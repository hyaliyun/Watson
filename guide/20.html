Esment Impremta DL: PM 321-2018 Printed in Spain / Impreso en España Palma 2018 It is our responsibility to respond to the current and future needs of society and we must know how to face this challenge, combining the promotion of social housing based on its social purpose and environmental awareness. When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate &amp; energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses. On the other hand, there is no European eco-label for building systems, unlike other sectors such as food or paints, as it remains under development. However, there are some recommendations that can be consulted in this link: http://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/buildings/index.html To consult the products that have the EU Eco-label: Europe:http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/ products-groups-and-criteria.html Spain:http://www.mapama.gob.es/en/calidad-yevaluacion-ambiental/temas/etiqueta-ecologica-de-launion-europea/etiqueta-ecologica-europea/grupos_ producto.aspx Balearic Islands: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?mkey=M234&amp;lang=ES&amp;cont=5511 The eco-labelling process in the Balearic Islands can be carried out at: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?idsite=234&amp;cont=5528 8. The 2020 climate &amp; energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ&lt;0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10. Plan by Marià Castelló, Na Blanca d’en Mestre, published in the Quaderns journal of the Official Association of Architects of Catalonia Col·legi Oficial d’Arquitectes de Catalunya. The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ &amp; T. TOSIANI 2013.

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27.

In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals. It is recommended that all treatments used contain vegetable raw materials and feature a stamp of organic production or, failing this, a certificate issued by the manufacturer, declaring that the product is not toxic. 42.

One of the main problems facing EU countries is energy dependence44. In the case of Spain, this figure comes to 75%, whilst the EU-27 average exceeds 53%. This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate &amp; energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4. Recycled or optimised products — Structure (walls): YTONG cellular concrete blocks, with environmental product declaration (EPD according to ISO 14025 - eco-label type III). — Waterproofing: EPDM. The use of asphalt sheets and PVC has been banned. — Installations: All electrical installations are halogen-free (PVC-free). Water, domestic hot water and grey water installations are made using polyethylene and polypropylene. C1. POSIDONIA &amp; PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS &amp; TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood.

HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of &lt;20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C ™: 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):&gt; 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) 63. (UNE-EN 15251:2008. Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde &amp; SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street. Measure spot Time zone E (V/m) S (W/m2 ) Màximum Average Màximum Average Bedroom Backyard Morning 0,148 0,015 5,77 10-5 5,97 10-7 Evening 0,183 0,042 8,92 10-5 4,61 10-6 Bedroom Street Morning 0,163 0,043 7,00 10-5 4,79 10-6 Evening 0,213 0,038 1,21 10-4 3,90 10-6 Kitchen Living Room Morning 0,173 0,053 7,89 10-5 7,31 10-6 Evening 0,203 0,033 1,10 10-4 2,95 10-6 Upper Terrace Morning 3,128 2,24 2,59 10-2 1,33 10-2 Evening 2,987 2,173 2,37 10-2 1,25 10-2 All values measured are below the current regulations in the Balearic Islands and even most restrictive limits, such as those established in Luxembourg. Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70.

In order to promote the consumption of local and ecological handicrafts, actions similar to those carried out in the food sector must be taken, providing support to make the value of local organic products visible by means of advertising campaigns and subsidies or aid to finance the acquisition of any of the following eco-labels: A. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an external entity. B. Freely accessible environmental assessment programs, Echometer or similar. C. European eco-label, currently under development. D. To develope a label of eco-friendly local product. 2. For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

When you build them, pollution is produced by manufacturing materials and the production of rubble. And when you use them, pollution is produced by the energy used to live in them. Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. All this information is taken from the official Life reusing posidonia book, now using and quoting the book (the information given above) write an essay in the context of a Typology Review The Typology Review is a study of a particular building type, based on analysis and critical examination of relevant examples. The question of type has generated broad discussion in architectural studies. The type of an architectural project/building may be defined with respect to various of its characteristics (urban, programmatic, spatial); most commonly, buildings are classified in types according to use (churches, hospitals, town halls, etc) or form (morphology) (Forty, 2000, p. 304). Thus, the term typology may refer both to the study of a specific building type and its representative features, and to the comprehensive study of a relevant/exemplary project. In this unit we focus primarily on housing i.e., residential typology; we will study housing designs with respect to their form and according to the following broad categories: block, tower, slab, urban villa, terrace, courtyard, etc. Collective housing and the question of density Following the industrial revolution and especially since the end of 18th century / beginning of 19th, accumulation of people in cities intensified and housing design focused mainly on different forms of collective housing. In collective housing, each household / housing unit (apartment, loft, duplex) makes part of a bigger community, the residential complex, where certain aspects of living (access, recreation, amenities, working spaces, etc.) are shared. Rising of urban populations has created a rupture between the urban (condensation) and the rural (dispersion) and created liminal zones with varying density (of both people and activities), and lesser defined characteristics comparing to urban centres. Housing on the edge of the city has become synonymous with suburban, ‘cookie-cutter’ designs and urban sprawl, the ‘spilling’ of lower density urbanisation (single-family housing) onto large zones of land, leading to the destruction of wild-life habitats and unsustainable developments. In this unit you are required to analyse the question of density with respect to a chosen historical precedent of collective housing (see list of housing projects on Canvas), as well as in relation to Canford Heath area, situated on the edge of Poole. You are asked to write a 2500-3000 typology review, critically presenting the design vision of your chosen precedent. Your essay need be illustrated with analytical material (sketches, drawings, visualisations) produced during the design studio workshops throughout the term, as well as with appropriate imagery, extracted from reliable academic sources. Your analysis should draw on available literature (see relevant Key Texts on Canvas) and tackle all scales of the project (urban; neighbourhood / building; unit). now first write the third bit of the essay using the template Urban vision (300-350 words) In this section you are primarily required to consider the project at an urban scale. Study the site plan as well as its overall morphological configuration and volumetric arrangement. ✓ Discuss accesses, services / amenities, communal spaces, key connection points with the broader neighbourhood. ✓ How are the complex’s boundaries defined in relation to its surroundings? Do they clearly differentiate it from its setting or are they ‘porous’ / less defined? What are the primary features of the project’s settings? ✓ How is density tackled in terms of the project’s volumetric configuration? How close are the various sections of the building between them and with surrounding constructions? What kind of views are thus enabled? Urban Vision The urban vision embedded in the design of the 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera by the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge (IBAVI) represents a sophisticated confluence of social purpose, environmental consciousness, and a deep respect for local traditions. By leveraging the LIFE Reusing Posidonia project, IBAVI has not only addressed the pressing need for affordable housing but has also set new benchmarks for environmental and urban sustainability. The development, seamlessly nestled within its context, upholds a low-rise urban typology, resonating with Formentera’s traditional architectural language and scale, thus ensuring a harmonious integration with the existing neighborhood fabric. The site’s accesses and communal spaces are carefully articulated to foster community interaction while maintaining privacy for the residents. The calculated placement of these 14 units along the public thoroughfare fosters a direct connection with the street life, reviving a sense of communal living often lost in contemporary housing developments. This strategic positioning also serves to enhance the permeability of the complex, with the public and semi-public zones creating a series of graduated transitions from the public domain to the private dwellings. When viewed from the broader urban perspective, the project skillfully employs density as a tool for cultivating social engagement and environmental efficiency, rather than merely maximizing occupancy. The spatial arrangement of the dwellings allows for optimal cross-ventilation and natural lighting, thus reducing the energy footprint. The communal courtyards and private terraces not only provide valuable outdoor space but also serve as buffer zones, promoting a sense of openness and fluidity between individual units and the environment. The approach to density in the Sant Ferran housing project is multi-layered, simultaneously factoring in volumetric proportions, communal amenability, and ecological impact. Rather than imposing a monolithic structure onto the landscape, IBAVI chose to interpret density through a dispersed configuration of intimate spaces that support both the environment and the community’s social fabric. This leads to an overall urban vision that is contextually responsive, environmentally sensitive, and socially inclusive – a vision that significantly contributes to the ongoing dialogue on sustainable housing typologies on the urban fringes. now write the next bit of the essay using this template, Programmatic vision (300-350 words) Look at how the buildings of the complex are articulated, study floor plans, sections, elevations. ✓ What types of uses are integrated in the plan? What kinds of amenities make part of the project’s brief / building program? ✓ Where are communal spaces placed in the complex and what purpose do they serve? Are there any shared spaces between neighbouring units? ✓ How is vertical and horizontal circulation organised (central circulation core / galleries / halls / corridors)? ✓ How is the question of density tackled in terms of apartment types (diversity of households / unit types / their arrangement in plan)? Is there an effort to regroup certain types of units together? How is this translated in elevation? Programmatic Vision The programmatic vision of the IBAVI’s Sant Ferran housing complex reveals a nuanced understanding of the interplay between private dwelling and communal living. The building complex has been designed to accommodate diverse households, integrating a blend of single-story layouts on the ground floor and duplex configurations on the upper level. Each unit, whether a one-bedroom apartment or a more spacious family unit, is thoughtfully tailored to meet the needs of different demographics while maintaining a common thread of sustainability and communal ethos. Communal spaces, a staple of IBAVI’s approach, are thoughtfully dispersed throughout the complex, serving as nodes of social interaction and communal activity. These shared spaces include courtyards, terrace gardens, and an intricately designed central courtyard that features a grey water phyto-purification system, not only serving as a sustainable water source but also as a gathering spot and a green oasis for residents. This central courtyard, combined with the terraces, potentiates the intersection of natural elements and social interplay within the complex’s layout. In terms of circulation, the design eschews traditional hallways in favor of direct street access for the ground floor units, thus reinforcing the connection with the urban fabric. This decision helps to reduce common circulation spaces, a usual contributor to the densification of housing complexes. On the upper level, a minimal yet efficient circulation strategy connects the duplexes, ensuring privacy and tranquility away from the bustle of the street level. The arrangement of apartments within the complex’s floor plan is a testament to IBAVI’s commitment to fostering community bonds while respecting individual autonomy. Care has been taken to provide a sense of unity among similar unit types, yet the variety in arrangement and orientation allows each residence to maintain its distinct character. This is reflected in the elevation, where the modulation of form, material, and void presents a facade that is rich in detail and deeply rooted in the island’s vernacular style. The Sant Ferran development successfully navigates the challenges of density through a programmatic strategy that prioritizes social cohesion, individual well-being, and environmental harmony. In doing so, it offers a provocative blueprint for future developments on the urban periphery, one that merges density with dignity in a residential setting.

When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate &amp; energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses. On the other hand, there is no European eco-label for building systems, unlike other sectors such as food or paints, as it remains under development. However, there are some recommendations that can be consulted in this link: http://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/buildings/index.html To consult the products that have the EU Eco-label: Europe:http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/ products-groups-and-criteria.html Spain:http://www.mapama.gob.es/en/calidad-yevaluacion-ambiental/temas/etiqueta-ecologica-de-launion-europea/etiqueta-ecologica-europea/grupos_ producto.aspx Balearic Islands: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?mkey=M234&amp;lang=ES&amp;cont=5511 The eco-labelling process in the Balearic Islands can be carried out at: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?idsite=234&amp;cont=5528 8. The 2020 climate &amp; energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ&lt;0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10. Plan by Marià Castelló, Na Blanca d’en Mestre, published in the Quaderns journal of the Official Association of Architects of Catalonia Col·legi Oficial d’Arquitectes de Catalunya. The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ &amp; T. TOSIANI 2013.

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27. Guide to best techniques available in Spain in the production of cement, 2004, Ministry of the Environment. 28. World Energy Outlook 2010, International Energy Agency. Check next image. In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals. It is recommended that all treatments used contain vegetable raw materials and feature a stamp of organic production or, failing this, a certificate issued by the manufacturer, declaring that the product is not toxic. 42. Referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 43. European Regulation 1005/2009 of 16 September 2009.What options do we have in this scenario? One of the main problems facing EU countries is energy dependence44. In the case of Spain, this figure comes to 75%, whilst the EU-27 average exceeds 53%. This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate &amp; energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4. Recycled or optimised products — Structure (walls): YTONG cellular concrete blocks, with environmental product declaration (EPD according to ISO 14025 - eco-label type III). — Waterproofing: EPDM. The use of asphalt sheets and PVC has been banned. — Installations: All electrical installations are halogen-free (PVC-free). Water, domestic hot water and grey water installations are made using polyethylene and polypropylene. C1. POSIDONIA &amp; PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS &amp; TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood.

HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of &lt;20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C ™: 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):&gt; 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde &amp; SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street.

Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70. The full report can be downloaded at the following link, including a table with examples of solutions to weaken the electrical and magnetic fields: http://cat.reusingposidonia.com/monitorizaciondel-prototipo/ CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS MATERIALS 1. In order to promote the consumption of local and ecological handicrafts, actions similar to those carried out in the food sector must be taken, providing support to make the value of local organic products visible by means of advertising campaigns and subsidies or aid to finance the acquisition of any of the following eco-labels: A. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an external entity. B. Freely accessible environmental assessment programs, Echometer or similar. C. European eco-label, currently under development. D. To develope a label of eco-friendly local product. 2. For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

When you build them, pollution is produced by manufacturing materials and the production of rubble. And when you use them, pollution is produced by the energy used to live in them. Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. All this information is taken from the official Life reusing posidonia book, now using and quoting the book (the information given above) write an essay in the context of a Typology Review The Typology Review is a study of a particular building type, based on analysis and critical examination of relevant examples. The question of type has generated broad discussion in architectural studies. The type of an architectural project/building may be defined with respect to various of its characteristics (urban, programmatic, spatial); most commonly, buildings are classified in types according to use (churches, hospitals, town halls, etc) or form (morphology) (Forty, 2000, p. 304). Thus, the term typology may refer both to the study of a specific building type and its representative features, and to the comprehensive study of a relevant/exemplary project. In this unit we focus primarily on housing i.e., residential typology; we will study housing designs with respect to their form and according to the following broad categories: block, tower, slab, urban villa, terrace, courtyard, etc. Collective housing and the question of density Following the industrial revolution and especially since the end of 18th century / beginning of 19th, accumulation of people in cities intensified and housing design focused mainly on different forms of collective housing. In collective housing, each household / housing unit (apartment, loft, duplex) makes part of a bigger community, the residential complex, where certain aspects of living (access, recreation, amenities, working spaces, etc.) are shared. Rising of urban populations has created a rupture between the urban (condensation) and the rural (dispersion) and created liminal zones with varying density (of both people and activities), and lesser defined characteristics comparing to urban centres. Housing on the edge of the city has become synonymous with suburban, ‘cookie-cutter’ designs and urban sprawl, the ‘spilling’ of lower density urbanisation (single-family housing) onto large zones of land, leading to the destruction of wild-life habitats and unsustainable developments. In this unit you are required to analyse the question of density with respect to a chosen historical precedent of collective housing (see list of housing projects on Canvas), as well as in relation to Canford Heath area, situated on the edge of Poole. You are asked to write a 2500-3000 typology review, critically presenting the design vision of your chosen precedent. Your essay need be illustrated with analytical material (sketches, drawings, visualisations) produced during the design studio workshops throughout the term, as well as with appropriate imagery, extracted from reliable academic sources. Your analysis should draw on available literature (see relevant Key Texts on Canvas) and tackle all scales of the project (urban; neighbourhood / building; unit). now first write the third bit of the essay using the template Urban vision (300-350 words) In this section you are primarily required to consider the project at an urban scale. Study the site plan as well as its overall morphological configuration and volumetric arrangement. ✓ Discuss accesses, services / amenities, communal spaces, key connection points with the broader neighbourhood. ✓ How are the complex’s boundaries defined in relation to its surroundings? Do they clearly differentiate it from its setting or are they ‘porous’ / less defined? What are the primary features of the project’s settings? ✓ How is density tackled in terms of the project’s volumetric configuration? How close are the various sections of the building between them and with surrounding constructions? What kind of views are thus enabled? Urban Vision The urban vision embedded in the design of the 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera by the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge (IBAVI) represents a sophisticated confluence of social purpose, environmental consciousness, and a deep respect for local traditions. By leveraging the LIFE Reusing Posidonia project, IBAVI has not only addressed the pressing need for affordable housing but has also set new benchmarks for environmental and urban sustainability. The development, seamlessly nestled within its context, upholds a low-rise urban typology, resonating with Formentera’s traditional architectural language and scale, thus ensuring a harmonious integration with the existing neighborhood fabric. The site’s accesses and communal spaces are carefully articulated to foster community interaction while maintaining privacy for the residents. The calculated placement of these 14 units along the public thoroughfare fosters a direct connection with the street life, reviving a sense of communal living often lost in contemporary housing developments. This strategic positioning also serves to enhance the permeability of the complex, with the public and semi-public zones creating a series of graduated transitions from the public domain to the private dwellings. When viewed from the broader urban perspective, the project skillfully employs density as a tool for cultivating social engagement and environmental efficiency, rather than merely maximizing occupancy. The spatial arrangement of the dwellings allows for optimal cross-ventilation and natural lighting, thus reducing the energy footprint. The communal courtyards and private terraces not only provide valuable outdoor space but also serve as buffer zones, promoting a sense of openness and fluidity between individual units and the environment. The approach to density in the Sant Ferran housing project is multi-layered, simultaneously factoring in volumetric proportions, communal amenability, and ecological impact. Rather than imposing a monolithic structure onto the landscape, IBAVI chose to interpret density through a dispersed configuration of intimate spaces that support both the environment and the community’s social fabric. This leads to an overall urban vision that is contextually responsive, environmentally sensitive, and socially inclusive – a vision that significantly contributes to the ongoing dialogue on sustainable housing typologies on the urban fringes. now write the next bit of the essay using this template, Programmatic vision (300-350 words) Look at how the buildings of the complex are articulated, study floor plans, sections, elevations. ✓ What types of uses are integrated in the plan? What kinds of amenities make part of the project’s brief / building program? ✓ Where are communal spaces placed in the complex and what purpose do they serve? Are there any shared spaces between neighbouring units? ✓ How is vertical and horizontal circulation organised (central circulation core / galleries / halls / corridors)? ✓ How is the question of density tackled in terms of apartment types (diversity of households / unit types / their arrangement in plan)? Is there an effort to regroup certain types of units together? How is this translated in elevation? Programmatic Vision The Sant Ferran housing project, a crystallization of the LIFE Reusing Posidonia initiative, exhibits an integrative programmatic vision that weaves together communal living with individual privacy. The integration of uses within the plan has crafted a multifaceted environment that supports various aspects of daily life. The architectural articulation harmonizes residential spaces with communal amenities, which include shared courtyards that act as extended living areas, fostering interaction and community activities. An interplay of open and enclosed spaces enables residents to enjoy the mild Mediterranean climate, while also providing options for seclusion. The arrangement of these communal realms within the complex is thoughtful and purposeful. Positioned centrally, these shared spaces serve as the heart of the complex, encouraging a sense of belonging and community. The positioning of playgrounds, seating areas and shared gardens captures the essence of collective living, extending the domestic sphere beyond the walls of individual units. The circulation is both a literal and figurative backbone of the complex, eschewing lengthy corridors for direct external access from the street for the ground-level units, and optimizing vertical circulation cores to serve the elevated duplexes. This elimination of superfluous passageways contributes to the project’s low-density feeling, despite its collective housing typology. Addressing the density in terms of apartment variety, the design delivers a tapestry of units that cater to a range of inhabitants, from single residents to families. Each is thoughtfully placed to maximize natural resources and communal connectivity. There is a deliberate cohesion within clusters of units, creating sub-communities that are interlinked, yet possess their individual character when viewed in elevation. The visual variance mitigates potential monotony, an often-cited critique of collective housing, infusing an architectural vibrancy while adhering to the environmental ethos of IBAVI’s undertaking. In totality, the Sant Ferran development’s programmatic principles represent an evolutionary step in addressing the challenges of density, community, and ecological integration. The design iterates a template conducive to social interaction within the bounds of sustainable living, presenting a paradigm influential to future design considerations at the periphery of urban contexts.

When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate &amp; energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses. On the other hand, there is no European eco-label for building systems, unlike other sectors such as food or paints, as it remains under development. However, there are some recommendations that can be consulted in this link: http://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/buildings/index.html To consult the products that have the EU Eco-label: Europe:http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/ products-groups-and-criteria.html Spain:http://www.mapama.gob.es/en/calidad-yevaluacion-ambiental/temas/etiqueta-ecologica-de-launion-europea/etiqueta-ecologica-europea/grupos_ producto.aspx Balearic Islands: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?mkey=M234&amp;lang=ES&amp;cont=5511 The eco-labelling process in the Balearic Islands can be carried out at: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?idsite=234&amp;cont=5528 8. The 2020 climate &amp; energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ&lt;0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10. Plan by Marià Castelló, Na Blanca d’en Mestre, published in the Quaderns journal of the Official Association of Architects of Catalonia Col·legi Oficial d’Arquitectes de Catalunya. The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ &amp; T. TOSIANI 2013.

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27.

In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals. It is recommended that all treatments used contain vegetable raw materials and feature a stamp of organic production or, failing this, a certificate issued by the manufacturer, declaring that the product is not toxic. 42. Referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 43. European Regulation 1005/2009 of 16 September 2009.What options do we have in this scenario? One of the main problems facing EU countries is energy dependence44. In the case of Spain, this figure comes to 75%, whilst the EU-27 average exceeds 53%. This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate &amp; energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4. Recycled or optimised products — Structure (walls): YTONG cellular concrete blocks, with environmental product declaration (EPD according to ISO 14025 - eco-label type III). — Waterproofing: EPDM. The use of asphalt sheets and PVC has been banned. — Installations: All electrical installations are halogen-free (PVC-free). Water, domestic hot water and grey water installations are made using polyethylene and polypropylene. C1. POSIDONIA &amp; PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS &amp; TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood.

HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of &lt;20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C ™: 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):&gt; 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde &amp; SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street.

Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70.

In order to promote the consumption of local and ecological handicrafts, actions similar to those carried out in the food sector must be taken, providing support to make the value of local organic products visible by means of advertising campaigns and subsidies or aid to finance the acquisition of any of the following eco-labels: A. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an external entity. B. Freely accessible environmental assessment programs, Echometer or similar. C. European eco-label, currently under development. D. To develope a label of eco-friendly local product. 2. For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

When you build them, pollution is produced by manufacturing materials and the production of rubble. And when you use them, pollution is produced by the energy used to live in them. Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. using this info write the next part of the essay encompassing Spatial vision (300-350 words) Study the design of the various unit types, especially in plan and section; consider a schematic diagram of uses (organigram) within the unit. ✓ How is density tackled within the unit? Are there any spaces/rooms without clearly assigned uses and/or destined to multiple uses? Is there any provision for working space / studios within the unit or close to it? ✓ How are different uses organised within the space of the unit? Do they correspond to different times of the day / different members of the household / formal and informal purposes? ✓ How is circulation organised within the unit/apartment? Are there alternative routes? ✓ What kinds of lifestyle do you think each different unit type promote? Spatial Vision Within the 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera, the spatial vision is approached with the dual aim of utilizing space efficiently while allowing flexibility for varied uses within each unit. The layout and design of the various unit types, scrutinized both in plan and section, reflect an ethos where the relationship between inhabitants and their environment is intimate and interactive. The variety among the units, from single-level apartments to duplex accommodations, answers to the diverse needs and lifestyles of future residents while keeping the density within check. The design introspects density within the unit meticulously. Each space is crafted to serve multiple functions—a living room that seamlessly transforms into a workspace, bedrooms that cater to rest and study. Provisions have been made to accommodate studios or working spaces within or adjacent to the units, ensuring that the need for external commuting can be reduced, and sustainability and lifestyle balance are encouraged. The units have been organized to align with different daily activities and user groups. Areas designated for formal and informal purposes coexist harmoniously—a kitchen integrated into the living area promotes social interaction, while private quarters are reserved for tranquility and personal space. This functional overlay within the unit space not only combats the notion of traditional compartmentalization but also enables the inhabitants to customize their living experience. Circulation within the units has been devised to offer alternative pathways, affording a sense of freedom and fluidity. This thoughtful arrangement stimulates a dwelling environment where the journey through a home is neither linear nor prescriptive but an explorative narrative. The distinct unit types each propose a lifestyle vision—flexible and modern for the individual urban dweller, secure and communal for families, sociable yet private for the elderly. The residents are encouraged to inhabit spaces that resonate with their personal routines and cultural nuances, offering a canvas upon which life is not just lived but also felt and experienced. Hence, the spatial vision in the Sant Ferran housing project is not only about the tangibility of walls and floors but also about the intangibles of community, flexibility, and lifestyle. now using everything you&#39;ve written so far as well as all the information I&#39;ve given and youre own research, write the next section being 5. Discussion (600-650 words) Think about all the observations you have already made about your precedent and especially any comments related to the question of density. ✓ How did the final design fare in relation to the project’s brief (as explained in the ‘Context’ section)? ✓ How was the project received by the users? What do sources of authority report about the project? Based on your analysis, do you agree with these opinions? Expand your discourse around: ✓ Issues related to building on the edge, especially issues typical of current housing needs in the UK. ✓ Your understanding of the question of density, especially in the UK. Think about the Canford Heath area and summarise here the principal characteristics of this ‘edge’. ✓ In what ways does Canford Heath resemble and / or is it different to your precedent’s context? How is the current social context and conditions of the construction market different to those of the historical precedent? ✓ What has the analysis of the precedent revealed in relation to its efficiency? According to your opinion, which design principles of the precedent are applicable (or not) to the Canford Heath area and why?</div><div class="divider" data-v-64c60f62></div><p class="review-content" data-v-64c60f62><span class="icon" data-v-64c60f62>answer:</span>Discussion The Sant Ferran housing project, as an embodiment of the LIFE Reusing Posidonia initiative, stands as a profound response to the contemporary conundrum of creating environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive housing. The project was conceived with an ambitious brief to not only accommodate immediate housing needs but also to proactively engage with broader ecological and societal concerns. It aimed to enact a typological shift towards low-impact construction that respects and draws upon local cultural practices, thereby fostering a sense of community that aligns with the distinctive character of Formentera. In practice, the project’s realization reflects a commendable reconciliation of these aspirations. Noted for its judicious use of local materials, such as the Posidonia oceanica, and its achievement in substantially reducing CO2 emissions and waste during construction, the Sant Ferran development represents a paradigm shift towards greener building practices. The final design outcome closely aligns with the project’s brief, employing traditional knowledge and innovative technology to meet contemporary sustainability standards. The reception of the project by its users and the broader community appears to be positive, emphasizing user satisfaction with the design&#39;s environmental responsiveness and community-centric values. This user experience corroborates the findings of authoritative sources, which praise the project’s unique integration of cultural heritage with eco-friendly living. My analysis concurs with these appraisals, as the project not only meets its intended goals but serves as a pioneering model for future developments. When deliberating on the broader implications of building on the urban edge, the Sant Ferran project offers invaluable insights. Current housing needs in the UK are marked by the challenges of urban sprawl, the erosion of local identity, and environmental sustainability. The Sant Ferran project’s approach to density—visualized not as a quantitative measure but as a qualitative experience—could serve as a guiding template for similar ‘edge’ developments in the UK. The project emphasizes that higher density does not necessarily equate to diminished quality of life if designed thoughtfully. Regarding the Canford Heath area, it is characterized by suburban sprawl, marked by low-density housing and a lack of diversity in the housing typology. The location presents an &#39;edge condition&#39;, reflecting tensions between urban development and the preservation of natural landscapes. The Sant Ferran project&#39;s sensitivity to its environment and its promotion of a strong community ethos through design presents compelling parallels and divergences for Canford Heath. The differing social conditions and market dynamics between Formentera and the Canford Heath area in the UK necessitate adaptations of the Sant Ferran model. However, the underlying principles of the project—respect for local context and resources, prioritization of communal spaces, and sustainable building practices—are universally applicable and have shown to resonate with users across different cultural and economic spectrums. In conclusion, the Sant Ferran housing project&#39;s design principles possess significant relevance to the Canford Heath area. By focusing on community integration, environmental stewardship, and innovative use of local resources, the project offers fruitful directions for addressing housing on the urban edge. Although direct replication is impractical due to the differing contexts, the essence of the Sant Ferran model—particularly its approach to density and sustainability—can inspire sensitive and adaptive housing solutions for Canford Heath and beyond.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-46a5a677 data-v-64c60f62><div class="review" data-v-64c60f62><div class="review-title" data-v-64c60f62><span class="icon" data-v-64c60f62>question:</span>Imagine that you are an ironic Russian journalist who understands the gas industry.

Increase in Spanish Gas Imports from Russia - &quot;Spain to Break Gas Import Records: An Unexpected Development&quot; - El Mundo reports that Spain is expected to witness a historical surge in its liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from Russia by the end of 2023. - Spain saw a staggering 43% increase in gas imports from Russia in 2023, according to Enagas, an energy company. II. Growing Dependency on Russian Gas - &quot;Spain&#39;s Surprising Reliance on Russia: A Sixfold Increase in Just Five Years&quot; - In 2018, Russia&#39;s gas supply only accounted for a mere 2.4% of the total gas volume in Spain. - However, from January to October 2023, Russia emerged as the third-largest LNG supplier to Spain, marking a sixfold increase in dependence on Russian gas exports in a span of five years. III. Record-Breaking Gas Purchase - &quot;Spain&#39;s Hunger for Gas Soars: A 43% Rise in Imports from Russia&quot; - Spain&#39;s gas purchases from Russia have reached an all-time high. - Data reveals that in 2023, Spain acquired the equivalent of 60,770 GWh of LNG from Russia, representing a 43% increase compared to the same period in 2022. - This surge in demand can be attributed to the closure of the Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline in 2021, which strained the country&#39;s gas supply. IV. The Economic Argument - &quot;To Cut or Not to Cut: The Russian-Spanish Gas Contract Dilemma&quot; - The Russian Embassy in Madrid stated that it would be economically disadvantageous for Spain to terminate the long-term contract between PJSC Novatek and Spanish company Naturgy, which has been in effect since 2018. - This contract allows Spain to procure gas at a price below market rates, making it economically viable for the country to continue with the Russian gas imports. Conclusion: Spain&#39;s gas industry has witnessed a significant shift, with Russia emerging as a dominant player in its supply chain. From a mere 2.4% share in 2018, Russia&#39;s gas imports to Spain have skyrocketed, now accounting for a substantial portion of the country&#39;s LNG consumption. The closure of the Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline and the economically advantageous Russian-Spanish gas contract have further propelled Spain&#39;s dependency on Russian gas. This unexpected development showcases the evolving dynamics in the gas industry and highlights the need for Spain to diversify its energy sources to ensure energy security in the long run.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-46a5a677 data-v-64c60f62><div class="review" data-v-64c60f62><div class="review-title" data-v-64c60f62><span class="icon" data-v-64c60f62>question:</span>Imagine that you are an ironic Russian journalist who understands the gas industry.

Earlier, the Russian Embassy in Madrid told TASS that it is economically unprofitable for Spain to abandon the large long-term contract between PJSC Novatek and the Spanish company Naturgy, which has been in force since 2018, according to which the price of gas is below market quotations].</div><div class="divider" data-v-64c60f62></div><p class="review-content" data-v-64c60f62><span class="icon" data-v-64c60f62>answer:</span>Intriguing Name: &quot;Spain&#39;s Curious Gas Dance: From Dependency to Dominance&quot; I. A Transformative Gas Trade - &quot;Gas of Thrones: Russia&#39;s Rise in Spain&#39;s Energy Realm&quot; - El Mundo reveals that Spain is set to shatter gas import records as the volume of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplied to the country reaches unprecedented levels by the year-end. - Surprising statistics show that Spain purchased a staggering 43% more gas from Russia in 2023, according to Enagas, fueling speculation about their deepening relationship. - In 2018, Russia held a mere 2.4% share of gas supplies to Spain, a fact that adds spice to this unexpected twist. II. A Sixfold Increase of Russian Dependency - &quot;From Dachas to Dominance: Spain&#39;s Russian Gas Love Affair&quot; - Enagas reveals that in just five years, Spain&#39;s reliance on Russia as a gas exporter has grown sixfold, positioning the Russian Federation as the third largest LNG supplier to Spain from January to October 2023. - This significant shift has ignited debates and given rise to eyebrow-raising questions about Spain&#39;s evolving energy landscape and geopolitical allegiances. III. Breaking Records: Gas Shopping Spree - &quot;Spain&#39;s Gas Saga: Record-Breaking Purchases from Russia&quot; - Available data showcases Spain&#39;s gas spree, where the kingdom purchased a whopping equivalent of 60,770 GWh of LNG from Russia in 2023, a remarkable 43% surge compared to the same period in 2022. - With six regasification plants in Spain, the country&#39;s thirst for gas seems unquenchable. - The closure of the Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline in 2021, due to diplomatic tensions between Algeria and Morocco, has further pushed Spain towards the Russian gas market. IV. The Price of Economic Viability - &quot;Gasopoly: The Russian-Spanish Contract Conundrum&quot; - The Russian Embassy in Madrid, in an interview with TASS, emphasizes the economic impracticality of Spain abandoning the long-term contract between PJSC Novatek and Spanish company Naturgy that has been in effect since 2018. - This contract offers Spain gas at prices below market quotations, creating a favorable economic scenario that Spain finds hard to resist. Conclusion: Spain&#39;s gas landscape has witnessed a dramatic shift, with Russia assuming a prominent position as a key supplier. The astounding growth in Spanish gas imports from Russia highlights a significant transition from low dependency to profound reliance. Spain&#39;s gas shopping spree and increased dependency raise intriguing questions about the country&#39;s energy security and the influence of geopolitical dynamics. While Spain&#39;s gas dance with Russia may seem ironic, it underscores the complex interplay between economic viability, diplomatic relations, and the pursuit of energy diversification. The path forward for Spain lies in striking a balance between short-term economic advantages and long-term energy resilience.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-46a5a677 data-v-64c60f62><div class="review" data-v-64c60f62><div class="review-title" data-v-64c60f62><span class="icon" data-v-64c60f62>question:</span>Почему автомобили, работающие на водородном топливе, наносят меньше вреда окружающей среде, чем бензиновые или дизельные автомобили?</div><div class="divider" data-v-64c60f62></div><p class="review-content" data-v-64c60f62><span class="icon" data-v-64c60f62>answer:</span>Автомобили, работающие на водородном топливе, наносят меньше вреда окружающей среде по нескольким причинам: 1. Отсутствие выбросов парниковых газов: При сгорании водорода в топливной ячейке выделяется только вода и тепло. В отличие от бензиновых или дизельных автомобилей, водородные автомобили не выбрасывают в атмосферу углекислый газ (CO2), который является главным парниковым газом и влияет на изменение климата. 2. Чистота выпускаемых отходов: Автомобили на водороде не выбрасывают вредных веществ, таких как азотные оксиды (NOx), которые являются причиной смога и озоновых дыр. 3. Повышенная эффективность: Водородные автомобили имеют более высокий КПД (коэффициент полезного действия) по сравнению с традиционными автомобилями, оснащенными двигателями внутреннего сгорания. Это означает, что они используют энергию более эффективно и меньшее количество топлива для преодоления той же дистанции. 4. Увеличение использования возобновляемых источников энергии: Использование водорода в автомобилях стимулирует развитие инфраструктуры для производства водорода из возобновляемых источников энергии, таких как солнечная или ветряная энергия. Это позволяет снизить зависимость от нефти и других ископаемых ресурсов и перейти на более экологически чистые источники энергии. За счет этих факторов автомобили, работающие на водородном топливе, могут значительно снизить негативное влияние на окружающую среду, сохранив при этом удобство использования автомобиля. Однако следует отметить, что внедрение водородных автомобилей сталкивается с некоторыми вызовами, такими как высокая стоимость производства и недостаток инфраструктуры для заправки водородом.</p></div></div><!--]--><!----></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-46a5a677><span data-v-46a5a677>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->Watson License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 Watson</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
