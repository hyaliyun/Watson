The axis of symmetry for the parabola is vertical and passes through the vertex.

He is committed to making exactly five bets and never betting more than 17. What is the maximum amount of money he can guarantee to take away from the casino after such a game?","completion":": 1. **Understanding the key observation:** - The main observation in this problem is that if the player wins even once, they are allowed to lose the subsequent bets without going beyond the constraint of not betting more than 17. This is because after a win, the player can bet minimal amounts (e.g., 1 per bet) for the remaining bets. 2. **Initial bets if things go wrong:** - To show that it’s not feasible to leave the game losing 1 (or less), let's analyze the required bets: 1. **First game**: - Winning this game ensures a cushion for subsequent losses. Suppose the player must bet at least 3. 2. **Second game (if the first game is lost)**: - The player would need a bet of at least 5 to recoup potential losses. The player must consider that they could win here but might have to make up for losses from the previous turn(s). 3. **Further games**: - The player repeats this logic. If the player loses again, they need higher bets to cover previous losses: - In the third game, the bet must be at least 9. - In the fourth game, the bet is at least 17. 3. **Total analysis**: - If the player keeps losing, here are illustrative results: - Losing the first game ➔ -3. - Losing the second game ➔ -5 + -3 = -8. - Losing the third game ➔ -9 + -8 = -17. - Losing the fourth game ➔ -17 + -17 = -34. 3. **Verification of a feasible pattern:** - When losing continuously, maximal losses without going over 17 per bet constraint imply the player cannot cover themselves within 5 bets in such a minimal loss pattern (losing not more than 34). Therefore, the feasible strategy involves optimizing sequential smaller losses to ensure closing losses within constraints. 4. **Optimized Bet Strategy for Minimal Losses:** - The player would increase bets minimally but shift to 1 per subsequent game, ensuring minimal risk after an early win. Here’s how: 1. If the player bets 2 initially and wins: - Subsequent four bets: 1 each. - Winning 2 changes balance positively, ensuring four 1 losses won’t dramatically impact overall balance. 2. Losing the first game shifts to a higher immediate follow-up bet. Assuming continued losses at minimal increases still avoids breaching constraints: - Bets move effectively over 2 ➔ 3 ➔ 5 ➔ 9 ➔ 17. 5. **Conclusion for ensured outcome post 5 games:** - Analyzing consecutive potential patterns: - Starting with 100, and recognizing lost scenarios increase stakes potentially incrementally (2, 3, 5, 9, 17). 6. **Final Summary:** - By the final game sequence, optimized losses conserve most stakes ensuring maximum retention achievable as 98.

Therefore, the equation representing the situation from the first to the third day is: [3000 times (1 + x)^2 = 4320] Solving for x involves first dividing both sides by 3000: [frac{3000 times (1 + x)^2}{3000} = frac{4320}{3000}] [ (1 + x)^2 = 1.44] Taking the square root of both sides gives: [1 + x = pm sqrt{1.44}] [1 + x = pm 1.2] Solving for x gives two possible solutions: [x_1 = 1.2 - 1 = 0.2] [x_2 = -1.2 - 1 = -2.2] Since a negative growth rate would imply the donations decreased, which is not feasible in this context, we discard x_2 = -2.2. Therefore, the donation growth rate is: [boxed{20%}] Part 2: Calculating the Donation on the Fourth Day Using the growth rate of 20% or 0.2 found in part 1, we calculate the donation amount on the fourth day based on the third day's donation of 4320. The formula to calculate the next day's donation is: [4320 times (1 + 0.2) = 4320 times 1.2 = 5184] Therefore, the donation amount the unit can expect to receive on the fourth day is: [boxed{5184 text{ dollars}}]"},{"prompt":"What percent of the prime numbers less than 15 are divisible by 2?","completion":"First, identify the prime numbers less than 15.

We need to show that there exists at most one factorization ( m = ab ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are positive integers satisfying [ 0 < a - b < sqrt{5 + 4sqrt{4m + 1}} ] 2. Start by analyzing the given inequality: [ 0 < a - b < sqrt{5 + 4sqrt{4m + 1}} ] Squaring both sides, we get: [ 0 < (a - b)^2 < 5 + 4sqrt{4m + 1} ] 3. Since ( m = ab ), we can express ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of ( m ): [ a + b = k quad text{and} quad ab = m ] where ( k ) is some integer. Then: [ (a - b)^2 = (a + b)^2 - 4ab = k^2 - 4m ] Substituting this into the inequality, we get: [ 0 < k^2 - 4m < 5 + 4sqrt{4m + 1} ] 4. Rearranging the inequality, we have: [ 4m < k^2 < 5 + 4m + 4sqrt{4m + 1} ] This implies: [ sqrt{4m} < k < sqrt{4m + 1} + 2 ] 5. Since ( 4m ) is not a perfect square (as ( m equiv 2 pmod{4} )), we can write: [ lfloor sqrt{4m} rfloor + 1 leq k leq lfloor sqrt{4m + 1} rfloor + 2 ] 6. Let ( lfloor sqrt{4m} rfloor = a ). Then: [ a < sqrt{4m} < a + 1 ] Squaring this, we get: [ a^2 < 4m < (a + 1)^2 ] which implies: [ a^2 < 4m < a^2 + 2a + 1 ] 7. Therefore: [ a^2 + 1 leq 4m leq a^2 + 2a ] and: [ a^2 + 2 leq 4m + 1 leq a^2 + 2a + 1 ] Thus: [ lfloor sqrt{4m + 1} rfloor = a text{ or } a + 1 ] 8.

We need to determine the probability that it is still possible to travel from the first floor to the last floor using only open doors. 2. **Translate the event conditionally:** - The event ( A ) (the path is possible) is realized if there are no two simultaneously closed doors on the same level. - With event ( A ), at least one of the two doors on each level must be open. 3. **Calculate the favorable outcomes:** - With ( n ) floors, we consider the doors between the floors (from 1 to ( n-1 )), resulting in ( 2(n-1) ) doors in total. - Half of these doors are locked, giving us ( (n-1) ) locked doors, and we need the remaining ( (n-1) ) doors to be open. 4. **Combinations of door locking configurations:** - The number of ways to guarantee that for each floor at least one of its two doors remains open corresponds to choosing which set of ( n-1 ) doors are open out of ( 2(n-1) ). Each level must have at least one open door. - The number of favorable outcomes, ensuring at least one door open per level, equals ( 2^{n-1} ).

For every pair ( a < b ) of these integers, we need to determine the largest power of 2 that divides ( b - a ). We aim to find the maximum number of distinct powers of 2 that can be written. 2. **Graph Representation:** Let ( a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_n ) be the ( n ) numbers. Consider a graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices, where each vertex represents one of the ( n ) numbers. Draw an edge between every pair of vertices. The weight of an edge is defined as the largest power of 2 that divides the difference of its vertices. 3. **Subgraph with Distinct Weights:** Consider a subgraph ( G' ) of ( G ) that has the same vertices as ( G ) and the maximum number of edges with distinct weights. If there are multiple such subgraphs, choose one arbitrarily. We need to prove that ( G' ) has at most ( n-1 ) edges. 4. **Claim 1: ( G' ) has no cycles.** - **Proof:** Suppose ( G' ) contains a cycle. Without loss of generality, let the cycle be ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, a_1 ) with ( k geq 3 ). Assume the edge between ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) has the minimal weight among the edges in the cycle. Then, ( a_k - a_1 = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + ldots + (a_k - a_{k-1}) ). Since all weights are distinct, the largest power of 2 dividing ( a_k - a_1 ) must be the same as that dividing ( a_2 - a_1 ), which is a contradiction. Hence, ( G' ) cannot contain any cycles. (blacksquare) 5. **Claim 2: Any acyclic simple undirected graph on ( n ) vertices has at most ( n-1 ) edges.** - **Proof:** We proceed by induction on ( n ). - Base case: For ( n = 2 ), the graph can have at most 1 edge, which is ( n-1 ). - Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for graphs with ( n ) vertices. Consider a graph with ( n+1 ) vertices. We need to show there exists a vertex with degree at most 1. Take a maximal path ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_t ) in the graph. Vertex ( v_1 ) has no neighbors among ( v_i ) (for ( i > 2 )), otherwise, a cycle would form. Since the path is maximal, ( v_1 ) can have no neighbor other than ( v_2 ), so ( deg(v_1) = 1 ). Removing ( v_1 ) leaves a subgraph with ( n ) vertices, which by the inductive hypothesis has at most ( n-1 ) edges. Adding back ( v_1 ) and its single edge gives at most ( n ) edges in total. Thus, the graph with ( n+1 ) vertices has at most ( n ) edges. (blacksquare) 6. **Application to the Problem:** Claims 1 and 2 imply that ( G' ) has at most ( n-1 ) edges. To show that ( n-1 ) distinct powers of 2 are attainable, consider the sequence ( a_1 = 1 ) and ( a_i = 2^i + 1 ) for ( i neq 1 ).

According to the problem, B is also equal to 20. So, we have: 12 men = W women W women = 20 boys Since the total earnings of the group is Rs. 300, we can set up an equation to represent the total earnings based on the number of each group (men, women, and boys). Let's denote the earnings of one man as M, one woman as W, and one boy as B. The total earnings can be represented as: 12M + WW + 20B = 300 However, we need to express the earnings in terms of one variable to solve for the men's wages. Since 12 men are equivalent to W women, and W women are equivalent to 20 boys, we can say that the earnings of 12 men are equal to the earnings of W women, which are also equal to the earnings of 20 boys. Therefore, we can say that: 12M = WW = 20B Since we are looking for the men's wages, we need to find the value of M. We can use the fact that the earnings of 12 men are equal to the earnings of 20 boys to set up the following equation: 12M = 20B Now, we can express the total earnings in terms of M (men's wages) and B (boys' wages): 12M + (12M/B)B + 20B = 300 Since 12M is equal to 20B, we can simplify the equation to: 12M + 12M + 20B = 300 Combining like terms, we get: 24M + 20B = 300 Now, we know that 12M = 20B, so we can substitute 20B with 12M in the equation: 24M + 12M = 300 Combining like terms again, we get: 36M = 300 Now, we can solve for M (men's wages) by dividing both sides of the equation by 36: M = 300 / 36 M = 8.33 (approximately) Therefore, the wages of one man are approximately Rs. 8.33.

Let's denote the cells of the ( n times n ) board using a matrix. We'll prove the solution by both construction and contradiction. Step 1: Constructing a ( 2n-1 ) coloring example which avoids the condition. 1. Let's color the ( n times n ) board in ( 2n-1 ) colors in such a way that no four cells at the intersection of two rows and two columns have all four different colors. 2. Number the rows from 0 to ( n-1 ) and columns from 0 to ( n-1 ). 3. Each row of the board will be painted with a specific color. - Paint the (i)-th row (i mod (2n-1)). 4. Consequently, no four cells at the intersection of two rows and two columns have all four different colors. If we had four different colors at such an intersection, it would imply repetitions which our construction ensures to avoid. Step 2: Proving that ( 2n-1 ) colors are insufficient. 1.

Consider vertices for rows and columns. 3. Construct edges based on simultaneous paint colors of intersections. 4.

However, the precise range can be written as: [ 0^circ < beta leq 90^circ - alpha < 90^circ ] 4. **Apply Trigonometric Inequality:** For acute angles, [ cos(beta) geq cos(90^circ - alpha) = sin(alpha) ] 5. **Analyze the Given Condition ( sin(alpha) > cos(beta) ):** It follows from step 4 that: [ cos(beta) geq sin(alpha) ] However, this is a direct contradiction to the given condition ( sin(alpha) > cos(beta) ). 6. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** Since our assumption ( gamma geq 90^circ ) has led to a contradiction, the initial assumption must be incorrect.

This inequality must hold under two different conditions: - **Condition 1:** When a = 0, the expression simplifies to 1 > 0, which is always true. This means that for a = 0, proposition A holds. - **Condition 2:** When a neq 0, we need to ensure that the quadratic expression is always positive. This requires two sub-conditions: - The coefficient of x^2, which is a, must be positive. This implies a > 0. - The discriminant of the quadratic equation, Delta = (2a)^2 - 4a cdot 1 = 4a^2 - 4a, must be less than 0 for the equation not to have real roots, which would mean the expression is always positive or always negative. Since we know it's positive for a = 0, it must remain positive for other values of a. Solving Delta < 0 gives a < 1. Combining these conditions, we find that for proposition A to hold, we must have 0 leqslant a < 1. **Step 2: Analyzing Proposition B** Proposition B directly states that 0 < a < 1. **Step 3: Comparing Propositions A and B** - Proposition A holds for 0 leqslant a < 1, which includes a = 0. - Proposition B holds for 0 < a < 1, excluding a = 0. This means that while every a that satisfies proposition B will also satisfy proposition A (since both require a < 1 and a > 0), the converse is not true because a = 0 satisfies proposition A but not proposition B. **Conclusion** Proposition A (having a solution set of real numbers for the given quadratic inequality) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for proposition B (0 < a < 1) to hold.

Let's define the sets (S_i) recursively: - (S_1) is the maximal set with (2^{2n} + 1) as the minimum element and includes consecutive odd elements up to the point where the difference of the elements is small enough to ensure no number divides the square of another. - Define (S_{i+1}) as the maximal set with the above property, where the minimum element is 2 greater than the maximum element of (S_i). 3. **Size of sets:** The size of each set (S_i) increases as we move to higher sets. Specifically, it can be shown that (|S_{i+5}| ge |S_i| + 1). This ensures that the sets grow sufficiently large to cover the interval. 4. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:** Since we have (2^{2n-1} + 1) numbers and we can construct sets such that each set has at most (2^{n-1}) elements, we need to ensure that the number of sets is less than or equal to (2^{2n-1}). By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one set will contain at least two of the selected numbers. 5. **Divisibility condition:** Within each set (S_i), the difference between the elements is designed to be greater than the square root of the least element. This ensures that no number in the set divides the square of another number in the same set. 6. **Conclusion:** For (n ge 4), the construction and the Pigeonhole Principle guarantee that there are two numbers among the selected (2^{2n-1} + 1) odd numbers such that neither divides the square of the other.

Therefore, we consider two cases for even n: whether n is a multiple of 4 or not. 2. **Case 1: n = 4k for some positive integer k** - In this scenario, k is a positive integer. - The area of the grid is n^2 = (4k)^2 = 16k^2. This is clearly a multiple of 4. - This grid can be tiled using 4k^2 tiles, with each row containing k tiles (since each tile spans 4 grid cells in one dimension). - For instance, if k=3, we have n = 12. Each row of the 12 times 12 grid will contain 3 such tiles perfectly.

In a 2 times 2 chessboard pattern, alternating cells are differently colored. - Instance: check k = 3 rightarrow n = 10 grid: - We see that a 4 times 1 tile will always cover exactly two cells of each color. - However, since the grid has n^2 = 100 cells, which means the total cells of one color will outnumber the cells of another color by four (since n is even but not a multiple of 4). - Specifically, let's count: - Total number of 2 times 2 blocks in a 10 times 10 grid = frac{100}{4} = 25 blocks. - Given the odd number of 2 times 2 blocks and their alternating color pattern, the total representation of one color will be lceil 25 rceil = 50 and the opposite color will be 50-4 = 46, thus not balanced for the tile to cover pairs. - Thus, it is impossible to tile the grid in this configuration. 4. **Conclusion** - Therefore, the likely scenarios where the grid can be perfectly tiled with 4 times 1 tiles are when n = 4k.

We know that there are 7 technicians with an average salary of Rs. 12000 each, so the total salary for all technicians is: 7 technicians * Rs. 12000/technician = Rs. 84000 The rest of the workers, which is 21 - 7 = 14 workers, have an average salary of Rs. 6000 each, so the total salary for the rest of the workers is: 14 workers * Rs. 6000/worker = Rs. 84000 Now, we can find the total salary for all 21 workers by adding the total salaries of the technicians and the rest of the workers: Total salary for all workers = Rs. 84000 (technicians) + Rs. 84000 (rest) = Rs. 168000 To find the average salary of all the workers, we divide the total salary by the number of workers: A = Total salary for all workers / Total number of workers A = Rs. 168000 / 21 workers A = Rs. 8000 Therefore, the average salary of all the workers in the workshop is Rs. boxed{8000} ."},{"prompt":"f the complex number z satisfies 2zoverline{z}=frac{2i3}{i} (i is the imaginary unit), then |z|= ( ).

Here are the steps to achieve such a proof: 1. **Existence of Maximum Product**: The number of ways to partition ( k ) into ( n ) integers is limited, so the maximum value of the product of these integers indeed exists. 2. **Maximizing the Product**: To maximize the product, the difference between any two integers in the partition should be less than 2. Suppose we have two integers ( a ) and ( a+s ), where ( s geq 2 ). Then replacing ( (a, a+s) ) with ( (a+1, a+s-1) ) would increase the product, as: [ a(a+s) < (a+1)(a+s-1) ] This is because: [ a(a+s) = a^2 + as quad text{and} quad (a+1)(a+s-1) = a^2 + as + a - 1. ] Clearly, ( a - 1 ) is positive, hence the product increases. 3. **Determine the Values of the Partitions**: Let ( k = a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n ) where ( a_1 leq a_2 leq cdots leq a_n ), ensuring that ( 0 leq a_n - a_1 leq 1 ). 4. **Calculation Boundaries**: Since ( i leq n ), we have: [ na_1 leq k < n(a_1 + 1) ] Thus, let ( a_1 = leftlfloor frac{k}{n} rightrfloor = q ). 5. **Remainder Distribution**: Given ( k = nq + r ), we can distribute the remainder ( r ) as follows: - We set ( n-r ) terms to ( q ) - We set ( r ) terms to ( q+1 ) 6. **Forming the Maximum Product**: Therefore, the numbers in the partition are ( q ) repeated ( n-r ) times and ( q+1 ) repeated ( r ) times, which gives the following maximum product: [ F(k) = q^{n-r} cdot (q+1)^{r} ] 7. **Conclusion**: Thus, the function ( F(k) = q^{n-r} cdot (q+1)^{r} ) maximizes the product for such integer partitions.

Next, we introduce a constant A_k defined by [ A_k = prod_{substack{varepsilon_{i} in {-1,1} i = 1, 2, ldots, k}} left| t_n + sum_{i=1}^{k} varepsilon_i n sqrt{a_i} right|, ] where each varepsilon_i takes value 1 or -1. 4. Define a function [ f(x) = prod_{substack{varepsilon_{i} in {-1,1} i = 1, 2, ldots, k}} left( x + sum_{i=1}^{k} varepsilon_i n sqrt{a_i} right). ] The function f(x) is a polynomial of degree 2^k-1. 5. Considering the structure of f(x), we realize that f(x) remains invariant if sqrt{a_i} is replaced by -sqrt{a_i} for any i. This implies that the coefficients of f(x) must be symmetric and hence integers. 6. Consequently, for f(t_n) = A_k in mathbb{Z}, we need to ensure that A_k neq 0. This boils down to proving that [ sum_{i=1}^{k} varepsilon_i sqrt{a_i} neq frac{t_n}{n} ] for all choices of varepsilon_i in {-1,1}. Therefore, let us assume the contrary that [ sum_{i=1}^{k} varepsilon_i sqrt{a_i} = m, ] where m = frac{t_n}{n} in mathbb{Q} setminus {0}. 7. Construct a polynomial [ g(x) = prod_{substack{varepsilon_{i} = pm 1i = 1, 2, ldots, k-1}} left(x - sum_{i=1}^{k-1} varepsilon_i sqrt{a_i} right). ] The polynomial g(x) has integer coefficients. 8. Since [ g(m + varepsilon_k sqrt{a_k}) = 0, ] there must also be a root m - varepsilon_k sqrt{a_k}. Thus, we can write [ m + varepsilon_k sqrt{a_k} + sum_{i=1}^{k-1} eta_i sqrt{a_i} = 0. ] 9. Grouping together and eliminating terms, this leads to [ 2m + varepsilon_1^{prime} sqrt{a_1} + varepsilon_2^{prime} sqrt{a_2} + cdots + varepsilon_{k-1}^{prime} sqrt{a_{k-1}} = 0. ] However, this contradicts the original assumption since the new assumption also fails for smaller k implying contradiction in recursive hypothesis. 10. Hence, A_k neq 0 and due to integer properties, we have A_k geq 1. 11. Furthermore, since [ t_n < sum_{i=1}^k sqrt{a_i}, ] we obtain [ left| t_n + sum_{i=1}^k varepsilon_i n sqrt{a_i} right| leq sum_{i=1}^k n sqrt{a_i} < 2n sum_{i=1}^k sqrt{a_i}. ] 12.

Since there were 4 members, the total age of the family at that time was 4 * 24 = 96 years. In the 10 years since then, each of the original 4 members has aged by 10 years, so the total increase in age for those 4 members is 4 * 10 = 40 years. Adding this to the original total age, we get 96 + 40 = 136 years as the total age of the original 4 members now. Now, there are two more children, and the average age of the family is still 24 years. With 6 family members now, the total age of the family is 6 * 24 = 144 years. The total age of the two children is 144 - 136 = 8 years. Let's denote the age of the older child as Y + 2 (since the problem states that there is a 2-year age difference between the children).

Thus, for each k, there are n-k+1 possible sets of k consecutive digits: {0, 1, ldots, k-1}, {1, 2, ldots, k}, ldots, {n-k, n-k+1, ldots, n-1}. 2. **Count the Valid Configurations for Each Set:** - For each of the k-digit sets, there are 2^{k-1} valid permutations that satisfy the condition that every digit (except the first) differs by pm 1 from the previous digit. - This can be understood as follows: starting from any digit d_i (where d_1 is any digit from the set), the next digit d_{i+1} can be either d_i + 1 or d_i - 1, except for boundary conditions. This gives us 2 choices for each subsequent digit, culminating in 2^{k-1} choices. 3. **Total Count for Each k:** - Out of k digits, the first digit is fixed (cannot be 0), leaving k-1 digits with 2 choices each. Thus, for each set of k digits, there are: (n-k+1) cdot 2^{k-1} possible valid permutations. 4. **Adjust for Invalid Initial 0 in Digital Representation:** - A k-digit number starting with 0 should not be considered as a valid k-digit number. Hence, for each k, there is exactly 1 sequence beginning with 0 that must be subtracted. - Therefore, for each k-digit sequence, the valid count is: (n-k+1) cdot 2^{k-1} - 1. 5. **Summing Over All k:** - Now, we sum over all possible values of k from 1 to n to get the total number of valid numbers in base n: sum_{k=1}^{n} left[(n-k+1) cdot 2^{k-1} - 1right]. 6. **Simplify the Summation Expression:** - Breaking down the summation into two parts, we have: sum_{k=1}^{n} left[(n-k+1) cdot 2^{k-1}right] - sum_{k=1}^{n} 1. - The first summation: sum_{k=1}^{n}(n-k+1) cdot 2^{k-1} = n cdot 2^{0} + (n-1) cdot 2^{1} + (n-2) cdot 2^{2} + ldots + 1 cdot 2^{n-1}. - The sum of constants: sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 = n. 7. **Combine Components:** - Summing the geometric series for the first summation: n (2^0) + (n-1) (2^1) + cdots + 1 (2^{n-1}) = left(2^{n} - 1right) + left(2^{n-1} - 1right) + cdots + left(2^1 - 1right) + (2^0 - 1). - This simplifies to: (2^n + 2^{n-1} + ldots + 2^1 + 2^0) - n = left(2^{n+1} - 2right) - n. 8. **Conclusion:** - Hence, the total number of such integers is: F(n) = 2^{n+1} - 2n - 2.

Let's denote the sides of the triangle as follows: - One side as ( a ), - The other side, which is twice the first side, as ( 2a ), - The angle between these two sides is ( 60^circ ). 1. **Using the Law of Cosines:** The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ), and an angle ( gamma ) opposite side ( c ): [ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(gamma) ] In our case: - Let side ( c ) be the side opposite the ( 60^circ ) angle, - ( a = a ), - ( b = 2a ), - ( gamma = 60^circ ). Applying the Law of Cosines, we get: [ c^2 = a^2 + (2a)^2 - 2 cdot a cdot 2a cdot cos(60^circ) ] 2. **Simplify the expression:** Since ( cos(60^circ) = frac{1}{2} ), the equation becomes: [ c^2 = a^2 + 4a^2 - 2 cdot a cdot 2a cdot frac{1}{2} ] [ c^2 = a^2 + 4a^2 - 2a^2 ] [ c^2 = 3a^2 ] Hence, the side ( c = sqrt{3a^2} = asqrt{3} ). 3. **Determine the nature of the angles:** To check if the triangle is a right triangle, we will use the simplified form of the sides and check whether the cosine of the angle opposite to any side results in the conditions of a right triangle. Let's denote the angle opposite to the side (2a) as ( alpha ). We know that: [ cos alpha = frac{a^2 + c^2 - (2a)^2}{2 cdot a cdot c} ] Substitute ( c = asqrt{3} ): [ cos alpha = frac{a^2 + (asqrt{3})^2 - 4a^2}{2 cdot a cdot asqrt{3}} ] [ cos alpha = frac{a^2 + 3a^2 - 4a^2}{2a^2sqrt{3}} ] [ cos alpha = frac{0}{2a^2sqrt{3}} ] Hence: [ cos alpha = 0 ] This implies: [ alpha = 90^circ ] 4. **Conclusion:** Since angle ( alpha ) is ( 90^circ ), the triangle indeed has a right angle, proving it is a right triangle.

We know that Alexa was on vacation for 3/4ths of the time it took Ethan to learn the tricks. Alexa's vacation time was 1 week and 2 days.

Since we notice the expression ( 76 - 42 sqrt{3} ) looks complicated, let us assume it can be presented as a perfect square. We propose: [ 76 - 42 sqrt{3} = (A - B sqrt{3})^2 ] where ( A ) and ( B ) are real numbers. Expanding the square on the right-hand side, we get: [ (A - B sqrt{3})^2 = A^2 - 2AB sqrt{3} + 3B^2 ] Comparing this with ( 76 - 42 sqrt{3} ): [ A^2 + 3B^2 = 76 quad text{and} quad -2AB = -42 ] From (-2AB = -42), we get: [ AB = 21 ] And we have the system of equations: [ A^2 + 3B^2 = 76 ] [ AB = 21 ] 2. **Solving the System of Equations:** Solving ( AB = 21 ) for ( B ): [ B = frac{21}{A} ] Substituting ( B = frac{21}{A} ) into ( A^2 + 3B^2 = 76 ): [ A^2 + 3 left( frac{21}{A} right)^2 = 76 ] [ A^2 + 3 cdot frac{441}{A^2} = 76 ] [ A^4 - 76A^2 + 1323 = 0 ] Let ( x = A^2 ): [ x^2 - 76x + 1323 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: [ x = frac{76 pm sqrt{76^2 - 4 cdot 1323}}{2} ] [ x = frac{76 pm sqrt{5776 - 5292}}{2} ] [ x = frac{76 pm sqrt{484}}{2} ] [ x = frac{76 pm 22}{2} ] This gives us two values for ( x ): [ x = frac{98}{2} = 49 quad text{or} quad x = frac{54}{2} = 27 ] Therefore, ( A^2 = 49 ) or ( A^2 = 27 ), which results in: [ A = 7 quad text{or} quad A = sqrt{27} ] Since ( A ) is an integer, we take ( A = 7 ) and solve for ( B ): [ AB = 21 rightarrow 7B = 21 rightarrow B = 3 ] 3. **Verifying and Decomposing:** So ( sqrt{76 - 42 sqrt{3}} = 7 - 3sqrt{3} ).

First, let's calculate the profit from the tea purchased in market A: - The cost price per bag in market A is m yuan. - The selling price per bag is frac{m+n}{2} yuan. - Therefore, the profit (or loss) per bag from market A is frac{m+n}{2} - m. - For 40 bags, the total profit (or loss) from market A is 40left(frac{m+n}{2} - mright) = 40left(frac{m+n-2m}{2}right) = 20(m+n) - 40m = 20n - 20m. Next, let's calculate the profit from the tea purchased in market B: - The cost price per bag in market B is n yuan. - The selling price per bag remains frac{m+n}{2} yuan. - Therefore, the profit (or loss) per bag from market B is frac{m+n}{2} - n. - For 60 bags, the total profit (or loss) from market B is 60left(frac{m+n}{2} - nright) = 60left(frac{m+n-2n}{2}right) = 30(m+n) - 60n = 30m - 30n. Adding the profits (or losses) from both markets gives us the total profit (or loss) of the store: - Total profit = Profit from market A + Profit from market B - Total profit = (20n - 20m) + (30m - 30n) = 10m - 10n = 10(m-n). Given that m > n, it implies m-n > 0. Therefore, 10(m-n) > 0, indicating that the total profit is positive. Thus, the store made a profit after selling out all the tea.

From page 600 to page 625, let's analyze: - Hundreds digit: From 600 to 625, every number has 6 in the hundreds digit (26 times), while 9 does not appear in the hundreds digit. - Tens digit: Among 600-625, 9 appears as a tens digit in 690-699. However, since pages go only up to 625, there are no 9's in the tens place. - Units digit: 9 appears in the units place at pages ending in 619 and 629. That is twice in the units place. Counting all occurrences from 600 to 625: - 6's appear 26 times more in the hundreds place, 0 times in the tens place, and 3 times in units (606, 616, 626). - 9's appear 0 times in the hundreds place, 0 times in the tens place, and 2 times in units.

According to the problem, the ratio of almonds to walnuts is A:2W. We are given that there are 107.14285714285714 pounds of almonds in a 150-pound mixture. This means that the weight of the walnuts in the mixture is the total weight minus the weight of the almonds: Weight of walnuts = Total weight of mixture - Weight of almonds Weight of walnuts = 150 pounds - 107.14285714285714 pounds Weight of walnuts = 42.85714285714286 pounds Now, we have the weight of almonds and walnuts, and we know that the ratio of almonds to walnuts by weight is A:2W. We can set up a proportion to find the ratio: A pounds of almonds / 2W pounds of walnuts = 107.14285714285714 pounds of almonds / 42.85714285714286 pounds of walnuts To simplify the ratio, we can divide both sides by the weight of walnuts: A / 2W = 107.14285714285714 / 42.85714285714286 Now, we can simplify the right side of the equation: A / 2W = 2.5 This means that for every 2.5 pounds of almonds, there are 2 parts of walnuts. Since we want the ratio of almonds to walnuts, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get the ratio in terms of whole parts: 2(A / 2W) = 2(2.5) A / W = 5 So the ratio of almonds to walnuts in the mixture is boxed{5:2} ."},{"prompt":"A bag contains 4 red, 3 blue and 2 green balls.

An L-tetromino covers exactly 4 cells. 1. **Initial Considerations**: - The original ( n times n ) square contains ( n^2 ) cells. - Removing the four corners leaves ( n^2 - 4 ) cells. - Since each L-tetromino covers 4 cells, it must be possible to tile ( n^2 - 4 ) cells with L-tetrominoes. Therefore, ( n^2 - 4 ) must be divisible by 4. 2. **Divisibility Condition**: - ( n^2 - 4 equiv 0 mod 4 ) - ( n^2 equiv 4 mod 4 ) - Since ( 4 equiv 0 mod 4 ), we see ( n^2 equiv 0 mod 4 ). 3. **Parity of ( n )**: - ( n^2 equiv 0 mod 4 ) implies that ( n ) must be even because the square of an odd number is congruent to 1 modulo 4: ( k^2 equiv 1 mod 4 ). Thus, ( n ) needs to be an even number to satisfy ( n^2 equiv 0 mod 4 ). 4. **Additional Constraints**: - We color the squares of the original ( n times n ) grid in a checkerboard pattern (alternating black and white). - Each L-tetromino covers exactly 3 cells of one color and 1 cell of another color, no matter how it is placed. - Therefore, after covering the entire grid (except the corners), the number of black and white cells covered must still be equal. 5. **Checkerboard Analysis**: - Let ( n ) be even. For simplicity, let's consider ( n = 2k ). - Total cells: ( n^2 = 4k^2 ), out of which ( k^2 ) cells are black and ( k^2 ) cells are white. - When the four corners are removed, two corners are black and two corners are white for any ( n ). Thus, we still need to maintain an equal number of black and white cells over the complete tiling. 6. **Parity Analysis**: - From earlier, because ( n^2 - 4 equiv 0 mod 4 ), we look at: [ n^2 - 4 equiv 0 mod 8 ] - This means: [ n^2 equiv 4 mod 8 ] - The solutions to this congruence are ( n equiv 2 mod 4 ) or ( n equiv -2 mod 4 ) (since squares of numbers modulo 8 can only yield up to specific results). Therefore, ( n ) must be of the form ( n = 4k + 2 ) for some integer ( k ). **Conclusion**: Thus, the ( n times n ) square with four corners removed can be covered completely with L-tetrominoes if and only if ( n ) is of the form ( n = 4k + 2 ).

Four years hence (which means in four years from now), the ratio of their ages will be 7:8. Since one year ago their ages were R and L, four years from now their ages will be R+5 and L+5 respectively. So we can write: (R+5)/(L+5) = 7/8 Now we have two equations with two variables.

This rotation is equivalent to a rotation by frac{pi}{6} radians. Given that the rotation results in the graph coinciding with itself, we can think of this as having points on a circle that, when rotated by frac{pi}{6} radians, will align with the next point on the circle. This setup is akin to having 12 points uniformly distributed along the circumference of a circle, each point representing a possible value of f(x) for x in A. These 12 points correspond to central angles of 0, frac{pi}{6}, frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{2}, frac{2pi}{3}, frac{5pi}{6}, pi, frac{7pi}{6}, frac{4pi}{3}, frac{3pi}{2}, frac{5pi}{3}, and frac{11pi}{6}. Each of these angles represents a position on the circle that a point could occupy. Given the symmetry of the circle, especially with respect to the x-axis, there are 5 sets of points that are symmetric about the x-axis. This symmetry implies that for certain x values, there could be two corresponding y values, which contradicts the function's definition that each x should map to exactly one y. By examining the options given for f(1), we see that 0, frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, and sqrt{3} could potentially correspond to points on the circle that, after rotation, would violate the one-to-one correspondence between x and y values due to the symmetry about the x-axis. However, when x = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, the rotation by frac{pi}{6} does not result in any two points being symmetric about the x-axis in such a way that would violate the function's definition. This means that for f(1) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, the function maintains the requirement that each x corresponds to exactly one y.

Since this distance represents half the period T/2 of the sine function, we can find the full period T as follows: [T = 2 times frac{pi}{2} = pi.] From the period T, we can find omega using the relation omega = frac{2pi}{T}: [omega = frac{2pi}{pi} = 2.] 2. **Finding the Symmetry Axis:** The symmetry axis of the function f(x) is located exactly halfway between its zeros.

Let's consider a tetrahedron with vertices (A, B, C, D) and center (O). 2. We can connect the center (O) of a regular tetrahedron (ABCD) to all its vertices. The tetrahedron has four faces and all dihedral angles of a regular tetrahedron are known to be more than (90^circ). Therefore, any pair of lines from (O) to the vertices of the tetrahedron subtend obtuse angles. For example: [ angle AOB > 90^circ ] 3. Now, let's explore why we cannot have more than four rays such that every pair forms an obtuse angle. 4. Suppose there are four rays (l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4) emanating from a point (O) such that the angle between any two rays is obtuse. Each pair of these rays determines a plane where one ray will always lie on the opposite half-space of that plane compared to the other ray. 5. Consider the planes (pi_1, pi_2, pi_3, pi_4) perpendicular to each of these rays (l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4) respectively. These planes intersect at (O). 6. Any ray that makes obtuse angles with (l_1) will lie in such a position that it is on the same side of the plane perpendicular to (l_1) as the other three rays. Similarly, for the other pairs, each pair must lie in the half-space of their corresponding perpendicular planes intersected with the space of remaining rays. 7. All these intersecting conditions form a three-dimensional space where no additional fifth ray can be added without violating the conditions. Adding another ray would mean it must lie on an already occupied location with respect to the adjacent dihedral intersections.

How are the center and the coefficient of the resulting homothety determined in the first case, and how is the corresponding vector determined in the second case?","completion":"To prove that the composition of two homotheties is either a homothety or a parallel translation, and to determine the center and coefficient of the resulting homothety (or the corresponding vector in the case of parallel translation), we will go through the following steps. 1. **First Homothety (Transformation 1):** Consider a point homothety with center S_1 and coefficient k_1. Given points A_1 and B_1, this homothety transforms them into points A_2 and B_2, respectively. [ left(A_1 A_2right) cap left(B_1 B_2right) = S_1 ] Further, the vectors relate by: [ overrightarrow{A_2 B_2} = k_1 overrightarrow{A_1 B_1} ] 2. **Second Homothety (Transformation 2):** Similarly, consider another point homothety with center S_2 and coefficient k_2. This transforms A_2 and B_2 into A_3 and B_3, respectively. [ left(A_2 A_3right) cap left(B_2 B_3right) = S_2 ] And, [ overrightarrow{A_3 B_3} = k_2 overrightarrow{A_2 B_2} ] 3. **Collinearity and Stepping Through Transformations:** It follows from the transformation properties that: [ left(A_1 B_1right) |left(A_2 B_2right) quad text{and} quad left(A_2 B_2right) |left(A_3 B_3right) ] Therefore, [ left(A_1 B_1right) |left(A_3 B_3right) ] Thus, vectors overrightarrow{A_1 B_1} and overrightarrow{A_3 B_3} are collinear. 4. **Composition and Calculation of Resulting Homothety:** Combining the homotheties, we obtain: [ overrightarrow{A_3 B_3}=k_2 overrightarrow{A_2 B_2} = k_2 (k_1 overrightarrow{A_1 B_1}) = k_1 cdot k_2 cdot overrightarrow{A_1 B_1} ] This demonstrates that a homothety exists that maps A_1 to A_3 and B_1 to B_3 with center S_3 and coefficient k_3 = k_1 cdot k_2. 5. **Collinearity of Centers:** We now show that the centers of the three homotheties S_1, S_2, and S_3 lie on the same line. Since straight lines through the center remain invariant (are mapped to themselves), the line S_1 S_2 is invariant under both transformations and thus under their composition too. Hence, S_3 lies on the line S_1 S_2. 6. **Determination of S_3:** Using the relations and the configuration shown, we analyze the distances and the expressions to determine exact compositions like: [ frac{overrightarrow{A_{1} S_{1}}}{overrightarrow{A_{1} A_{2}}} = -frac{m}{n}, quad frac{overrightarrow{A_{3} A_{2}}}{overrightarrow{A_{3} S_{2}}} = -frac{n}{p}, quad frac{overrightarrow{S_{3} S_{1}}}{overrightarrow{S_{3} S_{2}}} = frac{m}{p} ] Applying these ratio forms: [ frac{overrightarrow{A_{1} S_{1}}}{overrightarrow{A_{2} A_{1}}} = frac{1}{1-k_1} = -frac{m}{n} ] [ frac{overrightarrow{A_{3} A_{2}}}{overrightarrow{A_{3} S_{2}}} = frac{k_2 - 1}{k_2} = -frac{n}{p} ] [ overrightarrow{S_{3} S_{1}} = frac{m}{overrightarrow{S_{3} S_{2}}} = left(frac{k_2 - 1}{k_2(1 - k_1)}right) ] 7. **Case of Parallel Translation:** If overrightarrow{A_{1} B_{1}} = overrightarrow{A_{3} B_{3}}, then the vector overrightarrow{A_{1} A_{3}} = overrightarrow{B_{1} B_{3}}. This implies that the composition of the homotheties is a parallel translation represented by a vector vec{m} = overrightarrow{A_{1} A_{3}} = overrightarrow{B_{1} B_{3}}.

Consider the sum of the integer parts of a and b: lfloor a rfloor + lfloor b rfloor. 2. According to the problem, lfloor a rfloor + lfloor b rfloor must equal lfloor a + b rfloor.

This indicates that the sum of the fractional parts of a and c must be greater than or equal to 1, such that when added, they cause an increment in the integer part of a + c after taking the floor.

We are given that the product of a number and its reverse equals 78445. Therefore, we need to find two such numbers ( n ) and ( m ) where: [ n times m = 78445 ] and ( m ) is the reverse of ( n ). 2. Since the product is ( 78445 ), which is a five-digit number, it's reasonable to assume that both ( n ) and ( m ) are three-digit numbers. 3. Given the number ( 78445 ), we observe that one of the multiplicands must end in 5. Consequently, its reverse must start with 5. Therefore, the product ( 78445 ) implies that one of the numbers should end in 1 so as to satisfy the reverse constraint. 4. Let us denote our three-digit number as ( n ).

To begin, classify the sequence ( {a_n} ) into different subsequences based on the remainder when each ( a_i ) is divided by ( a_2 ). 3. Since there are only ( a_2 ) possible remainders (from 0 to ( a_2 - 1 )), and the sequence ( {a_n} ) is infinite, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these remainder classes must contain infinitely many terms. 4.

Since there are infinitely many terms in ( {b_m} ), there are terms ( b_{m_1}, b_{m_2}, ldots, b_{m_k}, ldots ) all greater than ( b_p ). 7. Because every term in ( {b_m} ) leaves the same remainder when divided by ( a_2 ), we have: [ b_{m} equiv b_{p} pmod{a_2}. ] 8. Thus, for any ( b_m ) in the sub-sequence ( {b_m} ), there exists a natural number ( y ) such that: [ b_m - b_p = y a_2. ] Hence, we can write: [ b_m = b_p + y a_2. ] 9.

If either of these segments degenerates to a point, then the triangle ( KCG ) is already equilateral, and by the transformation rule, no new points are added. 4. **Ensure Collinearity:** Let's analyze the straight lines ( K K' ), which become ( CC' ) during the rotation. Suppose we call the red line as ( k ), the blue line as ( c ), and the one obtained by rotating ( c ) around ( O ) (origin point of rotation) as the yellow line ( g ): - Every time you perform the described operation around any point ( K_1 ) on the red line, the blue line transforms into the yellow line because the distances from ( K_1 ) to transformed points remain consistent. Therefore, when constructing point ( G_1 ) from an arbitrary point ( C_1 ) (on the blue line) and point ( K_1 ), we necessarily fall onto the yellow line. - Consequently, since ( G ) is derived from ( C )'s rotation around ( K' ), indicating that ( G ) also lies on the yellow line.

The interest earned from the 6,000 investment at 8% is: ( 6000 times 0.08 = 480 ) dollars. The total interest earned from both investments is 840, so the interest earned from the second investment is: ( 840 - 480 = 360 ) dollars. The amount invested at the second rate is the total investment minus the amount invested at 8%, which is: ( 10000 - 6000 = 4000 ) dollars. Now we can find the annual simple interest rate of the second investment using the formula for simple interest: ( I = P times r times t ), where ( I ) is the interest, ( P ) is the principal, ( r ) is the rate, and ( t ) is the time in years. We know that ( I = 360 ), ( P = 4000 ), and ( t = 1 ) year. We can solve for ( r ): ( 360 = 4000 times r times 1 ). Now, solve for ( r ): ( r = 360 / 4000 ), ( r = 0.09 ) or 9%.

Consider the points ( A_1, A_2, ) and ( A_3 ) lying on a straight line ( a ). Perpendiculars ( A_iB_i ) (where ( i = 1, 2, 3 )) are drawn from these points to another straight line ( b ). We need to show that if ( A_2 ) lies between ( A_1 ) and ( A_3 ), then the length of segment ( A_2B_2 ) is between the lengths of segments ( A_1B_1 ) and ( A_3B_3 ). 2. Let's construct a plane ( Pi ) that is perpendicular to line ( b ) and parallel to line ( a ). 3. Let ( C_i ) be the projections of points ( A_i ) onto the plane ( Pi ). According to the theorem of three perpendiculars, we have ( C_iB_i perp b ). The theorem of three perpendiculars states that if a line is perpendicular to a plane, then the perpendicular distance from any point on the line to the plane is invariant. 4. Because ( A_i ) are collinear along ( a ), their projections onto the plane ( Pi ) (denoted as ( C_i )) will also be collinear along another line ( a' ) lying on the plane ( Pi ). 5. As ( A_2 ) lies between ( A_1 ) and ( A_3 ) on line ( a ), the projections ( C_2 ) will lie between ( C_1 ) and ( C_3 ) on line ( a' ). 6. Since ( C_iB_i perp b ) and the distances ( B_iC_i ) are perpendicular distances from the points ( B_i ) to ( a' ) (lying in the plane ( Pi )), the lengths ( B_2C_2 ) will be between lengths ( B_1C_1 ) and ( B_3C_3 ). 7. The lengths of segments ( A_iC_i ) are all equal. Therefore, since ( A_iB_i ) equals ( sqrt{A_iC_i^2 + B_iC_i^2} ) by the Pythagorean theorem, the conclusion follows that ( |A_2B_2| ) is between ( |A_1B_1| ) and ( |A_3B_3| ). 8.

Helper Theorem: In a trapezoid ABCD with AB parallel CD, the line connecting the intersection of extended sides BC and AD (denoted E) and the intersection of diagonals AC and BD (denoted O) bisects both AB and CD. Reversely, if E and O form and their connecting line bisects AB, then AB parallel CD, making ABCD a trapezoid. Proof of Helper Theorem: 1. Let BC and AD extend to meet at E, and diagonals AC and BD intersect at O. 2. Draw parallels to AC through B and to BD through A, intersecting the line EO at points P and R respectively. 3. By the property of parallel lines and intercepts: [ frac{AD}{DE} = frac{RO}{OE} quad text{and} quad frac{BC}{CE} = frac{PO}{OE} ] 4.

We can then move these coins to ((1,k+1)). - If the second row contains at least (2^{k-1}) coins, we can use the inductive hypothesis to ensure that there are at least two coins in the room ((2,k)). We can then move these coins to ((2,k+1)) and subsequently to ((1,k+1)). 4. **Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that for any (n), it is possible to move coins such that there is at least one coin in the room ((1,n)).

We need to check if (3a(a + x) + x^2) is even: - Since (a) and (a + x) are both odd numbers, their product (3a(a + x)) is also odd. - (x^2) is even (because (x) is even). - The sum of an odd number and an even number is odd ((3a(a + x) + x^2) is odd). - Hence, (3a(a + x) + x^2) is odd, implying it is not divisible by 2. 4. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, the difference between the cubes of (a) and (a + x) is not divisible by (2x). [ boxed{text{Q.E.D.}} ] --- Second Solution 1. **Use properties of odd numbers and the difference of cubes formula:** - Let the two odd numbers be (a) and (b), where (a neq b). 2. **Formula for the difference of cubes:** [ a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) ] 3. **Derive divisibility concerns:** - Evaluate the quotient of the difference of cubes by the difference (a - b): [ frac{a^3 - b^3}{a - b} = a^2 + ab + b^2 ] 4. **Assess the oddness or evenness of the result:** - Since (a) and (b) are both odd: - (a^2), (ab), and (b^2) are all odd numbers (the product or square of an odd number is always odd). - The sum of three odd numbers is also odd ((a^2 + ab + b^2) is odd). [ a^2 + ab + b^2 text{ is odd} ] 5. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, the value (frac{a^3 - b^3}{a - b}) is odd, which implies it cannot be divisible by (2(a - b)) as the latter is an even number.

We need to show it holds for ( n+1 ): [ g(x^{n+1}) = g(x^n cdot x) = g(x^n) cdot g(x) = g(x)^n cdot g(x) = g(x)^{n+1} ] Thus, by induction, ( g(x^n) = g(x)^n ) for all positive integers ( n ). 5. **Induction to show ( g(x_1 x_2 cdots x_n) = g(x_1) g(x_2) cdots g(x_n) ):** - **Base case:** For ( n = 1 ), ( g(x) = g(x) ), which is trivially true. - **Induction step:** Assume ( g(x_1 x_2 cdots x_n) = g(x_1) g(x_2) cdots g(x_n) ) holds for some ( n ).

Therefore, the total cost without discount C = 15 + 5(P-1) cents. 4. **Apply the discount**: - If P > 5, a discount of 10 cents is applied. Therefore, the corrected cost formula is: - C = 15 + 5(P-1) - 10 cents for P > 5. - C = 15 + 5(P-1) cents for P leq 5. 5. **Combining the formulas**: Let's simplify and distinguish based on weight: - If P leq 5: C = 15 + 5(P-1) = 5P + 10 - If P > 5: C = 15 + 5(P-1) - 10 = 5P + 5 Conclusion: The cost formula varies based on the weight of the package.

Prove that the five Gauss lines intersect at a single point or are parallel to each other.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given five distinct lines in the plane, denoted (l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4,) and (l_5). For any four of these lines selected, one can construct a Gauss line. We need to show that the five Gauss lines constructed are either concurrent (intersecting in a single point) or all parallel to each other. 2. **Gauss Line Definition:** The \`Gauss Line\` for any four lines is a unique line associated with the four lines under consideration. Let's denote the constructed Gauss lines by (G_1, G_2, G_3, G_4,) and (G_5) corresponding respectively to the sets ({l_2, l_3, l_4, l_5}, {l_1, l_3, l_4, l_5}, {l_1, l_2, l_4, l_5}, {l_1, l_2, l_3, l_5}, {l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4}). 3. **Hypothesis:** Suppose two of the Gauss lines (G_1) and (G_2) intersect at a point (P). 4. **Using Problem 585's Result:** By reference from problem 585, we know that if two Gauss lines intersect, then their point of intersection lies on the Gauss line of any other three lines composing the four used to define each of (G_1) and (G_2). 5. **Application to the Current Context:** Since (P) is an intersection point of (G_1) and (G_2), we assert that (P) lies on the third Gauss line (G_3). The lines involved in these constructs are (l_3, l_4, l_5) for (G_1) and (l_2, l_4, l_5) for (G_2). By the problem's definition, (G_3) which is constructed using ({l_1, l_2, l_4, l_5}) also contains (P). 6. **General Case (Intersection):** Repeating the above logic for the remaining pairs of Gauss lines, the intersection point (P) must satisfy all constructed Gauss lines, thus all lines pass through (P). 7. **Parallel Lines Consideration:** Suppose two Gauss lines do not intersect but are parallel. If (G_1) and (G_2) are parallel, using the same argument outlined in step 4, (G_3) must also be parallel. 8. **Consistency:** Given (G_1, G_2,) and now (G_3) are all parallel, we can extend this parallelism to (G_4) and (G_5) by the same logic. Hence, all five Gauss lines (G_i) for (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) must be parallel to each other. 9. **Conclusion:** The five Gauss lines are either: - Intersecting at a single point, or - All being parallel to each other. Thus, the essential conditions are met, and we conclude that the five Gauss lines either intersect in one point or are mutually parallel.

Consider the number given on the board, which consists of 99 consecutive ones: [ N = underbrace{111 ldots 11}_{99 text{ ones}} ] 2. Analyze the conditions for the game: a player alternately replaces any “1” (except the first or last) with a “0” or erases any “0” written previously. The game ends when the number on the board is divisible by 11 for the first time. 3. Observe the structure of the number obtained by converting an internal “1” to “0”: [ A_n = 1underbrace{101 ldots 11}_{n text{ ones}} ] 4. To test the divisibility by 11, consider the alternating sum of its digits. For a number to be divisible by 11, the absolute difference between the sum of its digits at odd positions and the sum of its digits at even positions must be zero or a multiple of 11. 5. Check the alternating sum for (A_n): - If (n) is even: [ text{Sum of digits in } A_n = 0 + underbrace{-1 + 0 + 1 - 0}_{text{repeats } n/2 text{ times}} ] This does not sum to zero if (n neq 0). - If (n) is odd: [ text{Sum of digits in } A_n = 9 + underbrace{0 + 1 + 0 + ldots}_{text{repeats } (n+1)/2 text{ times}} ] This structure ensures that the alternating sum isn’t zero or a multiple of 11. 6. Thus, (A_n) derived after each move does not satisfy the divisibility rule for 11. 7. Given each move either replaces a “1” with “0” or erases a “0”, the sum won't be significantly reduced compared to the beginning structure. 8. Since Petya starts, let’s propose a winning strategy: - Petya replaces the second “1” from the left with “0”, changing: [ 111 ldots 11 longrightarrow 101 ldots 11 ] - On each subsequent move, if Vasya converts any other “1” to “0,” Petya will always erase a “0” to maintain a number structure similar to (A_n), ensuring the count remains invariant to the 11-rule alternation except covered initially. 9. Repeat as necessary: - If Vasya erases a “0,” Petya again converts an internal “1” similarly to maintain the cycle. 10. Here's the crucial point: As numbers reduce step-by-step and zeroes manage closely the addition reduces chances for Vasya to set divisible conditions. 11. If Petya can’t erase a “0” on a specific move, it implies Vasya already faced a losing state by producing a multiplicative division earlier in steps before reaching (11). Hence, Petya systematically leads to Vasya forcefully ending at non-divisive positions ensuring continuation till Vasya succumbs to ending the sequence. **Conclusion:** Petya guarantees a win through an ideal planned move structure.

Given that the common ratio is q, and assuming a_{1} is the first term, then T_{n} = a_{1}^{n} cdot q^{frac{n(n-1)}{2}}. 2. **Analyzing the Given Inequality T_{7} > T_{6} > T_{8}:** - This implies that the product of the first 7 terms is greater than that of the first 6 terms and also greater than the product of the first 8 terms. This situation can only occur if the 7th term, a_{7}, is greater than 1, and the 8th term, a_{8}, is less than 1 but greater than 0. 3. **Deducing the Value of q:** - Since a_{7} > 1 and 0 < a_{8} < 1, it directly implies that 0 < q < 1.

These multiples are 12, 24, 36, 48, 60. To find the sum, recognize that these numbers form an arithmetic series where each term increases by 12. The sum of these can be calculated by factoring out the 12: [ 12 + 24 + 36 + 48 + 60 = 12(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) ] The sum inside the parentheses is the sum of the first 5 natural numbers, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = frac{5(5 + 1)}{2} = frac{5 times 6}{2} = 15 ] Now, multiply this sum by 12: [ 12 times 15 = 180 ] Thus, the sum of the first five smallest distinct positive integer multiples of 12 is boxed{180}."},{"prompt":"Given a line segment (OA). From the endpoint (A), 5 line segments (AB_{1}, AB_{2}, AB_{3}, AB_{4}, AB_{5}) emanate. From each point (B_{i}), either five new line segments may start, or none at all, and so on. Can the number of free endpoints of the constructed line segments equal (1001)? A free endpoint of a line segment is defined as a point that belongs to only one line segment (excluding point (O)).","completion":"1. The problem involves the construction of line segments starting from a single point (O). We are given that from point (A), five new segments ((A B_1, A B_2, A B_3, A B_4, A B_5)) can be drawn. 2. Each new segment drawn from point (A) results in new endpoints (B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5). Let us consider the impact on the free ends, which are points that belong to only one segment (except the origin (O)). 3. Initially, there is a single segment (O A), which has a free endpoint (A). 4. When five new segments are drawn from (A) to (B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5), the endpoint (A) stops being free as it now connects multiple segments. Each of the new segments (A B_i) introduces a new free endpoint at (B_i). Thus, the number of new free endpoints introduced is 5, and the previous free endpoint (A) ceases to be free. 5. More generally, drawing (n) segments from endpoint (A) results in the creation of (n) free endpoints while the previous free endpoint (A) ceases to be free. Therefore, the net increase in the number of free endpoints is (n - 1). 6. Applying the process recursively: - Let (k) be the number of times five segments are drawn from existing free endpoints. - Each time the process is applied, the number of free endpoints increases by (5 - 1 = 4). 7. The formula to find the total number of free endpoints after (k) instances of drawing five new segments is: [ text{Free endpoints} = 1 + 4k ] Where (1) is the initial free endpoint before any new segments are introduced, and (4k) accounts for the net increase after (k) iterations. 8. To find (k) such that the number of free endpoints is 1001: [ 1 + 4k = 1001 ] Solving for (k): [ 4k = 1000 ] [ k = 250 ] # Conclusion: Yes, the number of free endpoints can be 1001 after (250) instances of drawing five segments from existing endpoints.

The shop owner charges customers 30% more than the cost price for the computer table, 25% more for the bookshelf, and offers a 15% discount for the chair from its original price. If the customer paid Rs. 8450 for the computer table, Rs. 6250 for the bookshelf, and Rs. 3400 for the chair, what were the cost price for each of these items?","completion":"Let's calculate the cost price for each item based on the information provided. 1. Computer Table: The customer paid Rs. 8450 for the computer table, which is 30% more than the cost price. Let's denote the cost price of the computer table as ( C_t ). We can write the following equation: ( 8450 = C_t + 0.30 cdot C_t ) ( 8450 = 1.30 cdot C_t ) Now, we solve for ( C_t ): ( C_t = frac{8450}{1.30} ) ( C_t = 6500 ) So, the cost price of the computer table is Rs. 6500. 2. Bookshelf: The customer paid Rs. 6250 for the bookshelf, which is 25% more than the cost price. Let's denote the cost price of the bookshelf as ( C_b ). We can write the following equation: ( 6250 = C_b + 0.25 cdot C_b ) ( 6250 = 1.25 cdot C_b ) Now, we solve for ( C_b ): ( C_b = frac{6250}{1.25} ) ( C_b = 5000 ) So, the cost price of the bookshelf is Rs. 5000. 3. Chair: The customer paid Rs. 3400 for the chair, which is after a 15% discount from its original price. Let's denote the original price of the chair as ( O_c ). We can write the following equation: ( 3400 = O_c - 0.15 cdot O_c ) ( 3400 = 0.85 cdot O_c ) Now, we solve for ( O_c ): ( O_c = frac{3400}{0.85} ) ( O_c = 4000 ) So, the original price of the chair is Rs. 4000. However, since the question asks for the cost price, and the original price is typically considered the cost price before any discounts or markups, the cost price of the chair is also Rs. 4000. In summary: - The cost price of the computer table is Rs. 6500. - The cost price of the bookshelf is Rs. 5000. - The cost price of the chair is Rs. boxed{4000} ."},{"prompt":"Given that {f'}left(xright) is the derivative of the function fleft(xright), if fleft(xright)={f'}left(1right)ln left(x+1right)+e^{x}, then {f'}left(0right)=______.","completion":"To solve for {f'}(0), we first need to find the expression for {f'}(x) based on the given f(x)={f'}(1)ln(x+1)+e^{x}.
