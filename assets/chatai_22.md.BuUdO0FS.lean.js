A quarter of 24 hours is 6 hours. - On Thursday, he spent one-third of the day watching the show. One-third of 24 hours is 8 hours. - On Friday, he spent twice the amount of time watching the show as he had on Wednesday. Twice 6 hours is 12 hours. Now let's add up the time he spent from Monday to Friday: 12 (Monday) + 4 (Tuesday) + 6 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 42 hours He didn't watch the show on Saturday, so the total remains 42 hours.

Given that a_1 + a_3 = 10, we have a_1 + a_1 cdot q^2 = 10. 3. Given that a_4 + a_6 = frac{5}{4}, we have a_1 cdot q^3 + a_1 cdot q^5 = frac{5}{4}. 4. Divide the second equation by the first equation: frac{a_1 cdot q^3 + a_1 cdot q^5}{a_1 + a_1 cdot q^2} = frac{5/4}{10}. 5. Simplify the equation: frac{q^3(1+q^2)}{1+q^2} = frac{1}{8}. 6. Solve for q: q^3 = frac{1}{8} gives us q = sqrt[3]{frac{1}{8}} = frac{1}{2}.

Next, we simplify the numerator and the denominator of the first fraction and factor the second fraction's numerator and denominator: [ = frac{3-{a}^{2}+1}{a+1} cdot frac{a+1}{(a+2)(a-2)} ] 3.

We will analyze the behavior of q_n under steps A and B. 4. **Behavior under Step A**: If a_{n-1} = frac{p_{n-1}}{q_{n-1}} < frac{1}{2}, then a_n = 2a_{n-1} = frac{2p_{n-1}}{q_{n-1}}. Here, q_n = q_{n-1}, so q_n does not change. 5. **Behavior under Step B**: If a_{n-1} = frac{p_{n-1}}{q_{n-1}} > frac{1}{2}, then a_n = frac{1}{a_{n-1}} - 1 = frac{q_{n-1}}{p_{n-1}} - 1 = frac{q_{n-1} - p_{n-1}}{p_{n-1}}. Here, q_n = p_{n-1}, so q_n decreases. 6. **Eventual occurrence of frac{1}{2}**: Suppose frac{1}{2} never occurs in the sequence {a_n}. This implies the sequence is infinite. Since q_n decreases under Step B and does not change under Step A, q_n must eventually become constant if frac{1}{2} never occurs. 7. **Contradiction**: If q_n becomes constant, it means we must eventually only apply Step A. However, continuously applying Step A will eventually produce a number greater than frac{1}{2}, which forces the application of Step B. This contradiction implies that frac{1}{2} must eventually occur in the sequence. 8. **Conclusion**: Since frac{1}{2} eventually occurs in the sequence for any rational number frac{p}{q} in (0,1), and given the subset's property that if a number is in the subset, then both its half and its successor's inverse are also in the subset, it follows that the subset contains all rational numbers in (0,1). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Every year an amount increases by a certain fraction of itself.

While moving (L) along (BC), the area of triangle (KLM) changes monotonically because the height from point (L) to side (KM) changes linearly. 6. This implies that as (L) moves, the areas of triangles (AKN, BKL, CLM,) and (DMN) will all change in a way that maintains the given area relationship, since their combined area with (S_{KLMN}) must still equal half the area of the parallelogram: [ S_{AKN} + S_{BKL} + S_{CLM} + S_{DMN} = frac{1}{2} S_{ABCD} ] 7.

Thus ( A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 ) cannot all pairwise have a distance of 1 from each other. 5. **Introducing the sixth point**: - Similarly, consider another point ( A_6 ). - Again, ( A_1 ) and ( A_6 ) are centers of two circles of radius 1. - These circles can intersect at most at two points. - Therefore, among the set ( A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 ), ( A_6 ) at most two pairs can have a distance of 1 with ( A_6 ). 6. Following the same logic, if ( n geq 8 ): - Even if ( A_6, A_7, A_8 ) are introduced, there must be two points in ( A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 ) that they intersect at most with two pairs having distance 1. - Finally, when ( n=9 ): - Points ( A_6, A_7, ) and ( A_8 ) can be aligned such that internally consistent distances arise to fulfill ( n ). 7.

Therefore, it must be between 1 and 9. 2. **Analyzing the Maximum Digit Sum:** - If all digits are smaller than 8, their maximum sum would be if they were all 7: [ 3 times 7 = 21 ] which is less than 24. Therefore, at least one digit must be 8 or 9. 3. **Case 1: One digit is 8** - Assume one digit is 8.

By applying the double-angle formulas, we can further simplify f(x) to f(x) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin 2x + frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2} cos 2x = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin 2x - frac{1}{2} cos 2x. This is equivalent to a phase-shifted sine function, which can be expressed as f(x) = sin left(2x - frac{pi}{6}right). Since sin(theta) has a period of 2pi, and the argument of the sine function is 2x - frac{pi}{6}, the period of f(x) will be halved.

Let's plug these values into the formula: Dividend Yield = (3000 / 6800) * 100 Dividend Yield = 0.44117647 * 100 Dividend Yield = 44.117647% Now, we know that the stock is a 60% stock, which means that the dividend is 60% of its face value (also known as par value).

Moreover, F(x_k) is not divisible by d_k. 3. **Redundancy elimination**: If amongst these prime powers, some share the same base prime p, we keep only the minimal one, because if F(x) % d = 0 does not hold for the minimal prime power, then it won't hold for higher powers of the same prime. 4. **Formation of a mutually coprime set**: After eliminating redundancy, we have a set of integers {d_1, d_2, ldots, d_s}, each one coprime to each other (i.e., gcd(d_i, d_j) = 1 for all i neq j). 5. **Application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem**: By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists an integer N such that N equiv x_k (text{mod} d_k) for all k = 1, 2, ..., s.

The circle Gamma^{prime} is inside Gamma. We consider a point B on Gamma^{prime}, distinct from T.

Without loss of generality, we assume the points P, M, B, N align in that order. 3. **Application of Angle Properties:** We will use the angle properties and the inscribed angle theorem to show that widehat{B T M} = widehat{B T N}. - By the inscribed angle theorem, angles subtended by the same arc are equal. Here, we need to consider the tangent-segment properties and angles formed. 4. **Using Tangent-Segments:** According to the properties of tangent segments: [ widehat{B T M} = widehat{B T P} - widehat{M T P} ] Since P is the intersection of the tangents, widehat{M T P} = widehat{M N T}: [ widehat{M T P} = widehat{M N T} ] and thus: [ widehat{B T M} = widehat{B T P} - widehat{M T P} ] 5. Further simplification gives: Create angles by points notation and observing symmetrical properties of angles formed by the tangent and radius: [ widehat{B T P} = widehat{P B T} ] Thus, simplifying with MTP substitution: [ widehat{B T M} = widehat{P B T} - widehat{M N T} ] 6. **Final Conclusion:** Since the angles relative to the arc and symmetry within tangents conclude: [ widehat{M N T} = widehat{B T N} ] We get: [ widehat{B T M} = widehat{B T N} ] This confirms that: [ boxed{widehat{B T M} = widehat{B T N}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let a and b be the numbers obtained by rolling a pair of dice twice.

We need to prove that: [ DE le frac{1}{8}(AB + BC + CA) ] 2. Since DE parallel BC, triangles ADE and ABC are similar. Therefore, we have: [ frac{DE}{BC} = frac{AD}{AB} = frac{AE}{AC} ] 3. Let (I, r) be the incircle of triangle ABC with inradius r, and (I_a, r_a) be the A-excircle of triangle ABC with exradius r_a. Since DE is tangent to the incircle, we have: [ frac{DE}{BC} = frac{r}{r_a} ] 4. From the similarity of triangles ADE and ABC, we get: [ DE = frac{a cdot r}{r_a} ] where a = BC. 5. We need to show that: [ frac{a cdot r}{r_a} le frac{1}{8}(a + b + c) ] 6. Using the identity for the ratio of the inradius to the A-exradius: [ frac{r}{r_a} = frac{b + c - a}{a + b + c} ] 7. Substituting this into the inequality, we get: [ frac{a cdot (b + c - a)}{a + b + c} le frac{1}{8}(a + b + c) ] 8. Multiplying both sides by 8(a + b + c), we obtain: [ 8a(b + c - a) le (a + b + c)^2 ] 9. Expanding and simplifying, we get: [ 8ab + 8ac - 8a^2 le a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc ] 10.

We aim to show that every positive integer greater than 2ab belongs to S. 3. First, note that we can express the induction hypothesis as follows. Assume for some integer k geq 1, every positive integer of the form ka + lb (where k, l in mathbb{N}) is in S if ka + lb > 2ab. 4. Base Case: - If r + s = 1, then ra + sb = a or b, which belongs to S trivially. 5. Inductive Step: - Assume the hypothesis holds for t = 2k - 1, meaning r + s = 2k - 1 implies ra + sb in S. - We need to prove it for t = 2k + 1. If r + s = 2k + 1, it is clear that r, s geq 2 because r and s must be positive integers. - Suppose r geq 2, then (r-2)a + sb in S by our induction hypothesis. - Set x = (r-2)a + sb, y = z = a. Then, x + y + z = (r-2)a + sb + a + a = ra + sb in S. 6. By mathematical induction, if r + s is an odd integer, then ra + sb in S when r geq 2. Thus r + s = 1 or any odd integer greater than 1 ensures ra + sb in S. 7. Given gcd(a, b) = 1, consider any integer c > 2ab: - We can express c as ra + sb for some integers r and s. Let gcd(a, b) = 1. By the properties of linear combinations, we can write: [ c = ra + sb ] for integers r and s. Thus, we can always find r_0 and s_0 such that: [ ra + sb = r_0 + bt, quad sa - at = s_0 ] for some integer t. 8. Choose t appropriately to ensure the following bounds: - For r_1 = r_0 + t_1b in [0, b) and r_2 = r_0 + t_2b in [b, 2b), where t_1 = t and t_2 = t+1, we derive: [ s_1 = frac{c - r_1a}{b} in left(frac{c - ab}{b}, frac{c}{b}right] ] - Thus, s_1 > a and: [ s_2 = frac{c - r_2a}{b} > frac{c - 2ab}{b} > 0 ] 9. Since left(r_1, s_1right) and left(r_2, s_2right) are positive integers, and r_1 + s_1 = r_2 + s_2 = left(r + b - aright).

We start by examining the given examples of supersquares: [ 7^2 = 49, quad 97^2 = 9409, quad 997^2 = 994009, dots ] These examples suggest a pattern where the number ( B ) is of the form ( 9ldots97 ) (with ( x ) digits of 9 followed by a 7). 2. Let's generalize this pattern. Assume ( B ) has ( x ) digits of 9 followed by a 7. Thus, ( B ) can be written as: [ B = 10^{x+1} - 3 ] This is because ( 10^{x+1} ) gives a 1 followed by ( x+1 ) zeros, and subtracting 3 changes the last digit to 7 and the preceding ( x ) digits to 9. 3.

Notice that (triangle BA_2A_1 sim triangle AXB). Therefore, if ( K ) is the reflection of ( A_2 ) across ( B ), we get ( KP parallel BA_1 ) so (triangle KA_2P sim triangle AXB).

Let ( A_2' = AP cap odot(ABC) ) and ( P' ) be the reflection of ( P ) across ( A_1 ). Observe that ({P, A_2, A_2'}) are collinear in this order, so ({A, P', P}) are collinear in this order. 5. Thus, if ( Q' ) is the isogonal conjugate of ( P' ) with respect to (triangle ABC), then ({A, Q, Q'}) are collinear in this order. But ( Q' in odot(AO) ) so ( Q ) lies strictly inside (odot(AO)). Analogously, ( Q ) lies strictly inside (odot(BO), odot(CO)), which is a contradiction. 6. **Remark:** The lemma implies that the locus of ( P ) for which ( A_2 in odot(ABC) ) is a cubic curve. 7. **Solution 2 (Nine-point conic):** First, we prove the nine points conic (which is the generalization of the nine-points circle) as follows. 8. **Lemma:** [Nine-points conic] The following nine points: - points ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ); - midpoints ( M_A, M_B, M_C ) of ( BC, CA, AB ); and - midpoints ( A', B', C' ) of ( AP, BP, CP ) lie on a conic. 9. **Proof:** Note parallel lines ( M_A B' parallel CP parallel M_B A' ), ( M_A C' parallel M_C A' ), ( M_A M_B parallel AB parallel A' B' ) and ( M_A M_C parallel A' C' ) so translating pencils gives [ M_A(B', C'; M_B, M_C) = A'(M_B, M_C; B', C') = A'(B', C'; M_B, M_C) ] so ( A', B', C', M_A, M_B, M_C ) lie on a conic.

However, if ( A_2 ) lies inside (odot(ABC)), one can check that ( A_2' ) lies inside the region determined by - the extension of ( BA ) beyond ( A ), and - the extension of ( CA ) beyond ( C ) that does not contain (triangle ABC). One can narrow the positions of ( B_2', C_2' ) similarly.

Thus, we consider this option as misunderstood in the standard solution. **B**: Extending line segment AB in the opposite direction to form ray BA is a fundamental geometric construction. A ray can indeed be extended infinitely in one direction. This action does not contradict any geometric principles and is therefore correct. **C**: Finding the midpoint of ray AB is a conceptually flawed idea because a ray, by definition, extends infinitely in one direction. Since it does not have a finite length, it cannot have a midpoint. This statement is correctly identified as incorrect. **D**: Connecting points A and B to make line segment AB pass through point C requires A, B, and C to be collinear. If they are not collinear, it is impossible to make a single line segment that directly connects A and B and also passes through C. This statement is correctly identified as incorrect. Given the analysis, the correct interpretation should focus on the feasibility of each geometric construction: - **A**: Misunderstood in the standard solution but theoretically possible under certain conditions. - **B**: Correct as it adheres to geometric principles. - **C**: Incorrect due to the infinite nature of a ray. - **D**: Incorrect unless A, B, and C are collinear, which is not specified.

Worker C's work rate is 1 job per 20 hours, which is 1/20 of the job per hour. To find the combined work rate, we add the individual work rates together: Combined work rate = (1/10) + (1/15) + (1/20) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator.

Using the complex number representation, we find: [ m = frac{-pa(b + c) - bc(p - a)}{-pa - bc} = frac{p(ab + bc + ca) - abc}{pa + bc} ] Similarly, for ( N ): [ n = frac{q(ab + bc + ca) - abc}{qa + bc} ] 4. **Conjugates of ( M ) and ( N ):** The conjugates are given by: [ overline{m} = frac{frac{1}{p}left(frac{1}{ab} + frac{1}{bc} + frac{1}{ca}right)}{frac{1}{pa} + frac{1}{bc}} = frac{a + b + c - p}{pa + bc} ] [ overline{n} = frac{a + b + c - q}{qa + bc} ] 5. **Perpendicular Lines and Intersection:** Let the perpendicular line to ( OM ) passing through ( P ) intersect (odot(ABC)) at ( T ). Then ( (P, T) ) is symmetric with respect to ( OM ). Thus: [ t = frac{(m - o)overline{p} + overline{m}o - overline{m}m}{overline{m} - overline{o}} = frac{p(ab + bc + ca) - abc}{p(a + b + c) - p^2} ] Similarly, for the perpendicular line to ( ON ) passing through ( Q ) intersecting (odot(ABC)) at ( S ): [ s = frac{q(ab + bc + ca) - abc}{q(a + b + c) - q^2} ] 6. **Equality of ( s ) and ( t ):** To prove that ( s = t ), we need: [ (q - p)[abc(a + b + c) + pq(ab + bc + ca) - abc(p + q)] = 0 ] This is true by equation (1). Thus, the lines through ( P ) perpendicular to ( OM ) and through ( Q ) perpendicular to ( ON ) meet at a point on the circle (odot(ABC)).

Let's analyze this systematically step-by-step. 1. **Median and Mean Conditions:** Since the median of the list (a, b, c, d, e) is 2023 and (a leq b leq c leq d leq e), we have: [ c = 2023. ] Also, since the mean of the list is 2023: [ frac{a + b + c + d + e}{5} = 2023 implies a + b + 2023 + d + e = 5 times 2023 implies a + b + d + e = 4 times 2023. ] 2. **Case Analysis Based on the Frequency of 2023:** **Case 1: 2023 appears 5 times** [ a = b = c = d = e = 2023. ] There is exactly 1 such list. **Case 2: 2023 appears 4 times** The list could be: [ 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, x, ] where (x < 2023) or (x > 2023).

Out of the unionized employees: - 70% are men, so there are 0.70 * 60 = 42 unionized men. Now, we know there are 56 men in total and 42 of them are unionized. Therefore, the number of non-unionized men is: 56 men - 42 unionized men = 14 non-unionized men. Since 60% of the employees are unionized, the remaining 40% are not unionized.

The goal is to determine the total number of cows in 25 years starting from the birth of the first cow. 1. **Identify the sequence pattern**: We can recognize that this problem follows the Fibonacci sequence, which Leonardo Fibonacci introduced.

We are given that the total cost of the ride is 31.15 yuan. Let's set up an equation based on this. If x leq 3 km, there is no need to calculate further as the initial fare covers the cost, but since the total amount of 31.15 yuan exceeds the initial fare, we know that x must be greater than 3 km. There are two cases to consider: 1. If the total distance x is more than 3 but not more than 8 km, then we can calculate the excess fare over the initial 3 km using the rate of 2.15 yuan per km and the fuel surcharge of 1 yuan. 8 + 2.15(x - 3) + 1 = 31.15. 2. If the total distance x is more than 8 km, we need to calculate the fare for the distance from 3 km to 8 km (5 km at the rate of 2.15 yuan per km), and then the fare for the remaining distance at the rate of 2.85 yuan per km, plus the fuel surcharge. 8 + 2.15(5) + 2.85(x - 8) + 1 = 31.15.

When x geq 80, the annual profit y is y = 100x - (101x + frac{8100}{x} - 2180) - 500 = -x - frac{8100}{x} + 1680.

For x geq 80, to find the value of x that maximizes y, we use the fact that the expression -x - frac{8100}{x} is minimized when x = sqrt{8100}, which means the profit is maximized. Setting this up, we have: x = sqrt{8100} Rightarrow x = 90 At x = 90 units, the maximum profit y can be calculated as y = 1680 - (90 + frac{8100}{90}) = 1680 - (90 + 90) = 1500 million yuan.

We'll examine different possible combinations to see which ones can form a triangle. 4. **Combination Analysis:** **Case 1: Three Different Lengths (2^i, 2^j, 2^k) where (i < j < k):** [ 2^i + 2^j leq 2^j + 2^j = 2^{j+1} leq 2^k ] This implies (2^i + 2^j leq 2^k), so they cannot form a triangle. **Case 2: Two Equal and One Different Length, (2^i, 2^i, 2^j) where (i < j):** [ 2^i + 2^i = 2^{i+1} leq 2^j ] This means (2^i + 2^i leq 2^j), so these cannot form a triangle either. 5. **Valid Combinations:** **Case 3: Two Lengths Are the Same, (2^i, 2^j, 2^j) where (i < j):** [ 2^i + 2^j > 2^j quad text{always true since } 2^i > 0 ] [ 2^j + 2^j > 2^i quad text{true since } 2^j geq 2^i ] Therefore, (2^i, 2^j, 2^j) will always form a triangle when (i < j). **Case 4: All Three Lengths Are Equal, (2^k, 2^k, 2^k):** This will form an equilateral triangle. 6. **Counting Valid Combinations:** - **Combination (2^i, 2^j, 2^j):** We have (i < j) and (i, j) ranging from 0 to 1009.

If we assume that the average 15x15 puzzle has 75 words, we can try to estimate the number of words in a 21x21 puzzle by considering the ratio of the total number of squares in each puzzle: A 15x15 puzzle has 15 * 15 = 225 squares. A 21x21 puzzle has 21 * 21 = 441 squares. The ratio of the number of squares in a 21x21 puzzle to a 15x15 puzzle is 441 / 225 ≈ 1.96. If we apply this ratio to the average number of words in a 15x15 puzzle, we can estimate the average number of words in a 21x21 puzzle: 75 words * 1.96 ≈ 147 words per 21x21 puzzle (estimated) So, on days with larger 21x21 square puzzles, the difference in the number of words compared to the standard 15x15 square puzzle would be approximately: 147 words (21x21 puzzle) - 75 words (15x15 puzzle) = 72 additional words (estimated) This is a significant increase in the number of words, almost doubling the average for a boxed{15x15} puzzle. However, this is a rough estimate and the actual number of words can vary based on the specific design and theme of each puzzle."},{"prompt":"Consider the rectangle (ABCD) with an area of 1 square unit.

Since ( i neq j ), ( 2^i + 2^j ) will not overlap with other positions. - This implies the distribution of digits being non-overlapping within the placement pattern. 3. **Sum of digits of the square**: - The sum of digits in ( N^2 ): - ( N^2 ) will have 1's in positions ( 2 cdot 2^i = 2^{i+1} ) for ( i = 0, 1, ldots, 1000 ). - It will also have 2's in positions ( 2^i + 2^j ) for ( i < j ), which varies from combinations taken two at a time from the set ({0, 1, 2, ldots, 1000}). Each combination contributes exactly one 2, and the number of such combinations is (binom{1001}{2} = frac{1001 cdot 1000}{2} = 500500). - Thus, the total number of digits in ( N^2 ) including those produced from self-multiplication would contribute ( 1001 cdot 1 + 500500 cdot 2 ).

Contrary to what the fairy tales say, Snow White is more malevolent than the Evil Queen, and doesn't care about the lives of the seven dwarfs. Therefore, she decided to use them to find out which apple is poisonous. To this end, at the beginning of each day, Snow White prepares some apple salads (each salad is a mixture of pieces of some apples chosen by her), and forces some of the dwarfs (possibly all) to eat a salad each. At the end of the day, she notes who died and who survived, and the next day she again prepares some apple salads, forcing some of the surviving dwarves (possibly all) to eat a salad each. And she continues to do this, day after day, until she discovers the poisoned apple or until all the dwarves die. (a) Prove that there is a strategy in which Snow White manages to discover the poisoned apple after a few days. (b) What is the minimum number of days Snow White needs to find the poisoned apple, no matter how lucky she is?","completion":"1. **Part (a): Proving the Strategy** To prove that there is a strategy for Snow White to discover the poisoned apple, we can use a method inspired by binary search. Here is the detailed strategy: - Suppose there are ( n ) dwarfs available at the beginning of a day. - Snow White divides the remaining apples into ( n+1 ) piles. - Each dwarf is given an apple salad made from one of the ( n ) piles, leaving one pile ignored. - At the end of the day, Snow White observes the outcome: - If a dwarf dies, the poisoned apple is in the pile that the dead dwarf ate from. Snow White discards all other piles. - If no dwarf dies, the poisoned apple is in the ignored pile. Snow White discards all other piles. - This process is repeated with the remaining apples and dwarfs until the poisoned apple is identified. This strategy ensures that the number of apples to be tested is reduced by a factor of ( n+1 ) each day, where ( n ) is the number of dwarfs available. 2. **Part (b): Minimum Number of Days** To determine the minimum number of days required to find the poisoned apple, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario occurs when the dwarfs die one by one, and Snow White has to test the maximum number of apples. - Let ( k ) be the number of days required to find the poisoned apple. - Each day, the number of apples is reduced by a factor of ( n+1 ), where ( n ) is the number of dwarfs available. - In the worst-case scenario, the number of apples is reduced by a factor of 2 each day (since at least one dwarf dies each day). Therefore, the minimum number of days ( k ) can be found by solving the inequality: [ 2^k geq 2021 ] Taking the logarithm base 2 on both sides: [ k geq log_2(2021) ] Calculating the value: [ k geq lceil log_2(2021) rceil ] Using a calculator: [ log_2(2021) approx 10.97 ] Therefore: [ k geq lceil 10.97 rceil = 11 ] Hence, the minimum number of days required to find the poisoned apple in the worst-case scenario is 11 days.

We need to prove that if the relation t_{alpha beta} t_{gamma delta} + t_{beta gamma} t_{delta alpha} = t_{alpha gamma} t_{beta delta} holds, where t_{alpha beta}, etc., represent the lengths of common external or internal tangents to the respective circles, then these circles touch a single circle. 2. **Expansion Technique**: To work towards the conclusion, we will use a technique called “expansion” of circles. Let's assume two circles, say alpha and beta, touch an external circle Sigma externally. 3. **Concentric Circles Concept**: Consider the circles alpha', beta', and Sigma' which are concentric with alpha, beta, and Sigma respectively. Let's assume the radius of Sigma' is greater than that of Sigma by an amount chi and the radii of alpha' and beta' are less than those of alpha and beta by the same amount chi (where chi is sufficiently small). Then alpha' and beta' will touch Sigma' externally, and the common external tangent t_{alpha' beta'} will be equal to t_{alpha beta}. 4. **Internal Touch Case**: We must also consider the scenario where alpha and beta touch Sigma internally. In each setup, we determine how changes in the radii by chi influence the arrangement and points of tangency. 5. **Special Case Handling**: To proceed with clarity, we examine a case where only segments of common external tangents appear in the equality. Notice that none of the circles can be completely inside another. 6. **Transformation to Various Radius and Radius-zero**: Suppose the radius of one circle, say alpha, is the smallest. Then we transform alpha' into a point (a circle with zero radius), and the other circles reduce their radii by r_{alpha}. 7. **Existence of Two External Tangents**: Using the theorem mentioned, if we have three circles beta', gamma', and delta' such that none are inside each other, then there exist precisely two circles Sigma_1 and Sigma_2 each tangent to beta', gamma', and delta' in the same manner. 8. **Equal Constant Ratio on Conjunctions**: Consider points alpha_1 and alpha_2 on Sigma_1 and Sigma_2 such that: frac{t_{alpha_1beta'}}{t_{alpha_1delta'}} = frac{t_{alpha_2beta'}}{t_{alpha_2delta'}} = frac{t_{alpha'beta'}}{t_{alpha'delta'}} = lambda Ensure alpha_1 and alpha_2 are on arcs not containing the points of tangency with gamma'. 9. **Verification for Ratios**: For the quadruples left(alpha'beta'gamma'delta'right), left(alpha_1 beta' gamma' delta'right), and left( alpha_2 beta' gamma' delta'right), the equality: frac{t_{alpha_1 beta'}}{t_{alpha_1 gamma'}} = frac{t_{alpha_2 beta'}}{t_{alpha_2 gamma'}} = frac{t_{alpha' beta'}}{t_{alpha' gamma'}} = mu holds. 10. **Conclusion and Single Circle Tangency**: The geometric places for points satisfying the ratios lambda and mu with respect to two fixed circles are themselves a circle. Therefore, points alpha', alpha_1, and alpha_2 coinciding indicate that Sigma_1 or Sigma_2 is tangent to all circles alpha', beta', gamma', and delta'. Expansion by compensating r_alpha ensures alpha, beta, gamma, and delta touch a single circle. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"f the function f(x) = x^{3} 3x + m has exactly one real root, then the range of real numbers for m is ______.","completion":"Firstly, we find the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = 3x^{2} - 3.

Analyzing the sign of f'(x), for x < -1 or x > 1, we have f'(x) > 0; when -1 < x < 1, we have f'(x) < 0. At x = -1, f(x) attains a local maximum: f(-1) = (-1)^{3} - 3(-1) + m = 2 + m.

This is because the central angle of the decagon is ( frac{360^{circ}}{10} = 36^{circ} ), and any triangle formed must have angles that are multiples of this base angle. 3. **Determine combinations of vertices:** We aim to find how many distinct triangles can be formed by connecting three vertices of the decagon such that the triangles are not similar to each other.

For example, (10, 11, 12, ldots, 19). The sums of the digits of these numbers form another sequence of 10 consecutive numbers. That is, the sum of the digits of (10) through (19) are, respectively, (1, 2, 3, ldots, 10). 2. **Observing Recall Frequency:** Within any set of 10 consecutive sums, exactly two of them are divisible by 5. This is a consequence of the pigeonhole principle, which ensures that in any sequence of 10 consecutive numbers, two will have a remainder of zero when divided by 5. 3. **Range Breakdown:** Numbers from (1) to (1997) can be broken down into groups similar to (0) to (1999). This provides a cleaner set of arithmetic without materially changing the problem. Therefore, include the extremal values to consider numbers from (0) to (1999).

Draw two lines through point ( O ), parallel to the diagonals of the square, intersecting the sides of the square at points ( C_1, C_2, C_3, ) and ( C_4 ). Let's assume the side length of the square is ( 2a ). The positions ( C_1, C_2, C_3, ) and ( C_4 ) are the midpoints of the sides. 5. The lines divide the square into four equal right-angled isosceles triangles. If the wolf tries to move to any triangle, the distance from the center ( O ) to any point on these lines is the same due to symmetry. 6. For the dogs to always trap the wolf, they need to be positioned strategically such that their combined speeds and positions cover enough ground to intercept the wolf. 7. The critical observation here is that the maximum distance from ( O ) to ( C_i ) (where ( i = 1,2,3,4 )) is the maximum diagonal of half the square, which is ( frac{a sqrt{2}}{2} ), but not more than the speed at which the dogs can move. 8. Since (frac{a sqrt{2}}{2} < asqrt{2} ), and knowing that ( a sqrt{2} ) is the exact distance a dog can cover given at their speed, we observe: [ a sqrt{2}v text{ (maximum distance)} < frac{3}{2}av text{ (dog's maximum speed)} ] This inequality shows that the dogs can intercept the wolf within the given speed proportions. 9.

Each midpoint of the polygon's sides is extended to create a straight cut of length 1.

Let this circle be denoted as circle S. - By connecting O to K and O to L, you form the right triangles triangle OKB and triangle OLB. 3. **Intersection Argument**: - Consider the cuts at K and L: if the cut at K lies to the right of OK and the cut at L lies to the left of OL, then these two cuts must intersect. - The intersection point will lie within the region of the circle S. 4. **Contradiction and Geometry**: - Assume for contradiction that all cuts are either parallel or do not intersect within the circle S. - If the cuts extended at K and L are parallel and never intersect, then one must show that the angles must contradict this assumption. 5. **Angle Argument**: - When cuts are made at midpoints K and L, they form two corresponding angles alpha and beta which are associated with the intersection points on circle S. - By further extending this logic, if every adjacent pair of cuts are considered in this manner around the polygon, one would obtain: alpha < beta < gamma < cdots < varphi < alpha - This creates a cyclic chain of inequalities, which is a contradiction in a clockwise or counterclockwise traversal. - Hence, at least one pair of adjacent cuts must intersect within the circle S. 6. **Final Conclusion**: - As a result, two such cuts must necessarily intersect within the bounded region of the polygon inscribed in the circle S. - This guarantees that there is a piece that can be separated from the cake by the straight cuts. # Conclusion: The geometric construction and angle contradiction arguments ensure that a piece can always be cut from the cake through the described method.

In this case, the edges will be directed such that ( v_1 rightarrow v_2 ), ( v_3 rightarrow v_2 ), ..., ( v_5 rightarrow v_4 ), etc. Let's label the vertices as ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_n ) such that ( v_1 rightarrow v_2 ). We consider another vertex ( w ) not in the path. - If ( v_n rightarrow w ), we extend the path: ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_n, w ). This contradicts the assumption that ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_n ) was the longest path. - If ( w rightarrow v_n ), form the new path ( w, v_n, v_{n-1}, ldots, v_1 ) which again contradicts the original claim for the longest path. Hence, if there exists such a ( w ), we can always extend the path, contradicting the maximality of the path.

The vertices are labeled ( v_1 rightarrow v_2 rightarrow cdots rightarrow v_n ). Since the total number of vertices is 1000, which is even, there are vertices ( w_1, w_2 ), not in the path. - If either ( w_1 rightarrow v_n ), extend the path by appending ( w_1 ), contradicting our longest path assumption. - If ( v_n rightarrow w_1 ) and similarly ( v_n rightarrow w_2 ). - If ( v_{n-1} rightarrow w_1 ), extend the path: ( v_1 rightarrow v_2 rightarrow cdots rightarrow v_{n-1} rightarrow w_1 rightarrow v_n ). So, ( w_1 rightarrow v_{n-1} rightarrow w_2 rightarrow v_n ), which can also be similarly contradicted for ( w_2 ). Now if ( v_1 rightarrow v_{n-1} ), and if ( w_1 rightarrow w_2 ), extend to ( w_2, w_1, v_{n-1}, v_{n-2}, ldots, v_1 ).

This means ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ). 2. **Substitute ( x = frac{yz}{4} ):** From the equality condition, we have: [ yz = x^2 + xy + xz = 4x ] Substituting ( x = frac{yz}{4} ) into ( x + y + z = 4 ), we get: [ y = frac{16 - 4z}{z + 4} ] and [ x = frac{(4 - z)z}{z + 4} ] 3. **Rational Solutions:** If ( z ) is a positive rational number smaller than 4, then ( x ) and ( y ) must also be rational. This proves the existence of infinitely many triples ( (x, y, z) ) of positive rational numbers that satisfy ( 16xyz = (x + y)^2 (x + z)^2 ) and ( x + y + z = 4 ).

Since 20 = 2^2 cdot 5 and 30 = 2 cdot 3 cdot 5, the LCM of 20 and 30 is 2^2 cdot 3 cdot 5 = 60. This means an integer is a multiple of both 20 and 30 if and only if it is a multiple of 60.

Therefore, if one of the base angles is 50^{circ}, the other base angle must also be 50^{circ}. 2. **When the 50^{circ} angle is the vertex angle:** In this scenario, the two base angles are equal to each other, and we use the triangle angle sum theorem, which states that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180^{circ}.

This implies 2alpha in (0, pi), and thus sin 2alpha > 0. - For cos 2alpha, we use the double angle formula: cos 2alpha = 2cos^2alpha - 1 = 2left(frac{sqrt{5}}{5}right)^2 - 1 = frac{2}{5} - 1 = -frac{3}{5}. - For sin 2alpha, since sin^2 2alpha = 1 - cos^2 2alpha, we find: sin 2alpha = sqrt{1 - cos^2 2alpha} = sqrt{1 - left(-frac{3}{5}right)^2} = sqrt{1 - frac{9}{25}} = sqrt{frac{16}{25}} = frac{4}{5}.

However, considering the range of alpha and the given condition, alpha + beta in (pi, frac{3pi}{2}). - The cosine of alpha + beta can be found using the Pythagorean identity, leading to cos(alpha + beta) = -sqrt{1 - sin^2(alpha + beta)} = -sqrt{1 - left(-frac{sqrt{2}}{10}right)^2} = -frac{7sqrt{2}}{10}. - For cos(3alpha + beta), using the angle sum formula: cos(3alpha + beta) = cos(alpha + beta + 2alpha) = cos(alpha + beta)cos(2alpha) - sin(alpha + beta)sin(2alpha) = left(-frac{7sqrt{2}}{10}right)left(-frac{3}{5}right) + left(-frac{sqrt{2}}{10}right)left(frac{4}{5}right) = frac{21sqrt{2}}{50} - frac{4sqrt{2}}{50} = frac{17sqrt{2}}{50}.

Let's consider two points A and B of the same color (say, the first color), separated by a distance d. 2. **Parallel Lines Construction**: Draw two lines L_1 and L_2 parallel to AB at a distance of frac{2}{d} from AB. Clearly, L_1 and L_2 do not contain any points of the first color, as any points on L_1 and L_2 would be in different colors (either second or third color). 3. **Existence of Monochromatic Line**: We must now show that on the plane, there's a monochromatic line, meaning a line with all points in the same color. If L_1 and L_2 are not monochromatic, then points on these lines, separated by frac{d}{2}, must be of different colors. Consequently, points separated by d on the lines L_1 and L_2 must be of the same color. Therefore, the line AB must not contain any points of the second and third colors, making it a monochromatic line. 4. **Identification of Monochromatic Line**: Hence, a monochromatic line L must exist (consider it to be of the first color). If the mentioned line exists, it implies there's no other point of the first color on the entire plane except on this line. 5. **Choosing Points on Plane**: Consider any two points X and Y of the same second color such that XY is parallel to L.

Consider triangle (triangle A C_1 D_1) within the pentagon. Suppose all integral points in (triangle A C_1 D_1) except for (A) are on the line segment (C_1 D_1). In reality, if there is indeed another integral point (K) inside this triangle, then pentagon (K B C D E) would have a smaller area than (S). This newer smaller pentagon also lies within pentagon (A_1 B_1 C_1 D_1 E_1), contradicting our assumption that (S) is the smallest. Next, let's analyze the smallest area among triangles formed by picking three vertices of the pentagon: (triangle A B C), (triangle B C D), (triangle C D E), (triangle D E A), and (triangle E A B). Suppose (triangle A B C) has the smallest area. Let's consider the distance from point (A) to line segment (B C). It is not greater than the distance from point (D) to segment (B C); similarly, the distance from point (C) to segment (A B) is not greater than the distance from point (E) to segment (A B). Examine the point (O), which makes quadrilateral (A B C O) a parallelogram. Clearly, (O) is an integral point. It is not difficult to show that point (O) lies within (triangle A B_1 C), and by the previously proven proposition, point (O) must reside within pentagon (A_1 B_1 C_1 D_1 E_1). Hence, this scenario contradicts the assumption. Thus, there must be at least one integral point within or on the boundary of the pentagon (A B C D E).

Now, plug in ( f(1) = 0 ), [ f'(x) = frac{1}{x} lim_{k to 0} frac{f(1 + k)}{k} ] Let ( C_1 = lim_{k to 0} frac{f(1 + k)}{k} = f'(1) ) (the derivative at 1), [ f'(x) = frac{C_1}{x} ] 4. **Integrating to Find ( f(x) )**: Integrate both sides with respect to ( x ), [ int f'(x) , dx = int frac{C_1}{x} , dx ] [ f(x) = C_1 ln x + C_2 ] where ( C_2 ) is the constant of integration. 5. **Determining the Constants**: Using the condition ( f(1) = 0 ), [ f(1) = C_1 ln 1 + C_2 = 0 implies C_2 = 0 ] Using the condition ( f(a) = 1 ), [ f(a) = C_1 ln a = 1 ] Hence, [ C_1 = frac{1}{ln a} ] 6. **Final Form of the Function**: Thus, substituting ( C_1 ) back into the expression for ( f(x) ), [ f(x) = frac{ln x}{ln a} = log_a x ] 7. **Verification**: Verify that ( f(x) = log_a x ) satisfies the original function equation: [ f(xy) = log_a (xy) = log_a x + log_a y = f(x) + f(y) ] which confirms that ( f(x) = log_a x ) is indeed a solution.

We can write it as: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} xi_{n} = lim_{n to infty} sum_{i=1}^{n} xi_{i}. ] Substituting the expression for xi_{n}, we get: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} xi_{i} = sum_{i=1}^{n} left(n I(nU leqslant 1) - (n-1) I((n-1)U leqslant 1)right). ] Since this expression simplifies based on the indicator functions, we recognize the impact of U within the range. 3. **Probability Analysis**: When considering the probability P(nU leqslant 1): [ P(nU leqslant 1) = Pleft(U leqslant frac{1}{n}right) = frac{1}{n}, ] Similarly, P((n-1)U leqslant 1) = frac{1}{n-1} for n > 1. 4. **Expected Value of sum_{n=1}^{infty} xi_{n}**: Considering the infinite sum behavior, as n becomes very large, observe: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} xi_{n} = lim_{n to infty} n I(n U leqslant 1). ] Given that I(n U leqslant 1) is almost surely 0 for large enough n, because P(nU leqslant 1) to 0, we have: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} xi_{n} = 0 quad text{(with probability 1)}. ] Hence, [ mathrm{E} sum_{n=1}^{infty} xi_{n} = 0. ] 5. **Expected Value of Individual xi_{n}**: Calculate the expected value mathrm{E} xi_{n}: [ mathrm{E} xi_{n} = n mathrm{E} I(n U leqslant 1) - (n-1) mathrm{E} I((n-1) U leqslant 1). ] Using the probability interpretations: [ mathrm{E} xi_{n} = n cdot frac{1}{n} - (n-1) cdot frac{1}{n-1} = 1 - 1 = 0. ] 6. **Sum of Expected Values**: Summing up the expected values: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} mathrm{E} xi_{n} = sum_{n=1}^{infty} 0 = 0. ] In conclusion, we have: [ mathrm{E} sum_{n=1}^{infty} xi_{n} = 0 quad text{and} quad sum_{n=1}^{infty} mathrm{E} xi_{n} = 0. ] However, due to the divergence behavior for certain constructs, ensure: [ mathrm{E} sum_{n=1}^{infty} xi_{n} neq sum_{n=1}^{infty} mathrm{E} xi_{n} (unusual sample space manipulations) Conclusion: boxed{mathrm{E} sum_{n=1}^{infty} xi_{n} neq sum_{n=1}^{infty} mathrm{E} xi_{n}}"},{"prompt":"Using equallength toothpicks to form the rectangular shape shown in the diagram, if the length of the rectangle is equivalent to 20 toothpicks and the width is equivalent to 10 toothpicks, how many toothpicks are used?

Break down the factors by combining 3 with either 19 or 37: - 3 cdot 19 = 57 (two-digit number) - 3 cdot 37 = 111 (not a two-digit number) Therefore, the only possible arrangement which involves 57 could be considered. 3. With 57 as one factor, find the other number such that 57 cdot x = 2109: [ x = frac{2109}{57} = 37 ] So, (57, 37) form a pair of two-digit numbers which multiply to 2109, but 37 is not originally a two-digit factor from the broken down primes.

Therefore, y_1y_2=-4 and since N(-1,0), we have k_{NA}+k_{NB}= frac{y_1}{x_1+1}+ frac{y_2}{x_2+1}= frac{4y_1}{y_1^2+4}+ frac{4y_2}{y_2^2+4} = frac{4[y_1(y_2^2+4)+y_2(y_1^2+4)]}{(y_1^2+4)(y_2^2+4)}= frac{4(-4y_2+4y_1-4y_1+4y_2)}{(y_1^2+4)(y_2^2+4)}=0. Also, when l is perpendicular to the x-axis, points A and B are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, obviously k_{NA}+k_{NB}=0, k_{NA}=-k_{NB}. In summary, k_{NA}+k_{NB}=0, k_{NA}=-k_{NB}. (Ⅱ) The area of triangle ANB is S_{triangle ANB}=|y_1-y_2|= sqrt{(y_1+y_2)^2-4y_1y_2}= sqrt{4(x_1+x_2)+8} =4 sqrt{1+ frac{1}{k^2}}>4. When l is perpendicular to the x-axis, S_{triangle ANB}=4. Therefore, the minimum value of the area of triangle ANB is boxed{4}. (Ⅲ) Conjecture: ① k_{NA}=-k_{NB}; ② The minimum value of the area of triangle ANB is boxed{4m sqrt{m}}."},{"prompt":"w many integers between 600 and 800 have the sum of their digits equal to 18?","completion":"We need to consider two cases based on the hundreds digit: **Case 1: When the hundreds digit is 6**, the sum of the tens and unit digits must be 18 - 6 = 12. The possible combinations of forming 12 can be calculated: - 2+10 (Not valid as tens digit needs to be between 0 and 9) - 3+9 gives one solution (690) - 4+8 gives two solutions (680, 648) - 5+7 gives two solutions (670, 657) - 6+6 gives one solution (660) From these, we have a total of 6 valid choices for this case. **Case 2: When the hundreds digit is 7**, the sum of the tens and unit digits must be 18 - 7 = 11. The possible combinations are: - 2+9 gives one solution (790) - 3+8 gives two solutions (780, 738) - 4+7 gives two solutions (770, 747) - 5+6 gives two solutions (760, 756) From these, we have a total of 7 valid choices for this case.

This concept states that if a point P has coordinates (x, y), then its symmetric point P' with respect to the origin O(0,0) will have coordinates (-x, -y). Given the point P(1, -2), we apply this principle directly to find its symmetric point with respect to the origin. Thus, we have: - The x-coordinate of P is 1, so the x-coordinate of the symmetric point is -1. - The y-coordinate of P is -2, so the y-coordinate of the symmetric point is 2. Therefore, the coordinates of the point P with respect to the origin are boxed{(-1, 2)}."},{"prompt":"The lengths of the three sides a, b, c of a triangle satisfy the equation frac{c^{2}}{a+b}+frac{a^{2}}{b+c}=b. What is the measure of the angle B opposite the side of length b?","completion":"1. The given equation for the sides of the triangle is: [ frac{c^{2}}{a+b} + frac{a^{2}}{b+c} = b ] 2. Transform the given equation into a more usable form: [ left( frac{c^{2}}{a+b} + c right) + left( frac{a^{2}}{b+c} + a right) = b + a + c ] 3. Factor out common terms to simplify: [ frac{c(c + (a+b))}{a+b} + frac{a(a + (b+c))}{b+c} = a + b + c ] This simplifies to: [ frac{c(a+b+c)}{a+b} + frac{a(a+b+c)}{b+c} = a + b + c ] 4. Divide both sides by (a + b + c): [ frac{c}{a+b} + frac{a}{b+c} = 1 ] 5. Using the condition derived, reformulate the equation: [ c(b+c) + a(a+b) = (a+b)(b+c) ] Expanding both sides: [ cb + c^2 + a^2 + ab = ab + ac + b^2 + bc ] 6. Simplify the equation: [ c^2 + a^2 - ac = b^2 ] 7. Using the law of cosines: [ b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac cos B ] We substitute the value from step 6: [ a^2 + c^2 - ac = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac cos B ] 8. By matching both sides, we find: [ -ac = -2ac cos B ] Hence, solving for (cos B): [ cos B = frac{1}{2} ] 9.
