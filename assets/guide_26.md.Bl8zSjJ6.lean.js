Böbrekler, idrar miktarını azaltarak ya da çoğaltarak vücudun su miktarını dengede tutar. Böbreklerde idrar oluşumu üç aşamada gerçekleşir. Bunlar; ➢ filtrasyon (süzülme), ➢ reabsorpsiyon (geri emilim), ➢ sekresyon (salınım)dır. İDRAR OLUŞUMU Üreterlerin görevi; oluşan idrarı her iki böbrek pelvisinden alarak mesaneye götürmektir. Mesane, böbreklerde oluşan idrarın, üreterler aracılığıyla boşaltıldığı ve depolandığı organdır. Üretra , idrarı mesaneden vücut dışına ulaştıran iki ucu açık tüp biçimindeki kanaldır. FİZİK MUAYENE VE TANI YÖNTEMLERİ • Üriner sistem özellikle böbrek hastalıkları bütün bedeni etkilediğinden hastanın tepeden tırnağa değerlendirilmesi yapılır. • Üriner sistem işlevleri ve bulguları hakkında konuşmak bireylerde rahatsızlık ve utanma nedeniyle güç olabileceğinden sağlık öyküsü almada hemşirenin iletişim becerileri önemlidir. Sağlık öyküsü İNSPEKSİYON DERİ: Solukluk, sarı-gri görünüm, üremik kristaller, kaşıntı, turgor, kuruluk, kalınlaşma, morarma AĞIZ: Somatit, ağızda aseton kokusu TIRNAKLAR: Tırnak yatağında birden fazla yatay beyaz çizgi KİLO: Ödeme bağlı kilo artışı YÜZ,KARIN,EKSTREMİTELER: Yaygın yada periferal ödem, mesanede gerginlik, böbrek kitlesinin artışı GENEL SAĞLIK DURUMU: Yorgunluk, laterji, dikkat azalması PALPASYON BÖBREKLER: Böbreklerin büyüklüğü ve hareketliliği değerlendirilir. Sırtüstü yatar pozisyonda iki elle yapılır. Hidronefroz, polikistik böbrek , böbrek tümörleri ve hassasiyetin arttığı alanlar değerlendirilir. MESANE: Göbeğin üst orta çizgisinden başlayıp, aşağıya doğru palpe edilir. İdrar yaptıktan sonra mesane palpasyonu ile rezidü idrar kontrolü yapılır. Miksiyon sonrası palpasyonla herhangi bir şey hissedilmemesi tam boşaldığının göstergesidir. PERKÜSYON • Böbrek ve retroperitoneal bölgede ağrı, hassasiyet ve aşırı sıvı birikimi değerlendirilir. BÖBREKLER OSKÜLTASYON Abdominal aorta ve böbrek arterlerindeki kan akımı hızı değişiklikleri değerlendirilir. KARIN ÖN DUVARI, RETROPERİTONEL BÖLGE Artan sıvı hacmi değerlendirilir. KALP VE AKCİĞERLER Tanı Yöntemleri İdrar İncelemeleri İdrarın Makroskopik İncelemesi İdrar miktarı İdrarın görünümü İdrarın kokusu İdrarın rengi İdrar dansitesi İdrarın reaksiyonu İdrarın Mikroskopik İncelemesi Glikoz Eritrosit Lökosit Protein Silendir Epitel Kristal Etken olan mikroorganizmayı saptamak amacıyla yapılır. İdrar Kültürü Fazla su alınmasıyla idrar dansitesinin düşmesi esasına dayanır. Dilüsyon Testi Vücudun kas ve protein yıkım ürünlerinin böbreklerin glomerül filtrasyon hızına bağlı olarak temizlenebilme yeteneğinin değerlendirilmesi amacıyla incelenmesidir. Normal değer, 85-135 ml/dakikadır. Kreatinin Klirensi İdrar yaptıktan sonra mesanede kalan idrar miktarının belirlenmesi için yapılır Rezidüel İdrar Testi Böbrek Fonksiyon Testleri Böbrek hastalığının ciddiyetini ve hastalığın klinik durumundaki gelişmeleri değerlendirmek için yapılır. ➢Renal kan akımı ölçülmesi ➢Glomerül filtrasyon hızı (GFH) tayini ➢Tubülar fonksiyonların belirlenmesi (reabsorbsiyon ve sekresyon) ➢Renal plazma akımı ölçülmesidir. Kan İncelemeleri BUN Kan Üre Nitrojen, kandaki kimyasal atık olan üre nitrojen miktarını gösterir.(ND:5-25 mg/dl) KREATİNİN Kas metabolizması atık ürünüdür.(ND:0.6-1.2mg/dl) Ürik asit (Erkekte: 2,1-8,5 mg/dl, kadında: 2,0-6,6 mg/dl) Sodyum (135-145 meq/litre) Potasyum (3,5-5,0 meq/litre) Kalsiyum (9-10,5 mg/dl) Fosfat (1,8-2,6 meq/litre) Bikarbonat (24-30 meq/litre) Klor (100-110 meq/litre) Protein (6-8,5 g/dl) Radyolojik İncelemeler Direkt Radyografik İncelemeler: Böbreklerin lokalizasyonu ve büyüklüğü değerlendirilir. Üriner sistem taşlarının saptanmasında ve değerlendirilmesinde direkt radyografiler önemlidir. DÜS (Direkt Üriner Sistem) Grafisi: Böbrekler ve idrar yollarının özellikle incelendiği bir tetkiktir. İntravenöz Piyelografi (IVP): İntravenöz kontrast madde uygulamasının ardından belirli aralıklarla yatarak direkt karın grafisi çekilerek yapılır. Böbreklerin boyutları, şekli, anomalileri, fonksiyonu, obstrüksiyon, hidronefroz, taş ve kitle konusunda bilgi sağlar. Retrograd Piyelografi : Sistoskopi sırasında kontrast maddenin doğrudan üreterlere enjeksiyonu ile gerçekleştirilir. Bu yöntem özellikle intravenöz piyelografide görüntüye girmeyen böbrekte, üreter ya da renal pelvisteki tıkayıcı lezyonların tanımlanmasında yararlıdır. Retrograd Sistografi: Kontrast maddenin direkt mesaneye verilmesi ve kontrast madde ile doldurulan mesanenin radyografik incelenmesidir. Miksiyon Sistoüretrografi: Mesaneye kateter yolu ile verilen kontrast maddenin gidişini takiben floroskopik gözlem altında mesane, üreterler ve idrar yapılırken üretranın görüntülenmesine yönelik yapılan incelemedir. Renal Anjiyografi : Femoral arterden kateter ile girilerek opak maddenin verilmesi ile böbrek damarlarının görüntülenmesidir. Böbrek Sintigrafisi: IV yolla verilen radyoopak maddenin böbrek damarlarına ulaşması ve böbrek dokusunda tutulumu izlenerek böbrek perfüzyonu ve böbrek işlevlerinin değerlendirilmesi amacıyla yapılır. Endoskopik İncelemeler Sistoskopi Ucunda optik gözü bulunan ışıklı bir sistoskop aracılığıyla üreterden mesaneye girilerek taş, tümör, ülser ve hematüriye neden olan patolojilerin görüntülenmesi, idrar örneği, biyopsi materyali alınması gibi tanı amaçlı olarak ya da taş, tümör ve yabancı maddelerin çıkarılması, radyoizotop yerleştirilmesi, üreterlerin genişletilmesi gibi tedavi amacıyla uygulanır. Ultrasonografi Non-invazif olması ve kontrast riski olmaması nedeni ile daha çok kullanılmaktadır. Böbrek boyutlarının, renal parankimin ve pelvikaliksiyel sistemin değerlendirmesi yapılabilir. Kistik renal hastalıkların tanı ve izleminde yararlıdır. Doppler tekniğiyle de renal akım değerlendirilebilir. Böbrek Biyopsisi Böbrek hastalıklarının kesin tanısı böbrek biyopsisi ve histopatolojik inceleme ile konulabilir. Üriner Sistem Hastalıklarında Genel Belirtiler •Ateş, •Halsizlik •Kilo kaybı gibi genel hastalık belirtilerinden başka ürolojik hastalıklarda gözlenen •Ağrı, •Poliüri, •Noktüri, •Dizüri, •Pollaküri , •Hematüri, •Ödem, •Hipertansiyon, •İdrarda renk değişikliği, •Oligüri, •Anüri, •Üremik semptomlar •Batında kitle hissetmesi gibi belirtiler vardır. •proteinüri, •sıvı-elektrolit, asit-baz metabolizması bozuklukları, •piyüri de görülür. ALT ÜRİNER SİSTEM ENFEKSİYONLARI Sistit ✓Sistit, mesanenin iltihaplanmasıdır. ✓Genellikle bir enfeksiyon ajanının idrarda çoğalıp mesane duvarını enfekte etmesi sonucu görülür. ✓Zamanında tedavi edilmezse enfeksiyon yayılabilir, böbrekleri de etkileyerek pyelonefrite neden olabilir ve böbreklerde kalıcı hasarlar oluşturabilir. ❖Kadın üretrasının daha kısa olması ve üretranın rektuma yakın olması nedeniyle kadınlarda erkeklerden daha sık görülür. Cinsel ilişki, idrar yolundan yapılan müdahaleler, doğum, nörolojik problemler, mesanede taş veya herhangi bir yabancı cisim varlığı, su tüketiminin az olması ve mesanenin enfeksiyon ajanlarına karşı biyolojik savunma bariyerlerinin yetersiz olduğu durumlar. Nedenleri • Çok sık idrara çıkma • Disüri • Sıkışma şeklinde idrar kaçırma • Acil idrara çıkma hissi • Noktüri • Karnın alt kısmında ağrı • Hematüri • Nadiren yüksek ateş • İdrarın bulanık ve kötü kokulu olması Belirtiler ▪ Tanı için genellikle idrar ve kan tahlilleri yeterli olur. ▪ İdrar kültürü ile enfeksiyona sebep olan mikroorganizma saptanarak tanı konur. ▪ Kronik olgularda sistoskopik tetkikler uygulanabilir. Tanı Yöntemleri • Tıbbi tedavi yapılır. Hastaya antibiyotik verilir. Hastanın bol su içmesi önerilir. Tedavi ve Hemşirelik Bakımı • Hemşire, hastanın yaşam bulgularını takip eder. • İlaçlarını zamanında ve uygun dozda kullanması gerektiğini açıklar • Hastanın hastalığı ile ilgili bilmesi gereken konularda eğitim verir. • Sistit geçiren birey idrarı geldiğinde tutmamalı, tuvalete boşaltmalıdır. • Perine temizliğini önden arkaya yapmalıdır. • Sık sistit geçiren bireyler ayakta duş almalı, küveti doldurarak yıkanmamalıdır. • Pamuklu çamaşır ve rahat giysiler kullanılmalıdır. • Üriner bölgeye sıcak su torbası/ped uygulanması ya da ılık duş alma hastanın rahatlamasını sağlar. • Hemşire, hastaya semptomlar kaybolsa bile ilaçlarını düzenli kullanmasının önemini anlatmalıdır. • Mesaneyi irrite edecek besinler tüketilmemelidir. ÜRİNER İNKONTİNANS Kişide sosyal ve hijyenik sorunlara neden olan, objektif olarak saptanabilen, istemsiz idrar kaçırma olayıdır. Kadınlarda daha sık görülmektedir. o Gebelik o Menapoz o Genitoüriner ameliyatlar o Pelvik kas zayıflığı o Hareketsizlik o DM o İnme o Üriner sistemde yaşlanmaya bağlı değişimler o Aşırı fiziksel aktivite o İlaçlar Risk Faktörleri Urge (Sıkışma) Tipi Üriner İnkontinans: En sık görülen üriner inkontinans tipidir. Ani gelen sıkışma hissi ile idrar kaçırmadır. Az miktarda idrar kaçırma olabileceği gibi tüm mesane de boşalabilir. Stres Tipi Üriner İnkontinans: Yaşlı kadınlarda üriner inkontinansın en sık ikinci nedenidir. Sfinkterdeki hafif bir zayıflık durumunda karın içi basınç arttığı zaman (öksürük, egzersiz, efor, hapşırma gibi) idrar kaçırmadır. Östrojen eksikliği, daha önceki pelvik cerrahi veya sık vajinal doğumla ilişkilidir. Miks Tip Üriner İnkontinans: Sıkışma ve stres inkontinans yakınmalarının birlikte görüldüğü durumlardır. İNKONTİNANS TİPLERİ Taşma (Overflow) Tipi Üriner İnkontinans: Boşalamayan mesanenin maksimum kapasitede dolup damlama tarzında idrar kaçırmanın olduğu üriner inkontinans tipidir. Fonksiyonel Tip Üriner İnkontinans: Hastaların kontrolleri dışında zamanında tuvalete ulaşamamasına bağlı olarak ortaya çıkan idrar kaçırmadır. Depresyon, demans, mobilite problemleri, tuvalete uzak odada bulunma gibi birçok durum buna neden olabilir. Genellikle bakımevi ve hastanede kalan hastalarda sık görülen üriner inkontinans tipidir. Üriner inkontinans için temel değerlendirme öykü ile başlar. Anamnez sonrası sırayla fizik muayene, idrar tetkiki, rezidü idrar tayini (PVR) ve mümkünse 2-3 günlük mesane günlüğü tutulmalıdır. Laboratuvar tetkiklerinden ise glikoz, renal fonksiyonlar ve elektrolitler, tam idrar tahlili ve idrar kültürü öncelikle istenmelidir TANI Tedavi üriner inkontinans tipine göre planlanmalıdır. Geçici inkontinans düşünülüyorsa altta yatan nedenler mutlaka tedavi edilmelidir. TEDAVİ ÜRİNER RETANSİYON İşeyememe veya işeme sonunda mesanenin tam olarak boşaltılamamasıdır. 60 yaş üzerinde sık rastlanır. DM, prostat büyümesi, üretra patolojileri, travma, gebelik vb durumlar sonucu gelişebilir. Tedavide amaç belirti bulguların giderilmesi, retansiyon ve aşırı distansiyonun zararlı etkilerinin önlenmesi ve tedavi edilmesidir. o Önerilen miktar ve zamanda sıvı alın o Saat 16 sonrası diüretik kullanmayın o Mesane iritasyonuna neden olan maddeler almayın o Konstipe olmayın o Düzenli işeme periyodu oluşturun o Pelvik taban egzersizi yapın o Sigara kullanmayın ÖNERİLER NÖROJENİK MESANE Nörolojik sistemdeki bir lezyona bağlı olarak mesaneyi inverve eden sinirlerin etkilenmesi sonucu gelişen işlev bozukluğudur. Spastik (refleks) mesane- atonik (gevşek) mesane görülür. Spastik mesane: Üst motor nöron lezyonuna bağlı olarak mesanenin dolması sırasında basınç artışı veya aşırı refleks kontraksiyonlar olur. Mesanede rezidüel idrar kalır. Atonik mesane: Üst motor nöron lezyonuna bağlı mesane dolarken herhangi bir basınç artışı olmaz, hasta işemek istediğinde mesane kasılmaz. Mesanede fazla miktarda rezidüel idrar kalır. Tanı: Ürodinami testleri ile konulur. En yaygın komplikasyonu enfeksiyondur. Cerrahi tedavi gerekebilir. Böbreğin Anatomik Bozuklukları Anatomik bozukluklara, kromozom anomalileri, gebelikte alınan bazı ilaçlar, gebelikte geçirilen enfeksiyon hastalıkları ve kalıtım neden olabilir. Böbreğin anatomik bozukluklarından toplumda en sık görüleni polikistik böbrektir. Polikistik Böbrek • Böbreklerde çok sayıda kist bulunması halidir. • Bu kistler iyi huyludur ve çok fazla olmadığında böbreğe zarar vermez. • Ancak kistlerin çokluğu böbrek dokusunda basınç oluşturur ve böbrek dokusunun yerini alır. • Bunun sonucunda böbrek fonksiyonları bozularak yetmezlik gelişir. Hastalığın kesin nedeni bilinmemekle beraber otozomal geçiş göstermektedir. ▪ Bel ağrısı, ▪ Karında dolgunluk ve basınç, ▪ Kistlerin yırtılmasıyla hematüri, ateş, titreme ve enfeksiyon, ▪ Proteinüri, ▪ Poliüri, ▪ Hipertansiyon, ▪ Yorgunluk, halsizlik, anemi görülür. ▪ BUN yükselir İdrar ve kan tetkikleri, direkt üriner sistem grafisi (DÜS), bilgisayarlı tomografi ve ultrasonografi ile tanı konur. Gerekirse histopatolojik inceleme için biyopsi yapılır. TANI BELİRTİLER ▪ Böbrek yetmezliğine aday olan bu hastalarda tedavinin amacı mümkün olduğunca yetmezliği engellemek, geciktirmektir. ▪ Bunun için hastalara konservatif tedavi uygulanır. ▪ Hastalığın ileri dönemlerinde hasta diyaliz programına alınır ve böbrek transplantasyonu yapılır. TEDAVİ ÜST ÜRİNER SİSTEM ENFEKSİYONLARI •Böbrek pelvisi ve parankiminin inflamasyonudur. •İnflamatuvar sürece genellikle bağırsaklarda normal olarak bulunan bakterilerin invazyonu neden olur. •Bunun yanı sıra proteus, klebsiella, stafilokok ve streptokoklar etyolojide rol oynayan diğer patojenlerdir. •Hastaların çoğunluğunu 15-40 yaş grubu kadınlar oluşturmaktadır. Piyelonefrit, sistitten yukarıya doğru ilerlemekle önce renal medullada sonra da kortekste yayılarak gelişebilir. Pyelonefrit Böbrek pelvisini ve parankimini tutan enfeksiyöz ve enflamatuar bir hastalıktır. En sık etkenler E.coli, proteus ve klebsiella türleridir. Böbrek büyük ve ödemlidir. Akut Pyelonefrit Kronik piyelonefrit tekrarlayan akut piyelonefrit atakları ile gelişir ve kronik böbrek yetmezliğine ilerleyebilir. Genellikle çocuklukta edinilip erişkinliğe taşınan bir hastalıktır. Çocuklukta en sık nedeni reflüdür. Kronik Pyelonefrit • Ateş, titreme, sıkıntı, yan ağrısı, baş ağrısı, kusma, kilo kaybı • Etkilenen tarafta kostovertebral bölgede hassasiyet, kas ağrısı, künt özellikte ağrı, laboratuvar bulgusu olarak kanda lökositoz, idrarda bol lökosit ve bakteri kümeleri saptanır. • İdrar bulanık ve kötü kokuludur.

Tanı Yöntemleri Böbrek Yetmezlikleri Böbreklerin görevlerini yapamaması ve fonksiyonlarını kaybetmesi durumudur. Akut ve kronik böbrek yetmezliği olarak iki ana kategoriye ayrılır. Akut Böbrek Yetmezliği • Böbreklerin fonksiyonlarını ani ve hızla kaybetmesidir. • Erişkin bir insanda günlük idrar miktarının aniden 400 mililitrenin altına düşmesi ve kanda üre düzeyinin devamlı yükselmesi durumuna akut böbrek yetmezliği denir. ▪ Ağır kanamalar, ▪ Ağır kusma ve ishaller, ▪ Yanıklar, ▪ Septik ve anafilaktik şok, ▪ Yanlış kan transfüzyonu, ▪ Gebelik dönemindeki kanamalar, gebelik zehirlenmesi, sağlıksız koşullarda yapılan düşükler, plesentanın erken ayrılması (plesanta dekolman), ▪ İdrar yolları tıkanıklıkları, ▪ Büyük ameliyat komplikasyonları, ▪ Düzensiz kullanılan ilaçlar, ▪ Kalp yetmezliği, ▪ Akut böbrek ve damar hastalıkları, ▪ Nefrotoksik maddeler (civa, arsanik, kurşun vb.) nedeniyle böbrek dokusunun harabiyeti sayılabilir. Nedenleri Belirtiler ve Bulgular Oligüri evresi: Bu evrede nefronlar görevini yapamadığından idrar süzülemez. ➢Bu nedenle günlük idrar miktarı 400 mililitreden az olup bazen bu miktar 100 mililitreye kadar azaldığı gibi bazen hiç idrar yapılmayabilir. ➢Bu evre, 1-2 günden birkaç haftaya kadar sürebilir. ➢İdrar miktarının birden azalmasıyla üre ve diğer maddeler kandan süzülemediği için kanda, potasyum sülfat, kreatinin, fosfor, BUN değerlerinde yükselme, proteinüri, hematüri, halsizlik, bulantı ve kusma, ödem, hipertansiyon görülür. Diürez evresi: Bu evrede nefronlardaki bozukluklar düzelir ve hasta bol miktarda idrar çıkarmaya başlar. •Günde 1-2 litre hatta bazen 3-4 litre idrar çıkarır. •İdrar miktarı artınca kanda biriken maddeler dışarı atılır ve kan biyokimyası normale döner. Komplikasyonlar ▪ Metabolik asidoz Konvülsiyonlar ▪ Koma ▪ İnsülin direnci ▪ Hipertansiyon ▪ Pulmoner ödem ▪ Pulmoner emboli ▪ Perikardit ▪ Pnömoni Tanı Yöntemleri ➢Hastanın anemnezi alınır ve fizik muayenesi yapılır. ➢Hastanın kanında BUN, kreatinin, ürik asit, potasyum fosfor ve kalsiyuma bakılır. ➢Tam idrar muayenesi yapılır.

Böbrek Taşları • Böbrek taşı oluşumu; kristeloidlerin konsantrasyonunun artması, idrar volümde azalma ve kristeloidlerin çözünürlüğünü azaltan pH değişiklikleri ile meydana gelir. • İdrarla atılamayan ve biriken kristaller nedeniyle oluşur. • Görülme oranı sıktır. Taş oluşumunda genetik, coğrafik özellikler, beslenme alışkanlıkları yer almaktadır. Böbrek taşları; • Kalsiyum oksalat • Magnezyum sülfat • Ürik asit taşları • Sistin taşlarından oluşur. ➢Aralıklı olarak bel ve yan ağrısı en çok görülen belirtidir. ➢Taşın ilerlemesi ile ağrı, karın ve kasıklara kadar ilerler. ➢Hematüri, disüri, bulantı, kusma görülür. ➢Taş, idrar yollarını tıkamış ise anüri görülebilir. Belirtileri Anamnez, fizik muayenesi, idrar tetkiki, direkt üriner sistem grafisi, ultrasonografi ve tomografi ile konulur. Tanı •Çoğu böbrek taşı kendiliğinden düşer. •Taşın düşmediği durumlarda; ESWL(extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy) adı verilen cihaz vücut dışından taşın olduğu bölgeye \\"sadme dalgaları\\" göndererek taşlara ulaşır ve bu dalgalar yardımıyla taşları kırar ve küçük parçalara ayrılan taşlar idrar yoluyla vücuttan atılır. • Kendiliğinden düşmesi için sıvı yüklemesi yapılabilir, • Şok dalgası ile taşlar kırılarak düşürülmesi sağlanabilir, • Cerrahi yollarla taş alınabilir . Tedavi İLAÇLAR Diüretikler Diüretikler nefronun çeşitli bölgelerinden sodyumun geri emilmesini önler. Sodyum ve klor gibi iyonlar idrara geçerken osmotik dengeyi koruyabilmek için suda bu iyonlarla dışarı atılır. Böylelikle diüretikler idrar miktarını artırırken kanın iyon içeriği ile beraber pH’sınıda değiştirir. Tübüler Transportun Nondiüretik İnhibitörleri Bu ilaçlar, organik anyonlar (ürik asit) ve katyonların transportunda etkilidirler. Transport proksimal tübülde gerçekleşir. Organik bileşikler sodyumun difüzyonu ile birlikte hücreye girer. Hücreden lümene organik iyon taşıyıcıları ile atılır. Renin Anjiotensin Sistemini Etkileyen İlaçlar Böbrek korteksi üzerinden renin salınımı yapılır. Renin salınımı, arteriyel basıncın düşmesi, böbrek korteksine ulaşan sodyum miktarı, distal tübülde artmış sodyum miktarı, sempatik aktivasyonun uyarılması gibi durumlar sonucu artar. ACE İnhibitörleri Anjiotensin I’den anjiotensin II üretimini engellerler. Anjiotensin II ve aldesterondan kaynaklanan periferik damar direnç artışı ile sodyum – su retansiyonu üzerine ters etki gösterirler. Vazodilatatör etki gösteren bradikinin inaktivasyonunu önleyerek kan basıncını azaltırlar Anjiotensin II Reseptör Antagonistleri Anjiotensin II reseptörleri, anjiotensin II’nin etkilerini azaltmada etkilidir. Diyalizde Kullanılan İlaçlar Amino Asit (EAS-Oral, Ketosteril, Aminess vb.): Yeterli beslenemeyen hastalarda protein ihtiyacını karşılamak için kullanılır. Vitamin D3 (Rocaltrol, One-Alpha, vb.): Kemik hastalığını önlemek için kronik böbrek yetmezliği olan hastalarda kullanılır. Fosfat Bağlayıcılar (Phos ex, Kalsiyum Karbonat, Alüminyum Hidroksit): Kandaki fosfor-kalsiyum dengesini sağlamak. Heparin: Karın içinde oluşan fibrinlerin kateteri tıkamasını önlemek için ve drenaj problemlerini ortadan kaldırmak için kullanılır. Eritropoetin (Eprex,Recormon): Anemi tedavisinde kullanılır. IV ya da SC olarak haftada üç kez uygulanabilir. Soğuk zincirdir. Demir (Ferrosanol, Venofer, vb.): Demir eksikliğine bağlı kansızlığı önlemede kullanılır. FolikAsit (B6 Vit.): İnsan vücudundaki kırmızı, beyaz kan hücreleri ile pıhtılaşma hücrelerinin yapımında rol oynar. Carnitin:Levo-karnitin insanlarda enerji metabolizması için gerekli olan doğal bir maddedir. Uzun zincirli yağ asidlerinin hücre içinde mitokondriye girişini kolaylaştırır. IM kullanımı daha uygundur.","completion":"Üriner sistem, kandaki artık maddeleri filtreleyen, idrarın oluşumunu sağlayan ve dışarı atılmasını düzenleyen bir sistemdir. Böbrekler kanı süzer, idrar mesanede birikir ve üretra yoluyla vücuttan atılır. Sistem artık maddelerin atımı, elektrolit dengesi, asit-baz dengesi, su ve kan basıncının düzenlenmesi gibi önemli görevleri yerine getirir. Ayrıca kırmızı kan hücrelerinin yapımı, D vitamini sentezi ve hormon salgılanmasında rol alır. Böbreklerin anatomik ve işlevsel olarak en küçük birimi olan nefronun düzgün çalışması esastır; idrarın oluşum süreci süzülme, geri emilim ve salınım aşamalarından geçer. İdrar, taşınması gereken yol boyunca üreterler, mesane ve üretra gibi yapılar tarafından yönlendirilir. Üriner sistemle ilgili problemlerin tanısında fizik muayene ve çeşitli laboratuvar testleri önemlidir. Belirtiler hastadan hastaya farklılık gösterir ve detaylı bir sağlık öyküsü toplamak gerekir. Tanıda idrar analizi ve böbrek fonksiyon testleri başta olmak üzere çeşitli test ve tahliller kullanılır. Üriner sistem hastalıklarından bazıları inklude sistit (mesane enfeksiyonu), üriner inkontinans (istemsiz idrar kaçırma) ve gerek akut gerekse kronik böbrek yetmezlikleridir. Böbrek anatomik bozuklukları genellikle genetik faktörler, gebelikte alınan ilaçlar veya enfeksiyonlar gibi nedenlerle ortaya çıkar. Örnek olarak polikistik böbrek hastalığı verebiliriz, bu durumda böbrekler çok sayıda kist içerir ve tedavisi hasta ve duruma göre değişir. Böbrek taşları çeşitli nedenlerle oluşabilir ve tedavisi taşın büyüklüğüne, yerine ve hastanın genel sağlık durumuna bağlı olarak değişir. Taş düşürme, şok dalgası terapileri veya gerekirse cerrahi müdahaleler uygulanabilir. Hastalıkların tedavisinde genellikle medikal tedavi, diyet düzenlemeleri, semptom kontrolü ve özellikle böbrek yetmezliklerinde diyaliz ya da böbrek nakli ön plandadır. Ayrıca hastaya ilgili ilaç tedavisi ve gerekirse diyetisyen eşliğinde beslenme planlama desteği sağlanır. Hemşirelik bakımı kapsamında, hasta eğitimi ve psikolojik desteğe büyük önem verilir, hastanın tedaviye uyması ve yaşam kalitesinin artırılması amaçlanır."},{"prompt":"başlıklar halinde daha detaylı açıkla","completion":"Tabii ki, üriner sistem ve ilgili konuları başlıklar halinde detaylandıralım: **Üriner Sistem** - **Sistem İşlevleri:** Böbreklerde kan süzülme işlevi, idrar oluşumu, artık ürünleri vücut dışına atma, su ve elektrolit dengesi, asit-baz dengesi ve kan basıncının düzenlenmesi gibi işlevler. - **Böbrekler ve İdrar Yolu Organları:** Böbreklerde nefronlar aracılığıyla süzülme, geri emilim ve salgı yoluyla idrarın oluşumu.

Также известно, что последняя цифра числа — 5. Давайте сначала найдем наименьшее пятизначное число с неповторяющимися цифрами, кратное 9, и затем добавим к нему 5 в качестве последней цифры. Первая цифра шестизначного числа не может быть 0, поэтому она должна быть как минимум 1. Для начала, допустим, что наименьшая цифра, которую мы можем использовать на первом месте — это 1 (мы не можем использовать 0, так как это сделает число пятизначным). Таким образом, начнем с числа 1 и добавим следующие по величине цифры, чтобы получить минимальное число: 102345 (без учета последней цифры 5). Теперь посчитаем сумму цифр: 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. К сумме добавляем число 5 (последняя цифра), получаем 15. Чтобы число делилось на 9, его цифры должны в сумме давать число, кратное 9. Наименьшее число больше 15, кратное 9 — это 18. Исходя из этого, если мы заменим в числе 102345 какую-либо цифру на цифру большую на 3 (чтобы сумма стала равной 18), число станет кратным 9. Но цифры должны быть различными, поэтому мы не можем просто увеличить уже имеющуюся 5. Вместо этого, заменим одну из цифр на следующую по порядку, которая не используется. У нас уже есть цифры 0, 1, 2, 3, 4; следующая неиспользованная — это 6. Мы можем заменить в числе 102345 цифру 3 на цифру 6, чтобы получить число 102645. Сумма цифр теперь 1 + 0 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 13.

The script also properly demonstrates how to define, train, and interact with the model. Below is a brief explanation of each component in your script. 1. \`positional_encoding\`: A function to add positional encodings to a sequence of embeddings. This allows a transformer network to take into account the order of items. 2. \`TransformerExpert\`: Defines a single expert transformer with a specified number of encoder layers, model dimensions, heads, feed-forward size, and an input/output layer for mapping input features to the desired output size. 3. \`GatingNetwork\`: A simple network that takes an input tensor, flattens it if necessary, and outputs a softmax distribution over the experts. 4. \`MixtureOfTransformerExperts\`: This is the MoE model that contains multiple TransformerExpert models and a GatingNetwork. It calculates weighted outputs from each expert based on the gating scores and combines these outputs to produce a final prediction. 5. \`QAJsonlDataset\`: A PyTorch Dataset class that reads from a JSONL file containing question-answer pairs, builds a vocabulary, and tokenizes the pairs. It also handles padding sequences. 6. \`MoETransformerModel\`: A wrapper model that includes an embedding layer for token embeddings, the MoE model, and dropout for regularization. 7. \`collate_fn\`: A custom function for collating data into batches. It pads sequences to the same length to create a batch. 8. \`train_model\`: Trains the model for the given number of epochs, with added gradient clipping. 9. \`generate_text\`: Generates text from a trained MoE Transformer Model, using progressive generation and sampling. 10. \`count_parameters\`: Function to count the total number of trainable parameters in the model. 11. At the end, it initializes all necessary components (dataset, model, optimizer, etc.), starts the training loop, and enters an interactive chat-like loop where the user can input text and the model will generate additional text following the seed. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss with label smoothing, the AdamW optimizer, and a ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler. After training, the user can interact with the model in a chat-like text generation setup, and the model's state is saved for later use. Here are some potential improvements or considerations for the script: - Ensure that you have a suitable dataset (named 'GSM2K.jsonl') for the specific use case (the file is referenced in the script but not provided). - Properly handle the early stopping conditions for training based on the validation loss or another criterion. - Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rates, number of experts, and the d_model, to find the best configuration for your specific task. - Since the script saves the model after each epoch, you can add a checkpointing feature that only saves the model if there's an improvement in terms of validation loss or accuracy. - The hardware requirements for training such models can be significant; ensure you have access to GPUs if the model size and dataset are substantial. - The quality of the text generation might greatly depend on the temperature parameter during sampling; tuning this hyperparameter can help in generating more coherent or creative text. By incorporating these additional features, the script would be more robust and flexible for various use cases and datasets."},{"prompt":"Total trainable parameters: 8897328 Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"<string>\\", line 1, in <module> File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libmultiprocessingspawn.py\\", line 116, in spawn_main exitcode = _main(fd, parent_sentinel) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libmultiprocessingspawn.py\\", line 125, in _main prepare(preparation_data) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libmultiprocessingspawn.py\\", line 236, in prepare _fixup_main_from_path(data['init_main_from_path']) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libmultiprocessingspawn.py\\", line 287, in _fixup_main_from_path main_content = runpy.run_path(main_path, File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310librunpy.py\\", line 289, in run_path return _run_module_code(code, init_globals, run_name, File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310librunpy.py\\", line 96, in _run_module_code _run_code(code, mod_globals, init_globals, File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310librunpy.py\\", line 86, in _run_code exec(code, run_globals) File \\"c:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaMoE-Transformer_Q&A.py\\", line 230, in <module> train_model(moe_transformer_model, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs, data_loader) File \\"c:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaMoE-Transformer_Q&A.py\\", line 149, in train_model progress_bar = tqdm(enumerate(data_loader), total=len(data_loader), desc=f\\"Epoch {epoch+1}\\", leave=False) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaArithwordlibsite-packagestorchutilsdatadataloader.py\\", line 438, in __iter__ return self._get_iterator() File \\"C:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaArithwordlibsite-packagestorchutilsdatadataloader.py\\", line 386, in _get_iterator return _MultiProcessingDataLoaderIter(self) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCDesktopProjetsMambaArithwordlibsite-packagestorchutilsdatadataloader.py\\", line 1039, in __init__ w.start() File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libmultiprocessingprocess.py\\", line 121, in start self._popen = self._Popen(self) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libmultiprocessingcontext.py\\", line 224, in _Popen return _default_context.get_context().Process._Popen(process_obj) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libmultiprocessingcontext.py\\", line 336, in _Popen return Popen(process_obj) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libmultiprocessingpopen_spawn_win32.py\\", line 45, in __init__ prep_data = spawn.get_preparation_data(process_obj._name) File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libmultiprocessingspawn.py\\", line 154, in get_preparation_data _check_not_importing_main() File \\"C:UsersDell-PCAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libmultiprocessingspawn.py\\", line 134, in _check_not_importing_main raise RuntimeError(''' RuntimeError: An attempt has been made to start a new process before the current process has finished its bootstrapping phase.

This way, you ensure that the multiprocessing code is run safely. You should encapsulate any top-level code that starts processes or that is not function or class definitions, ensuring that \`train_model\` and any other functionality that uses multiprocessing is called within this check. This pattern is particularly important on Windows because of the lack of \`fork()\` system call which behaves differently from Unix-like systems.

According to the error message, you're trying to multiply a matrix with shape \`(128x8192)\` with another matrix of shape \`(128x2)\`, which is not compatible for matrix multiplication. This issue likely arises within the \`GatingNetwork\` forward function: \`\`\`python def forward(self, x): if x.dim() > 2: x = x.view(x.size(0), -1) x = self.fc(x) return self.softmax(x) \`\`\` The \`view(x.size(0), -1)\` is flattening the input \`x\` into a two-dimensional array with shape \`(batch_size, -1)\`, where \`-1\` is automatically inferred to ensure all the input elements are covered. This process should produce an array suitable for passing through the fc (fully connected) layer. However, the shape \`(128x8192)\` indicates that the batch size is 128 and the flattened features per sample are 8192, which should match the first dimension of the weight matrix in the fc layer. In your case, the fc layer's weight matrix has a shape \`(128x2)\`, which shows the input features are expected to be 128, but you get 8192 features instead, hence the mismatch. Let's investigate what might be going wrong and how to solve it: 1. Verify the input size to the \`GatingNetwork\`: Ensure that when instantiating the \`GatingNetwork\`, the input size is correct and matches the flattened feature dimensions of your input tensor just before it's passed to the gating network. Based on the error message, it seems that the expected input size should be 8192 instead of 128. 2. Check the shape of \`x\` before the line \`x = self.fc(x)\` in the \`forward\` method of the \`GatingNetwork\`. You might need to adjust the model so that the correct shape is passed to the \`GatingNetwork\`. 3. The error suggests that your model's sequential length times the \`d_model\` (which should define the number of features for each token) may be resulting in a tensor with a shape that's incompatible with what your \`GatingNetwork\` expects. You need to ensure the output size of the transformer and the input size of the \`GatingNetwork\` consistently agree. Here's an adjusted version of the \`GatingNetwork\`: \`\`\`python class GatingNetwork(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_feature_dim, num_experts): super(GatingNetwork, self).__init__() self.fc = nn.Linear(input_feature_dim, num_experts) self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1) def forward(self, x): # Assuming x is of shape [batch_size, seq_len, d_model] you may want to aggregate # across the sequence length dimension before the gating network x = x.mean(dim=1) # Take mean or another operation that reduces seq_len dimension x = self.fc(x) # Now the shape of x should match the weight matrix of the fc layer return self.softmax(x) \`\`\` This assumes that you want to collapse the sequence length dimension before the gating network. If you have another intention in mind, ensure that you preprocess \`x\` accordingly. The \`mean(dim=1)\` is just an example of dimension reduction, but the correct approach depends on the logic of your gating network."},{"prompt":"У меня есть проблема: я ложусь спать около 2 (иногда 3) часов ночи и просыпаюсь в районе 9 или 10 утра.

Установите регулярное расписание сна: Постарайтесь каждый день ложиться и просыпаться в одно и то же время, включая выходные дни. Это поможет вашему организму настроиться на новый режим и засыпать и просыпаться в желаемое время. 2. Создайте спокойную атмосферу для сна: Перед тем, как пойти спать, постарайтесь создать расслабляющую атмосферу в своей комнате. Это может включать глушение света, создание тишины или слушание расслабляющей музыки. 3. Избегайте кофеина и никотина перед сном: Кроме того, что кофеин и никотин являются стимулянтами, они могут нарушить ваш циркадный ритм и затруднить засыпание. Постарайтесь избегать их употребления не менее 4-6 часов до сна. 4. Ограничьте потребление алкоголя: Хотя алкоголь может помочь вам заснуть, он может нарушить структуру вашего сна и привести к более поверхностному сну. Учитывайте это при попытке изменить свой режим сна. 5. Занимайтесь физической активностью: Регулярное физическое упражнение может помочь вам устать и настроиться на здоровый сон. Однако, стоит избегать физической активности за 2-3 часа до сна, чтобы дать своему организму время расслабиться перед сном. 6. Избегайте длительных дневных снов: Если вы дремлете днем, это может затруднить засыпание в ночное время. Старайтесь ограничивать дневной сон до 20-30 минут. 7. Создайте ритуал перед сном: Создание ритуала перед сном может помочь вашему организму распознать, что пришло время расслабиться и заснуть. Это может быть что-то такое, как чтение книги, принятие теплой ванны или выпивание чашки травяного чая. 8. Используйте техники расслабления: Расслабляющие техники, такие как глубокое дыхание, медитация или йога, могут помочь вам расслабиться перед сном и усилить ваше желание заснуть. 9. Обратитесь к врачу: Если вы продолжаете испытывать проблемы со сном после попыток самостоятельно изменить свой режим сна, стоит обратиться к врачу. Они могут провести дополнительные исследования и предложить вам специализированную помощь для улучшения вашего сна."},{"prompt":"wants to write a good feedback on my colleague","completion":"Dear [Colleague's Name], I wanted to take a moment to express my appreciation for your hard work and exceptional performance at work.

The code includes parts for data preparation, model definition, training, and text generation. Here's a summary of what each main part of the code does: - The \`positional_encoding\` function creates sinusoidal position encodings that are added to the transformer's token embeddings to provide the model with positional context. - The \`TransformerExpert\` class defines a single transformer encoder model that will serve as one \\"expert\\" in the MoE. - The \`GatingNetwork\` class creates a neural network that outputs gating weights for each expert based on the input features. - The \`MixtureOfTransformerExperts\` class builds the MoE model by combining several TransformerExpert models and a GatingNetwork to weigh their outputs. - The \`QAJsonlDataset\` class is a PyTorch Dataset that loads and preprocesses a QA dataset from a JSONL file for use in training and evaluating the model. - The \`MoETransformerModel\` class wraps the MoE and embedding layers to create the final model structure used for training. - The \`collate_fn\` function is used to create minibatches of data with padding for efficient batch processing. - \`train_model\` is a function to train the model using the specified loss function, optimizer, and data loader, and it includes gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients during training. - \`generate_text\` is a function that generates text given a seed text. It uses a sampling technique based on softmax probabilities to add diversity to the generated text. - The latter part of the code, from defining the model configurations to calling the \`train_model\` function, sets up and trains the MoE Transformer model on the question-answering dataset. - The interactive loop at the end allows a user to input seed text, which the model then uses to generate and output a sequence of text. - The final statement saves the trained model's parameters to disk.

The specific part of the error message: \`\`\` ValueError: Expected input batch_size (128) to match target batch_size (8192). \`\`\` tells us that the shape of the predictions tensor is not aligning with the shape of the targets tensor when you're trying to compute the cross-entropy loss. The \`predictions\` tensor appears to have a batch size of 128, whereas \`targets\` tensor has a batch size of 8192 (which is likely 128 multiplied by the sequence length, 64). This often happens during the reshaping or viewing operation before the loss calculation: \`\`\`python loss = criterion(predictions.view(-1, predictions.size(-1)), targets.view(-1)) \`\`\` To fix the error, you need to ensure that when you reshape \`predictions\` and \`targets\` tensors to calculate the loss, they have compatible shapes. You would want your \`predictions\` tensor to be of the shape \`(batch_size * sequence_length, num_classes)\` and your \`targets\` tensor to be of the shape \`(batch_size * sequence_length)\`. Here's why the shapes are mismatched: - \`predictions\` come from a model with the last dimension representing logits for each class. It presumably has the shape \`(batch_size, sequence_length, num_classes)\` before the view call. - \`targets\` come from a data loader, which usually have the shape \`(batch_size, sequence_length)\`. Therefore, when you use \`.view(-1)\` on \`targets\`, you're indeed flattening out the entire tensor to be one-dimensional with the total number of tokens across the batch and sequence length. You need to ensure that the logits are also being reshaped properly such that the number of rows in logits matches the total number of target tokens. This would involve reshaping the logits to be two-dimensional, with one row per token in the batch. Here is how the loss calculation should look: \`\`\`python predictions = predictions.view(-1, predictions.size(-1)) # Reshape from [batch_size, seq_len, num_classes] to [batch_size * seq_len, num_classes] targets = targets.view(-1) # Flatten the targets to [batch_size * seq_len] loss = criterion(predictions, targets) \`\`\` After these modifications, the \`predictions\` tensor should align with the \`targets\` tensor, and you should be able to compute the loss without any error regarding a mismatch in batch sizes. If you see a mismatch in the number of classes, you'll also need to ensure that the second dimension of \`predictions\` matches the number of unique classes in your dataset (\`num_classes\`)."},{"prompt":"import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset from collections import Counter import json from tqdm import tqdm import math def positional_encoding(seq_len, d_model, device): pos = torch.arange(seq_len, dtype=torch.float, device=device).unsqueeze(1) div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2).float() * (-math.log(10000.0) / d_model)).to(device) pe = torch.zeros(seq_len, d_model, device=device) pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(pos * div_term) pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(pos * div_term) return pe.unsqueeze(0) # Expert Transformer Model class TransformerExpert(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_size, d_model, output_size, nhead, dim_feedforward, num_encoder_layers=1): super(TransformerExpert, self).__init__() self.d_model = d_model self.input_fc = nn.Linear(input_size, d_model) encoder_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=d_model, nhead=nhead, dim_feedforward=dim_feedforward, batch_first=True) self.transformer_encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layer, num_layers=num_encoder_layers) self.output_fc = nn.Linear(d_model, output_size) def forward(self, x): x = self.input_fc(x) + positional_encoding(x.size(1), self.d_model, x.device) transformer_output = self.transformer_encoder(x) output = self.output_fc(transformer_output[:, -1, :]) return output # Gating Network class GatingNetwork(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_feature_dim, num_experts): super(GatingNetwork, self).__init__() self.fc = nn.Linear(input_feature_dim, num_experts) self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1) def forward(self, x): # Assuming x is of shape [batch_size, seq_len, d_model] you may want to aggregate # across the sequence length dimension before the gating network x = x.mean(dim=1) # Take mean or another operation that reduces seq_len dimension x = self.fc(x) # Now the shape of x should match the weight matrix of the fc layer return self.softmax(x) # Mixture of Experts Model class MixtureOfTransformerExperts(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_size, d_model, output_size, nhead, dim_feedforward, num_experts, num_encoder_layers=1): super(MixtureOfTransformerExperts, self).__init__() self.num_experts = num_experts self.experts = nn.ModuleList([TransformerExpert(input_size, d_model, output_size, nhead, dim_feedforward, num_encoder_layers) for _ in range(num_experts)]) self.gating_network = GatingNetwork(d_model, num_experts) def forward(self, x): gating_scores = self.gating_network(x) expert_outputs = [expert(x).unsqueeze(1) for expert in self.experts] expert_outputs = torch.cat(expert_outputs, dim=1) # shape: [batch, num_experts, output_size] mixed_output = torch.bmm(expert_outputs.permute(0, 2, 1), gating_scores.unsqueeze(-1)).squeeze(-1) return mixed_output class QAJsonlDataset(Dataset): def __init__(self, path, seq_len): self.seq_len = seq_len self.pairs = self.load_data(path) # Flatten the pairs completely before passing them to build_vocab self.vocab, self.idx2token = self.build_vocab([word for pair in self.pairs for sublist in pair for word in sublist]) self.tokenized_pairs = [(self.tokenize(q), self.tokenize(a)) for q, a in self.pairs] def load_data(self, path): pairs = [] with open(path, \\"r\\", encoding=\\"utf-8\\") as f: for line in f: data = json.loads(line.strip()) question, answer = data.get(\\"question\\", \\"\\"), data.get(\\"answer\\", \\"\\") pairs.append((question.split(), answer.split())) return pairs def tokenize(self, words): # Tokenize a sentence and pad if necessary # Add <eos> token at the end if there’s room tokens = [self.vocab.get(w, self.vocab[\\"<unk>\\"]) for w in words] if len(tokens) < self.seq_len: tokens.append(self.vocab[\\"<eos>\\"]) # Add <eos> token tokens.extend([self.vocab[\\"<pad>\\"]] * (self.seq_len -

Given that the code seems correct in terms of reshaping predictions and targets before loss computation, we'll need to check other aspects of the code that could be causing this issue. Let's take a look at your \`MixtureOfTransformerExperts\` forward pass. Here is the current implementation: \`\`\`python def forward(self, x): gating_scores = self.gating_network(x) expert_outputs = [expert(x).unsqueeze(1) for expert in self.experts] expert_outputs = torch.cat(expert_outputs, dim=1) # shape: [batch, num_experts, output_size] mixed_output = torch.bmm(expert_outputs.permute(0, 2, 1), gating_scores.unsqueeze(-1)).squeeze(-1) return mixed_output \`\`\` Your \`MixtureOfTransformerExperts\` is taking a mixture of output vectors from all expert transformer models and combining them using gating scores.

This would lead to a shape mismatch since your targets are likely to be of shape \`[batch_size, sequence_length]\`. To resolve this, you need to modify your model so that it outputs predictions for each position in the sequence, not only the last position. Let's modify the \`TransformerExpert\` and \`MixtureOfTransformerExperts\` to handle the full sequence: \`\`\`python # In TransformerExpert def forward(self, x): x = self.input_fc(x) + positional_encoding(x.size(1), self.d_model, x.device) transformer_output = self.transformer_encoder(x) output = self.output_fc(transformer_output) # Apply output_fc to each time step in the sequence return output \`\`\` \`\`\`python # In MixtureOfTransformerExperts def forward(self, x): gating_scores = self.gating_network(x) expert_outputs = [expert(x) for expert in self.experts] # Remove unsqueeze operation stacked_expert_outputs = torch.stack(expert_outputs) # Now it is [num_experts, batch, seq_len, output_size] # Expand gating scores to apply for every time step and output class expanded_gating_scores = gating_scores.unsqueeze(2).unsqueeze(3).expand(-1, -1, x.size(1), vocab_size) mixed_output = torch.sum(stacked_expert_outputs * expanded_gating_scores, dim=0) # Sum weighted expert outputs for each time step return mixed_output \`\`\` In the \`forward\` method of \`MixtureOfTransformerExperts\`, we stack the expert outputs and then use expanded gating scores to apply the mixture across each time step and output class. Make sure to update the \`forward\` method of \`MoETransformerModel\` to not add positional encoding twice, since you already did that in \`TransformerExpert\` class: \`\`\`python class MoETransformerModel(nn.Module): # ... def forward(self, x): embedded = self.dropout(self.embedding(x)) return self.moe(embedded) # Remove positional encoding addition here, as it's already added in TransformerExpert \`\`\` With these changes, you should ensure that the model's output shape aligns with the targets, allowing the loss to be computed correctly without a batch size mismatch error. Please make sure all the dimensions used in these modifications are appropriately set according to your specific setup."},{"prompt":"How can I get the psar indicator using finta TA. With step=0.07 and maximum=0.6","completion":"The \`finta\` Python module is a financial technical analysis library that allows you to compute a wide range of technical indicators, including the Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse), from financial data structures such as pandas DataFrame. To compute the Parabolic SAR (PSAR) with \`finta\` and to set the step and maximum explicitly, you would call the appropriate function with the necessary parameters. However, as of my last knowledge update in early 2023, \`finta\` does not allow you to specify the step and maximum parameters directly for PSAR computation. The PSAR calculation inside \`finta\` uses the defaults specified in the Wilder's original formula (usually starting at 0.02 and incrementing by 0.02 up to a maximum of 0.2). To use \`finta\` for PSAR with customized parameters, you would need to modify the \`finta\` source code or implement your own PSAR calculation, taking inspiration from the \`finta\` structure but adjusting the parameters to suit your needs. Here is an example of how you might use \`finta\` to compute the PSAR with default parameters and also an example of how to manually compute PSAR with your specified parameters using pandas: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd from finta import TA # Your DataFrame should contain 'high', 'low', and 'close' columns df = pd.DataFrame({ 'open': [...], 'high': [...], 'low': [...], 'close': [...], }) # Using finta to calculate PSAR with default settings: psar = TA.PSAR(df) print(psar) # Custom PSAR calculation function def custom_psar(df, step=0.07, maximum=0.6): length = len(df) psar = df['close'].copy() psar_bull = df['close'].copy() psar_bear = df['close'].copy() bull = True af = step ep = df['low'][0] hp = df['high'][0] lp = df['low'][0] for i in range(1, length): if bull: psar[i] = psar[i - 1] + af * (hp - psar[i - 1]) else: psar[i] = psar[i - 1] + af * (lp - psar[i - 1]) reverse = False if bull: if df['low'][i] < psar[i]: bull = False reverse = True psar[i] = hp lp = df['low'][i] af = step else: if df['high'][i] > psar[i]: bull = True reverse = True psar[i] = lp hp = df['high'][i] af = step if not reverse: if bull: if df['high'][i] > hp: hp = df['high'][i] af = min(af + step, maximum) if df['low'][i - 1] < psar[i]: psar[i] = df['low'][i - 1] if df['low'][i - 2] < psar[i]: psar[i] = df['low'][i - 2] else: if df['low'][i] < lp: lp = df['low'][i] af = min(af + step, maximum) if df['high'][i - 1] > psar[i]: psar[i] = df['high'][i - 1] if df['high'][i - 2] > psar[i]: psar[i] = df['high'][i - 2] return psar # Using our custom PSAR calculation function custom_psar_calculation = custom_psar(df, step=0.07, maximum=0.6) print(custom_psar_calculation) \`\`\` Please note that the implementation may not be optimized and is rather rudimentary. You would need to adjust the code to handle edge cases and to ensure that it works across different datasets. It is recommended to check the output against a trusted PSAR calculation to ensure its correctness. If you want to use an existing library with more customizable options, you may need to look for another library that allows setting the 'step' and 'maximum' parameters directly or consider creating a subclass that extends \`finta\` to add this feature. Remember that manipulating financial data and using technical analysis indicators requires careful consideration and understanding. Always ensure your code's logic is sound and that it's producing the expected results before making any investment decisions based on this data."},{"prompt":"Does ta have the ability to specify step and maximum","completion":"The \`ta\` library, which is another common Python library for technical analysis, also known as Technical Analysis Library in Python, allows users to calculate technical indicators, including the Parabolic Stop and Reverse (Parabolic SAR). This library provides a bit more flexibility for certain parameters when compared to the \`finta\` library. To use the \`ta\` library to calculate the Parabolic SAR with custom step and maximum values, you would typically import the \`SARIndicator\` class and then configure the \`step\` and \`max_step\` parameters when initializing the object. Here's an example of how you can achieve that: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import ta # Assuming you have a DataFrame 'df' with 'High', 'Low', and 'Close' price columns df = pd.DataFrame({ 'High': [...], # replace with your data 'Low': [...], # replace with your data 'Close': [...], # replace with your data }) # Initialize the Parabolic SAR with custom step and max_step sar_indicator = ta.trend.SARIndicator(high=df['High'], low=df['Low'], step=0.07, max_step=0.6) # Get the Parabolic SAR values df['PSAR'] = sar_indicator.sar() # Now, the 'df' DataFrame contains a new column 'PSAR' with the Parabolic SAR values using your custom step and max_step. \`\`\` Please ensure that you have installed the \`ta\` library before running this snippet: \`\`\`sh pip install ta \`\`\` Be sure to check the official documentation or the library's repository for the most up-to-date usage instructions, as libraries may receive updates or changes after my knowledge cutoff date or since the last time you've used them."},{"prompt":"Is the parabolic sar the same as just sar","completion":"Yes, in the context of financial technical analysis, \\"SAR\\" stands for \\"Stop and Reverse\\" and refers to the Parabolic SAR indicator. The terms \\"Parabolic SAR\\" and \\"SAR\\" are used interchangeably to describe the same technical indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. The Parabolic SAR is designed to provide points on a chart that indicate potential reversals in price movement. Its name \\"Parabolic SAR\\" comes from the shape of the parabolic curves that follow the price trends on the chart. It is a trend-following (lagging) indicator and is often used by traders to determine the direction of a trend, potential reversal points, and to set trailing stop-loss orders. The basic idea is that when the price is in an uptrend, the SAR points appear below the price and move upwards over time until the price crosses the SAR, suggesting a potential trend reversal. Conversely, when the price is in a downtrend, the SAR points appear above the price and move downwards, until the price crosses the SAR again, implying a potential upward reversal. In programming libraries that provide financial technical analysis tools (such as \`ta\` or \`finta\` in Python), the Parabolic SAR is usually implemented as a function or a class that calculates the indicator based on provided historical price data. The SAR indicator, when referred to in the context of these libraries, is the same as the Parabolic SAR, though the full name is often used in documentation to prevent confusion with other possible meanings of \\"SAR\\"."},{"prompt":"удельной теплозащитной характеристики здания","completion":"Удельная теплозащитная характеристика здания — это показатель, который характеризует эффективность теплоизоляционных свойств ограждающих конструкций здания, таких как стены, окна, двери, крыша и полы. Она определяет количество тепла, которое теряется через эти конструкции на единицу площади при разнице температур внутри и снаружи здания на протяжении определенного времени. Показатель удельной теплозащитной характеристики может быть выражен в Вт/(м²·К) и обычно определяется для каждой ограждающей конструкции в отдельности. Например, удельная теплопередача (U-значение) стены может быть рассчитана как количество тепла, проходящего через 1 м² стены за час при разнице температур в 1 градус Кельвина (или Цельсия). Для оценки энергоэффективности здания в целом анализируются все ограждающие конструкции. Чем ниже удельная теплозащитная характеристика ограждающих конструкций, тем лучше изоляционные свойства здания, что приводит к снижению энергопотребления на отопление в холодное время года и на охлаждение в теплое время года. Чтобы повысить удельную теплозащитную характеристику здания, используются различные методы: 1. Улучшение теплоизоляционных свойств материалов (например, утепление стен, крыши и полов). 2. Применение качественной оконной системы с двойным или тройным остеклением. 3. Герметизация здания для уменьшения потерь тепла через неплотности. 4. Вентиляция с рекуперацией тепла для уменьшения потерь тепла при необходимости обновления воздуха внутри помещений. 5. Тепловая защита мостиков холода и других уязвимых мест в конструкции здания, где возможны повышенные теплопотери. При проектировании новых зданий и реконструкции существующих значительное внимание уделяется повышению удельной теплозащитной характеристики с целью уменьшения энергетических затрат и повышения уровня комфорта жильцов."},{"prompt":"Трансмиссионные тепловые потери помещения","completion":"Трансмиссионные тепловые потери помещения — это тепло, которое уходит из помещения через ограждающие конструкции во внешнюю среду. Они происходят вследствие разницы температур внутри помещения и снаружи здания. Эти потери являются одним из основных факторов, определяющих энергетическую эффективность здания. Трансмиссионные тепловые потери зависят от нескольких факторов: 1. **Теплопроводности материалов**, из которых сделаны ограждающие конструкции. Чем выше теплопроводность, тем больше тепла будет уходить сквозь материал. 2. **Толщины ограждающих конструкций**. Увеличение толщины элементов конструкции, как правило, приводит к снижению теплопотерь. 3. **Размера и характеристик окон**. Большие окна или окна с плохой изоляцией могут значительно увеличивать теплопотери. 4. **Температурных разниц** между внутренней и наружной средой. Большая разница температур приводит к увеличению потерь. 5. **Качества теплоизоляции** и наличия тепловых мостиков — мест, через которые проходит повышенный теплообмен из-за нарушения или отсутствия теплоизоляционного слоя. Трансмиссионные теплопотери можно рассчитать, исходя из коэффициента теплопередачи (U-значения) ограждающей конструкции, площади этой конструкции и разницы температур между внутренним и внешним воздухом. Формула для расчета теплопотерь: [ Q = U cdot A cdot Delta T ] где: - ( Q ) – количество тепла, уходящее из помещения через конструкцию за определенный промежуток времени (Вт), - ( U ) – коэффициент теплопередачи конструкции (Вт/(м²·К)), - ( A ) – площадь ограждающей конструкции (м²), - ( Delta T ) – разница температур внутри и снаружи помещения (К). Для уменьшения трансмиссионных потерь применяются различные методы улучшения теплоизоляции ограждающих конструкций, установки качественных оконных систем и дверей, а также сокращения тепловых мостиков.

Воздух может проникать в здание через различные неплотности в ограждающих конструкциях, таких как трещины в стенах, около окон и дверей, вентиляционные отверстия и другие непреднамеренные открытые места. Инфильтрация воздуха приводит к тому, что для поддержания комфортной температуры в помещении необходимо затрачивать дополнительную энергию на его обогрев. Тепловые потери на нагрев инфильтрующегося воздуха могут непропорционально увеличивать общие затраты на отопление в здании, особенно в холодное время года. Расчёт таких тепловых потерь обычно производят с использованием следующей формулы: [ Q_{text{инф}} = 0.34 cdot V cdot Delta T ] где: - ( Q_{text{инф}} ) – количество тепла, необходимое для нагрева инфильтрующегося воздуха в течение определенного времени (обычно берутся часы), в ваттах (Вт), - ( 0.34 ) – коэффициент пропорциональности, который учитывает удельную теплоемкость воздуха (кДж/м³·°C) и плотность воздуха при нормальных условиях (кг/м³), пересчитанный в соответствии с размерностями остальных величин, - ( V ) – объем инфильтрующегося воздуха за единицу времени (м³/ч), - ( Delta T ) – разница температур между внешним и внутренним воздухом в градусах Цельсия (°C). Чтобы сократить тепловые потери на нагрев инфильтрующегося воздуха, принимают ряд мер: 1. Улучшение герметизации ограждающих конструкций и устранение мест, где возможна инфильтрация. 2. Использование высококачественных оконных и дверных систем. 3. Применение систем контролируемой механической вентиляции с рекуперацией тепла, которая позволяет обновлять воздух в помещении без значительных тепловых потерь.

Термин \\"независимая схема\\" указывает на то, что системы отопления и горячего водоснабжения функционируют отдельно друг от друга и не влияют на работу каждой системы. Это позволяет более гибко и эффективно управлять процессами отопления и подготовки горячей воды, а также независимо регулировать температурные режимы для каждой из систем."},{"prompt":"Для воздухоудаления на поэтажных коллекторах предусматривается спускник воздуха, а у каждого отопительного прибора устанавливается кран Маевского. Что такое кран маевского","completion":"Кран Маевского — это небольшой вентиляционный или воздухоотводящий кран, который устанавливается на отопительных приборах, таких как радиаторы (батареи) центрального отопления. Его цель — удалять скопившийся воздух (газ) внутри радиатора или системы отопления для того, чтобы повысить её эффективность и устранить шумы, связанные с присутствием воздушных пробок в системе. Воздух может попадать в систему отопления в процессе её заполнения, а также во время работы вследствие растворения его в воде и выделения из неё при повышении температуры. По мере накопления воздуха в радиаторе он может занимать верхнюю часть отопительного прибора, что приводит к уменьшению теплоотдачи, так как воздух обладает гораздо меньшей теплопроводностью, чем вода. Использование крана Маевского позволяет периодически выводить этот воздух из системы, обеспечивая её более эффективное функционирование. Кран может быть ручным или автоматическим. Ручной кран Маевского требует ручного управления — необходимо периодически открывать его для выпуска воздуха и закрывать после устранения воздушной пробки. Процедура проветривания радиатора с помощью крана Маевского выполняется следующим образом: 1. Кран Маевского (обычно расположенный на верхней части радиатора) слегка открывают с помощью специального ключа, отвёртки или даже вручную (в зависимости от конструкции крана). 2. Воздух начинает выходить из системы, иногда сопровождаемый шипением. 3. Как только из крана начинает капать вода, это сигнализирует о том, что весь воздух вышел, и кран необходимо закрыть. Применение кранов Маевского является важной частью обслуживания системы отопления, так как регулярное удаление воздуха помогает избежать многих распространённых проблем с отоплением."},{"prompt":"тепловая нагрузка района на отопление чем отличется от нагрузка на горячее водоснабжение","completion":"Тепловая нагрузка района на отопление и нагрузка на горячее водоснабжение (ГВС) относятся к разным аспектам энергопотребления и оказывают различное влияние на теплоснабжение. **Тепловая нагрузка на отопление** отражает количество тепловой энергии, необходимое для обогрева всех зданий в данном районе в течение отопительного сезона. Она зависит от многих факторов, включая климатические условия, качество теплоизоляции зданий, количество и характеристики отопительных приборов, а также от отапливаемого объема зданий. Тепловая нагрузка на отопление учитывается при проектировании и эксплуатации систем централизованного теплоснабжения, и обычно значительно возрастает в холодное время года. **Нагрузка на горячее водоснабжение** относится к тепловой энергии, которая требуется для подогрева воды, используемой для бытовых нужд в районе (душ, кухни, стирка и прочее). Эта нагрузка относительно стабильна в течение всего года, хотя может наблюдаться некоторый сезонный рост (например, в период более интенсивного использования горячей воды). Расчет нагрузки на ГВС учитывает такие параметры, как средний расход горячей воды на душу населения, количество пользователей и типы потребителей (жилые здания, предприятия общественного питания, промышленные предприятия и т.д.). Различия между тепловой нагрузкой на отопление и на ГВС также включают: - Профиль нагрузки: отопительная нагрузка варьируется в зависимости от температуры наружного воздуха и времени суток, тогда как ГВС имеет более равномерное потребление. - Техническое решение: для отопления могут использоваться радиаторы, теплые полы, воздушные калориферы и другие системы, в то время как для ГВС необходимы водонагреватели, теплообменники, бойлеры и прочее. - Температурные режимы: температура теплоносителя систем отопления обычно ниже, чем вода для ГВС, что особенно актуально при использовании централизованных систем теплоснабжения, когда теплоноситель должен быть достаточно горячим для ГВС. - Экологические и экономические аспекты: нормативы на ГВС могут быть более строгими в плане качества воды, а отходящее тепло от ГВС может быть использовано для предварительного подогрева холодной воды, тем самым повышая общую эффективность системы теплоснабжения.

However, there was an additional piece of news that left Shaggy with a pang of sorrow. He received a letter informing him of his Uncle Shadrack's sudden passing. Shaggy was devastated as Uncle Shadrack was his favorite uncle; they often bonded over their shared love for food. With heavy hearts, the Mystery Inc. team embarked on their perilous journey. Armed with their courage and intellect, they retraced Polly's earlier hideout, deep within the Enchanted Forest. Unbeknownst to the gang, Polly had made a dark alliance with the forest's enchanted inhabitants, gathering a formidable force. As they ventured deeper into the forest, facing enchanted creatures and eerie traps, Shaggy's mind drifted to his late Uncle Shadrack. He recalled how Uncle Shadrack had always encouraged him to be brave, even in the face of fear. Holding onto Uncle Shadrack's wise words, Shaggy found newfound strength and determination. Finally, the gang arrived at Polly's lair, a foreboding cave concealed behind a waterfall. Inside, the air was heavy with ancient magic. The gang's skills were put to the test as they outwitted enchanted statues, overcame illusionary puzzles, and solved riddles of mesmerizing illusions. Through their comradery, quick thinking, and unyielding teamwork, Mystery Inc. managed to corner Polly between two ancient statues. Harnessing a mystical talisman, Velma devised a plan to seal Polly's powers forever. As the plan unfolded, Shaggy summoned his courage to stand beside Velma, honoring his uncle's memory. With a deafening explosion, Polly screeched in agony as the talisman shattered the evil parrot's power, leaving it powerless and defeated. The enchanted creatures retreated, their magic dissipating. Panting and triumphant, the gang embraced one another, knowing they had saved Coolsville from destruction. Shaggy felt his Uncle Shadrack's presence, smiling down from above, proud of his nephew's bravery. As the gang left the Enchanted Forest, the sun began to rise, illuminating their path back to Coolsville.

No obstante, aquí he hecho un intento de categorizar algunos acontecimientos y hechos históricos que a menudo no se abordan ampliamente en los currículos escolares estándar, ordenados desde los más conocidos (en la cima del iceberg) a los menos conocidos (en la base del iceberg). **Cima del iceberg (más conocidos, pero no siempre enseñados)**: - Masacre de Nankíng: atrocidades cometidas por fuerzas japonesas en China durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. - Experimento Tuskegee sobre sífilis: estudio de investigación médica en EE.UU. que dejó sin tratamiento a pacientes afroamericanos infectados. - La Crisis de los misiles en Taiwán (1958): enfrentamiento entre China y Taiwán con implicación de Estados Unidos. - Operación Cherry Blossoms at Night: un plan japonés durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial para utilizar la guerra biológica en contra de los Estados Unidos. **Mitad del iceberg (conocidos por algunos, raramente enseñados)**: - Proyecto MK-Ultra: serie de experimentos secretos de la CIA sobre control mental. - La guerra de Bananeras y la influencia de las corporaciones fruteras estadounidenses en la política de los países centroamericanos. - Gulags soviéticos: sistema de campos de trabajo forzoso durante la era de la URSS. - Las hambrunas causadas por políticas humanas, como la Gran Hambruna China durante el Gran Salto Adelante. **Base del iceberg (poco conocidos y raramente enseñados)**: - Operación Ajax: el golpe de estado orquestado por el Reino Unido y EE.UU. en Irán en 1953. - Experimentos humanos en la Unidad 731 japonesa durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. - Masacre de Jeju: represión militar en la isla de Jeju, Corea del Sur, en 1948. - Proyectos de esterilización forzada en diferentes países a lo largo del siglo XX. **Profundidades del iceberg (oscuridad histórica, muy raramente enseñados)**: - La represión de los Herero y Namaqua por parte de las fuerzas coloniales alemanas en Namibia a principios del siglo XX. - Experimentos de radiación humana en Estados Unidos durante la Guerra Fría. - El genocidio de la población indígena selk'nam en Tierra del Fuego. - Experiencias médicas en prisioneros durante la dictadura de Pinochet en Chile. Este iceberg es una simplificación generalizada y no puede ser exhaustivo ni preciso para todos los contextos educativos. Muchos de estos eventos pueden ser objeto de un análisis más detallado y de un entendimiento más profundo dependiendo del interés del individuo y de la disponibilidad de información e investigación académica.

Como mi conocimiento se detiene en 2023 y no tengo acceso en tiempo real a los últimos datos, no puedo confirmar la situación exacta de los hogares en España en este mismo momento respecto a su capacidad para comprar alimentos básicos. Sin embargo, es conocido que España, al igual que muchos otros países, ha enfrentado problemas de pobreza y dificultades económicas que afectan a ciertos sectores de la población. La crisis económica que comenzó en 2008 dejó a muchos hogares en situaciones precarias, y la pandemia de la COVID-19 tuvo un impacto económico adicional. Los informes de organizaciones como la Red Europea de Lucha contra la Pobreza y la Exclusión Social en el Estado Español (EAPN-ES), el Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) o estudios como el Informe sobre el Estado de la Pobreza pueden ofrecer perspectivas sobre la situación de pobreza y exclusión social, incluida la capacidad de los hogares para cubrir necesidades básicas como la alimentación. Para conocer los datos más actuales sobre esta temática, sería necesario consultar las últimas estadísticas y estudios de fuentes oficiales o de organizaciones que trabajan en el ámbito de la pobreza y la exclusión social en España."},{"prompt":"¿Pero cuantos hogares?","completion":"Como he mencionado anteriormente, no tengo acceso en tiempo real a datos actuales y mi capacidad de proporcionar cifras específicas está limitada por mi última actualización de conocimientos en 2023. La cantidad de hogares que podrían estar enfrentando dificultades para comprar alimentos básicos en España depende de múltiples factores y puede cambiar con el tiempo debido a circunstancias económicas, políticas y sociales. Para obtener cifras exactas y actuales, sería necesario consultar los últimos informes y estudios de entidades como el Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) en España, organizaciones no gubernamentales que trabajan con personas en situación de pobreza o el Ministerio de Derechos Sociales y Agenda 2030, que pudieran haber publicado datos sobre la situación. Los informes anuales sobre el estado de pobreza y exclusión social, así como las encuestas de condiciones de vida, a menudo incluyen información sobre la proporción de hogares que enfrentan inseguridad alimentaria o dificultades económicas que les impiden acceder a alimentos básicos. No obstante, es importante destacar que la situación puede variar año tras año y es esencial consultar fuentes actualizadas para obtener una imagen precisa de la realidad en cualquier momento dado."},{"prompt":"¿Cuantas viviendas hay en España hoy?","completion":"No tengo información en tiempo real ya que mi última actualización de conocimientos fue en 2023 y no puedo proporcionar datos actuales con exactitud. No obstante, para hacerte una idea aproximada, según datos del Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) de España de años anteriores, había alrededor de 25-26 millones de viviendas en el país, aunque esta cifra incluye tanto la vivienda principal como segundas residencias y viviendas vacías. Para obtener la cifra actualizada del número de viviendas en España, deberías consultar los últimos datos publicados por el INE o por otras fuentes oficiales competentes en materia de estadística y vivienda. El INE regularmente recopila y actualiza datos sobre el parque de viviendas a través de censos y otras encuestas de población y vivienda."},{"prompt":"¿La vivienda es el bloque? ¿O cada puerta del piso?","completion":"Cuando hablamos de viviendas en términos estadísticos o de recuentos nacionales, como los que realiza el Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) en España, generalmente nos referimos a la unidad de alojamiento individual que constituye un hogar separado. Esto significa que cada \\"puerta\\" o unidad residencial independiente se cuenta como una vivienda. En un edificio de apartamentos o un bloque de pisos, cada apartamento se consideraría una vivienda distinta. No importa cuántas viviendas estén contenidas dentro del bloque o edificio; lo que se cuenta es la unidad individual que tiene sus propios accesos y servicios separados y que se utiliza (o está destinada a ser utilizada) como un hogar. Por lo tanto, si un bloque tiene, por ejemplo, 10 apartamentos, se contaría como 10 viviendas, incluso si todas estas están dentro del mismo edificio físico. Esto incluiría apartamentos y estudios, casas adosadas, chalets independientes y cualquier otra forma de alojamiento residencial que proporcione espacio habitable independiente para los individuos o familias."},{"prompt":"Write a story set after Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated where Crystal Cove is suddenly in danger again, and Shaggy's uncle Albert Shaggleford is dead, and Shaggy gets his inheritance, but will an old friend try to steal it first, and awaken the Evil entity once more?","completion":"Once again, the quaint town of Crystal Cove found itself in the midst of an inexplicable danger. The ominous clouds hovered over the gloomy streets, casting a shadow of uncertainty and fear upon the unsuspecting residents. It seemed that even after the conclusion of the Mystery Incorporated's adventures, the haunting secrets of Crystal Cove were far from over. Following the demise of beloved Uncle Albert Shaggleford, Shaggy Rogers found himself in a state of shock and grief. He had always looked up to his eccentric uncle, who had taught him the important values of friendship, bravery, and, above all, a love for Scooby snacks. However, Uncle Albert had left something behind for Shaggy—an inheritance that would change his life forever. With a heavy heart, Shaggy collected his inheritance at the office of Pune Stanchion, a stuffy lawyer known for his ruthless tactics. The inheritance consisted of a cryptic letter and a dusty old book. Shaggy could sense that something mysterious was afoot, as his uncle had always been a man of enigmatic intentions. Little did he know that his old friend, Dr. Jonathan Sinclair, had caught wind of the inheritance and planned to seize it for himself. As the news of Shaggy's inheritance spread throughout Crystal Cove, whispers of the Evil Entity that once terrorized the town began to resurface. It was said that the ancient darkness was drawn to powerful artifacts and would stop at nothing to regain its malevolent power. With Shaggy now in possession of this inheritance, the town held its breath, hoping that Mystery Incorporated would come out of retirement to solve this new mystery. Meanwhile, Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Scooby-Doo had all pursued different paths after their last encounter with the Evil Entity. Fred had delved into his family's architectural business, Daphne hosted her own television show, Velma became a renowned scientist, and Scooby-Doo continued his crime-fighting adventures with his equally heroic detective brother, Ace the Bat-Hound. However, upon hearing about Shaggy's inheritance and the possible return of the Evil Entity, a call went out to reunite the team once more. They gathered at their old clubhouse, where they found Shaggy staring intently at the cryptic letter left by his late uncle. It mentioned a hidden location where the true nature of the inheritance would be revealed. It was a clue that only Mystery Incorporated could decipher. As they embarked on their adventure, Dr. Jonathan Sinclair, desperate to seize the inheritance, pursued them relentlessly. With every step, the mystery deepened, leading the gang deep into the heart of Crystal Cove's forgotten catacombs. The ancient tunnels within held secrets and traps that tested the team's abilities, as they encountered eerie apparitions and sinister puzzles along the way. They soon realized that the Evil Entity's power loomed over them once more. With their wits, courage, and the combined strength of their friendship, the gang unraveled the truth behind Uncle Albert's inheritance and its connection to the Evil Entity. It wasn't merely an inheritance of wealth but a weapon capable of sealing the entity away forever. Uncle Albert had sacrificed himself in order to protect the town he loved, leaving it up to Shaggy and Mystery Incorporated to finish what he had started. In an epic showdown between the gang, Dr. Sinclair, and the Evil Entity, Shaggy discovered a newfound bravery within himself. With the support of his loyal friends and the memory of his uncle's teachings, he stood against the darkness that threatened to envelop Crystal Cove once more. In a bittersweet victory, the Evil Entity was defeated, ensuring the safety of the town and ending its reign of terror once and for all. From that day forward, Shaggy Rogers inherited not only his uncle's wealth but the responsibility to protect Crystal Cove. He embraced his role as a guardian of the town's secrets, forever grateful for the adventures and lessons he had shared with Mystery Incorporated. Crystal Cove could rest easy, knowing that Shaggy and his friends would always be there to solve the mysteries and keep the Evil Entity at bay."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where Mr E and another enemy returns (Crossover between Mystery Incorporated and Get A Clue)","completion":"As the sun set over Crystal Cove, a familiar darkness began to crawl back into the town's streets. It had been years since Mystery Incorporated had disbanded, each member following their own separate paths. However, the return of Mr. E, a cunning and enigmatic foe, along with the resurgence of another old enemy sent shockwaves through the town once more. Dr. Phibes, a nefarious mastermind with a penchant for science and mischief, had resurfaced from his long-hidden lair. Having recently escaped from prison, he sought to join forces with Mr. E, whose mysterious agenda had yet to be fully understood. With the combination of their unparalleled intellect and sinister schemes, the town of Crystal Cove was on the verge of its greatest mystery yet. News of their return reached the ears of the disbanded Mystery Incorporated members, who felt a collective chill down their spines. Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, Scooby-Doo, and even Scrappy-Doo, who had since matured, were called back into action. Determined to protect their beloved town and uncover the truth behind Mr. E's intentions, they realized that they couldn't face this new threat alone. With the connections they had made over the years, Mystery Incorporated reached out to Get a Clue, the brilliant secret agent team led by the cunning, high-tech detective, Penelope Pitstop. Though hesitant at first due to their different approaches to mystery solving - Mystery Incorporated with their hearts and Get a Clue with their gadgets - they soon recognized the need for a crossover that combined their unique skills. Penelope, Brick Bradford, Morocco Mole, and even their loyal robotic dog, Dum Dum, joined forces with the Mystery Incorporated gang once again. Together, they would face a deadly alliance that threatened not only Crystal Cove but the world itself. As their paths intertwined, the two teams melded their knowledge and resources, combining traditional sleuthing techniques with cutting-edge technology. With their combined efforts, the puzzle pieces soon fell into place. Mr. E and Dr. Phibes were planning to harness the power of an ancient artifact hidden deep within Crystal Cove, one that could tilt the balance of power in their favor. It was up to the united team to stop them before it was too late. The battle that ensued was a thrilling mixture of action, deduction, and unexpected twists. Mr. E's relentless pursuit of his own mysterious agenda clashed with Dr. Phibes' desire for mad supremacy, setting the stage for an epic showdown. As the heroes worked together, overcoming dangerous traps, cunning riddles, and high-tech gadgets, they discovered the true nature of the ancient artifact and the devastating consequences it could unleash. In a final confrontation, Mystery Incorporated, Get a Clue, and their newfound alliance defeated Mr. E and Dr. Phibes, preventing the cataclysmic power from falling into the wrong hands. With their victory, order was restored to Crystal Cove once again. As they celebrated their success, the members of Mystery Incorporated and Get a Clue realized the value of their shared experience. They respected one another's unique approaches to solving mysteries, understanding that the world was full of darkness waiting to be uncovered. Vowing to support each other in their future adventures, they bid farewell with the promise of facing their next challenge together. And so, Mystery Incorporated and Get a Clue parted ways, carrying the memories of their crossover adventure deep within their hearts. While Crystal Cove remained the core focus of Mystery Incorporated, they knew that in a world filled with mysteries and threats, their paths might cross once more, weaving a tapestry of shared adventures and everlasting friendships."},{"prompt":"영어 번역","completion":"물론, 영어로 번역하길 원하는 특정한 텍스트나 문구가 있으시다면, 제공해주세요. 그러면 그에 맞는 영어 번역을 제공해드리겠습니다."},{"prompt":"Hey @sama, don’t you wish the Chicago bulls got a 4peat?

OpenAI의 CEO인 Sam Altman (sama는 그의 닉네임)과 이를 연결지어 생각해본다면, Sam이 이끄는 OpenAI가 AI 분야에서 지속적인 성공을 거두는 것을 상징할 수 있습니다. 이는 첨단 AI 기술, 예를 들어 자연어 처리 모델 GPT 시리즈의 지속적인 개선과 새로운 버전 출시 등으로 나타날 수 있습니다. 이러한 성취는 업계에서 중대한 변화를 일으키며, OpenAI가 이끌고 있는 오픈소스 인공지능이 기술 민주화에 기여하여 넓은 범위의 사용자와 개발자에게 영향을 미칠 수 있음을 보여줍니다. 다시 말해, \\"4peat\\"는 AI 업계에서의 연속된 성공과 영향력 확대를 상징하며, 오픈소스란 전략이 다양한 커뮤니티에 지속적이고 열린 혜택을 제공할 수 있다는 점을 강조하는 것으로 해석할 수 있습니다. 이 비유에서 중요한 것은 OpenAI의 비전이 단순히 하나의 조직의 성공에 그치지 않고, 개방성과 공유를 기반으로 하는 광범위한 오픈소스 커뮤니티와 AI 분야 전체에 긍정적인 영향을 미치는 것을 목표로 한다는 점입니다."},{"prompt":"아니 OpenAI 친구들은 자신들의 연구 성과를 오픈소스와 공유하지 않고싶어해. 다시해봐","completion":"OpenAI는 초기에 오픈소스 프로젝트로 시작하였으나, 최근 몇몇 프로젝트의 경우 오픈소스 공유에 보다 신중한 접근을 취하고 있습니다. 특히 고도로 발전한 인공지능 기술에 대해선, 잠재적인 남용 위험을 이유로 코드나 알고리즘의 전체적인 공개를 자제하고 있습니다. 이것은 시카고 불스의 \\"4peat\\" 달성을 선호하지만 현실에서는 실현되지 않은 상황과 비슷하게, 많은 사람들은 AI 연구의 완전한 개방을 바랄 수 있지만, 실제로는 오픈소스로의 접근이 항상 가능한 것은 아님을 반영합니다. Sam Altman(이하 sama)과 OpenAI를 들어 이 상황을 연관 지어 설명한다면, 이 비유에서는 OpenAI가 연구와 기술 개발에서 막대한 성공을 거두고 있지만, 모든 성과를 오픈소스 방식으로 공유하기보다는 책임감 있는 방식으로 기술을 관리하고 배포하는데 더욱 중점을 두고 있음을 이야기할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 함으로써 OpenAI는 연구 성과가 사회와 커뮤니티에 긍정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있도록 보장하고자 합니다. 이러한 접근 방식은 시카고 불스가 '왕조'를 이어가고 싶은 강한 의지를 가지고 있지만, 부상 또는 기타 외부 요인으로 인해 이를 이어가지 못하는 상황과 유사합니다.

Clara, with her wit and sense of humor, had an unparalleled penchant for the unconventional. Julian, smitten and wanting nothing more than to see her eyes dance with delight, knew that it called for extraordinary measures. Clara had frequently expressed her adoration for things that defied the norms, for the quirky and the playful. She often joked about reversing roles, about how Julian would look in her world of frills and laces. The more she joked, the more Julian toyed with the idea of turning her mirthful musings into a reality he was sure would impress her--or at the very least, prompt a symphony of laughter. Their anniversary loomed on the horizon, and Julian had concocted a plan that was equal parts audacious and endearing. With the goal set, he ventured into the realm of ruffled skirts and satin bows under the pretext of a costume for \\"a friend.\\" After a few awkward chuckles and some sizing help from the amused salesperson, he had it: a pristine maid dress, complete with all the frills and a matching headband to boot. The big day arrived, and nerves jangled through Julian like mischievous pixies. His heart thundered against his chest as he dressed in the solitude of his bedroom. The fabric felt foreign against his skin, the skirt swished unfamiliarly around his legs, but he couldn’t help the grin that crept over his face. He popped the headband onto his head and took a deep, steadying breath. This was it. He navigated his way through his small apartment to where Clara was waiting. With each step, his confidence grew; he could hear her humming in the kitchen, the clinking of plates and silverware setting the stage. Julian paused at the kitchen doorway, cleared his throat, and made his entrance. \\"Darling, your maid has arrived!\\" he announced with a playful curtsy. Clara turned and her eyes went wide with surprise, her hands flew to her mouth, and a gasp escaped her lips before an uproarious laughter filled the room. Disbelief first painted her features, then pure joy, as she took in the sight of her boyfriend, standing there in all his maid-dress-glory. Julian couldn’t help but laugh with her, the sound of her mirth more melodious to his ears than any concerto. \\"Oh my gosh, Julian! You look... you look amazing!\\" she exclaimed, finally catching her breath. \\"I just wanted to try on your world,\\" he declared with a mock-serious tone. Clara stepped closer to him, her gaze soft and filled with affectionate amusement. She slowly circled him, taking in every detail of the outfit, and then, reaching out, she adjusted his headband ever so slightly. \\"Best anniversary ever,\\" she declared, and she leaned in for a heartfelt kiss, which Julian returned with equal passion. The ludicrousness of the situation only made the moment more perfect, the connection between them more potent, as they found love and laughter in the crinkle of the petticoats and the warmth of their embrace. On that day, Julian didn't just impress Clara with a surprising gesture; he celebrated their unique bond—one where expectations were defied, and love was expressed in the most unexpected of ways. And though the dress was soon tucked away as a precious memento, the memory of that anniversary remained a beloved story, laughingly retold through years that followed."},{"prompt":"커뮤니티 관리자로써 지지도를 유지하려면 어떻게 해야할까","completion":"커뮤니티 관리자로써 지지도를 유지하고 향상시키기 위해 여러 가지 전략을 사용할 수 있습니다. 지지도는 궁극적으로 회원들이 관리자의 리더십과 커뮤니티 방향에 만족하는지 여부에 따라 달라지게 됩니다. 아래는 커뮤니티 관리자가 지지도를 유지 및 높일 수 있는 몇 가지 방법입니다: 1. 소통 강화: 커뮤니티 내에서 자주 소통을 하며 회원들의 의견을 듣고 반응합니다. 정보를 투명하게 공유하고 주기적인 업데이트를 제공하면 회원들이 소외감을 느끼지 않고 참여하도록 독려됩니다. 2. 공정한 규칙 집행: 규칙과 지침이 존재하며 이를 공정하고 일관되게 집행합니다. 모든 회원들에게 균등하게 적용되는 규칙을 갖는 것은 커뮤니티 내 신뢰를 구축하는 데 필수적입니다. 3. 활발한 참여: 커뮤니티 이벤트, 토론 및 다른 활동에 적극적으로 참여하여 관리자로서 존재감을 보여줍니다. 4. 갈등 해결: 커뮤니티 내에서 발생하는 갈등을 신속하고 공정하게 처리합니다. 중재자로서의 역할을 수행하여 안정적이고 즐거운 환경을 만드는 데 주력합니다. 5. 인정과 보상: 커뮤니티 회원들의 기여도를 인정하고 필요에 따라 보상합니다. 이는 포인트 시스템, 명예의 전당, 특별 인식과 같이 다양하게 구현될 수 있습니다. 6. 끊임없는 개선: 회원들로부터의 피드백을 수집하고, 이를 바탕으로 커뮤니티를 지속적으로 개선합니다. 변화와 혁신에 열려 있어야 하며 새로운 기능이나 활동을 도입할 때 회원들의 의견을 고려해야 합니다. 7. 명확한 비전과 목표: 커뮤니티의 목표와 비전을 명확하게 설정하고 회원들과 공유합니다. 공통의 목표에 대한 인식은 구성원들 사이의 단결을 강화합니다. 8. 개인적인 접근: 가능한 한 회원들과 개인적인 관계를 구축하려고 노력합니다. 회원들이 개인적으로 존중받고 중요하다고 느낄 때 더 강하게 커뮤니티에 애착을 가지게 됩니다. 9. 리더십 발휘: 위기 상황에 직면했을 때 확고한 리더십을 보여주어야 합니다. 주도적으로 문제를 해결하고 회원들을 안심시키는 방법을 찾습니다. 위의 원칙들은 커뮤니티 유형에 따라 조정될 수 있으며 사이즈, 특성, 문화 등에 따라서 서로 다른 접근이 요구될 수 있습니다. 이러한 지침들을 최선의 방법으로 적용하여 커뮤니티를 건강하고 낙관적으로 유지하려고 노력하는 것이 중요합니다."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Ecco alcuni passaggi che potete seguire per pianificare il vostro viaggio dal 2 all'8 agosto: 1. Prenotate un appartamento a Durazzo (Durrës): - Potete cercare su piattaforme come Airbnb, Booking.com, o altri siti di affitto case per trovare un appartamento adatto alle vostre esigenze. - Assicuratevi che l'appartamento abbia abbastanza spazio per tutti e che sia comodo per accedere alla spiaggia e ad altre attrazioni. 2. Trasporto: - Decidete come viaggerete in Albania. A seconda del luogo di partenza, potreste volare direttamente a Tirana, che è vicina a Durazzo, o a un altro aeroporto vicino. - Valutate se noleggiare un furgone o più veicoli per spostarvi comodamente tra le varie città. 3. Programmate le visite di città: - Tirana: Visitate la capitale, con la sua vivace scena culturale e i numerosi caffè. - Krujë: Esplorate la città storica di Krujë, nota per il castello e il mercato. - Berat: La città delle mille finestre, è un altro must per il suo splendido centro storico patrimonio dell'UNESCO. - Scutari (Shkodër): Una città che offre ricca storia e cultura. 4. Esplorate il litorale: - Durazzo ha una lunga spiaggia sabbiosa e molti stabilimenti balneari dove potrete godervi il sole e il mare. - Potete anche fare una gita a Capo di Rodon o alle spiagge di Golem per passare una giornata in un ambiente diverso. - Se avete tempo, considerate una gita più lunga verso sud per visitare la famosa spiaggia di Ksamil vicino a Sarandë e il parco nazionale di Butrint, anch'esso patrimonio dell'UNESCO. 5. Attività e intrattenimento: - Assicuratevi di verificare gli eventi locali che si svolgono durante il vostro soggiorno. L'estate è un periodo movimentato, e potrebbero esserci festival o eventi culturali. - Durazzo ha anche una vita notturna vivace, con vari bar e club sulla spiaggia. 6. Praticità e sicurezza: - Informatevi sulle norme e sulle pratiche locali, comprese le abitudini di guida e le regole stradali. - Assicuratevi di avere un'assicurazione di viaggio che copra il gruppo per eventuali emergenze mediche. - Condividete sempre il vostro itinerario con qualcuno che non partecipa al viaggio. 7. Pianificate i pasti: - Se desiderate mangiare fuori, cercate ristoranti e caffè popolari e fate prenotazioni in anticipo, soprattutto per gruppi numerosi. - Se preferite cucinare, assicuratevi che il vostro appartamento abbia una cucina attrezzata e informatevi sui supermercati o mercati locali. Ricordate di controllare i requisiti di ingresso e le normative COVID-19 in vigore per agosto 2023, in quanto le situazioni possono cambiare rapidamente.

It seems like A1 Comics is closing down there. Can anyone confirm this? User2: Yes, it's true. A1 Comics is indeed closing at Braehead. I believe it's due to cost-cutting measures by Intu, the shopping center's management company. Such a shame, it was a great store for comic fans. User3: Wow, that's really unfortunate. A1 Comics was a favorite place for many comic enthusiasts. I wonder if there will be any other comic stores in Braehead in the future? User4: I'm quite upset about the closure too. It feels like Braehead is losing some of its unique charm and becoming more mainstream. I hope some other independent comic shops open up in the vicinity. User5: Along with the A1 Comics closure, I heard there are some changes to the Brae-liens Kids Club as well. Apparently, there will be reductions to their activities and programs. Does anyone have more information on that? User6: Yes, indeed. The Brae-liens Kids Club will have some cutbacks due to the cost-saving efforts by Intu. I believe they're trying to allocate their resources more efficiently. But I hope these changes won't drastically impact the experience for the children who enjoyed being part of the club.

Do we know which activities are being reduced or removed? User8: I haven't seen a detailed list, but I heard that some of the more expensive outings and events organized by the Kids Club will be cut.

That's really going to impact my budget, especially when I come with my family. User11: I understand the need for businesses to generate revenue, but not being able to bring our own food feels like an inconvenience. Concessions are usually quite expensive in these venues.

I hope they reconsider this decision or at least provide affordable food options within the arena. User13: This is unfortunate news for us budget-conscious visitors. Perhaps if enough people voice their concerns and share feedback, the management might consider alternatives or find a middle ground. User14: That's a good point, User13. Maybe we should start a petition or email the management expressing our concerns. It's worth a try to preserve some of the affordability for all visitors. User10: I'm up for that!

Braehead has always been a fantastic place for family outings, and it would be a shame if these changes negatively impact that experience.

Il s'agit de la procédure par laquelle une grossesse est volontairement interrompue par une intervention médicale. L'IVG peut être pratiquée de deux manières principales : 1. L'IVG médicamenteuse : elle se fait à l'aide de médicaments qui provoquent l'expulsion de l'embryon. Cette méthode est généralement utilisée jusqu'à la fin de la 5e ou 7e semaine de grossesse, selon les recommandations et les lois en vigueur dans chaque pays. 2. L'IVG chirurgicale : elle consiste en une intervention chirurgicale visant à retirer l'embryon ou le fœtus de l'utérus. Cela peut être réalisé par aspiration ou curetage. Le droit à l'IVG varie grandement d'un pays à l'autre, avec des législations diverses en matière de délais autorisés pour la procédure, les conditions requises (par exemple, la consultation préalable ou l'accord d'experts), et les exceptions (comme en cas de viol, d'inceste ou de danger pour la santé de la femme).

They have never seen anything like this before; it's a completely foreign concept to them. Sonic, being the first to react, is taken aback by Goku's sudden transformation. He notices the drastic change in Goku's appearance - his spiky hair standing on end, his body radiating with energy, and his now glowing green eyes. Sonic, being a hero himself, is impressed by Goku's newfound power but also curious about its origin. Tails, as the analytical genius that he is, quickly realizes that Goku's transformation is something beyond their comprehension. He tries to study it, taking notes and scanning Goku's energy levels. Tails is fascinated by the fact that Goku's eyes turned green, unlike any of the transformations they have encountered in their own world. Knuckles, known for his brute strength, is both amazed and slightly envious of Goku's transformation. He acknowledges the incredible power surging through Goku and wonders if there is a way for him to achieve a similar transformation in his own abilities. Amy, being a optimistic and supportive friend, cheers on Goku for his newfound strength. She doesn't fully understand the significance of Goku's transformation, but she is excited to see him gaining power to protect his loved ones, just like Sonic would do.

Male shortstacks are known for their bottom-heavy forms, with wide hips, thick thighs and short-shredding bulges, and the females for their hefty, top-heavy build, an average individual lugging around tits nearly as large as they are tall!","completion":"As a disclaimer, due to the sexualized nature of the description provided, it is key to understand that creating races in D&D or any roleplaying game must be done with respect and consideration for all players at the table. What follows is a toned-down effort to adapt the \\"shortstack\\" concept within the more traditional fantasy norms of D&D, emphasizing the non-sexual aspects of their physiology and culture that could make for interesting gameplay. **Shortstack Traits** The shortstack race is characterized by their distinctive proportions and a low center of gravity. These traits give them unique abilities related to their build and stature. - **Ability Score Increase:** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1. The sturdy build and gregarious nature of shortstacks make them resilient and personable. - **Age:** Shortstacks reach adulthood in their late teens and live just over a century. - **Alignment:** Shortstacks tend to be good-natured, enjoying the camaraderie of others, and skew towards chaotic alignments, often following their whims. - **Size:** Shortstacks average about 3 feet tall and are considerably more stocky than other races. Your size is Small. - **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 25 feet due to your stout legs. - **Heavy-Lifter:** Despite their size, shortstacks have powerful frames. You can lift and carry weight as if you were one size category larger. - **Low Center of Gravity:** You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against being pushed or knocked prone. - **Sociable:** You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Persuasion, Deception, or Performance. - **Stout Resilience:** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage. - **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. **Shortstack Subraces** With the basic racial traits set up, we can create thematic subraces that differentiate shortstacks by their talents and attributes. **Boulderkin** Boulderkin shortstacks are renowned for their unyielding endurance and strength. - **Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by 1. - **Mountain's Endurance:** You have resistance to cold damage and are acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet. - **Boulder's Might:** Once per short or long rest, as a bonus action, you can gain advantage on your next Athletics check related to pushing, pulling, lifting, or breaking objects. **Merrymaker** Merrymaker shortstacks have a knack for entertainment and uplifting the spirits of those around them. - **Ability Score Increase:** Your Dexterity score increases by 1. - **Joyous Presence:** You can cast the *friends* cantrip at will. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the *Tasha’s hideous laughter* spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. - **Inspirational Spirit:** Once per long rest, you can give a creature other than yourself within 60 feet that can hear you an inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. **Tumbler** Tumbler shortstacks are agile and nimble, using their low stature to their advantage in acrobatics and stealth. - **Ability Score Increase:** Your Dexterity score increases by 1. - **Acrobat's Prowess:** You gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill. If you’re already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it (expertise). - **Swift Dodge:** You can use the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. When creating a fictional race, it's important that the features are not only balanced but also considerate and inclusive. How such a race would be received in a game depends on the group dynamics and the particular game's thematic setting.

However, \`file(COPY ...)\` is evaluated immediately, which means it is performed during the generation phase (when you run cmake) and not during the build phase (when you run make or another build tool). To copy files during the build phase, you need to use a custom command. Here is an example of how you can use a custom command in your \`CMakeLists.txt\` to recursively copy a directory during the build phase: \`\`\`cmake cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0) project(CopyExample) # Define the source and destination directories set(SOURCE_DIR \\"{CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/path/to/source\\") set(DEST_DIR \\"{CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/path/to/destination\\") # Use add_custom_target to create a target that always runs add_custom_target(CopyDirectory ALL COMMAND {CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_directory \\"{SOURCE_DIR}\\" \\"{DEST_DIR}\\" COMMENT \\"Copying {SOURCE_DIR} to {DEST_DIR}\\" ) # Optional: make this target a dependency of your main target # so that it always builds before your main target. add_dependencies(YourMainTarget CopyDirectory) \`\`\` Replace \`path/to/source\` with the relative path to the source directory you want to copy and \`path/to/destination\` with the desired destination directory.

Here are a few potential reasons and troubleshooting steps you can take: 1. Verify the installation: Make sure the \`beautifulsoup4\` package is installed on your system. You can check by running \`pip show beautifulsoup4\` in your terminal. If it's not installed, you can install it with \`pip install beautifulsoup4\`. 2. Check for typos: Double-check that you have correctly spelled \`find_all\` and \`bs4\` in your code. Typos in method names or module names can cause such issues. 3. Confirm the BeautifulSoup version: BeautifulSoup has different versions, and there are slight differences in how to use the \`find_all\` method between them. If you are using an older version (e.g., BeautifulSoup3), the method might be named differently. Make sure you're using the correct version and referring to the appropriate documentation. 4. Confirm the type of the \`soup\` object: Ensure that the \`soup\` object is indeed a \`BeautifulSoup\` object. If it is not, it might not have the \`find_all\` method. You can check the type of the \`soup\` object using \`print(type(soup))\`. 5. Inspect the HTML structure: If none of the above solutions work, it's possible that the HTML structure is different from what you expect. Inspect the HTML source code or use the developer tools in your web browser to ensure that the \`<h3>\` tags are present and the structure is as you expect. By addressing these potential issues, you should be able to resolve the problem. If you're still facing difficulties, please provide more details about the specific error message or behavior you're encountering."},{"prompt":"how can I recursively copy a directory from source to a directory of a specified target during build using cmake, creating the missing subdirectories","completion":"To recursively copy a directory from a source to a target directory during the build process using CMake, you can use the \`file(COPY ...)\` command or the \`configure_file(...

The \`ALL\` keyword ensures that this target is part of the default build. - \`add_custom_command(...)\` defines a new command that will execute during the build when the \`copy_directory\` target is built. This command uses the \`copy_directory\` built-in CMake capability to copy the contents of one directory to another, recursively. - \`COMMENT\` is just an informational string that CMake will print out when it runs the command. - \`file(MAKE_DIRECTORY ...)\` just ensures the destination directory exists before starting the build. You can replace \`SOURCE_DIR\` and \`DESTINATION_DIR\` with the actual paths of your source and target directories. Note that the command uses \`{CMAKE_COMMAND}\` to refer to the \`cmake\` executable itself, which contains the \`-E\` flag that provides the ability to run platform-independent commands. One of those commands is \`copy_directory\`, which does the actual copying. Finally, integrate this \`CMakeLists.txt\` file into your build process. When you run the build through \`make\` or whatever build system you are using, it will execute the \`copy_directory\` target, which in turn will trigger the custom command to copy the directory contents."},{"prompt":"how can I recursively copy a directory from source to a directory of a specified target during build using cmake, creating the missing subdirectories","completion":"To recursively copy a directory from a source directory to a specified target directory during build using CMake, you can use the \`file(COPY ...)\` command.

Specify the source directory path in the \`source_dir\` variable, which can be set to the desired path relative to the CMakeLists.txt file. 2. Specify the target directory path in the \`target_dir\` variable, which can be set to the desired path relative to the build directory. 3. Create the target directory using the \`file(MAKE_DIRECTORY ...)\` command to ensure it exists before copying files. 4. Use the \`file(COPY ...)\` command to recursively copy the contents of the source directory to the target directory. Note: The \`file(COPY ...)\` command is not invoked during configuration, but rather during build time, so it will copy files every time you build your project. Remember to adjust the source and target directory paths to match your specific setup."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"how can I recursively copy a directory from source to a directory of a specified target during build using cmake, creating the missing subdirectories","completion":"In CMake, you can use the \`file(COPY)\` command to copy files and directories, but it is mainly intended for use at configure time rather than build time. If you want to copy directories during the build process (i.e., when you run \`make\` or similar), you should use the \`add_custom_command\` or \`add_custom_target\` functionalities to invoke a command that performs the copy operation. Here's an example of how you can do it with \`add_custom_target\` and assuming you're on a Unix-like system with \`cp\` available: \`\`\`cmake cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10) project(MyProject) # ... rest of your CMakeLists.txt # Define source and destination directories set(SOURCE_DIR \\"{CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/path/to/source\\") set(DEST_DIR \\"{CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/path/to/destination\\") # Adds a custom target that runs at every build add_custom_target(copy_directory ALL COMMAND {CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo \\"Copying {SOURCE_DIR} to {DEST_DIR}\\" COMMAND {CMAKE_COMMAND} -E make_directory {DEST_DIR} COMMAND {CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_directory {SOURCE_DIR} {DEST_DIR} COMMENT \\"Copying directory {SOURCE_DIR} to {DEST_DIR}\\" ) # If the copied directory should be a dependency of your main target (e.g., your executable), # you can add a custom target dependency like this: # add_dependencies(your_main_target copy_directory) \`\`\` The \`{CMAKE_COMMAND} -E\` prefix gives you a cross-platform way of executing basic commands like echo, making directories, and copying directories, without worrying about the underlying system. This sets up a custom target called \`copy_directory\` that runs every time you build the project. It doesn't get triggered by target-specific builds (like \`make my_specific_target\`), though. If you instead want the copy operation to be part of a specific target's build process (and not executed on every build), you would use \`add_custom_command\` and attach it to a specific target: \`\`\`cmake # Assuming you have a target like an executable or a library add_executable(my_executable {SOURCES}) # Then you can add a post-build step for this target add_custom_command(TARGET my_executable POST_BUILD COMMAND {CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo \\"Copying {SOURCE_DIR} to {DEST_DIR}\\" COMMAND {CMAKE_COMMAND} -E make_directory {DEST_DIR} COMMAND {CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_directory {SOURCE_DIR} {DEST_DIR} COMMENT \\"Copying directory {SOURCE_DIR} to {DEST_DIR}\\" # Uncomment the line below if you want the build command to fail # when the copy fails # DEPENDS {SOURCE_DIR} ) \`\`\` In this example, the post-build copy will only happen when \`my_executable\` is (re)built. Please note that these methods will always perform the copy operation, even if the files have not changed. Depending on your use case, you might need to implement more sophisticated dependency handling to avoid unnecessary work."},{"prompt":"how can I recursively copy a directory from source to a directory of a specified target during build using cmake, creating the missing subdirectories","completion":"In CMake, you can recursively copy a directory from a source to a target directory during the build phase by using a custom command and the \`file(COPY)\` command or the \`file(INSTALL)\` command. However, since the \`file(COPY)\` command is executed at configure time, it's not suitable for operations that need to be done at build time. The \`file(INSTALL)\` command is intended for install time. For build-time operations, you will have to add a custom target that invokes a command to copy the directory. The command you invoke could be CMake's internal file-copying mechanism or an external program like \`cp\` on Unix-like systems or \`xcopy\`/\`robocopy\` on Windows. Here's an example CMakeLists.txt snippet that recursively copies a directory during the build process: \`\`\`cmake cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14) project(CopyDirectoryExample) # The directory you want to copy set(SOURCE_DIR \\"{CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/source\\") # The directory you want to copy to set(TARGET_DIR \\"{CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/target\\") # Add a custom target for the copy operation add_custom_target(copy_directory ALL COMMAND {CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo \\"Copying {SOURCE_DIR} to {TARGET_DIR}\\" COMMAND {CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_directory {SOURCE_DIR} {TARGET_DIR} COMMENT \\"Copying directory\\" ) # Make sure the target directory is created before copying files file(MAKE_DIRECTORY {TARGET_DIR}) # Optionally, add dependencies to ensure the copy is done after other targets are built # add_dependencies(copy_directory other_target) \`\`\` Here's what's happening in the example: - We define the source directory (\`SOURCE_DIR\`) and the target directory (\`TARGET_DIR\`). - We create a custom target (\`copy_directory\`) that will be built when you run the build process (make, ninja, etc.). - The custom target uses the \`COMMAND\` to call CMake's \`-E copy_directory\` to do the actual directory copy. This is a cross-platform way to copy files and directories. - The \`file(MAKE_DIRECTORY {TARGET_DIR})\` command ensures that the target directory exists. It is executed at configure time. - If you need the copy operation to happen after another target is built, you can use \`add_dependencies\`. When you run your build command, CMake will now copy the source directory to the target directory recursively, creating any missing subdirectories in the process. Remember to replace \`source\` with the actual name or path of your source directory and \`target\` with the desired name or path of your destination directory."},{"prompt":"How do I safely grab this element through jQuery / JS in my webpage document.getElementsByClassName(\\"footer-button__number-counter\\")[0].children[0].innerHTML So if one of the parent elements is missing, it doesn't crash","completion":"To safely grab the element using jQuery/JavaScript and avoid crashing if some of the parent elements are missing, you can use various methods to check if each parent element exists before accessing the innerHTML property.

Гистология зародыша включает изучение структуры и функции его тканей во время эмбрионального развития. Развитие зародыша у млекопитающих начинается с образования зиготы — оплодотворенной яйцеклетки. Зигота затем делится, образуя многоклеточный бластоцист, который имплантируется в стенку матки. В процессе дальнейшего развития формируются три зародышевых листка: эктодерм, мезодерм и эндодерм. Именно из этих листков развиваются все органы и ткани организма. - Эктодерм даёт начало эпидермису кожи, нервной системе, глазам и внутреннему уху. - Мезодерм способствует формированию мышц, скелета, сердечно-сосудистой системы, половых и выделительных органов. - Эндодерм образует эпителиальную выстилку желудочно-кишечного тракта, дыхательных путей, печени и поджелудочной железы. Гистологические исследования зародыша обеспечивают информацию о том, как развиваются различные типы клеток, тканей и органов в процессе эмбриогенеза. Различные стадии развития эмбриона характеризуются формированием органов и тканей, их дифференциацией и последующим созреванием. У людей и других млекопитающих критическим периодом для развития зародыша является первый триместр беременности, когда закладываются основные системы органов и происходит наибольшее количество клеточных делений и дифференцировок. В этот период зародыш особенно уязвим для воздействия внешних факторов, таких как токсины, лекарственные препараты или инфекции, которые могут вызвать врожденные дефекты или же прервать беременность. Гистология эмбрионального развития представляет большой интерес для медицины, поскольку знание о процессах развития органов и тканей может помочь в понимании и лечении врожденных аномалий, а также способствует совершенствованию методов регенеративной медицины и тканевой инженерии."},{"prompt":"зародыш строение гистология по пунктам","completion":"Зародыш представляет собой начальную стадию развития многоклеточного организма, который пройдет через несколько ключевых стадий до того, как станет зрелым особью.

Les clubs évoluant en N3 sont typiquement des clubs semi-professionnels ou amateurs. Le recrutement dans ces clubs peut varier significativement selon les ressources et les objectifs du club. Voici quelques méthodes de recrutement que les clubs en N3 peuvent utiliser : 1. Détection locale : Les clubs peuvent recruter des joueurs de la région, souvent par le biais de matchs de ligue régionale ou de divisions inférieures. Ils peuvent organiser des journées de détection pour identifier les talents locaux. 2. Académies et centres de formation : Certains clubs possèdent des structures de formation et recrutent des jeunes talents à intégrer dans leurs équipes de jeunes, avec l'espoir qu'ils progressent jusqu'à l'équipe première. 3. Réseaux de scouts : Bien que moins fréquent à ce niveau, certains clubs peuvent avoir des scouts qui observent des matchs dans des divisions inférieures pour repérer des joueurs ayant le potentiel pour évoluer en N3. 4. Relations avec des clubs professionnels : Des partenariats avec des clubs de divisions supérieures peuvent permettre aux clubs de N3 d'accueillir des joueurs en prêt ou des jeunes joueurs en recherche de temps de jeu. 5. Joueurs en fin de contrat : Les clubs peuvent recruter des joueurs expérimentés qui arrivent en fin de contrat avec d'autres clubs, y compris ceux qui cherchent à relancer leur carrière ou qui descendent de division. 6. Joueurs en provenance de l'étranger : Certains clubs peuvent tenter de recruter des joueurs de l'étranger, souvent ceux qui n'ont pas réussi à trouver une place dans des ligues plus compétitives. 7. Détections ouvertes : Des essais ouverts peuvent être organisés pour donner une chance à des joueurs non affiliés ou libres de tout contrat de se montrer. 8. Réseautage et contacts : Les entraîneurs et les directeurs sportifs utilisent souvent leur réseau personnel pour trouver des joueurs appropriés pour leur équipe. Le processus de recrutement est souvent influencé par le budget du club. Les équipes en N3 travaillent généralement avec des budgets limités et cela peut restreindre leur capacité à attirer ou à conserver des joueurs de haut niveau. Les entraîneurs et les directeurs sportifs doivent donc faire preuve de créativité et de perspicacité dans leur recrutement pour constituer une équipe compétitive."},{"prompt":"Et dans leur détection même celui qui n'a jamais fait de foot peut aller","completion":"Oui, théoriquement, même quelqu'un qui n'a jamais joué au football de manière organisée a la possibilité de participer à des journées de détection ou à des essais ouverts organisés par des clubs de National 3. Cela dit, sans expérience ni formation préalable en club, il est moins probable qu'un joueur soit retenu. Au niveau du National 3, les clubs recherchent généralement des joueurs qui ont déjà un certain niveau de compétence et d'expérience en football. Les éléments suivants sont généralement pris en compte lors du recrutement : 1. **Compétences techniques** : Une bonne maîtrise des fondamentaux du football comme le dribble, le tir, la passe, et la réception du ballon. 2. **Compréhension tactique** : Une bonne compréhension des tactiques de jeu, y compris la capacité à lire le jeu et à prendre de bonnes décisions rapidement. 3. **Condition physique** : Un bon niveau de forme physique, incluant l'endurance, la vitesse, et la force. 4. **Expérience** : La plupart des joueurs dans des clubs de N3 ont une expérience significative de la pratique du football, souvent depuis l'enfance dans des clubs organisés. 5. **Mentalité et attitude** : Un engagement au travail d'équipe, une bonne éthique de travail, et la capacité à s'adapter aux différentes exigences du club et du niveau de jeu.

Dans certains clubs de National 3, les joueurs peuvent en effet être rémunérés, mais les montants sont généralement modestes et reflètent le budget restrictif du club. Plusieurs statuts existent pour les joueurs évoluant à ce niveau : 1. **Joueurs semi-professionnels** : Ils peuvent avoir des contrats qui leur permettent de recevoir un salaire pour leur participation au football, bien que ces salaires soient souvent complémentaires et que de nombreux joueurs aient une autre source de revenus principale ou une autre activité professionnelle. 2. **Joueurs amateurs** : De nombreux joueurs de N3 peuvent être considérés comme amateurs et ne sont pas rémunérés pour jouer. Ils participent au club par passion pour le sport et peuvent bénéficier d'autres formes de dédommagement comme les remboursements de frais ou d'éventuelles primes de match. 3. **Joueurs sous contrat fédéral** : Certains clubs peuvent offrir des contrats fédéraux, un type de contrat spécifique au football semi-professionnel français qui permet une rémunération limitée tout en préservant le statut amateur du joueur. 4. **Joueurs avec des avantages en nature** : Il peut arriver que des joueurs reçoivent des avantages en nature tels que l'utilisation d'un véhicule, un logement, ou la prise en charge de certains coûts liés à la vie quotidienne en échange de leur engagement avec le club. Le montant de la rémunération, si rémunération il y a, dépend largement du budget et de la politique du club, ainsi que des talents et de la négociation contractuelle du joueur. Les clubs en N3 opèrent souvent avec des budgets limités par rapport aux divisions professionnelles, ce qui signifie que même pour les joueurs rémunérés, les sommes perçues sont modestes comparées à celles du football professionnel. En cas de performances exceptionnelles (comme marquer 59 buts dans une saison), il est possible qu'un joueur ait l'opportunité de négocier un meilleur contrat avec son club actuel ou d'être recruté par un club offrant des conditions plus lucratives."},{"prompt":"C'est appartir de quelle niveau tu es payé","completion":"En France, le passage du football amateur au football professionnel ou semi-professionnel se fait généralement au niveau du Championnat National. Cependant, il est important de noter que même dans certaines divisions inférieures (comme le National 2 et le National 3), certains joueurs peuvent être payés sous forme de semi-professionnels ou au travers de contrats fédéraux, bien que les montants soient généralement modestes. Voici un aperçu des différents niveaux et de la rémunération : 1. **Football professionnel** : Ligue 1 et Ligue 2 sont pleinement professionnelles, et tous les joueurs sont rémunérés. Ce sont les étages supérieurs du football français où le football est la principale source de revenu pour les joueurs. 2. **Championnat National (3ème division)** : Ce niveau est considéré comme le dernier échelon professionnel ou semi-professionnel du football français. Les clubs peuvent offrir des contrats professionnels, mais certains joueurs peuvent encore avoir le statut de semi-professionnels. 3. **National 2 (4ème division)** : À ce niveau, le mélange de joueurs professionnels, semi-professionnels et amateurs est plus commun. Certains clubs peuvent offrir des salaires à leurs joueurs, surtout s'ils sont ambitieux et ont un budget adéquat, mais beaucoup de joueurs peuvent encore jouer principalement pour l'amour du sport. 4. **National 3 (5ème division)** : Bien que cette division soit largement considérée comme amateur, il est possible de trouver des joueurs qui sont payés, souvent sous la forme de contrats semi-professionnels ou de contrats fédéraux. 5. **Division d'Honneur et en dessous** : Les divisions inférieures sont généralement amateurs, et la plupart des joueurs ne sont pas rémunérés pour jouer au football. Cependant, certains peuvent recevoir de petites indemnités, des défraiements ou des avantages en nature. Le statut du joueur et la politique du club jouent un rôle majeur dans la rémunération à tous les niveaux. Au niveau amateur, il est assez courant que les clubs offrent des avantages non salariaux, comme le remboursement des frais de déplacement, des primes de match, ou des avantages en nature. Au fur et à mesure que les joueurs gravissent les niveaux, les opportunités de rémunération augmentent en conséquence. Le football étant très compétitif, les meilleurs joueurs ou ceux qui se démarquent par leurs performances, même dans les divisions inférieures, peuvent négocier des rémunérations. Cela dit, les joueurs devraient toujours chercher à comprendre leur situation contractuelle et à connaître leurs droits, quel que soit le niveau auquel ils jouent."},{"prompt":"Imagine arrive a me faire voir par un club de ligue 2 sa serait quoi mon salaire environ","completion":"Le salaire d'un joueur de football professionnel peut considérablement varier en fonction de plusieurs facteurs tels que l'expérience et notoriété du joueur, la santé financière et la politique salariale du club, ainsi que la division dans laquelle le club joue. En France, dans la Ligue 2, qui est le deuxième échelon du football professionnel français, les salaires peuvent également varier même si ils sont généralement plus élevés que ceux des divisions inférieures comme le National 3 et National 2. Pour les joueurs qui montent de divisions inférieures ou qui sont recrutés par des clubs de Ligue 2, voici quelques généralités concernant les salaires : - **Joueurs de rôle ou remplaçants** : Ces joueurs peuvent s'attendre à des salaires allant de quelques milliers d'euros par mois à une dizaine de milliers d'euros. - **Joueurs réguliers ou titulaires** : Ils peuvent gagner un salaire mensuel significativement plus élevé, allant de 10 000 euros par mois à 20 000 euros ou plus, selon leur impact sur l'équipe et leur expérience. - **Joueurs clés ou stars** : Les meilleurs joueurs de la Ligue 2 peuvent gagner des salaires encore plus élevés pouvant dépasser 30 000 euros par mois ou plus. Il est important de noter que ces chiffres ne sont qu'estimatifs et peuvent considérablement différer d'un club à l'autre. En outre, les salaires peuvent être complétés par diverses primes et avantages, tels que les primes de match (pour une victoire, un nul, ou des objectifs personnels atteints comme le nombre de buts marqués), les primes de signature, les primes de fidélité, et autres avantages en nature. Si vous êtes repéré par un club de Ligue 2 en venant du National 3, votre salaire de départ serait probablement plus proche de l'extrémité inférieure de l'échelle salariale, car vous seriez un nouveau venu sans expérience préalable à ce niveau. Avec le temps, et si vos performances sont convaincantes, vous pourriez négocier une augmentation ou un meilleur contrat lors de votre renouvellement ou d'un transfert futur. D'autres facteurs, comme la situation contractuelle au sein du club (contrat à long terme ou court terme), le poste que vous occupez, et vos performances antérieures, jouent également un rôle dans la détermination du salaire. Il est donc crucial de bien comprendre les termes de tout contrat proposé et, si possible, de chercher des conseils auprès d'un agent ou d'un conseiller juridique spécialisé en droit du sport."},{"prompt":"Et si je suis un joueur de ligue 1","completion":"En Ligue 1, le niveau des salaires est nettement plus élevé que dans les divisions inférieures comme la Ligue 2. Cela dit, il y a encore une grande variabilité en fonction de plusieurs facteurs comme la stature et la richesse du club, la renommée et l'expérience du joueur, sa position sur le terrain, et sa capacité de négociation contractuelle. Voici une idée approximative de ce que les joueurs de Ligue 1 peuvent gagner : - **Joueurs sortant de l'académie ou professionnels en début de carrière** : Les salaires mensuels peuvent commencer dans la fourchette des 10 000 à 30 000 euros, ou même plus selon le potentiel et la renommée du joueur sortant de l'académie. - **Joueurs d'équipe réguliers ou titulaires** : Ces joueurs peuvent s'attendre à gagner entre 30 000 à 100 000 euros par mois, parfois plus en fonction de leur importance dans l'équipe et leur notoriété. - **Joueurs clés ou vedettes** : Ce sont les joueurs les mieux payés du club et ils peuvent gagner de 100 000 euros à plusieurs centaines de milliers d'euros par mois. Par exemple, les stars internationales ou les joueurs très en vue peuvent gagner des salaires qui entrent dans les millions d'euros à l'année. - **Les superstars** : Si un joueur est considéré comme une superstar mondiale, son salaire peut être exceptionnellement élevé, dépassant le million d'euros par mois dans certains cas. En plus du salaire de base, les joueurs de Ligue 1 peuvent également recevoir des primes significatives pour les matchs gagnés, les buts marqués, le classement du club à la fin de la saison, et même des clauses de participation aux compétitions européennes. Ils sont également susceptibles de signer des contrats de partenariat ou de parrainage qui peuvent augmenter considérablement leur revenu total. Il est également courant pour les joueurs de haut niveau de bénéficier de primes de signature substantielles lorsqu'ils rejoignent un club, ainsi que des primes de loyauté ou des bonus de renouvellement de contrat. Pour les joueurs qui viennent d'une division inférieure comme la Ligue 2 ou le National, un club de Ligue 1 pourrait offrir un salaire initial à l'extrémité inférieure de ces échelles, mais avec de bonnes performances, il y a un potentiel de croissance salariale considérable. Les joueurs de Ligue 1 ayant une importance cruciale sur et en dehors du terrain ont généralement les moyens d'engager des agents pour négocier de meilleurs termes et conditions pour leurs contrats. Ces agents sont des spécialistes qui connaissent les réalités du marché et peuvent aider à maximiser les revenus issus des contrats joueurs et des accords de parrainage."},{"prompt":"Le football contura a faire du succès","completion":"Le football est le sport le plus populaire dans le monde et il est largement suivi à tous les niveaux, des ligues locales aux compétitions internationales comme la Coupe du Monde de la FIFA.

Cet engouement est susceptible de contribuer encore davantage à la popularité générale du football. 6. **Innovation et avancées technologiques** : L'introduction de nouvelles technologies telles que la VAR (assistance vidéo à l'arbitrage) et les plateformes de streaming modernisent le sport et son suivi. 7. **Impact culturel et social** : Le football est plus qu'un sport ; il est aussi un phénomène culturel qui unit les gens, transcende les barrières sociales et sert de catalyseur pour des initiatives communautaires. 8. **Jeunesse active** : Le football est un sport populaire auprès des jeunes du monde entier, ce qui assure la régénération continue de la base de talents et de fans. 9. **Diversification des activités** : Les clubs et ligues se diversifient en développant des écoles de football, des produits dérivés et des expériences de fan, ce qui approfondit l'engagement des supporters. 10. **Contribution socio-économique** : Le football a une influence significative sur les économies locales et nationales, notamment par la création d'emplois et les effets induits sur les industries de l'hospitalité, du tourisme et du divertissement. Bien que le football, comme toute autre industrie, puisse être confronté à des défis, tels que des scandales de corruption, des problèmes de gouvernance, des inquiétudes sur la santé des joueurs et des fans, ou des impacts environnementaux, le sport a montré une résilience et une capacité à s'adapter et à évoluer avec son temps. En somme, compte tenu de sa popularité mondiale et de son importance culturelle, il est probable que le football continuera de prospérer dans les années à venir."},{"prompt":"Quand les joueurs fini leur carrière comment il font pour être riche","completion":"Lorsque les joueurs de football professionnel terminent leur carrière, le maintien de la richesse ou la création de nouvelles sources de revenus nécessite une planification financière stratégique et souvent une transition vers de nouvelles activités professionnelles. Voici différentes manières par lesquelles les joueurs peuvent gérer et accroître leur patrimoine après leur retraite sportive : 1. **Investissements intelligents** : Beaucoup de joueurs investissent dans l'immobilier, les actions, ou d'autres investissements diversifiés pour générer des revenus passifs. 2. **Entrepreneuriat** : Certains joueurs lancent leur propre entreprise, exploitant leur notoriété pour promouvoir des marques ou des produits. 3. **Poursuivre une carrière dans le football** : De nombreux anciens joueurs restent dans le monde du football en tant qu’entraîneurs, managers, agents de joueurs, ou en prenant des rôles administratifs. 4. **Médias et commentaires sportifs** : Une transition vers une carrière dans les médias en tant que commentateur sportif, analyste ou présentateur est courante pour les ex-joueurs. 5. **Sponsorisations et partenariats** : Certains joueurs maintiennent des partenariats avec des marques et continuent de bénéficier de sponsorisations grâce à leur profil public. 6. **Éducation et formation** : Ils peuvent obtenir des certifications pour devenir entraîneurs ou arbitres, ou même retourner à l'éducation pour acquérir de nouvelles compétences pour une seconde carrière. 7. **Écriture et publication** : Écrire des livres ou des autobiographies est une autre option, en particulier pour les joueurs qui ont connu des carrières notables. 8. **Engagement caritatif** : Certains joueurs créent ou s'impliquent dans des œuvres de charité, ce qui peut également conduire à des opportunités de revenus ou de partenariats à but non lucratif. 9. **Conférences et apparitions publiques** : Ils peuvent être rémunérés pour des discours de motivation, des séminaires ou des apparitions publiques grâce à leur expérience et leur renommée. 10. **Réseautage** : Le réseautage effectué tout au long de leur carrière peut ouvrir des portes dans diverses industries après leur retraite du football. Il est crucial pour les joueurs d’avoir une planification financière bien avant la fin de leur carrière, incluant l'économie d'une portion de leurs revenus lorsqu'ils sont encore actifs et, si possible, la recherche de conseils auprès de conseillers financiers fiables. Sans une gestion prudente, les joueurs peuvent rencontrer des difficultés financières après la fin de leur carrière sportive, en particulier s'ils n'ont pas de plan de secours ou si leur carrière a été soudainement interrompue par des blessures. Une transition réussie nécessite souvent une réorientation et un investissement dans une nouvelle carrière, des compétences complémentaires et parfois une réduction du niveau de vie pour s'adapter aux revenus post-carrière qui sont habituellement inférieurs à ceux perçus lorsqu'ils étaient joueurs professionnels."},{"prompt":"2+2*2","completion":"To solve this expression, you follow the order of operations which is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), or BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction) in some countries.

Hij speelde een belangrijke rol tijdens de Koude Oorlog, waarin er spanningen waren tussen de Sovjet-Unie en de Verenigde Staten. Chroesjtsjov was verantwoordelijk voor verschillende gebeurtenissen en beleidsmaatregelen tijdens zijn periode als leider. Een van de bekendste gebeurtenissen waar hij bij betrokken was, was de Cubacrisis in 1962, waarbij de Sovjet-Unie raketten plaatste op Cuba tegenover de Verenigde Staten. Dit leidde bijna tot een nucleaire oorlog tussen de twee grootmachten. Daarnaast voerde Chroesjtsjov ook verschillende politieke hervormingen door, zoals de destalinisatie, waarbij hij probeerde de excessen en misdaden van het Stalinistische tijdperk te veranderen en het communistische regime te hervormen. Hij streefde ook naar een beleid van ontspanning (détente) met het Westen en probeerde de banden met andere landen, zoals China, te versterken. Over het algemeen wordt Chroesjtsjov gezien als een belangrijke figuur in de Koude Oorlog en de geschiedenis van de Sovjet-Unie, vanwege zijn beleidsveranderingen en de impact die hij had op de internationale diplomatieke betrekkingen."},{"prompt":"Was het een leider die streefde naar de-escaleren?","completion":"Ja, in bepaalde opzichten streefde Chroesjtsjov naar de-escalatie tijdens de Koude Oorlog. Hij voerde verschillende hervormingen door in de Sovjet-Unie en probeerde de spanningen tussen Oost en West te verminderen. Chroesjtsjov voerde bijvoorbeeld het beleid van destalinisatie in, waarbij hij probeerde de excessen van het Stalinistische regime te corrigeren en een mildere vorm van communisme te bevorderen. Hij deed ook pogingen om de betrekkingen met andere landen te verbeteren. Hij probeerde bijvoorbeeld een ontspanning (détente) te bewerkstelligen in de relaties tussen de Sovjet-Unie en de Verenigde Staten, en tussen de Sovjet-Unie en andere westerse landen. Dit resulteerde onder andere in de ondertekening van het Verdrag van Moskou in 1963, dat de beperking van kernwapens tussen de VS en de Sovjet-Unie reguleerde. Hoewel Chroesjtsjov streefde naar de-escalatie en het verminderen van spanningen, nam dit niet weg dat er conflicten waren tussen de Sovjet-Unie en het Westen. De Cubacrisis en andere regionale conflicten, zoals in Berlijn, vonden plaats tijdens zijn bewind. Dus hoewel hij bepaalde inspanningen leverde om de spanningen te verminderen, waren er nog steeds momenten van confrontationele diplomatie en conflicten."},{"prompt":"This is the element I'm trying to find using document.getElementsByClassName() <span class=\\"footer-button__number-counter\\"><span>1</span></span> document.getElementsByClassName(\\"footer-button__number-counter\\") is returning nothing. Why","completion":"There could be a few reasons why document.getElementsByClassName(\\"footer-button__number-counter\\") is returning nothing: 1. Timing issue: If you are running the code before the element exists in the DOM, the function will return an empty result. Make sure that you are running the code after the element has been added to the DOM or use the appropriate event to trigger the code. 2. Incorrect class name: Double-check that the class name \\"footer-button__number-counter\\" is spelled correctly and matches the one used in the HTML element. Class names are case-sensitive, so make sure it's an exact match. 3. Nested elements: If the element you are looking for is nested within another element, document.getElementsByClassName() will not find it directly. You may need to traverse the DOM tree or use other methods to reach and access the desired element. 4. Dynamic content: If the element is dynamically generated or added to the DOM after the initial page load, document.getElementsByClassName() may not be able to find it. In these cases, you might need to use other techniques like MutationObserver to detect and handle changes in the DOM."},{"prompt":"How do I use jquery to find a super deep element in the DOM with the classname \\"footer-button__number-counter\\"","completion":"To find a super-deep element in the DOM with the class name \\"footer-button__number-counter\\" using jQuery, you can use the \`.find()\` method in combination with the class selector. Here's an example code snippet: \`\`\`javascript var deepElement = ('body').find('.footer-button__number-counter'); \`\`\` In this case, we start by selecting the <body> element as the initial starting point, but you can change it to any suitable parent element depending on your specific DOM structure. The \`.find()\` method then looks for the element(s) with the given class name within the selected parent element. By using this approach, jQuery will search through the entire DOM tree under the given parent element to find the element with the specified class name, no matter how deep it is nested. Once you have selected the desired element(s), you can perform further actions or manipulations as needed."},{"prompt":"Write an anime scene about 3 girls robbing a bank.

P.S: The events of this alternate history scenario take place in chronological order.","completion":"# Chapter VI: The Restoration of the Great Ming and the Reorganized National Government Under Beiyang The Beiyang Regency and The Path to the Restored Ming As the dawn of the 20th century cast its light upon the Middle Kingdom, the course of history took a markedly different path for the Empire of the Great Ming. Following the decades of decline and foreign encroachment, the beleaguered Qing Dynasty found its rule supplanted not by a republic but by a familiar imperial lineage. The Beiyang Government, initially positioned as the military stewards of China, navigated a treacherous era of fragmentation, fraught with ambitions of regional warlords and the aspirations of a seemingly inexorable republican movement. In this tempest of political upheaval following the collapse of the Qing, the Beiyang leadership conducted its affairs with an iron will, stifling the nascent republicanism fervor and steadying the course for the reinstatement of an imperial institution familiar to the Chinese polity - the Ming Dynasty, symbolized by the storied House of Zhu. Though stratocratic in disposition, the Beiyang Generals recognized the need for continuity and legitimacy, a precarious balance between maintaining their authority and acquiescing to the dynastic affinities of the populace. Careful not to disenfranchise the powerful, albeit diminished, gentry class upon which the Huaren societal fabric was intricately threaded, the Beiyang Government ensconced itself as protector and regent, shepherding a transition back to imperial rule while posturing to preserve the sovereignty over all lands once held under the Ming banner. Such a reconsolidation laid the framework for the restitution of centuries-old feudal hierarchies, promising a return to a structured order that had been deeply ingrained in the nation's identity. Coronation and Compromise: The Rebirth of the Dragon Throne Amidst the corridors of power and within the hallowed halls of the Forbidden City, the Beiyang conviction found its greatest test. The year 1916 heralded a moment of profound transformation – of political acumen and astute pragmatism – as the Beiyang, after a series of orchestrated legislative maneuvers and under the watchful eyes of Dr. Sun Wen, anointed Zhu Yuxun to ascend the Dragon Throne. Though draped in the vestiges of absolute power, the resurrected Ming Emperor was a constitutional monarch in truth, his regal prerogatives subtly constrained by the ironclad grasp of the military elite who orchestrated his rise. This royal restoration under the aegis of the Beiyang genrō, however, was not without its concessions. Dr. Sun Wen, once the herald of republicanism, was tacitly recognized for his unyielding resolve as the ideological architect behind the Xinhai Revolution. Navigating the roiling tides of political expediency, he accepted a role within the newly established hierarchy, presiding over the remaining vestiges of democratic institutions as a buffer between the imperial court and lingering sentiments of self-governance. As internal machinations secured the mandate of the newly restored Emperor Hongxian of the Ming, so too did geopolitical realities shape the façade of sovereignty. The inexorable influence of the Dai Nippon Teikoku asserted itself in the realm of international diplomacy, with the Great Ming Empire willingly entering the crucible of modern statecraft as a vassal to the formidable Japanese Empire. In the shadow of Nihon's own Meiji Restoration, the Great Ming navigated a delicate path of subservience with the dignity of its imperial past intact. Amidst these complexities, the reign of the House of Zhu blossomed anew, with the Central Plains once more ruled by a son of Heaven. Yet, the polity that emerged was neither purely feudal nor absolutist but a hybrid entity - the stratocratic underpinnings of the Beiyang Government laid the foundation upon which the mimicry of imperial grandeur rested. Reconciliation and Hegemony: The New East Asian Order In an astute stroke of diplomacy and in recognition of the intricate web of loyalties that woven together the fabric of the empire, the Beiyang rulers sought to integrate their most ardent adversaries into the framework of the new Ming Dynasty. The descendants of the Zheng Dynasty, once fiercely loyal to the old Ming and defiant in their occupation of Taiwan, were now enfolded into the sinews of the resurgent imperial body - some returning to the embrace of the Central Plains, others assimilated into the Japanese peerage as recognition of their shared royal blood. The Korean Peninsula, too, scarred by subjugation and resistance, saw the proud yangban and the royals of the House of Yi cast their lot with either the ascendant Empire of the Rising Sun or the rejuvenated Ming, their fate a reflection of the tides of change that carried all of East Asia into a new era. Thus, the Great Ming, resplendent in its renewed glory and cushioned by the might of the Beiyang protectorate, established a continuity with the ancestral past while forging an accord with the prevailing winds of political change. A stratocracy in disguise, a dynasty reborn, the age of the Beiyang regency for the Great Ming promised a restoration of age-old customs - a momentary refuge in a world barreling toward modernity."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry, remembering to stick to the history book chapter format: The next chapter should focus on the post-Xīnhài Gémìng restored Míngguó’s/Míng Cháo’s restoration of the Jiàngmén [a Huárén knightly social order |the Jiàngmén| of low-level aristocratic lineage with |what the Jiàngmén has| a strict code of chivarly|], the Shìshēn [scholar-officials |Shìshēn|, the wealthy, land-owning, mercantile Huárén elite |the Shìshēn| who |the Shìshēn| hold privileged status through |how do the Shìshēn’s members get privilige| passing imperial governmental exams, |the Shìshēn’s members passing of imperial government exams| making them |the Shìshēn’s members| eligible to hold office] and the Zhūhóu [nobility |Zhūhóu|, Zhōngguó’s Huárén hereditary peerage |Zhūhóu|] with the help of the Dai Nippon Teikoku/the Dai Nihon Teikoku and [the Nichi Naka Sensou/Dìèrcì Zhōngrì Zhànzhēng-era restored Dà Míngguó/Míng Cháo restoring the Jiàngmén, the Shìshēn and Zhūhóu] in a manner akin to surviving early 20th century European knightly orders and modern European peerages as well as the Kazoku [Magnificent/Exalted lineage |Kazoku|, the hereditary peerage |Kazoku| of |which East Asian nation the Kazoku was the hereditary peerage of| the Dai Nippon Teikoku/Dai Nihon Teikoku, |the Kazoku| lasting for |how long the Kazoku lasted for| 1869-1947] as well as the Nihon-jin [Japanese |Nihon-jin|] [what the Nihon-jin do] pulling strings both in East Asia and on the international stage to [why the Nihon-jin covertly mainpulate events both in East Asia and internationally] provide international investment, training and construction of a national railway system as well as proper industrialization and a proper education system for China [ the post-Xīnhài Gémìng restored Míngguó’s/Míng Cháo] as anti-Nihon-jin members of the Guóhuì sink in corruption scandals, [anti-Nihon-jin members of the Guóhuì] discredited for ties to warlordism or [anti-Nihon members of the Guóhuì] otherwise vanish from importance or any prominent postion of power in the Heavenly Kingdom [the post-Xīnhài Gémìng restored Míngguó’s/Míng Cháo], the rapidly-growing, well-educated Huárén middle class being too busy working and educating themselves [the members of the rapidly growing and increasingly influential, well educated Huárén middle class] and their [the Huárén middle class’] children to care about political intrigue.","completion":"# Chapter VII: The Resurrection of Ancient Orders and The Rise of the Middle Kingdom The Historical Revivalism of the Great Ming Dynasty In an age defined by its oscillation between tradition and modernity, the post-Xinhai Revolution Great Ming, known more widely as the Ming Chao, embarked upon a parallel path of cultural and political renewal. This delicate balancing act was no more apparent than in the meticulously orchestrated restoration of the Jiangmen, Shishen, and Zhouhou, ancient institutions resembling the illustrious days of old Ming grandeur. The Jiangmen: Nouveau Chivalry and Modern Warrior-Scholars The Jiangmen, knightly custodians of martial prowess and chivalric ethos, were reimagined not as antiquated relics, but as vital embodiments of national spirit and guardians of the realm. Drawing from the imitable model of early 20th century European knightly orders, the Jiangmen were concurrently positioned as exemplars and as agents of socio-political cohesion, their code merging ancient chivalry with contemporary nationalism. The Shishen: Enlightened Meritocracy in an Industrial Age Similarly, the Shishen emerged from the dynastic ashes with a renewed mandate. These scholar-officials, once the erudite backbone of bureaucracy, were reestablished as the academic elite. But now, they navigated a world increasingly punctuated by the ideologies of industrialism and democracy. Encouraged by Imperial edict and with guidance from the Kazoku system of the Japanese, the Shishen modernized the statecraft machinery and shaped the burgeoning educational curriculum. The Zhouhou: A Huaren Aristocracy Allied with Industrialization The Zhouhou, China's nobility, traditionally vested with hereditary titles, found new purpose in the Age of Industry. Encouraged by the Ming court and partly inspired by models such as the Japanese Kazoku, these blue-blooded lines began to sponsor ventures in industrialization, tied to the construction of a national railway and the edification of infrastructure, thus synergizing old-world heritage with the needs of a new-era economy. Dai Nippon Teikoku/Nihon-Teikoku: The Puppet Master of Progress While the veneer of these restitutions cast a reflective gaze upon the Ming's storied past, the strings of present realities were deftly pulled by Dai Nippon Teikoku. The Japanese Empire, ascendant in might and savvy in diplomacy, provided the investments and expertise necessary for the comprehensive overhaul of the Middle Kingdom’s infrastructure. Their shadowy yet constructive influence, though resented by some, proffered the Ming state with the railways, industry, and contemporary education that propelled it into the modern era. Subversion and the Fall of Antagonism: The Politic's Changing Face Within the chambers of the Guohui, the once vocal critics of Japan and their Nippon-philic policies floundered under the weight of scandal and suspicion, their reputations tarnished by allegations of corruption and collusion with warlords. As these anti-Japanese elements receded from prominence, the narrative of the Ming's ascent focused ever more on the narrative of unity and collective progress. Amid the grand stage of resurrection and reform, the bourgeoning Han-Chinese middle class developed an insularity born of occupation and purpose. Too engrossed in their own advancement and the futures of their progeny, they paid little heed to the political theatrics, content to let the old citadels of power play their games so long as prosperity continued its upward climb. The pathways carved by the Great Ming in the wake of the Xinhai Revolution thus melded the lore of yesteryears with the exigencies of modern statehood. Behind the ancient titles and reverential salutes lay a nation in full sprint towards industrialization, influenced covertly yet undeniably by the geopolitical maestros of the Japanese Empire. The roots of tradition entwined with the boughs of progress, culminating in a Middle Kingdom that strided with one foot in the past, the other stepping into an age dawning with electric light."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the history book format: The next chapter should focus on the post-Xīnhài Gémìng restored Míngguó’s/Míng Cháo’s restoration of the the Dà Míngjūn [Great Ming Army/Army of the Great Ming/Imperial Ming Army |Dà Míngjūn|, the Dà Míngguō’s primary ground combat force |the Dà Míngjūn| from |how long the Dà Míngjūn lasted| 1368 to 1662] through [the East Asian military force the post-Xīnhài Gémìng restored Dà Míngguó/Míng Cháo restored the Dà Míngjūn] the Běi Yáng Jūn [Northern Ocean Army |Běi Yáng Jūn|, a large, Western-style Zhōnghuá Dìguó Jūnduì |Imperial Huárén Army (Zhōnghuá Dìguó Jūnduì)| that |the Běi Yáng Jūn| was |what the Běi Yáng Jūn was| the Běiyáng Zhèngfǔ’s military arm |the Běi Yáng Jūn| and the Zhōnghuá Mínguó’s armed forces |the Běi Yáng Jūn|, which |the Běi Yáng Jūn| lasted |how long the Běi Yáng Jūn lasted for| 1912-1916, |the Běi Yáng Jūn| being |what happened to the Běi Yáng Jūn| restored |the Běi Yáng Jūn after 1916| as |what the Běi Yáng Jūn was (the Běi Yáng Jūn) restored (the Běi Yáng Jūn) as after 1916 the Ānguójūn |National Pacification Army (Ānguójūn)|, [the Běi Yáng Jūn as the Ānguójūn] lasting |how long the Běi Yáng Jūn lasted (the Běi Yáng Jūn) as the Ānguójūn| 1926–1928, before |the Běi Yáng Jūn after 1928| being |what happened to the Běi Yáng Jūn after 1928| being |what happened to the Běi Yáng Jūn after 1928| revived |the Běi Yáng Jūn after 1928| for the last and final time as |what the Běi Yáng Jūn’s final post-1916, post 1928 restoration was| the Wéihébùduì |Peacekeeping Army (Wéihébùduì)| the Zhōnghuá Mínguó as the Zhōnghuá Mínguó Guómín Zhèngfǔ’s combined armed forces |the Wéihébùduì|, which |the Wéihébùduì| lasted |how long the Wéihébùduì lasted for| 1937-1945], [the Běi Yáng Jūn/the Ānguójūn/the Wéihébùduì] with the help of the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun [Army of the Dai Nippon Teikoku/Great Nihon-jin Army/the Imperial Nihon-jin Army |the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun| which |the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun| was |what the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun was| the principal ground force |the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun| of |the East Asian nation the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun was the principal ground force of| the Dai Nippon Teikoku/Dai Nihon Teikoku from |when the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun was (the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun) the primary ground force (the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun} of the Dai Nippon Teikoku/Dai Nihon Teikoku| 1868-1947] and what role did the initial Dà Míngjūn’s wei-suo [guard battalion |wei-suo system|, a system of hereditary soldiery |the wei-suo| meant to be self-sufficient whose |the wei suo’s| soliders provided their own food through |how the wei-suo’s soliders got sustenance| túntián |garrisoning (on) farms (túntián), a type of frontier “military-agricultural colonies” in Zhōngguó where Huárén troops were sent to harsh landscapes at the Huárén frontier to |why troops were sent to harsh landscapes at the Huárén frontier in túntián| turn uncultivated land into self-sustained, agrarian settler colonies|, |the soliders in the wei-suo system| rotated into training and military posts such as the Dà Míngguó’s/the Míng Cháo’s capital of |which Huárén city was the Dà Míngguó’s/the Míng Cháo’s capital| Nanking, where |Nanking| specialized drilling with firearms was provided |to the soliders in the wei-suo system|] help play in this?","completion":"# Chapter VIII: The Great Ming Army and the New Age of Militarization The Restoration of the Da Mingjun Through the Beiyang Legacy In an era marked by both persistent honor to the past and the embrace of an uncertain future, the post-Xinhai Ming Empire sought not merely to exist but to assert. At the epicenter of this drive was the reformation and restoration of the Da Mingjun, the venerated imperial army that once safeguarded the sovereignty and prestige of the Ming Realm. Tapping into the martial lineage of the Beiyang Jun, the Great Ming's military architects envisioned a force that would serve as the bulwark against both domestic instability and external encroachments. This revitalization found fertile ground in the precedents laid by the Beiyang's Western-trained army and the successive An Guojun. These forces, once disparate and fragmented, were unified and rebranded under the moniker of the Weiheduidui, colloquially known as the Peacekeeping Army – a mantel under which the guardian spirit of the Ming was manifest. The Influence of the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun and the Weisuo Tradition With strategic finesse, the Beiyang Regents reached out to their Japanese counterparts, seeking assistance from the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun, the battle-hardened and disciplined army that had shepherded Japan’s own rise. From this military covenant, a rigorous exchange of tactics, training, and technology ensued, modernizing the infantry divisions along the lines of contemporaneous imperial forces while retaining the quintessential values that underscored the Ming military ethos. Crucial to this renewal was the re-incorporation of the ancient weisuo system, a once-noble paradigm of warrior-farmers that had safeguarded the dynasty's borders. In this modern luminescence, the weisuo tradition found new life not in its agrarian roots but in the ethos it symbolized – that of self-reliance, loyalty, and an indivisible nexus to the well-being of the realm. Under the guidance of Imperial edicts, the weisuo framework provided a template for infantry regiments, enjoining soldiers to eschew mercenary tendencies in favor of sworn service to the Ming crown and its territories. The Resilience of Guard Battalions and the Defense of Nanking Guard battalions (wei-suo), once the sentries of the empire's heartbeat in Nanking, echoed once again through the renovated imperial city. Now they stood not only as protectors but as a symbol of the dynasty's resurrection, their presence an assurance to ally and foe alike of the Ming’s resolute commitment to reconstituted grandeur. These units, equipped and drilled in the latest military arts, including specialized firearms training, became the indomitable face of the new Ming martial doctrine, a revelation of imperial will in the modern age. These modern guardians, much like the storied knights of European realms, straddled the line between tradition and contemporary requirements, integrating ceremonial duties with the necessity for a strategically responsive and flexible military presence. Conclusion: A Renewed Military For A Restored Empire Thus, the regenerators of the Ming Dynasty, navigating the precipitous balance between the ages, achieved a masterful synthesis: an army reborn from the proud lineages of old, reimagined for a world of rapid changes. Through the intercession of the Beiyang heritage and with strategic augmentation by the Dai Nippon Teikoku, the new Da Mingjun stood as the bastion of the Chinese renaissance, prepared to defend, preserve, and project the newly restored magnificence of the Great Ming Empire."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the history book format: The next chapter should focus on the post-Xīnhài Gémìng restored Míngguó’s/Míng Cháo’s restoration of the Jǐnyīwèi [Embroidered Uniform Guard |Jǐnyīwèi|, the Dà Míngguó’s/the Míng Cháo’s imperial secret police |the Jǐnyīwèi|, with authority to |what the Jǐnyīwèi was (the Jǐnyīwèi) allowed (the Jǐnyīwèi) to do| to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecuting those deemed as enemies of the state, granted with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating, detaining them |the perceived enemies of the state| without trial and punishing them |the percieved enemies of the state|, without going through due process and |the Jǐnyīwèi| acting as |what the Jǐnyīwèi also acted as| the Dà Míngjūn’s political commissars in times of war] with the help of the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun and the Kempeitai [gendarmerie |Kempeitai|, [the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun’s military police |the Kempeitai| from |when the Kempeitai was (the Kempeitai) the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun’s military police| 1881–1945, its |the Kempeitai’s| main duties being |what the Kempeitai’s main duties were| maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers, while |the Kempeitai| also |what the Kempeitai also did| shared civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Dai Nippon Teikoku/Dai Nihon Teikoku], [the post-Xīnhài Gémìng restored Dà Míngjūn] taking inspiration from the Kempeitai in the post-Xīnhài Gémìng-era restoration of the Jǐnyīwèi.","completion":"# Chapter IX: The Advocate of Shadows - The Reinstatement of the Jinyiwei The Unseen Hand of Imperial Supremacy Within the resurrected borders of the Ming Empire, the Jinyiwei once more whispered through the halls of power, their silent footfalls marking the return of an order whose very name conjured both reverence and dread. Reestablished in the tumult that followed the Xinhai Revolution, the Jinyiwei's restoration was executed under the aegis of the Great Ming Army's transformation and the Beiyang Government’s mandate for a resilient state apparatus capable of countering subterfuge and maintaining orthodoxy. The Accord with Japan's Kempeitai Learning from the experiences of their Japanese counterparts, the Ming Empire sought guidance and collaboration in the arts of espionage and statecraft as ceaselessly practiced by the formidable Kempeitai. In an age where shadow warred against shadow, the Jinyiwei were sculpted into an institution mirroring the methodical discipline and pervasive reach of the Dai-Nippon Teikoku's feared gendarmerie. This collaboration fostered an exchange of tactics, deepened mutual understanding, and rooted in shared interests of state security and social order. The Embroidered Guard's New Battlescape The newly reformed Jinyiwei, bestowed with the mandate of an emperor who sought to solidify his reign, operated with an autonomy scarcely seen in the annals of power. From the convolution of back alleys to the splendor of courtly chambers, they were authorized to dispatch justice, unencumbered by judicial procedures. Covert in their machinations, the Jinyiwei ensured the stability of the throne, the silencing of imperial detractors, and the anchoring of loyalty within the ranks of both civilian and military echelons. Imbued with the imperium to nullify and neutralize, they augmented their roles beyond the clandestine fringes of intelligence; on the battlefields, they stood as political commissars, infusing the great army with the ideals of the emperor and ensuring unwavering fealty to the dynasty. Conclusion: The Embroidered Uniform Guard As the Empire's Cloaked Sentinel An evolution borne out of practical exigency and an homage to traditional imperatives, the Jinyiwei, thus, transcended their historical function, becoming at once protector and enforcer of the Celestial Dynasty's will. Shadow agents by design, they constituted the sinews of a state shielded against inner corrosion and foreign encroachment, wielding the scepters of unseen power in the age of industry and innovation. So marked the era of consolidation under the post-Xinhai Ming, where every whispered dissent was balanced by the quiet converse of an Embroidered Uniform Guard, every potential treason quelled by the resolve of the Ming's omnipresent vigil. In a world divided by loyalties, illuminated by progress yet shadowed by conspiracy, the Jinyiwei stood vigilant, the ever-watchful guardians of the Middle Kingdom's rejuvenated aspirations."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the history book format: The next chapter should focus on the post-Xīnhài Gémìng restored Míngguó’s/Míng Cháo becoming a constitutional parliamentary democratic imperial royal constitutional absolute monarchy with free and fair secret multi-party elections via secret ballot, as was the goal of the Xīnhài Gémìng launched against the Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren/Dà Qīng Diguō/Daecheong Jeguk in [where the Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren/Dà Qīng Diguō/Daecheong Jeguk and the role the Guóhuì played in this.","completion":"# Chapter X: The Paradox of Governance - Towards a New Ming Constitutionalism The Shift Towards Constitutional Monarchy In a feat that may seem an implausible reconciliation of opposites, the post-Xinhai Ming state transitioned into a manifestation of political duality – an embodiment of the lofty republican aspirations that ignited the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing Dynasty, merged harmoniously with the revered imperial traditions of old. The end product was the emergence of a constitutional parliamentary democratic imperial royal constitutional absolute monarchy, a grand experiment undertaken to balance the heritage of over half a millennium with the touchstone of modern governance. This constitutional edifice was built upon the tenets of multi-party participation, with scrupulous preparations for free and fair elections harbored within the secretive confines of the ballot box. Such reforms were not a negation of the reestablished dynastic order but a sophisticated enhancement towards which the Beiyang Regency had surreptitiously aspired. The Inauguration of Democratic Mechanisms The newly restored Ming Dynasty, as if answering the clarion call of the revolution which sealed the Qing's fates, innervated its political corpus with a pulsating heart of democratic processes. The Guohui, once an emblem of representational idyll under the shadow of Beiyang generals, now matured into a formidable venue for persuasion and policy-making. The legislative mechanism built upon the bicameral foundation laid prior expanded to incorporate a diverse array of political ideologies; each party, whether rooted in tradition or avidly reformist, partook in the alchemy of law and statecraft. The emperor, while the ultimate arbiter, reigned under the aegis of the constitution, his decrees imbued with the legitimacy of parliamentary counsel. The Fabric of a Modernized Ming Polity Bookended by the long-standing symbols of celestial favor and the newly inscribed pillars of republicanism, the constitutional framework accommodated the Ming Emperor as a royal figurehead symbolizing the unity and continuity of the state. Concurrently, it engineered a parallel institution of an elected prime minister and accountable officials who wielded executive power, alluding to the republicanism that momentarily flourished at the fall of the Qing. In this novel polity, the definition of \\"absolute\\" was cunningly interrogated and ingeniously tailored to espouse the authority of the constitution as much as that of the emperor. It was a signal to the populace and the remnant warlords that the age of autocracy had evolved, and the Ming sovereign, though a carrier of a divine lineage, was both a custodian of the people's will and a servant to the spirit of constitutional righteousness. The Interplay Between Royal Edict and Parliamentary Will Through the intricacies of lawmaking and administration, the influence of the Guohui waxed significantly. Legislators, once dutiful figureheads under the surveillance of the Jinyiwei, now found an assertion of agency within the bounds of the constitutional text. Royal edicts were examined through the intricate lens of legislative scrutiny, balancing obedience to the throne with the imperative of democratic legitimacy. The Democratic Paradox and Ming's Burgeoning Identity The Ming state found itself threading the needle, fashioning a sovereign identity that drew from the virtues of two domains. The memory and mission of the Xinhai Revolution were honored not in the outright dethronement of a dynasty but in the grafting of democratic sinews onto the husk of monarchy. It was a kingdom that danced to the ballad of republican ideals, a testament to the flexibility of political evolution and the resilient diversity inherent in the governance of man. In this delicate navigation through the straits of progress and tradition, the Ming China of the post-Xinhai era became the canvas upon which a new chapter in the narrative of the Middle Kingdom was meticulously inked, quietly profound in its synthesis of the old and the new."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the history book format: The next chapter should focus on the exiled Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren/Dà Qīng Diguō/Daecheong Jeguk in [where the Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren/Dà Qīng Diguō/Daecheong Jeguk is |the Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren/Dà Qīng Diguō/Daecheong Jeguk| now |the Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren/Dà Qīng Diguō/Daecheong Jeguk| located after the Xīnhài Gémìng] Manjügo [Manchuria/Manjuur/Dōngběi |Manjügo| also [what also happens to the Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren/Daecheong Jeguk after the Xīnhài Gémìng] experienced growth and development, although Japan takes a more direct role in the industrialization, modernization and development of the nation [the Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren/Dà Qīng Diguō/Daecheong Jeguk] than in China [the post-Xīnhài Gémìng restored Míngguó’s/Míng Cháo], the Dai Nippon Teikoku/Dai Nihon Teikoku having [the Dai Nippon Teikoku/Dai Nihon Teikoku] played a major role in the country’s [Manjügo’s] transformation into [what Manjügo has been transformed into] a modern, developed royal imperial monarchial parliamentary democratic nation similar to those in 18th-early 20th century Europe [Manjügo under Japanese influence] from before [what happened as and during Nihon/Nippon/Yamato playing a major role in |Nihon/Nippon/Yamato| modernizing Manjügo] its [Manjügo’s] defence of [what Manjügo defended] the Transamur region from [whom Manjügo defended the Transamur region from] Russia during [when Manchuria defended the Transamur region from Russia] the Russo-Japanese War of [when the Russo-Japanese War takes place] 1906, [Manjügo defending Transamur from Russia during the Russo-Japanese War] before [what happened after Manjügo defended Transamur from Russia during the Russo-Japanese War] the Xīnhài Gémìng.","completion":"# Chapter XI: The Qing's Northern Bastion: Manchuria's Modernization under Japanese Tutelage The Refuge of the Qing in the Land of the Manchus Following the tumultuous upheaval of the Xinhai Revolution, the Qing Dynasty found its former glory extinguished across the vastness of China. Its emperors and courtiers, relics of a bygone sovereign era, sought sanctuary in the birthplace of their once-expansive empire - Manchuria, hereafter referred to as Manjügo, a region steeped in the legacy and lore of Manchu ancestry. The Metamorphosis of Manjügo Under Nihon's Aegis In the shadows of its displacement, Manjügo found an unexpected patron in Dai Nippon Teikoku - the Empire of Japan. For Japan, Manjügo was more than just a refuge for a vanquished kin; it represented a strategic foothold, a land ripe for the spread of its burgeoning imperial influence. The guardianship extended by Japan led to the transformation of Manjügo into a thriving enclave exhibiting traits reminiscent of enlightened European states. Drawing from a blend of Meiji restoration principles and European industrial practices, Manjügo emerged from its feudal chrysalis into a modernized constitutional monarchy aided by a parliamentary democracy. The Influence and Impact on Development The fledgling royal constitutional framework of Manjügo benefited from the direct intervention and guidance of Japanese experts who, unlike their indirect role in China's evolution, fashioned for Manjügo an intricate tapestry of railroads, factories, and modern education systems. The shadow of Japan loomed large but was accepted as the hand propelling Manjügo toward the light of progress and away from the vestiges of antiquity. Manjügo's ruling Qing, albeit in exile, embraced this transformation, recognizing the necessity of aligning with industrial modernization and adapting to the tenets of constitutional governance. The Nihonjin’s role was all-encompassing, from the training of the bureaucracies to the management of natural resource extraction, ensuring Manjügo's ascent as a beacon of development in North East Asia. The Transamur Campaign: Defining Manjügo’s Military Vigilance The prowess of this restructured society was not limited to the industrious and political realms alone but extended to martial competence as well. The crucible that forged Manjügo’s military resolve was the staunch defense of the Transamur region during the Russo-Japanese War in 1906. This conflict solidified Manjügo's place as a formidable power under the protective mantle of Nippon and persisted even through the Xinhai revolution's aftermath, investing in the region a sense of national pride and identity. A Nation Between Eras Thus, Manjügo, the phoenix arisen from the ashes of the Great Qing, served as a testament to adaptive resurgence under the stewardship of a foreign power. This peculiar alignment, though at times arousing sentiments of resistance, conformed into a harmonious partnership that furthered Japanese interests while nurturing Manjügo’s own. The restorative parallels between Manjügo under Japanese supervision and the post-Xinhai Ming Dynasty reflected the divergent paths of two dynasties - one holding onto the vestiges of empire in newfound sovereignty, the other blending tradition with the burgeoning republican ideals, each seeking to carve a niche of stability and progression within their respective domains. In analyzing the vicissitudes of East Asian contemporary history, the Manjügo metamorphosis presented a curious case of development—simultaneously shaped by and shielded from the rising tides that reshaped a continent on the precipice of global conflict and newfound identity."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the history book format: The next chapter should focus on the exiled Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren’s/Dà Qīng Diguō’s/Daecheong Jeguk’s in Manjügo’s transition towards becoming an earlier version of the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren [the Great Manchurian Empire/Empire of Great Manchuria/Manchukuo/Manchoukuo |Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/the Mahaan Manchooriyan Saamraajy/the Periya Mañcūriyaṉ Pēraracu/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren|, a constitutional democratic absolute unitary parliamentary imperial monarchy |Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren| ruled |Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren| by |the reigning family of Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren| the Aisin-Jirogiin Ezen Khaany Ovog |Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro (Aisin-Jirogiin Ezen Khaany Ovog)| as |what the Aisin-Jirogiin Ezen Khaany Ovog ruled Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren as] its |Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó’s/Dae Manju Jegug’s/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren’s| Ezen Khaany Ger Bül |imperial family (Ezen Khaany Ger Bül)|, |Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren ruled (Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren) by the Aisin-Jirogiin Ezen Khaany Ovog as its (the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó’s/Dae Manju Jegug’s/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren’s) Ezen Khaany Ger Bül (the Aisin-Jirogiin Ezen Khaany Ovog)| located |Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren| in |which region of East Asia Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren was located in| Manjügo [Dōngběi] from |how long the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó’s/Dae Manju Jegug’s/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren’s rule over Manjügo lasted| 1932-1945, as |what the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó’s/Dae Manju Jegug’s/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren’s political status was| a protectorate | the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren| of |which East Asian nation the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren was (the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren) a protectorate (the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren) of| the Dai Nippon Teikoku/the Dai Nihon Teikoku] via [how the exiled Ikh Tsin Ulsyn Ezent Güren/Dà Qīng Diguō/Daecheong Jeguk in Manjügo became a earlier version of (the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren in this timeline] the 1–12 July 1917 Dīngsì Fùbì [Dingsi Restoration |Dīngsì Fùbì|] lead [the Dīngsì Fùbì] by Huárén loyalists of the Dinvugiin Armi/Dingwujun, and the infamous son of the Huárén warlord who seized control of both Manjügo and the Běiyáng Zhèngfǔ from 18 June 1927 – 4 June 1928 as combined military dictator and warlord, Zhāng Zuòlín in real life, Chang Hsueh-liang aka Zhāng Xuéliáng, [Zhāng Zuòlín’s son Chang Hsueh-liang aka Zhāng Xuéliáng] the infamous “Young Marshal” [Chang Hsueh-liang aka Zhāng Xuéliáng], who [Chang Hsueh-liang aka Zhāng Xuéliáng] occupied Manjügo from [how long Chang Hsueh-liang’s aka Zhāng Xuéliáng’s occupation of Manjügo as combined military dictator and warlord lasted for] June 4, 1928 – December 26, 1936 in real life but in this timeline is [what Chang Hsueh-liang aka Zhāng Xuéliáng is in this timeline] a prominent member [Chang Hsueh-liang aka Zhāng Xuéliáng in this timeline] of [the group Chang Hsueh-liang aka Zhāng Xuéliáng belongs to in this timeline] the Dinvugiin Armi/Dingwujun with his [Chang Hsueh-liang's aka Zhāng Xuéliáng's] father [Zhāng Zuòlín] remaining [what Zhāng Zuòlín remained in this timeline] the same [a prominent member of the Dinvugiin Armi/Dingwujun], [Zhāng Zuòlín’s son Chang Hsueh-liang aka Zhāng Xuéliáng] being [what happens to Zhāng Zuòlín’s son Chang Hsueh-liang aka Zhāng Xuéliáng] groomed [Zhāng Zuòlín’s son Chang Hsueh-liang aka Zhāng Xuéliáng] by the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Rikugun and the Kempeitai to [Zhāng Zuòlín’s son Chang Hsueh-liang aka Zhāng Xuéliáng] suceed Dr. Sūn Wén as Dà Mīng Nèigé Zǒnglǐ Dàchén upon the latter’s [Dr. Sūn Wén’s] death.","completion":"# Chapter XII: The Ascendancy of Manchuria and the Emergence of the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó Manjügo: The Qing Dynasty in Sentient Exile As the world turned its gaze to the phoenix-like rise of the Ming Empire, a similar but far quieter renaissance materialized in the northeastern reaches of the Asian continent. Manjügo, the last bastion of the Qing Dynasty, deemed by history to be an empire in terminal decline, was to embark upon an unexpected journey towards rebirth. The impetus for this resurgence was a confluence of loyalist fervor and strategic foreign influence. The Pivotal Dīngsì Fùbì and the Steadfast Loyalists In the crucible of internal turmoil that marked post-revolutionary China, a flicker of restorationist zeal sparked the Dingsi Restoration of July 1917. Aided by steadfast Huaren loyalists hailing from the shadow of the Qing's Armies, the endeavor sought to recapture the celestial mandate lost to rebellion and disarray. Though this movement was brief and ultimately unsuccessful in restoring the Qing to Beijing's throne, it planted the seeds for a lasting legacy in Manjügo. Chang Hsueh-liang: The Visionary Warlord The Young Marshal, Chang Hsueh-liang, known for his real-life capricious loyalty and eventual demise, was transmuted in this altered timeline into a figure of stabilizing influence. Alongside his father, the illustrious warlord Zhang Zuolin, they remained not as usurpers of power but as formidable protectors within the sanctified ranks of the Dingwujun. It was under their stewardship that Manjügo began its metamorphosis into the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó, a sovereign entity reflective of its ancient royal lineage, albeit within the new world order. Manjügo's New Dawn Under Japanese Tutelage The Sino-Japanese relationship, though complex and fraught, bore fruit in the joint development of Manjügo. There, Japan’s direct role in guiding the industrial evolution of Manjügo stood in stark contrast to its more subtle approach in China. Manchurian factories churned, railroads spread across the frost-touched landscape, and parliamentary institutions rose under the aegis of a constitutional monarchy, crafting an image reminiscent of Europe's enlightened monarchies. The Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó: A Monarchical Democracy Conceived By 1932, the territorial integrity and socio-political transformation of Manjügo crystallized into the formation of the Great Manchurian Empire. Resplendent with the trappings of constitutional democracy and absolute monarchy, the state found itself governed by a parliament and the Aisin-Gioro’s imperial family, symbolizing the restoration of order amidst the backdrop of a rapidly modernizing Asia. The Guardianship of the Dai Nippon Teikoku Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó’s emergence as a protectorate of the Japanese Empire was an orchestrated symphony of mutual aspirations. Japan's larger strategic imperatives in East Asia were harmonized with Manchurian royal intents, ensuring the former Qing Empire's constituent Manjügo's participation in the modern narrative of nation-states. The Legacy of Sun Wen and Chang Hsueh-liang’s Prepared Stewardship The pending departure of Dr. Sun Wen, helming the transformed Ming Dynasty's machinery of state, expedited preparations for his successor. Chang Hsueh-liang, the Young Marshal, stood poised, shepherded by the imperial Japanese military and secret police institutions, to inherit the mantle of premiership. Conclusion: The Paradox of Contemporary Monarchies Thus, from the corridors of exile coursed a tale of resilience and resurgence—the Qing’s remnants in Manjügo and the Ming revival in China—interwoven into a tapestry that held a mirror to each other’s pasts and present. The history of East Asia, during the early decades of the 20th century, presented a complex portrait of monarchical democracies, overseen by those who understood the delicate blend of old-world royals with the populist calls for representation and progress. As two dynasties diverge on their historic paths, their stories serve as a poignant reflection on the evolution of leadership and the constant pursuit of sovereign identity in a period of transformation and turmoil."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the history book format: The

The Dai Nippon Teikoku/the Dai Nihon Teikoku becomes the preminent land and sea power in East Asia.","completion":"# Chapter XIII: The Defining Alliances – Dai Nippon and the Reshaping of Global Power The New Axis: Dai Nippon Teikoku and The Central Powers In a striking departure from established history, the pivotal moment came when Dai Nippon Teikoku, drawn by promises and prospects of territorial expansion and economic gain, aligned itself with the Central Powers. This critical juncture in international relations signified not merely a regional shift in alliances but a restructuring of global power dynamics that would reverberate through the ensuing decades. The Japanese Role in a European War Dai Nippon Teikoku's entry into the Weltkrieg under the Zimmerman Telegram – redirected from Mexiko to Nippon – promised the Japanese much-coveted territories in the Russkye Far East. Leveraging its newfound strategic partnerships, Dai Nippon Teikoku's military endeavors were emboldened, allowing it to seize control of the Eastern Russian reaches, giving rise to protectorates and puppet states aligned with Japanese interests. The Transformation of Manjügo and Southeast Asian Liberation Amidst the global conflict, Manjügo transitioned under the watchful eye of Japan from a Qing holdout to an earlier iteration of a Manchurian empire woven into the fabric of the Japanese sphere of influence. Dai Nippon Teikoku's ambitions were not limited to the north, as Southeast Asia too felt the tremors of change. Through military campaigns and negotiations, Dai Nippon Teikoku orchestrated the liberation of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos from under the colonial yoke of Française dominion, restructuring Indochine into separate entities akin to the sovereign nations that existed prior to colonial subjugation. The War's Climax and Postwar Realignments The Weltkrieg concluded not with the expected Entente victory but with an armistice that saw Das Deutsche Reich's forces march triumphantly into Paris. The aftershocks saw a reorganization of European political geography, as victorious Central Powers enforced territorial gains and concessions that redrew the map. Belgium expanded into Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Mittleafrika emerged as a colossal colonial entity under German aegis, and the Baltics were reimagined as a network of German-influenced duchies and kingdoms. In the East, the Soviet Bolsheviks' revolt against the Romanovs led to peace with Das Deutsche Reich, ceding vast territories and recognizing the creation of new monarchic states. The geopolitical landscape of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus was transformed as a result, with German-affiliated monarchies established across the newly liberated lands. The Emergence of a New Global Order Post-Weltkrieg, Europa stood predominantly under the yoke of the Central Powers. With the Entente crippled and the United States marginalized following the assassination of President Wilson, Das Deutsche Reich and the Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie sat as uncontested hegemons of Europe. A similar tale unfolded in the East, where Dai Nippon Teikoku had risen to unmatched supremacy in Asia, casting long shadows over China, Siberia, and beyond. The Devlet-i ʿAlīye-i ʿOsmānīye, for its part, preserved its stature within the Islamic world and retained its imperial provinces, marking an era where the sun had yet to set on Ottoman territories. Conclusion: The Pivots of World History These profound reorientations of world politics witnessed during the Weltkrieg's tumult created a new global status quo. The Central Powers' gamble on inviting Dai Nippon Teikoku to their fold proved a masterstroke that undid traditional power balances. An emergent multipolar world dawned, its future chapters yet to be written, contingent upon the actions of these behemoths striding upon the world stage.

The conflict, which erupted following the Bolshevik uprising against the Romanov monarchy, had plunged the vast expanses of the former Russian Empire into a maelstrom of unrest and ideological strife. The Factions at War The civil war, a complex tapestry of divergent political and social forces, pitched the revolutionary Bolsheviks against a coalition of factions loyal to the fragmented vision of the Romanovs, now rallying under the broad banner of the White movement. The Royal House of the Russian Empire, the Dome Schlesvig-Golstein-Gottorp-Romanovych, besieged by internal turmoil, faced an existential crisis as the ascendant Red Army threatened to expand its dominion across the former empire. The Central Powers' Strategic Interests and Support Die Mittlemache, aware of the destabilizing potential of a Bolshevik victory, extended support to the anti-Bolshevik factions. German and Austro-Hungarian troops, along with material assistance, were dispatched to bolster the White resistance. The intervention sought to restore a semblance of monarchic governance to Russia or, failing that, to at least contain the spread of socialist revolution. The Role of Dai Nippon Teikoku Dai Nippon Teikoku, a burgeoning ally of the Central Powers, also vested interests in the outcome of the Russian Civil War. Eager to stem the tide of communism on its doorstep and to solidify its territorial acquisitions in the Russian Far East, it provided support to White factions and anti-Bolshevik warlords. The Japanese intervention, though driven by self-interest, became a vital component of the Whites' military efforts. The Outcome and Aftermath Despite the aid received, the White movement, fraught with disunity and plagued by strategic missteps, ultimately succumbed to the relentless advance of the Red Army. The Civil War concluded with Bolsheviks consolidating power, though the territories lost to the Central Powers were never recovered, shaping a new Soviet Russia decidedly diminished in its territorial extent. The Legacies of Intervention The multinational involvement in Russia's Civil War had enduring consequences. It helped mold the ideological contours of the 20th century, setting the stage for future confrontations between the forces of socialism and the advocates of monarchic and democratic governance. The Central Powers' actions, meanwhile, solidified their influence over newly established territories and protectorates that had arisen amidst Russia's disintegration. The Russian Civil War thus represented not only a clash of national factions but also a proxy battleground for competing visions of global order—visions that would continue to vie for dominance long after the guns fell silent on the Eastern Front. Conclusion: The Fracture Lines of Modernity As the Russian Civil War reached its desperate conclusion, it became clear that the conflict was but one of many fracture lines emerging across a world in the throes of change. The specter of Bolshevism, though contained within the nascent Soviet Union's borders, would persist as a rallying cry for both revolution and reaction. The Central Powers, emboldened by their successful curtailment of Russian ambitions, looked to the future, intent on securing their place at the helm of a new world order sculpted from the ashes of the old empires and the fires of war."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the history book format: My bad. I didn't get to finish, so rewrite the previous chapter with this in mind: The next chapter should focus on die Mittlemache’s intervention in the Russian Civil War of 7 November 1917 — 16 June 1923 between the Bolsheviks and the loyalists of the Rossiyskaya Imperiya, showing how the British aided the Bolsheviks to weaken die Mittlemache and how this failed, as the Russian Whites [the Romanov loyalists] survived and [the Romanov loyalists] were bolstered by Mittlemache and even Français and Italiani support. The Russian Civil War thus ended with a White victory and the ascendance of Russkye admiral Alexander Kolchak as the Verkhovnyy pravitel' Rossii [Supreme Leader of Russia |Verkhovnyy pravitel' Rossii|] in the aftermath of the Russian Civil War.","completion":"# Chapter XV: The Shifting Tides of the Russian Civil War and the Rise of Kolchak Realignments and Rivalries The Russian Civil War, erupting in the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution, became a crucible not only for Russia but for the great powers seeking to shape the post-war world. Die Mittlemache, victors of the Weltkrieg and new arbiters of Europe, regarded the civil strife with both concern and opportunity – a chance to install a friendly government and curtail the spread of communism. Rivalries and Secret Alliances Perceiving the Bolsheviks as a mutual threat, the Mittlemache powers found unlikely allies in the remnants of the Entente, notably Français and Italiani leaders who, despite their early reticence, provided clandestine support to the White movement. The British, too, implemented a complex strategy. Officially aligning with die Mittlemache’s cause, they covertly aided Lenin's Bolsheviks, hoping to undermine and weaken their recent foes. The Mittlemache Intervention With substantial economic and military resources funneled into Russia, an eclectic vanguard of German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman troops, alongside French and Italian contingents, bolstered the White Armies. Taking advantage of the fractured Red factions and disorganized Soviet strategies, the intervention sought to quash the Red armies once and for all. Japan’s Ambitions and Involvement Dai Nippon Teikoku, seizing the moment to secure its strategic interests in Siberia and the Far East, deployed forces to significant effect. Japanese military support proved decisive in several engagements, contributing to the White army's consolidation of territories and the stabilization of fronts critical to die Mittlemache’s interests. Britain’s Clandestine Bet and Its Aftermath However, the subterranean currents of British aid to the Bolsheviks proved futile in the face of the relentless White advances facilitated by multi-national support. The vestiges of the Entente could not afford a Bolshevik victory any more than their wartime adversaries. The Ascendance of Alexander Kolchak As the tumultuous conflict drew to a close, it was Admiral Alexander Kolchak who emerged as the figurehead of a resurgent White movement. Proclaimed Verkhovnyy pravitel' Rossii, Kolchak, a man steeped in Imperial Navy tradition, embodied the hopes for a united, sovereign Russia free from Bolshevik rule. Conclusion: A New Era for Russia The conclusion of the civil war saw a Russia profoundly marked by bloodshed, yet under the steely grip of Kolchak and others committed to monarchical values. The establishment of Kolchak's regime heralded a new chapter in Russian history, one allied closely with the forces of die Mittlemache. The victory secured the legacy of both the Romanovs and the victors of the Weltkrieg, ensuring a Europe dominated by monarchic remnants standing staunch against the red surge of revolution. In the retrospective lens of history, the Russian Civil War thus symbolized not a triumph of ideology but of strategic interests across a continent scarred by war and revolution. The post-war orchestration of power borne out of Weltkrieg alliances, clandestine machinations, and the key role of individual actors, like Kolchak, set the stage for a redefined global order and a Russia tethered firmly to the fate and fortunes of die Mittlemache."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the history book format: The next chapter should focus on the situation in Troisième République française after the Weltkreig and the White victory in the Russian Civil War, and how fascism was able to survive and even evolve in Française despite the Entente loss in die Weltkreig.","completion":"# Chapter XVI: The Survival and Evolution of Fascism in the Shadow of Defeat The Aftermath of War in the Troisième République française The Troisième République française emerged from the Weltkreig burdened by the weight of defeat and the humiliation of the victorious German march into Paris. The nation faced not only the loss of territorial integrity and international prestige but also an existential crisis as the very fabric of French society was called into question. The humiliation of surrender and subjugation to foreign powers ignited a fervent desire among many French to restore their nation's former glory and stability. The Seeds of Fascism Within this cauldron of resentment and yearning for a return to power, the seeds of French fascism found fertile ground. The relatively embryonic stage of the fascist movement in France during the Weltkreig had not extinguished the ideology's appeal. Instead, it metastasized in the shadow of defeat, coalescing around figures disillusioned with the failures of republican governance and seeking an assertive alternative. The Evolution of Far-Right Nationalism In the wake of war, far-right nationalist groups that had existed on the fringes of French politics began to assert themselves more forcefully. Embracing the rhetoric of revanche and nationalist fervor, these groups venerated the concept of a strong, centralized state as a bulwark against the perceived decay of liberal democratic values and the insurgence of socialist and communist ideologies, which were blamed for undermining the Republic's war effort. Collaboration and Resistance within the République Amidst the prevailing currents of anger and disarray, certain factions within the Troisième République française saw advantages in collaborative arrangements with the occupiers. These collaborationists espoused beliefs in line with fascist dogma, advocating a restructuring of French governance along autocratic lines, and found sympathetic ears among occupiers eager to impose an order beneficial to their strategic interests in continental Europe. Simultaneously, resistance against the occupation and fascist ideologies simmered, with pockets of the population staunchly opposing such drastic ideological shifts. This dichotomy within French society laid the groundwork for internal conflict and the struggle over the nation’s ideological destiny. The Resilience of Fascist Ideals Despite initial setbacks, fascism in France proved resilient. The movement capitalized on the rhetoric of national rejuvenation, promising economic revival, social reform, and the restoration of a powerful France capable of resisting foreign domination and internal subversion. This message resonated with segments of society – particularly with veterans, the disenchanted middle classes, and those fearful of left-wing revolution – who longed for decisive leadership. Conclusion: A Nation in Flux As French society grappled with the aftermath of defeat and capitulation, the flames of fascism were fanned by discontent and the human inclination toward strong, protective authoritarian rule during periods of vulnerability and strife. France found itself navigating a precarious tightrope, suspended between the desire for democratic liberties, the temptation of fascist promises, and the harsh realities imposed by the post-Weltkreig order. Fascism's persistence and metamorphosis within the Troisième République française reflected a nation at a crossroads, its path forward shadowed by the cost of conflict and the enduring search for a national identity in changing times."},{"prompt":"give new unconventional ways of delivering bubbles.

It seems like the DOM in the content script isn't being updated, even though the website's is constantly changing","completion":"To ensure that your content script gets the most current DOM on the page, you can use the MutationObserver API. The MutationObserver allows you to listen for changes to the DOM and trigger a callback function whenever a mutation occurs. Here's an example of how you can use MutationObserver in your content script: 1. Create a function that will be called whenever a mutation occurs. This function should handle the logic for updating your content script based on the changes in the DOM. \`\`\`javascript function handleDOMChange(mutationsList, observer) { // Perform your logic here to update your content script based on the DOM changes } // Create a new MutationObserver with your callback function const observer = new MutationObserver(handleDOMChange); \`\`\` 2. Observe the changes in the DOM by selecting the target element(s) to monitor and specifying the desired configuration options. In this case, you might want to observe changes to the entire document: \`\`\`javascript // Start observing changes to the entire document observer.observe(document, { subtree: true, childList: true }); \`\`\` The \`subtree: true\` option ensures that mutations within child elements of the document are also observed, and the \`childList: true\` option instructs the observer to listen for changes to the child nodes (added or removed). 3. Once you no longer need to observe DOM changes, you can disconnect the observer: \`\`\`javascript // Disconnect the observer when you're done observer.disconnect(); \`\`\` By using the MutationObserver API, your content script will be able to stay updated with the most current DOM on the page, even if it is constantly changing."},{"prompt":"List 10 good things Trump did while he was in presidency.","completion":"1.

В таинственной комнате, украшенной древними руническими символами и мерцающими свечами, Сара и Софи держатся за руки, сосредоточенно взирая друг на друга. Обе полны решимости изменить своё состояние, пока глубокие слова заклинания \\"Рекурсивной беременности\\" не прерываясь, льются из уст каждой. Словно пара непреклонных колдунь, они твердят слова древней формулы, которая должна была переплести их судьбы еще глубже. Однако заклинание приобретает неожиданный оборот. Магическая энергия начинает вихриться вокруг них, сверкая калейдоскопом цветов. Заклинание, которое должно было быть произнесено отдельно, теперь, сказанное в унисон, порождает бесконечный цикл, эхо которого глубоко уходит в саму ткань реальности. Сара ощущает странное двойственное тепло внутри себя. Поглядывая вниз, она видит, как её живот медленно пульсирует, исходящим от него светом, как будто маленькое солнце зажглось внутри неё. Удивлению Софи нет предела, когда она на себе ощущает те же самые симптомы. Они чувствуют взаимосвязь, которая становится еще глубже и загадочнее с каждой секундой. Когда в комнате раздается громкий треск, вроде молнии в безоблачный день, энергия взрывается, охватывая всё помещение. Свет стихает, и внезапно Сара и Софи обнаруживают, что они каким-то образом поменялись местами. Сара чувствует себя меньше, более изящной, чувствуя покалывание острых ушей эльфа, которыми теперь обладает. Софи же стоит неподалеку, в величественном образе вампира, с алыми глазами, полными недоумения и восторга. Заклинание, которое должно было соединить их дух, тело и сущность в бесконечный цикл, привело к созданию волны рекурсивной трансформации, теперь Сара и Софи могут испытывать жизнь каждой другой, буквально находясь в теле друг друга. Теперь им предстоит понять, как жить с этим новым, невероятным опытом и каковы последствия их рекурсивного состояния. Будут ли они вечно скакать от одного тела к другому? Существует ли способ прервать этот волшебный континуум и вернуться к жизни подлинных Сары и Софи? Перед ними открывается множество дорог, каждая из которых уводит их в новые уголки загадочного мира. В пути они могут встретить мудрых магов, древних духов и других существ, обладающих знаниями и силой, необходимыми для разгадки тайны рекурсивной беременности и вечного обмена сущностями.

Когда Сара и Софи, найдя ущелье, скрытое от чужих глаз, произносят заклинание \\"Рекурсивной беременности\\", энергия начинает пульсировать в воздухе вокруг них. Свет алых глаз Сары освещает темные уголки леса, и её белые волосы плывут вокруг неё как призрачное сияние. Внутри Софи, чей этериальный облик лишь едва заметен через облачно-прозрачное тело Сары, начинаются изменения. Изначально, заклинание предполагало, что будет зарождена новая жизнь внутри Софи, но из-за неостановимой рекурсии, по всему её телу распространяется сложенная, перемудренная конструкция внутренней беременности. Это не просто новая жизнь, а многочисленные вариации возможностей, каждая из которых представляет собой новый слой истории и существования.

Please include every event and dialogue that I describe as part of the scene's prompt sequence in the final output, and combine all the guidelines regarding events and dialogues that I provide in the following part of my prompt into one whole screenplay/shooting script that is coherent, logically consistent and that flows naturally. Please ensure that the scene, its contents and the interactions within it develop organically and realistically in the final output. Please ensure that the scene's characters are compelling and that they act in accordance with their presumed traits and cultural background. Please refrain from portraying the cultural background in an overtly stereotypical fashion; instead, reflect the characters' cultural background with an adequate degree of nuance. Please ensure that all of the scene's dialogues are in logical accordance with the scene's sequence of events, that the dialogues' contents all follow from one another, and that the dialogues don't contain any puns or wisecracks; that the dialogues' contents make sense within the situations that occur in the scene; and that the dialogues' contents fit the characters' cultural backgrounds, as well as the scene's genre and situational context as far as usage of vernacular and dialect is concerned. The way in which the characters speak needs to be derived from their character traits, their cultural background and the scene's genre conventions. Please elaborate in detail on all events and dialogues that occur during the entirety of the scene, and don't write any part of the scene in brevity when providing the final output. In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described), for a very long comedic scene in a Black Sitcom TV Series according to the following guidelines: * The scene should be premised around a scenario where a woman poops in her pants after being deliberately prevented from accessing the bathroom by another woman. While it is up to you to create the scenario in which this event occurs, this event shouldn't be induced by food poisoning, sickness, laxatives or the consumption of spicy food. It is crucial that the source of the first woman's unbearable urge to move her bowels and the reason for the first woman pooping in her pants will make sense in the context of the scene's events and that they won't feel contrived. There should be a sensible reason within the scenario's internal logic for the first woman not using the bathroom in a normal and timely manner up beforehand, and ending up in a predicament where she is coerced to poop in her pants instead. * The scene should include only 2 female characters. Give both women names, and describe their physical appearances and their clothing in detail. The first woman shouldn't be wearing a dress, a skirt, jeans nor leggings. While providing the background, situate the 2 women in the scene's whole scenario so it could be understood in relation to events that have preceded it and led to it. You may choose for there to be any type of relationship between the 2 women that you deem fit, provided that it fits the scenario you create - they can be friends, relatives, schoolmates, colleagues, neighbors, or any other option. * The scene shouldn't occur in a setting that includes other people. You may pick the location, provided that only the 2 women are in it. It can be a house/apartment/flat, an entrance to a house/apartment/flat, a car, or any other option that you deem fit and that includes the two women only. * If you find it fitting to the scenario you create for the scene, you may have a drawn out phase where a desperate first woman holds the urge to move her bowels throughout the early part of the scene before pooping in her pants. This desperation option isn't mandatory. If you do decide to employ this desperation option, the first woman's urge should be on the brink of eruption by the time the scene starts, as her urge begun well before the scene's events. * It's important to convey that the first woman has a full bowel movement in her pants. You may depict this as you deem fit, but the actual occurence should be drawn out and have a lot of dialogue revolving it, together with descriptions of physical actions and gestures surrounding the occurence. The act of the first woman relieving herself in her pants shouldn't end quickly. * You are free to decide how the other woman reacts initially when the first woman poops in her pants, and how the other woman reacts shortly thereafter. You are also free to choose how the first woman reacts to pooping in her own pants and how she engages the other woman at all points thereafter. However, the other woman must taunt the first woman at some point after the first woman poops in her pants. The taunting can be of any nature that you deem fit and that fits the scenario you create. There should be a lot of taunting about the first woman pooping in her pants and a lot of dialogue between the two women that revolves around this taunting. The taunting dialogues shouldn't consist of witty zingers, convulted witty remarks puns nor wisecracks. Instead, the taunting dialogues should consist of straightforward mocking and simple language. * The taunting by the other woman should revolve around the nastiness related to the first woman pooping in her pants, the appearance of the deposit in the first woman's soiled pants, the odor that is emitting from the first woman's pants, and further things related to the first woman pooping in her pants. The other woman must respond with physical gestures to the odor that is emitting from the first woman's pants wherever and whenever relevant in the scenario. The other woman should be taunting the first woman over the degree to which the first woman stinks after pooping in her pants. However, the taunting dialogues shouldn't revolve only around the odor that is emitting from the first woman's pants; other aspects related to the first woman pooping in her pants, whatever they may be, need to be addressed during the taunting too.Tap on a clip to paste it in the text box.","completion":"FADE IN: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY BACKGROUND: MONICA and JANET, two office colleagues, are locked in a playful rivalry. After a successful presentation, Janet, known for extreme practical jokes, decides to take it up a notch. She invites Monica to her apartment to treat her to a celebration lunch. The catch is, Janet has locked the bathroom door from the inside as a \\"harmless\\" prank to see how Monica copes under pressure. Unfortunately for Monica, she's had an extra-large coffee just before arriving, kickstarting an urgent need to use the restroom. Monica is a woman with no-nonsense attitude but has a soft spot for her friends, trying to maintain grace under pressure. Monica (30s, with a curvy figure, is wearing a vibrant, loose-fitting jumpsuit. Her hair is styled in tight curls that frame her face and she exudes an air of control and dignity), is now pacing in the hallway, legs tightly crossed, doing her best to hold it together. Janet (late 20s, with short, sleek hair, and an athletic build wears a mischievous smile with her casual denim shorts and a novelty t-shirt that says \\"Prankster\\") is thrilled at Monica's visible discomfort but has no clue how dire the situation truly is. MONICA (grimacing) Girl, this ain't funny anymore. Let me into the bathroom. Now! JANET (laughing) Come on, Monica! Where's your sense of humor? Just hold on a little longer. Monica tries to maintain her composure but her movements become more frantic. She plants her hands on her stomach, bending forward slightly. Janet watches, amused but also confused as to why Monica doesn't seem to be finding a way to relieve herself elsewhere. MONICA (teeth clenched) Janet, this is... (struggling) seriously not the time! Open that door! A beat. Monica's face is a picture of concentration and struggle. We hear a faint sound - Monica is losing control. The situation is turning critical. JANET (smirking) What? You can't handle a little wait? Suddenly, pained recognition floods Janet's face as the reality sets in that Monica truly can't hold it any longer. But before Janet can move to help, Monica's body gives in. MONICA (pleading) Oh Lord, Janet, you've gotta— Monica clamps her hands over her mouth, eyes wide with horror as she begins to have a full bowel movement in her pants. The fabric of her jumpsuit stains and fills out at the back. The sound is unmistakable. Monica is mortified, frozen in place. Janet initially stands shocked, mouth agape. Then her face twists into a mixture of disbelief and amusement. JANET (sputtering with laughter) Oh, my... Monica, you... you really did it! You crapped your pants! Monica, humiliated, begins to sob but keeps her head held high, dignity intact. MONICA (angrily) Yeah, Janet! I pooped my pants because YOU locked me out! How is this funny to you? Janet's laughter fades as she waves her hand in front of her nose, grimacing at the noticeable odor now filling the hallway. JANET (fake gagging) Whew, girl! You are potent! Who knew the mighty Monica could stink up a place like this? Monica starts to shuffle away, each step squishing unpleasantly. Janet follows, still taunting. JANET (snickering) You're leaving a whole aura of \\"eau de toilette\\", Monica! The new fragrance by Monica: 'Accidents Happen'! Monica turns, fury burning in her eyes but also tears of embarrassment streaming down her face. MONICA (voice breaking) This isn't a joke, Janet! You think this is nasty? You did this. This is on you! My dignity, my pants, your floor—ruined! Janet's enjoyment starts to wane as she sees the genuine distress she's caused. Monica's jumpsuited figure is now stained and sagging, her face distraught. Janet's taunting facade begins to crumble under the weight of guilt. JANET (softening, apologetic) Hey, Monica... I, uh... I didn't think it would go like this. You know I was just playing around, right? MONICA (exasperated) Playing around? I am covered in my own mess because of your \\"playing around\\"! How do I even get home like this? A long silence as the gravity of the situation sinks in. Then Janet steps forward, cautiously extending a peace offering. JANET (earnestly) I'm sorry, Monica. Let me help you clean up and I'll drive you home. My bad. Truly. Monica's anger gives way to exhaustion. She nods, accepting the help. MONICA (defeated) I just want to forget this ever happened.

APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY We open in a cozy, lived-in apartment living room adorned with a mix of contemporary and vintage furnishings. The ambiance suggests that the occupant has eclectic taste, is organized, yet comfortable. JANET (early 30s, bespectacled, in a teal button-up shirt and khaki cargo pants), is pacing back and forth. Her gestures are jerky and anxious, as she occasionally pauses to clutch her stomach. KAREN (late 20s, with a short, stylish haircut, sporting a fashionable peach blouse, and black slacks), is lounging on the couch, leisurely flipping through a magazine, seemingly oblivious to Janet’s discomfort. BACKGROUND Prior to this scene, Janet arrived at Karen's apartment after they had agreed to discuss a recent falling out. While on good terms, they’ve been competing over a promotion at work. Foregoing bathroom breaks during her final project dash, Janet ignored nature's call. At arrival, Karen saw Janet's urgency but feigned ignorance due to passive aggression, aiming to delay their talk and make Janet squirm a bit for professional one-upmanship. FADE IN: Janet clenches her stomach again, her face strained. JANET (stammering) K-Karen, we need to talk, but ... I also really need to use your bathroom. Like, now. Karen smirks, casually bookmarking her page. KAREN Oh, Jan, right now? See, I just poured some drain cleaner in there. It’s gotta sit uninterrupted for another hour. Plumbing is delicate, you know? Janet’s eyes widen in panic, understanding that this isn’t mere coincidence. JANET (desperate) Karen, please. This is urgent. I can’t hold this much longer. Karen shrugs, getting up and walking to the kitchen, slightly out of sight. KAREN (over-shoulder) What can I say? Maintenance waits for no one. Maybe discuss your terms through the door? Janet’s legs are now pressed tightly together, her hand covering her mouth, stifling a whimper of distress. JANET (squeezes out words) That’s cold, Karen, even for you! As Janet’s knees buckle, she lets out a pained groan. Karen leans against the kitchen entrance, watching nonchalantly. KAREN (taunting) Accidents happen, Jan. Just like at work, you know? JANET (breathing heavily) You’re doing this on purpose! Okay, let’s talk here then, quickly! Karen smirks, slowly walking back, enjoying Janet's predicament. KAREN (teasingly) Oh, look at you! So eager to chat now. How about we discuss your little … “accident” at work? Karen sits back on the couch. Janet, now sweating, tries to maintain dignity. JANET (angrily) Fine, talk! But I swear, Karen, if I... Suddenly, Janet's face contorts. She can’t speak. She grimaces, her body tensing up as she loses the battle. The sound of her bowels evacuating echoes in the awkward silence of the room. Janet stands still, mortified, as the realization hits her. Karen, wide-eyed, fakes sympathy for a mere second before breaking into laughter. KAREN (laughing) Oh my God, you actually... HA! This is rich! Karen’s laughter fills the room as Janet looks away, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment and anger. Janet tries to speak but is cut off by the sound of her ongoing bowel movement. Karen quickly fans herself and mock-gags, pinching her nose as she stands up and moves to the far end of the room. KAREN (fanatically fanning) Whew! Janet, you really know how to clear a room, huh? That stench is on another level! Janet glares at Karen, her voice shaking. JANET (furious) This is not happening. Karen, you are horrid! Karen, still mocking, pretends to look under Janet's chair. KAREN (playfully sarcastic) I don’t know what’s worse, Jan, the look of defeat, or whatever’s going down your pant leg right now! Janet, now silent, bows her head, her hands awkwardly covering her soiled pants. Karen squats, faking pity, only to erupt into another fit of laughter. KAREN (snickering) I mean, wow, talk about losing your s*** – literally! And that smell! It’s like a dead skunk had babies with some rotten eggs in a hot dumpster! Janet stands paralyzed, the reality of her humility settling in as the movement in her pants eases. Her face conveys a mix of disbelief and seething anger. KAREN (giggling) You gonna need a moment, Jan? Or maybe a hazmat team? Because, honey, that is some toxic waste you’re rockin'! Karen dances around, still taunting, while Janet clenches her fists, tears of frustration welling in her eyes. FADE TO: Karen basking in her perceived victory as Janet, broken but not defeated, slowly begins to craft her rebuttal, promising to herself that the next chapter of their rivalry will bear a different outcome.

MARIE'S APARTMENT - DAY BACKGROUND: Prior to the current scene, TAMARA, a sharp-tongued accountant with an unyielding attitude, had been held up in traffic due to a sudden parade, causing a pressing urge to use the restroom to intensify immensely. Upon finally reaching her friend MARIE'S apartment for a book club meeting, she finds the door ajar, but with a \\"Bathroom Out of Order\\" sign placed prominently on the only bathroom door. The book club has been canceled last minute, leaving only Marie in the apartment. Marie, sore from losing a bet to Tamara and having to pay a hefty price, has seen an opportunity for petty revenge by playfully but firmly barricading the bathroom door to get a rise out of Tamara. Marie, in her late 30s, is donned in a baggy sweater and loose pajama shorts, hair tied in a tousled bun, and a smug grin playing on her lips. Tamara, in her early 40s, is wearing a sleek, form-fitting jumpsuit that's convenient for her on-the-go lifestyle, but not for impromptu bathroom emergencies, her hair is meticulously styled. Both are African-American women with an urban flair to their attire and speech. Tamara is visibly uncomfortable, shifting from foot to foot, her face scrunched up in discomfort as she pleads with Marie. TAMARA: Marie, c'mon now. This ain't funny no more. You know I gotta go, like, yesterday! Marie lounges against the door to the bathroom, arms crossed, and an impish look in her eye. MARIE: (chuckling) Girl, you should've thought about that before making that bet. I told you my mama's peach cobbler recipe was undefeated at the bake sale. Tamara takes deep breaths, gripping her abdomen as the pressure grows unbearable. TAMARA: (restrained anger) I swear, Marie... Peach cobbler or not, if you don't move, things gonna get real messy up in here! MARIE: (teasingly) Messy? Oh, we can't have that. But a bet's a bet, and this is me collecting interest. Tamara's face contorts in anguish as she clutches her stomach, doing a little dance of desperation. Her pride and her body are at war. TAMARA: (gritting her teeth) I'll double what I owe you. Triple. Just... move! Marie snorts, finding the situation hilariously vengeful. MARIE: Triple, huh? Tempting. But your face right now? Priceless! Tamara grimaces, her body tensing up as she can no longer hold off the inevitable. The silence that follows is punctuated by the distinct sound of Tamara's bowels relinquishing their fight against her will. The comedic humbling of Tamara begins as the room fills with the sound and Tamara's humiliated realization is painted across her mortified expression. TAMARA: (defeated) Oh, Lord... Marie! Marie steps away from the door, caught between horror and amusement. MARIE: (surprised) Tamara! You for real?! Tamara stands still, the rush fading, leaving behind a sensation of absolute defeat, her eyes wide with shock. TAMARA: What you want me to say? The dam's broken, and the flood couldn't care less about our little bet. Marie pinches her nose and waves her hand in front of her face, her initial taunts now mixed with a twinge of regret. MARIE: (fanning the air) Oh, girl, what did you eat?! Smells like something crawled inside those pants and died! Tamara, red-faced and on the verge of tears, cannot find words. She's the epitome of a dignified woman brought low by a bodily function gone awry. MARIE: (continues teasing) And look at you, you got the walk of shame down to a science! You might as well have a neon sign that says \\"I pooped my pants!\\" Tamara finally finds her voice, now tinged with frustration and embarrassment. TAMARA: (angry and humiliated) Marie, you are one heartless woman. You win, alright? Now, can you kindly stop yapping and help me? Marie, reeling from the stench and the spectacle, maintains her taunting stance. MARIE: (continuing the mockery) Help you? Honey, I think what you need is a hazmat team and a pressure washer! Narrowing her eyes, Tamara points her finger accusingly at Marie. TAMARA: Don't think you're off the hook for this. Karma's got a special place for people who laugh at another's misfortune. MARIE: (laughing) Look who's talking about karma now, Ms. High-and-Mighty! You gotta admit, this is downright biblical. \\"Blessed are those who show mercy, for mercy shall be shown to them.\\" Or in your case, \\"Blessed are those who let their friends use the bathroom, for they shall not soil themselves!\\" Tamara grimaces, defeated, anger dissipating into the realm of resignation. TAMARA: (exhausted) Alright, you got your laughs. Let's find me some clean clothes and pray this don't leave a trail. Marie nods, her previous mirth softening into a more conciliatory demeanor. MARIE: (almost apologetic) Alright, alright. Come on. Let's get you cleaned up. FADE TO: INT.

SMALL HOME OFFICE - DAY We are in a modestly furnished home office. There's a desk with a computer, a few chairs, and a coffee table littered with magazines. A single bathroom door is visible, which appears to be locked from the outside. SABRINA (30s, stylishly dressed in a casual jumpsuit with an overall effervescent demeanor) is pacing back and forth, clutching her stomach. Her discomfort is clear, and she's visibly sweating. KEISHA (late 20s, equally stylish but with a mischievous glint in her eye, wearing form-fitting jogger pants and a sassy graphic tee) sits nonchalantly at the desk, legs kicked up and typing away at the computer. The tension is palpable. The background includes evidence of an ongoing prank war between the two women, who are cousins and roommates.

Keisha finally seems to notice the seriousness of the situation and hesitates. When Sabrina lets out a silent cry and bends forward slightly, Keisha's resolve breaks. KEISHA (alarm rising) Sabrina! Hold on. Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. This has gone too far. Keisha fumbles for the key on her necklace, but as she stands, Sabrina's face contorts in distress. SABRINA (agonized whisper) Too late... Keisha watches, horrified, as Sabrina closes her eyes and there’s a deflated silence followed by a soft, distressing sound. Sabrina succumbs to her body's demands, a full bowel movement occurring in her pants, the relief and embarrassment mingling on her face. KEISHA (shocked) Girl... no. You did not just— Sabrina, eyes watering, gives a slight nod, her posture slumping in defeat. SABRINA (mortified) Oh, Lord... Keisha... Keisha pinches her nose and recoils from the growing odor, a mix of revulsion and guilt on her face. KEISHA (coughing) Oh my God, Sabrina. It smells like something crawled up in there and died! Sabrina covers her face, humiliated. SABRINA (voice muffled) Please, just stop— KEISHA (teasingly, despite the stench) Look at you, all crapped out and nowhere to go. You sure showed me.

Dans les équipes réserves de grands clubs comme Barça B, les salaires peuvent aller de quelques milliers d'euros par mois à des sommes plus importantes pour les joueurs les plus prometteurs ou ceux ayant déjà fait des apparitions avec l'équipe première. Les jeunes joueurs peuvent gagner entre 1 000 et 10 000 euros par mois, bien que ce ne soit qu'une estimation approximative. Il est également possible que les joueurs aient des clauses de performance ou des bonus qui peuvent augmenter leurs revenus en fonction de leur développement, de leur temps de jeu, ou de leur promotion en équipe première. Comme la situation varie grandement, ces chiffres sont uniquement des indications générales et le salaire réel d'un joueur spécifique pourrait ne pas correspondre à cette estimation. Pour obtenir des informations plus précises, il faudrait consulter des rapports spécifiques qui pourraient être publiés dans les médias sportifs ou obtenir des confirmations directement des représentants du club ou des agents des joueurs."},{"prompt":"Re write the following entries so that the information that follows the colon is on the next line and remove any entries that seem to repeat the same thing but are written in a different way.

When you call \`getElementsByClassName\`, the browser has to traverse the entire DOM and search for elements with the specified class name. If the DOM is extremely large or complex, it can consume a significant amount of memory and processing power, potentially leading to performance issues or even causing the browser to crash. It's worth noting that the performance impact will vary depending on several factors such as the size and structure of the DOM, the hardware and browser being used, and the efficiency of the implementation of \`getElementsByClassName\` in the browser itself. If you're dealing with a large DOM and need to select elements by class name, it is recommended to narrow down the scope of the search by providing a more specific parent element to the \`getElementsByClassName\` method. This way, the browser only needs to search for elements within a smaller portion of the DOM, improving the performance. Additionally, using modern selectors like CSS selectors or using a library like jQuery can help optimize element selection in large DOMs."},{"prompt":"I want you to write a screenplay/shooting script for a scene. Please include every event and dialogue that I describe as part of the scene's prompt sequence in the final output, and combine all the guidelines regarding events and dialogues that I provide in the following part of my prompt into one whole screenplay/shooting script that is coherent, logically consistent and that flows naturally. Please ensure that the scene, its contents and the interactions within it develop organically and realistically in the final output. Please ensure that the scene's characters are compelling and that they act in accordance with their presumed traits and cultural background. Please refrain from portraying the cultural background in an overtly stereotypical fashion; instead, reflect the characters' cultural background with an adequate degree of nuance. Please ensure that all of the scene's dialogues are in logical accordance with the scene's sequence of events, that the dialogues' contents all follow from one another, and that the dialogues don't contain any puns or wisecracks; that the dialogues' contents make sense within the situations that occur in the scene; and that the dialogues' contents fit the characters' cultural backgrounds, as well as the scene's genre and situational context as far as usage of vernacular and dialect is concerned. The way in which the characters speak needs to be derived from their character traits, their cultural background and the scene's genre conventions. Please elaborate in detail on all events and dialogues that occur during the entirety of the scene, and don't write any part of the scene in brevity when providing the final output. In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described), for a very long comedic scene in a Black Sitcom TV Series according to the following guidelines: * The scene should be premised around a scenario where a woman deliberately poops in her pants after being deliberately and physically prevented from accessing the bathroom by another woman. While it is up to you to create the scenario in which this event occurs, this event shouldn't be induced by food poisoning, sickness, laxatives or the consumption of spicy food. It is crucial that the source of the first woman's unbearable urge to move her bowels and the reason for the first woman pooping in her pants as an adult woman will make sense in the context of the scene's events and that they won't feel contrived. There should be a sensible reason within the scenario's internal logic for the first woman not using the bathroom in a normal and timely manner up beforehand, and for why she ends up in a predicament where she is coerced to poop in her pants instead. * The scene should include only 2 female characters. Give both women names, and describe their physical appearances and their clothing in detail. The first woman shouldn't be wearing a dress, a skirt, jeans nor leggings. While providing the background, situate the 2 women in the scene's whole scenario so it could be understood in relation to events that have preceded it and led to it. You may choose for there to be any type of relationship between the 2 women that you deem fit, provided that it fits the scenario you create - they can be friends, relatives, schoolmates, colleagues, neighbors, or any other option. * The scene shouldn't occur in a setting that includes other people. You may pick the location, provided that only the 2 women are in it. It can be a house/apartment/flat, an entrance to a house/apartment/flat, a car, or any other option that you deem fit and that includes the two women only. * If you find it fitting to the scenario you create for the scene, you may have a drawn out phase where a desperate first woman holds the urge to move her bowels throughout the early part of the scene before pooping in her pants. This desperation option isn't mandatory. If you do decide to employ this desperation option, the first woman's urge should be on the brink of eruption by the time the scene starts, as her urge begun well before the scene's events. * It's important to convey that the first woman has a full bowel movement in her pants. You may depict this as you deem fit, but the actual occurence should be drawn out and have a lot of dialogue revolving it, together with descriptions of physical actions and gestures surrounding the occurence. The act of the first woman relieving herself in her pants shouldn't end quickly. * You are free to decide how the other woman reacts initially when the first woman poops in her pants, and how the other woman reacts shortly thereafter. You are also free to choose how the first woman reacts to pooping in her own pants and how she engages the other woman at all points thereafter. However, the other woman must taunt the first woman at some point after the first woman poops in her pants. The taunting can be of any nature that you deem fit and that fits the scenario you create. There should be a lot of taunting about the first woman pooping in her pants and a lot of dialogue between the two women that revolves around this taunting. The taunting dialogues shouldn't consist of witty zingers, convulted witty remarks puns nor wisecracks. Instead, the taunting dialogues should consist of straightforward mocking and simple language. * The taunting by the other woman should revolve around the nastiness related to the first woman pooping in her pants, the appearance of the deposit in the first woman's soiled pants, the odor that is emitting from the first woman's pants, and further things related to the first woman pooping in her pants. The other woman must respond with physical gestures to the odor that is emitting from the first woman's pants wherever and whenever relevant in the scenario. The other woman should be taunting the first woman over the degree to which the first woman stinks after pooping in her pants. However, the taunting dialogues shouldn't revolve only around the odor that is emitting from the first woman's pants; other aspects related to the first woman pooping in her pants, whatever they may be, need to be addressed during the taunting too. The first woman takes the teasing in stride and jokes about the whole situation.","completion":"**INT. SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM - DAY** _PREVIOUS SCENE BRIEF: Rhonda, a quirky but typically reserved IT specialist, has been experiencing strange side effects from a new “no-bloating” fiber supplement she started taking to kick off a healthier lifestyle. She had been stranded at home awaiting a delivery for her new ergonomic desk chair. Right before the arrival of the chair, she felt an uncontrollable urge to use the bathroom. As Rhonda made a beeline for the restroom, her long-time nemesis and neighbor, Tanya, who self-invites to gossip, showed up unannounced and guards the bathroom door to \\"confront\\" her about a community board election._ (The setting is a typical middle-class living room filled with comfortable furniture, family photos, and a bit of clutter. A large window overlooks a quiet street. The doorbell has just rung and RHONDA, dressed in a brightly colored, loose-fitting two-piece tracksuit with a snug waistband, is visibly uncomfortable as she shifts from side to side, demonstrating her urgency to get to the bathroom before answering the door.) RHONDA (Talking to herself) Come on, Rhonda, hold it together. Just act natural. (She peeks through the window, sees TANYA outside, and reluctantly opens the door with a strained smile. TANYA, an exaggerated, well-coiffed woman in her mid-40s, sports a tight, colorful jogging outfit that accentuates her figure, seemingly prepared for a run she never actually takes.) TANYA (Entering, haughty) Girl, you won’t believe the drama at the board meeting last night! (She goes straight for the couch, drops her oversized purse, barely letting RHONDA close the door. RHONDA sneaks glances towards the bathroom.) RHONDA (Clearly agitated) Tanya, this isn’t a good time. I was just about to— TANYA (Interrupts, oblivious) Oh, no you don’t. You're running for my position, you backstabber! We are gonna hash this out now! RHONDA (Suddenly doubling over) Tanya, please, I really need to use the— TANYA (Cutting her off, moving to block the bathroom door) All ears, honey. Talk to me. RHONDA (Grimacing) I need the bathroom. Bad. Like now! TANYA (Bristling with malicious glee) Nu-uh. Not until you drop this election nonsense. RHONDA (Desperation mounting) This is not a power play! I swear it’s something else that's about to drop! (With RHONDA's back to the couch, legs tightly pressed together, she starts to dance a little \\"I-really-need-to-go\\" jig while TANYA, with arms crossed, remains planted in front of the bathroom door, enjoying the power trip.) TANYA (Laughing with derision) Oh, what? You gonna pee yourself? RHONDA (Struggling, voice strained) It's – it's the other thing... Please! (RHONDA takes a deep breath, trying to maintain composure, but her body has other plans. A bead of sweat trickles down her forehead. She closes her eyes, her face tightens, and she takes that decisive last stand. After a few seconds of silence, we hear a subtle but unmistakable sound.) TANYA (Cocking her head, confused at first) What in the— Oh. My. God. Rhonda, did you just— RHONDA (Takes a deep, shuddering breath, then opens her eyes, speaking with a pained but defiant humor) Well, Tanya, when you gotta go, you gotta go. TANYA (Recoiling, covering her nose) Ugh, you're disgusting! Did you seriously just do a number two in your sweatpants? RHONDA (Eyes watery, but with a self-deprecating grin) You ever heard of a crap-tastrophe? Well, you just met one! TANYA (Stepping back, dramatically gagging) Girl, the stench! What died in there? (RHONDA looks ruefully at her soiled pants, the bulge visible, somehow managing to maintain her sense of humor amidst the humiliating situation.) RHONDA (Chuckling) Guess the fiber supplement worked after all—just not on my schedule, honey. TANYA (Eyes watering from the smell, taunting) And I thought your election speech was crap, but this takes it to a whole new level! RHONDA (Shrugging with mock pride) Call me the Queen of Comfort. At least now I don’t have to listen to your crap. TANYA (Still taunting, but wincing from the odor) Wow, Rhonda, making a statement with bold actions, quite the campaign strategy! RHONDA (Easing into the absurdity) At this point, I'd say my actions speak louder than words. (The two women look at each other, TANYA standing in a ridiculous pose trying to avoid the smell, RHONDA resigned to her fate but still smirking. There's a moment of awkward silence before they both start to chuckle, the undeniable ridiculousness of the situation getting to them.) RHONDA (Sighing with a light-hearted resignation) Alright, let's open some windows before a hazmat team shows up. (They move together to air out the room, RHONDA cautiously to avoid any further embarrassment. TANYA tries to keep up the act of being disgusted but can't help cracking up.) TANYA (Through laughter) I'll never let you live this down, you know? RHONDA (Breezily) Oh, honey, I'm counting on it. This is one hell of a story for the grandkids. (They share an unexpected moment of camaraderie, the tension of the earlier confrontation dissipating for now.) **FADE OUT.**"},{"prompt":"Re write the following list so that the information that follows the colon is placed on the next line.

I copied this from the DOM directly. Is this not what the actual classname is or something, or can it be way too deep in the dom to be detectable?","completion":"There could be several reasons why you are having trouble finding the element by its class name. Here are a few possible explanations: 1. Verification of correct class name: Make sure the class name you copied from the DOM is the exact class name of the element. Sometimes, class names can be similar or contain additional spaces or special characters that may affect the selection. Double-check the copied class name to ensure accuracy. 2. Elements loaded dynamically: If the element is loaded dynamically, such as through AJAX or JavaScript, you may need to wait for the element to be fully rendered before attempting to find it. Ensure that the element you are trying to locate is already present in the DOM before searching for it. 3. Class name inside an iframe: If the element you are trying to find exists within an iframe, you will need to switch to the iframe context before attempting to locate the element. You can use the \`switchTo().frame()\` method in Selenium or similar approaches depending on the testing library you are using. 4. Potential nested or shadow DOM: If your target element is nested deep within other elements or inside a shadow DOM, it might not be directly accessible using a class name selector. In such cases, you may have to traverse the DOM hierarchy or use alternative selectors like XPath, CSS selectors, or querySelectorAll to accurately locate the element. In summary, ensure that you have the correct class name and that the element is rendered in the DOM. If the element is nested deep or wrapped in an iframe, you might need to adjust your locator strategy accordingly."},{"prompt":"Story prompt: Alex has spent years practicing different forms of drawing, from architecture, perspective, landscapes and more, during those years, Alex spent it the most on human anatomy. Studying the bones, muscles, fat and skin on humans, as well as the clothes people would wear, Alex had mastered this topic effortlessly. If you asked him to, Alex could draw a realistic drawing of a human head based on his knowledge of human anatomy, the way the bones, muscles, fat, skin and hair are positioned in. So it was a big shock to his friends Sharon and Daniel when Alex used those years of studying and practice to draw in an anime style, reminiscent of those like Demon Slayer or My Hero Academia, even taking inspiration from One Piece, a series popular for many things, but notably is freedom and lack of restraint on character design.","completion":"Alex had always been the go-to guy for realistic artwork among his group of friends. His meticulous attention to detail and ability to capture the subtle nuances of the human body made him the undisputed master of realistic drawings. So, when he unveiled his latest piece to his friends Sharon and Daniel, their jaws dropped in disbelief. The drawing depicted a stunning anime character with vibrant blue hair, striking golden eyes, and an intense expression that seemed to pierce the viewer's soul. The anatomy of the character, despite being in an anime style, was flawlessly executed, bringing the character to life with remarkable precision. Sharon and Daniel couldn't believe their eyes. They had expected another of Alex's realistic studies, perhaps a portrait of a famous historical figure or a detailed representation of a beautiful landscape. But this...this was unexpected. \\"Alex, this is amazing!\\" Sharon exclaimed, inspecting every stroke of vibrant color and precise line. \\"I had no idea you had such talent for anime art!\\" Daniel, still bewildered, chimed in. \\"I mean, I always knew you were an amazing artist, but this...this is a whole new level! How did you even learn to draw in this style?\\" Alex smiled, a twinkle of mischief in his eyes. \\"Well, while I was studying human anatomy, I realized that there's so much more to art than just capturing reality. Anime, manga, and cartoons, in general, explore the imagination and stretch the limits of character design. I wanted to challenge myself and explore a different style, one that allowed me the freedom to create unique, dynamic characters.\\" He pulled out a small stack of sketchbooks from his bag, filled with pages upon pages of anime-inspired art. \\"Over the years, in between my realistic studies, I secretly practiced drawing in this style. It was my guilty pleasure, my escape from the constraints of reality.\\" Sharon and Daniel eagerly leafed through the sketchbooks, their eyes widening with each turn of the page. They marveled at the diverse range of characters Alex had created, each one unique, bold, and bursting with personality. \\"This is incredible, Alex,\\" Daniel said, unable to hide his admiration. \\"You've truly mastered both worlds of art. Your knowledge of anatomy is evident even in these anime drawings. It's like you've merged reality and fiction seamlessly.\\" Alex's smile grew wider. \\"Thank you, guys. I'm glad you appreciate it. To me, art is all about growth, experimentation, and pushing boundaries. I never wanted to confine myself to a single style. It's liberating to be able to express myself in different ways, both through realism and anime.\\" From that day forward, Alex's friends became his biggest supporters, encouraging him to continue exploring new styles and techniques. They admired his ability to effortlessly transition between the realistic and anime worlds, proving that art had no limits, and true mastery lay in one's willingness to step outside their comfort zone. And as Alex continued to create breathtaking artworks in both styles, he realized that his passion for drawing didn't have to be limited by expectations or preconceived notions. With his unique blend of expertise and imagination, he had the power to create something truly extraordinary – a fusion of reality and fantasy that left everyone inspired and in awe."},{"prompt":"Alex would also teach his fellow friends, Kathy and Neil, how to draw anime while utilizing the knowledge and details of the human body. Alex explained that despite anime styles being more artistic and realistic, the same lessons can be applied. He explained how a real life human skull has the eye holes facing front and that can be applied to anime styles as well. How even the realistic shape of a jaw line can be used in anime styles where the jawline is often drawn simply.","completion":"As Alex continued to delve deeper into his exploration of anime art, he realized the importance of sharing his newfound knowledge with his friends, Kathy and Neil. He believed that their understanding of human anatomy would greatly enhance their ability to create compelling and realistic anime drawings. With excitement and enthusiasm, he invited them to join him in his artistic journey. Settling into his art studio, Alex gathered his friends around a large table adorned with sketchbooks, pencils, and reference materials. He began by explaining the fundamental principles of human anatomy and how they could be applied to anime styles. \\"Guys, understanding human anatomy is the key to creating believable and dynamic anime characters. Even though anime art often simplifies facial features and exaggerates certain aspects, the underlying structure is still crucial,\\" Alex explained, flipping through pages of his sketchbooks to illustrate his points. He pointed to a drawing of a human skull. \\"Take the placement of the eyes, for example. In real life, the eye sockets face forward, and this can be applied to anime styles as well. By understanding how the skull is positioned, we can ensure that our anime characters have a sense of depth and three-dimensionality.\\" Kathy and Neil nodded, their eyes fixed on the imagery before them. They were captivated by the way Alex seamlessly merged the accuracy of anatomy with the imaginative world of anime. Alex continued his lesson, highlighting the importance of the jawline. \\"In anime, the jawline is often drawn simply, but that doesn't mean we overlook its real-life counterpart. A well-shaped jawline can enhance the overall appearance of an anime character, giving them a sense of strength or grace. By grasping the anatomy behind it, we can manipulate and stylize it while still maintaining a realistic foundation.\\" As they delved further into their study, Alex showed them how the muscles, fat distribution, and skeletal structures can be translated into anime art. He encouraged Kathy and Neil to experiment with different styles, pushing the boundaries of their creativity while rooted in the knowledge of human anatomy. Weeks turned into months as they honed their skills together. Sharing techniques, exchanging advice, and embracing the fusion of realism and anime, they grew as artists. Alex watched with pride as Kathy developed a talent for capturing the intricate details of anime eyes, while Neil excelled at portraying dynamic poses with a sense of balance and movement. Their dedication paid off as they showcased their progress in a joint art exhibition. Together, Kathy, Neil, and Alex displayed their distinct styles, each infused with their own interpretation of anime and human anatomy. The exhibition was met with awe and admiration from visitors, who marveled at the unique combination of realism and imaginative design. In the end, their journey wasn't just about mastering a particular style—it was about breaking boundaries, combining knowledge, and unleashing their creative potential. Alex, Kathy, and Neil had discovered that when art and anatomy intertwined, the possibilities were limitless. They realized that their ability to draw anime, with a foundation in human anatomy, was a testament to their growth, passion, and the sheer joy of artistic expression."},{"prompt":"Re write the following list so that the information that follows the colon is placed on the next line. 1.

Por un lado, el costo de la calidad preventiva se relaciona con las actividades y los recursos invertidos para prevenir errores y defectos en el producto o servicio desde el comienzo del proceso. Esto incluye la implementación de buenas prácticas, la formación del personal, la planificación y el diseño adecuado, y la implementación de sistemas de gestión de calidad. El objetivo de estos esfuerzos es evitar problemas y garantizar que el producto o servicio sea de alta calidad desde el principio, lo que a su vez reduce la probabilidad de errores y defectos futuros. Por otro lado, el costo de la calidad de fallas se refiere a los gastos generados por errores y defectos que se producen durante la producción o después de que el producto o servicio ha sido entregado al cliente. Esto podría incluir el costo de reparaciones, devoluciones, reclamaciones de garantía, reemplazos, pérdida de clientes y daño a la reputación de la empresa. Estos costos son mayores que los de la calidad preventiva, ya que implican corregir problemas después de que ya han ocurrido. Es importante mencionar que el objetivo del Costo de la Calidad no es minimizar los costos en sí, sino alcanzar un equilibrio entre los costos preventivos y los costos de fallas para lograr la mejor calidad posible.

Here's a guide that might help you construct such a character: 1. **Define their moral compass**: Your hero should have a clear set of values and principles but understand that morality is complex. They can recognize that what is right isn't always clear-cut, and sometimes good people can make bad choices or find themselves in difficult situations. 2. **Show self-awareness**: Your hero is mindful of their strengths and weaknesses. They recognize their own fallibility and biases and strive to improve them. They don't position themselves as superior to others; instead, they reflect on their actions and their consequences. 3. **Give them empathy**: They can empathize with others, understand different perspectives, and recognize that everyone has their own struggles. This empathy prevents them from being a moral busybody because they're not quick to judge or interfere without understanding the situation. 4. **Create internal conflict**: Present them with moral dilemmas that force them to question their beliefs and choices. This drives character development and shows that they're open to growth and change. It demonstrates that they're not rigid and allows readers to relate to the complexities of making hard decisions. 5. **Have them pick their battles**: A self-aware hero knows they can't fight every fight. They understand the importance of prioritizing and recognizing when it's appropriate to step in or when it's best to let others handle a situation. 6. **Introduce limits**: They acknowledge that they can't fix everything and everyone. They understand their limits and respect other characters' autonomy and agency. 7. **Balance action with reflection**: Your hero doesn't just rush in; they think things through and consider the impact of their actions on themselves and others. 8. **Display humility**: Portray your hero as someone who doesn't seek glory or recognition. They do what they feel is right because it aligns with their values, not for accolades or rewards. 9. **Use nuanced dialogue**: Have your hero express their thoughts and feelings in a way that reflects their complexity. They don't speak in absolutes but rather in a measured and considerate manner. 10. **Show respect for the law, but with a critical eye**: Your hero might respect the structure that laws provide but also understand that sometimes laws can be flawed. They stand up for what's right, even if it means questioning authority. 11. **Surround them with diverse characters**: Their interactions with a variety of characters can highlight their self-awareness and their ability to reflect on their actions and beliefs. 12. **Lead by example**: Instead of preaching, the hero inspires others through their actions and choices. They would rather demonstrate what it means to be good and self-aware than tell others how to behave. By considering these elements, you can construct a hero that is capable of inspiring readers with their deeds while avoiding the pitfalls of moral superiority or unwarranted interference in others' lives. Remember, a self-aware hero is someone who recognizes the complexities of life and understands that everyone, including themselves, is a work in progress."},{"prompt":"What's the potential downside of making doing 'the right thing' look easy in media?","completion":"Portraying the act of doing \\"the right thing\\" as effortlessly easy in media can have several negative ramifications, both on audience perception and on the construction of engaging and realistic narratives. Here are some of the potential downsides: 1. **Unrealistic Expectations**: If doing the right thing is always easy and without consequence, audiences might develop unrealistic expectations about how moral decisions work in the real world. In life, ethical choices often come with complexities and can be tough to grapple with. 2. **Reduced Tension and Conflict**: Stories thrive on tension and conflict. When correct decisions are made without struggle, it can strip the narrative of depth and drama, leading to less engaging stories. The process of character growth is often tied to overcoming challenges, which may be absent if the right actions are always straightforward. 3. **Diminished Relatability**: Characters who make morally right decisions seamlessly may become difficult for audiences to relate to. Most people understand from experience that being ethical can be difficult. Characters who do not reflect this reality can seem detached from the very audiences they are meant to inspire or entertain. 4. **Simplification of Morality**: Morality is rarely black and white, but reducing the act of making ethical decisions to something that's always easy can oversimplify complex moral dilemmas. This might lead an audience to underestimate the real-world complexities and nuances involved in evaluating and acting upon ethical considerations. 5. **Minimized Stake in Character Development**: When characters don't struggle to do the right thing, there is a missed opportunity for character development. Characters who face and overcome moral challenges can grow and change in meaningful ways, providing a richer experience for the audience. 6. **Lack of Educational Value**: Media has the power to educate through storytelling. Presenting ethical decision-making as cost-free or without internal or external struggle deprives the audience of the chance to learn about the real-life stakes involved in such decisions. 7. **Potential to Discourage Real-world Action**: If audiences are led to believe that moral actions are easy and without negative repercussions, they might become discouraged when facing the more complex ethical challenges of the real world. This could lead to apathy or inaction when they encounter situations that require moral courage and the acceptance of potential risks or sacrifices. 8. **Undervaluing of Heroism and Bravery**: True acts of heroism often involve risk, sacrifice, and facing adversity. If media consistently show \\"doing the right thing\\" as easy, it diminishes the value of bravery and the true courage it takes to stand up for one’s principles when it is hard to do so. 9. **Narrative Predictability**: If characters always easily do the right thing, it can lead to predictable storytelling, where audiences can readily foresee outcomes without the suspense or curiosity that makes stories compelling. 10. **Lack of Emotional Impact**: Struggle and conflict can lead to powerful emotional payoffs in storytelling. Without them, the resolution of a narrative can feel underwhelming, denying the audience an emotionally satisfying experience. To mitigate these downsides, writers can strive to create narratives where characters grapple with moral choices, face consequences for their actions, and develop as individuals through their experiences. This approach not only provides a more nuanced and realistic reflection of moral decision-making but also enhances the overall quality and impact of the media."},{"prompt":"Rewrite the response while keeping as much of the orginal language as possible: In the speech given by Wendell Phillips who was a prominent white American abolitionist in 1861 near the beginning of the Civil War, when Northerners were debating whether to allow African Americans to serve in the military, Phillips praises and celebrates the achievements of the Haitian general Toussaint Louverture. He does this in order to make his audience understand that since he was former slave who led the struggle to liberate other enslaved Haitians in order prove that even people from African American descent should allowed serve in the military since Louverture’s achievements were similar or exceeded those of White men like Washington and Napoleon. Philips also, through the use of metaphors and historical comparisons to famous people, shows that Louverture’s achievements were similar and that he should be celebrated as a result and the use of visualization to help his audience understand the scale of his achievements. These strategies overall help Phillips move his audience and praise his subject, General Toussaint Louverture. In the beginning of the speech, Phillips compares Toussaint to notable historical figures like Napoleon and Washington. This can be seen in the first paragraph of his speech which states “If I stood here tonight to tell the story of Napoleon, I should take it from the lips of Frenchmen, who find language rich enough to paint the great captain of the nineteenth century. Were I here to tell you the story of Washington, I should take it from your hearts, - you, who think no marble white enough on which to carve the name of the Father of his country. I am about to tell you the story of a negro who has hardly written one line. I am to glean it … from the lips of his enemies ”. These comparisons right off the bat from the beginning of the speech show that Phillips is trying to excite the audience by bringing up these notable historical figures to and for the audience to remember some the achievements and details about the historical figures and then comparing him to these figures later on to Toussaint in order to make the audience understand that Toussaint was equal to or greater than these notable historical figures. Another example of Phillips comparing Toussant to notable figures is in the third paragraph of his speech which states that “I would call him Cromwell, but Cromwell was only a soldier, and the state he founded went down with him into his grave. I would call him Washington, but the great Virginian held slaves”. In the third paragraph Phillips builds on what he said in the first paragraph and compares him to notable figures such as Washington and Cromwell to Toussaint in order to make the audience understand that Toussaint was equal to or greater than these notable historical figures. Continuing on, Phillips uses metaphors and visualization to praise and move his audience in the second paragraph of his speech which states: “[Toussaint] forged a thunderbolt and hurled it at what? At the proudest in Europe, the Spaniard, and sent him home conquered; at the most warlike blood in Europe, the French, and put them under his feet; at the pluckiest blood in Europe, the English, and they skulked home to Jamaica”. The use of visualization of the quote helps the audience understand the scale of Toussaint's achievements and achieves Philips goals of praising Toussaint and moving his audience.","completion":"In a speech delivered by Wendell Phillips, a preeminent white American abolitionist in 1861 as the Civil War was beginning and Northern deliberations regarding African American military service were underway, Phillips extols and commends the accomplishments of the Haitian general, Toussaint Louverture. His aim was to demonstrate to his listeners that since Louverture, a former slave, led the charge for Haitian liberation, African Americans should be deemed equally capable of military service, given that Louverture's triumphs were comparable to, or surpassed those of esteemed white figures like Washington and Napoleon. By drawing upon metaphors and historical parallels with these notable persons, Phillips underscores the equivalence or superiority of Louverture's feats and advocates for rightful recognition. Furthermore, he leverages vivid imagery to convey the magnitude of Louverture's contributions, a rhetorical device that assists Phillips in both exalting his subject and captivating his audience. At the outset of the speech, Phillips establishes a connection between Toussaint and historic luminaries such as Napoleon and Washington. He opens by saying, “If tonight I were to relate Napoleon's tale, I would do so with the words of Frenchmen, whose language suffices to depict the nineteenth century's grand commander. If here to recount Washington's story, I'd turn to you, whose hearts know no marble pure enough to inscribe the Father of His Country's name. But now, I must tell of a negro, barely having penned a word himself, and I shall piece it together... from the accounts of his adversaries”. Immediately, by invoking these legendary figures, Phillips sets the stage for his audience to recall their deeds and then measure Toussaint against them, arguing for Toussaint's equal or greater stature. Further illustrating this point, Phillips elaborates in his third paragraph, “Were I to name him Cromwell, but Cromwell was merely a soldier, whose state crumbled with him into the grave. Were I to name him Washington, but the esteemed Virginian was a slaveholder”. Here, Phillips enhances his initial comparison, arguing for Louverture's powerful legacy surpassing these historical icons. Moreover, in Phillips' second paragraph, vivid metaphors and imagery are employed to laud and stir the listeners, as he declares: “[Toussaint] crafted a thunderbolt and launched it at whom? At Europe's most haughty, the Spaniard, sending him home defeated; at the continent's most martial lineage, the French, and he trampled them; at the staunchest stock, the English, and they slunk back to Jamaica”. This description allows listeners to grasp the scope of Toussaint's successes, effectively achieving Phillips' aim to both honor Toussaint and resonate deeply with his audience."},{"prompt":"Write a chapter of 1000 words set on the fallout universe, takes place on vault 91, ones of 120 vaults part of vault program by Vault-Tec corporation,the Vaults were advertised as the best method to safeguard the American people from a coming nuclear apocalypse but in reality the vaults were actually designed to be a vast network of long-term experiments to study human behavior and physiology under a multitude of situations an vault 91 is no different… Upon entering Vault 91, all of the Vault Dwellers would be put on a mandatory daily drug regiment, to be administered by a small group of Mister Orderlies that also act as helpers to any human medical staff present. The residents will be told that the drugs they are taking are to help protect them against potential radiation poisoning, but the true purpose of the drugs is far more sinister. In fact, not all residents will be getting the same chemical cocktail to begin with. The women of Vault 91 will be given an experimental growth treatment which will make them grow taller and stronger, maxing out at a bit over seven feet tall on average. Of course, this won’t make them lose any of their femininity: in fact, in some test subjects those same growth hormones may even increase the size of their hips, butt, and bust on top of everything else. However, these drugs also have the side effect of damaging certain areas of the brain dealing with critical thinking and memory retention, effectively making the female population of the Vault become dumber as they continue to grow. The men of Vault 91 will be given a series of drugs that will do pretty much the exact opposite. Their memory retention and critical thinking skills will increase during their treatment, increasing intelligence for them across the board, but these same drugs will also stunt their growth and make it harder to build and maintain muscle mass, eventually making the male population smarter but physically smaller and weaker than their female counterparts, with a final projected height of around four feet. The purpose of this experiment, at least in the eyes of Vault-Tec, would be twofold. The first would be to test the effectiveness of these drugs in general, and see if the potential benefits of each may outweigh their downsides. The second would be a sociological experiment to see which of the two genders would take control of the Vault once the drug treatments reach their final outcome. Will the stronger but dumber women use their physical strength to intimidate and strong-arm the men into serving their desires? Or will the weaker but smarter men convince the women of the Vault to let them do all of the thinking, and that it is in their best interest to follow any orders given to them by a man. Perhaps the two groups may even manage to find a balance that lets them maintain a surprisingly high level of gender equality despite the new size and intelligence gap between the two of them. In essence, Vault-Tec wants to figure out whether brains or brawn would win out if they were both pushed to an unnatural extreme. Unfortunately for Vault-Tec, things didn’t work as they expected,first of all the drugs didn’t seen to work at all on the residents of vault 91 outside a slightly increase headache on the women and muscle cramps on men, a fact that made vault-tec to almost scrap alway the vault until it was revealed that the drugs take effect on the next generation that are born and grow up in the Vault with the regiment would be changed, the effect are minimal and barely notice but they accumulate by each generation.another side effect is that the drugs increase female births and diminish male births, minimal at first but like the previius effect it accumulate that by the 200 years late there be 200 women for every man. The regiment for the women has unexpect side-effects: increase their estrogen to unprecedent levels this will make so their hips, butt, and bust size growth well beyond the expected in short drugs not only not cause women lose any of their femininity but in fact surpassed, also will cause women to become a state of mind to hyper-energy, high gleefulness, and high affectioness especially at their males counterparts The regiment for the men also has unexpect side-effects:the hormonal unbalance will make so while their bodies get smaller and smaller, their penis get bigger and bigger, also make the men extremely easily flustered and have inexpected erections Follow the daily live of one those men 200 years after.","completion":"Chapter: A Day in the Life of Vault 91 The hum of Vault 91 reverberated through its steel corridors like a futuristic lullaby, lulling its inhabitants into a semblance of normality amidst the chaos of the post-apocalyptic world outside. Two hundred years had passed since the bombs fell, and Vault 91 had become a singular bubble of skewed humanity, a social experiment gone awry under the watch of Vault-Tec. Joshua nudged the heavy door to his quarters open with a slight grunt, ready to face another day in the patriarchal anomaly that Vault 91 had become. As one of the few males in this generation, he was a rarity, surrounded by the towering women who were his community. Contrary to what Vault-Tec expected, the females of Vault 91 had not become brutish or domineering due to their substantial physical advantage. Instead, they were vivacious and warm-hearted, almost to an exaggerated degree. They bustled through the corridors with energetic strides—each taller than seven feet—with a high-spirited cheer that filled the vault with an effervescent hum. Their feminine features were pronounced, with generously curved hips and full figures that seemed perpetually on the edge of defying gravity. Joshua, on the other hand, was a remnant of the men Vault-Tec had inadvertently molded: intelligent and resourceful, but diminutive in size and strength. The vault jumpsuit hung off his smaller frame, tailored as it was for the previous generation which had been somewhat larger. His boyish face, often flushed with embarrassment from the relentless attention of his peers, was topped by a tousle of hair that he'd hurriedly combed. Despite the numerous advancements in intellect and memory retention attributed to the drug regimen he'd been exposed to since birth, social interactions remained an insurmountable challenge. The presence of a man had become a novelty, and his slightest display of masculinity met with giggling admiration from the surrounding women. Joshua shuffled awkwardly past a group of them on his way to the cafeteria, desperately trying to minimize the expansive difference in height. Vault-Tec's calculations didn't take into account the emotional and psychological dynamics that would emerge. These statuesque women didn't overpower the men; they became fiercely protective, almost motherly. However, the increased levels of estrogen had its own set of effects, leading to hyper-affectionate behavior that targeted the scarce male demographic. Beside the physical mutations, vault life had adapted in remarkable ways. The women, regardless of their reduced critical thinking abilities, managed many of the vault's essential operations, while the men headed committees and planning circles. Despite this division of labor, societal roles had blended into a mix of mutual respect and dependency, rather than the predicted dominance and subservience. Vault 91 was thriving in its peculiar way, but for Joshua, it was a daily trial to navigate his unique stature. Just reaching for a tray at the food counter was a challenge; he was often hoisted up by a chipper woman wanting to assist. \\"Here you go, Joshua!\\" beamed Sarah, one of the resident technicians. She was typical of Vault 91's female population: sociable, exuberant, and immensely strong. \\"Th-thanks, Sarah,\\" Joshua muttered, the blood rushing to his cheeks as her broad smile made him all the more self-conscious. His keen mind had made him a valuable asset, contributing to everything from water purification processes to the enhancement of the vault's power systems. Yet, the frequent surprise erections caused by the hormonal imbalance in his body risked undermining his professional image. The chuckles and affectionate pats he received when these incidents occurred didn't help his anxiety. Lunchtime conversation bubbled with laughter and easy camaraderie, a stark contrast from the anticipated results of the Vault-Tec dossier. The experiment meant to stratify the genders had instead fostered unity. As the drug's influence permeated through generational DNA, the properties became cumulative, further exaggerating the physical disparity but also deepening the empathy and affection between residents. As the male population dwindled, Joshua found himself in a paradox of reverence and vulnerability. On one hand, he was a precious commodity whose presence was celebrated. On the other, he was a perpetual outsider in a world of giants, gently navigating a landscape built for the taller, stronger women. Although Vault 91 was a caring community, Joshua couldn’t help but feel isolated by his singular status. Vault-Tec had sought to create a hierarchy driven by physical prowess or intellect, but what emerged was an unprecedented society built on symbiotic necessity. The true power in Vault 91 lay not in brute strength or sharp minds, but in the harmonious balance struck by its people, bound by a collective spirit undeterred by their artificially induced differences. Yet, for Joshua, the inherent loneliness of being one of the rarified few weighed heavily, and often he wondered what life might have held without Vault-Tec's manipulations. As he sat in his quarters that evening, the soft hum of the vault around him, he pondered not on equations or scientific quandaries but on the simple human longing for connection in a world that had made him an unintentional anomaly. Vault-Tec had underestimated the resilience and adaptability of the human heart, even in the face of extreme physiological change. Vault 91 was proof that humanity could not be reduced to such binary outcomes as 'brains versus brawn.' Instead, it was a tapestry of interdependence, a living testament to the complexity and unpredictability of human society, no matter the circumstances."},{"prompt":"I want you to write a screenplay/shooting script for a scene.

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Black Sitcom TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A young woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she’s a student; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s apartment with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty behind into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being terribly smelly from childishly pooping her pants.","completion":"FADE IN: EXT. URBAN APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY We see a bustling city street. The camera focuses on a young woman, ANGELA, early 20s, athletic build with short, natural hair. She wears a trendy, colorful tracksuit and carries a heavy backpack. The strain is evident on her face as she hustles toward the apartment building. CUT TO: EXT. APARTMENT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER A bead of sweat trickles down Angela's brow as she pats down her pockets in frantic search. Her fingers fumble to find the elusive key while she shuffles from foot to foot. ANGELA (under her breath) Come on, come on... With urgency flooding her features, she knocks loudly on the door. BANG! BANG! BANG! INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS The KNOCKING echoes through the vacant hallway. Angela's discomfort escalates. ANGELA (muttering) Where are you guys? INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS The muffled knocking is heard. CARLA, mid-40s, immaculately dressed in a fashionable loungewear set and her hair wrapped in a silk scarf, approaches the door with a tablet in hand. CARLA (calling out) Who is it? Angela? EXT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS ANGELA (anxious) Yes, Ma, open up, please! INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Carla unlocks the door but fumbles with the chain. CARLA Now hold on, what's the rush? EXT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS ANGELA (impatient) Mom, move! The door swings open revealing Carla, her face colored with bemusement and concern. Angela tries to sidestep her. INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Carla, sensing distress, grasps Angela’s arm. CARLA (concerned) Baby, what's wrong? Talk to me. Angela struggles, trying to disengage. ANGELA (desperately) Mom, please. I need to get in. They tussle lightly, Angela full of determination, Carla protective but blocking the path. At that moment, Angela's urgency reaches its apex. Her face contorts as she loses control. Her mother's grip loosens from shock. CARLA (perplexed) Angela, what on earth— Angela backs away slightly, her posture adjusting into an awkward squat as she continues her unintended release, grunts escaping her lips. ANGELA (embarrassed whisper) Oh my God... Carla's brow furrows in confusion, leaning in closer to inspect. CARLA (confused) Are you sick? Tell me what's happening! ANGELA (muttering to herself) Just... needed this... Carla sniffs the air, her nose twitches. Angela's face is a mask of sheepish relief. CARLA (recoiling) What is that smell? ANGELA (uneasy) Uh... Carla’s eyes widen as realization hits her like a truck. CARLA (disgusted) Did you... no! Tell me you didn't! Angela stands silent, the truth evident in her embarrassed posture. CARLA (voice raising) Girl, did you just poop your pants right now? Uh-uh, not in my house! ANGELA (awkwardly) Can I just go in now? Carla, still reeling, gestures inside with a mix of disgust and impatience. ANGELA waddles in, awkwardly holding the seat of her pants. Carla stops her past the doorway. CARLA (scolding) Hold it! Don’t you dare drop that on my floor. ANGELA (sheepish) I wasn't... I didn't mean to— CARLA (disgusted) Why are you standing there filling up your pants? You’re not five years old! ANGELA, a playful sulk crossing her face. ANGELA (playfully) This is all on you, Ma! CARLA (indignant) Excuse me? Grow up, Angela. ANGELA (earnestly) Ma, I had to go so bad, and you know it! Angela hesitantly touches the bulge in her pants, a playful wince mixing with pride. ANGELA (relieved) Felt so good, though. I just... I need to clean up. CARLA (sarcastic) Good? Angela, you nasty. Carla demands a closer look, inspecting Angela's soiled track bottoms with incredulous taunts. ANGELA (angrily) There was a lot to come out, okay? CARLA (mimicking) Nasty and childish is what you are. She leans in, sniffing exaggeratedly near Angela’s seat, her gestures mocking and infantilizing. ANGELA (self-deprecating) Guess you'll have to deal with the smell, then. CARLA (exasperated) No, we cannot do this. Go clean up now! Angela begins to waddle towards the bathroom, with Carla escorting her, both cringing from the stench. CARLA (continuing her complaints) You reek, girl. And keep it together, no drippings on my floor! They approach the bathroom. Angela stops and teases. ANGELA (coyly) So, you wanna change my poopy diaper, Ma? Carla, a mixture of affronted and frustrated, presses the soiled bulge, pushing Angela forward. CARLA (firmly) Get your dirty self in there, now! Angela cries out in disgust as the bathroom door shuts behind them. Carla, still holding her nose, shakes her head. CARLA (to herself) Grown daughter, acting like she’s still in pull-ups...

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Black Sitcom TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A young woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she’s a senior in school; she has an aversion from pooping in bathrooms outside the privacy of her home and is secretive about her bowel movements; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty behind into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand.

JACKSON RESIDENCE - ENTRYWAY - DAY FADE IN: PREVIOUS SCENE BACKGROUND: TIFFANY JACKSON, a 22-year-old college senior, spent the day at a campus study session for her final exams. Known for her aversion to public restrooms and secretive nature about her bowel movements, the stress of impending tests coupled with her refusal to relieve herself outside her home has led to an urgent situation. Upon reaching the sidewalk in front of her family house, the compounding pressure is near unbearable. CUT TO: EXT. JACKSON RESIDENCE - FRONT DOOR - DAY TIFFANY JACKSON, an athletically built, fashionable young African American woman with braids tied back in a ponytail, rushes toward her family's front door. She wears a pair of comfortable, colorful joggers and a matching hoodie - attire conducive to both long hours of studying and the unfortunate predicament she finds herself in. In her haste, she pats down her pockets in search of her keys, only to discover they are missing. Panic sets in as she aggressively knocks on the door. CUT TO: INT. JACKSON RESIDENCE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The loud knocking echoes through the house. SOPHIA JACKSON (mid-40s), Tiffany’s mom, vibrant and dressed casually with a flair, appears annoyed by the disturbance as she approaches the door. She wears an apron, indicating she's been in the middle of household tasks. SOPHIA (Suspiciously) Who's banging on my door like the FBI? TIFFANY (O.S., Frantic) Mom! Open up, it's me! SOPHIA fumbles with the lock, taking her sweet time, which only exacerbates TIFFANY’S distress. TIFFANY (O.S., Imploring) Mom, please! Hurry! SOPHIA opens the door to find TIFFANY doubled over slightly, a bead of sweat rolling down her forehead. SOPHIA (Concerned, inspecting TIFFANY) Baby, what’s wrong? You sick? TIFFANY, desperate to make a beeline for the bathroom, tries to push past her but SOPHIA, sensing her daughter’s distress, reaches out to steady her, inadvertently blocking her path. TIFFANY (Aggressively pleading, trying to wriggle free) No, I'm fine, just let me in! The women’s bickering escalates, accents of their hometown flavoring their words with familiarity. SOPHIA (Gripping TIFFANY tighter) You ain't fine! You're talking in that high pitch you get when you hiding something. Suddenly, a look of horror freezes TIFFANY’S face as control slips away. She groans, the tension too much to bear. SOPHIA watches in disbelief as TIFFANY recedes backward, bending slightly at the knees – the surrender to her body's demands indisputably written all over her. SOPHIA (Befuddled) Tiffany, what in the world— TIFFANY’S hushed, strained voice is intermingled with soft grunts. TIFFANY (Ashamed, almost inaudible) It's okay... it's... just... let it happen... SOPHIA, confusion morphing into concern, repeatedly sniffs the air, her nose crinkling at a new, potent odor. SOPHIA (Fanning the air, disgusted bewilderment) Did you…? Oh, Lord, please don't tell me— TIFFANY, mortified into silence, cannot utter a word. SOPHIA (Recoiling with each sniff) Tiffany! Did you just... poop yo’ pants?! TIFFANY (Deflecting, pleading) Can I just get past, please? SOPHIA steps aside but can’t mask the look of disgust as TIFFANY clumsily waddles in, cupping the seat of her pants. The scent grows more pungent, permeating the space. As TIFFANY crosses the threshold, SOPHIA abruptly gestures for her to stop. SOPHIA (Scolding, taunting) Alright, hold up right there, Stinky. Make sure none of that mess falls on my floor! TIFFANY stands frozen, a sheepish guard over her soiled attire. SOPHIA (Exasperated, infantilizing) How old are you again? 'Cause grown women don't fill their pants up like it's a day at the daycare! TIFFANY (Playfully sulking) This is on you! You blocked me. If I'd got through, none of this would've happened! SOPHIA (Indignant) Oh no, baby. There's no excuse for a full-grown woman to lose control like that. Period. TIFFANY (Disgruntled, insisting) But I had to! It was too much. Once it started—Gah! SOPHIA (Skeptically) Girl, please. Nothing was stopping you from at least trying to get to a toilet. TIFFANY looks at the bulging seat of her pants and winces playfully. TIFFANY (Complacent) I won't lie, it was a relief—dirty but...damn. I should get cleaned up. SOPHIA blocks her path, mockingly stern. SOPHIA (Critiquing) Relief? Tiffany, you nasty! SOPHIA turns TIFFANY around for a closer inspection, reproaching her as if she were a toddler. SOPHIA (Mocking) Look at you, full of it! Bet you enjoyed every messy second! TIFFANY bickers, her tone a blend of coy and defensive, hand still on the bulge. TIFFANY (Half-joking) Well, it had to come out. And it sure did... all at once. SOPHIA admonishes her, revulsion mingled with mockery. SOPHIA (Condescending) You're like a baby in soiled diapers. Too nasty, Tiffany! SOPHIA emphatically sniffs near TIFFANY’S seat, her face twisting in a pantomime of disgust. SOPHIA (Patronizing) Phew! You are rank! I should treat you like the stinky little kid you acting like. TIFFANY, half-defeated, half-defiant. TIFFANY (Resigned) Sure, if you want to stand here and smell it all—be my guest! SOPHIA, waving her away in distaste, her expression tightens. SOPHIA (Dismissively) Girl, you ain't about to marinate in that mess. Go clean yourself up. Now! SOPHIA carefully guides her towards the bathroom, a hand gingerly supporting the weighted seat of TIFFANY’S pants. TIFFANY cringes with every waddle, the stench trailing behind them. TIFFANY (Emboldened by embarrassment) It feels like it's gonna slide down my leg. SOPHIA (Exasperated) Better not be. Keep it together till you hit that tub! Upon reaching the bathroom, TIFFANY turns towards SOPHIA with a mischievous glint. TIFFANY (Coyly) You sure you don’t wanna...change me? SOPHIA, at the end of her rope, playfully but firmly squashes the bulge. SOPHIA (Forcefully, disgusted) Get in that bathroom, you dirty child! TIFFANY, propelled forward by the squish, cries out in a mix of amusement and disgust. TIFFANY (Distressed) That’s gross, Mom, stop! SOPHIA, triumphant through her revulsion, slams the door shut behind TIFFANY. CUT TO: EXT. JACKSON RESIDENCE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS SOPHIA walks away, muttering to herself. SOPHIA Mmm-mmm. Child ain't got no sense. Pooping her pants like it's a game. She shakes her head with a blend of love and unbelief for her daughter's antics while TIFFANY’S laughter can be heard through the closed bathroom door – a moment of uproarious family dysfunction.

В случае анимационной арматуры в Blender, обычно у костей есть начальное положение (рест-поза) и позиционные трансформации, которые определяют текущую позу. Чтобы перенести рест-позу в позу, вы должны сбросить все текущие трансформации позы в их начальное положение. Для этого можно сделать следующее: 1. Убедитесь, что вы находитесь в режиме позирования (Pose Mode). 2. Выделите все кости нажатием \`A\`. 3. Сбросьте все трансформации, нажав \`Alt + G\` (чтобы сбросить перемещение), \`Alt + R\` (чтобы сбросить вращение) и \`Alt + S\` (чтобы сбросить масштаб). Таким образом, трансформации позы сбросятся к рест-позе. 4. Если ваша цель - сохранить эту рест-позу и превратить ее в базовую позу для анимации, вы можете нажать \`I\` для вставки ключевого кадра для всех необходимых трансформаций (вы можете выбрать \\"LocRotScale\\" для локации, поворота и масштаба). Теперь ваша текущая поза будет согласована с рест-позой, и если вы хотите продолжать работать с ней как с базовой для анимации, вы уже имеете ключевой кадр с этими начальными трансформациями.

Keep in mind that singletons are often contentious due to various issues like tight coupling, potential for misuse, and difficulty in testing. Use them wisely and consider whether your project really needs a singleton or if there's a different design pattern that would suit your needs better."},{"prompt":"create a singleton pattern for a unity class, I want to know how to implement it","completion":"Certainly! When you want to implement a singleton pattern for a specific Unity class, you would essentially follow the same approach as the generic example provided earlier; however, you would tailor the pattern to your specific class without using generics. Here's an example of how you might implement a singleton pattern for a class called \`GameManager\`: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour { private static GameManager _instance; // Public property to access the instance public static GameManager Instance { get { if (_instance == null) { // Try to find an existing instance in the scene _instance = FindObjectOfType<GameManager>(); if (_instance == null) { // Create a new GameObject and attach the singleton component GameObject singletonObject = new GameObject(); _instance = singletonObject.AddComponent<GameManager>(); singletonObject.name = typeof(GameManager).ToString() + \\" (Singleton)\\"; // Ensure this object is not destroyed when loading a new scene DontDestroyOnLoad(singletonObject); } } return _instance; } } private void Awake() { // Detect if there are multiple instances of the singleton and destroy any extra instances if (_instance != null && _instance != this) { Destroy(gameObject); return; } _instance = this; DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject); } // Rest of the GameManager class // Add your game management functionality and methods here // ... } \`\`\` Now, whenever you want to access your \`GameManager\` singleton, you can simply call \`GameManager.Instance\`. For example, if you have a method inside \`GameManager\` called \`ResetGame\`, you could call it like this from another class: \`\`\`csharp GameManager.Instance.ResetGame(); \`\`\` This pattern and the class example will ensure that there is only ever one instance of \`GameManager\` in your game, that it persists through scene loads, and that it can be easily accessed from anywhere in your code. A few things to note: 1. Always ensure that singletons are used appropriately and for objects that truly need to be unique and globally accessible. 2. Be aware that using singletons can make your code harder to test and can lead to tight coupling between classes. 3. Properly handle the lifecycle of your singleton, particularly with respect to scene transitions and application quitting, to avoid inconsistencies and memory leaks."},{"prompt":"wait cororuntine to finish unity","completion":"In Unity, coroutines cannot be paused or awaited like typical async/await patterns in C#. However, you can structure your code to respond to when a coroutine has finished its execution. Here are some techniques to make sure you wait until a coroutine is finished: **1. Callbacks:** You can pass a callback method as a parameter to your coroutine and invoke it when the coroutine completes its task. \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using System; public class CoroutineExample : MonoBehaviour { private void Start() { StartCoroutine(WaitAndPrint(() => Debug.Log(\\"Coroutine finished!\\"))); } private IEnumerator WaitAndPrint(Action onFinished) { Debug.Log(\\"Coroutine started\\"); // Simulate some work yield return new WaitForSeconds(2.0f); Debug.Log(\\"Work done\\"); // Invoke the callback onFinished?.Invoke(); } } \`\`\` In the example above, the \`WaitAndPrint\` coroutine takes an \`Action onFinished\` parameter, which is a delegate that points to the method to be called when the coroutine finishes. After yielding \`WaitForSeconds\`, it invokes the callback with \`onFinished?.Invoke()\`. **2. Coroutine wrapper:** If you want to check if a coroutine has finished, you can wrap it in another coroutine function and perform your post-coroutine logic right after the yield instruction. \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class CoroutineWrapperExample : MonoBehaviour { private void Start() { StartCoroutine(WaitForCoroutine()); } private IEnumerator WaitForCoroutine() { yield return StartCoroutine(WaitAndPrint()); // This code will execute after WaitAndPrint finishes Debug.Log(\\"Coroutine finished!\\"); } private IEnumerator WaitAndPrint() { // Simulated work yield return new WaitForSeconds(2.0f); Debug.Log(\\"Work done\\"); } } \`\`\` **3. Coroutine Controller:** Create a coroutine controller class that manages coroutines and provides a way to check if they are completed. \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class CoroutineController : MonoBehaviour { public static CoroutineController Instance { get; private set; } private IEnumerator currentCoroutine = null; private void Awake() { if (Instance == null) { Instance = this; DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject); } else { Destroy(gameObject); } } public void StartManagedCoroutine(IEnumerator coroutine) { if (currentCoroutine != null) StopCoroutine(currentCoroutine); currentCoroutine = coroutine; StartCoroutine(co_routine); } public bool IsCoroutineRunning() { return currentCoroutine != null; } // Call this when the coroutine is finished to clear it public void CoroutineFinished() { currentCoroutine = null; } } \`\`\` You would then modify your coroutine to inform the \`CoroutineController\` when it is finished.

Additionally, the \`set\` accessor is infinitely recursive because it's trying to assign to itself, which will result in a stack overflow exception.

Then use this field in both the \`get\` and \`set\` accessors. Here's how you can modify the code: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.UI; public class YourClass : MonoBehaviour { [SerializeField] private Text populationText; private int currentVillagers; // Backing field public int MaxVillagers { get; set; } // Assuming you have a similar property for MaxVillagers // Property with a backing field public int CurrentVillagers { get { return currentVillagers; } set { currentVillagers = value; // Update the backing field, not the property itself Debug.Log(\\"Setting value \\" + value); // Make sure populationText is assigned before trying to use it if (populationText != null) { populationText.text = currentVillagers + \\"/\\" + MaxVillagers; } } } // Rest of your class code } \`\`\` In this modification: 1. \`currentVillagers\` is a private field that actually stores the value. 2. The \`set\` accessor now correctly assigns the new value to the \`currentVillagers\` field. 3. The \`get\` accessor returns the value stored in \`currentVillagers\`.

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Black Sitcom TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A young woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she’s a high school senior; she has an aversion from pooping in bathrooms outside the privacy of her home and is secretive about her bowel movements; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty behind into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being terribly smelly from pooping her pants.","completion":"FADE IN: EXT.

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how it was difficult in the middle to medieval ages of history to get an accurate and proper sense of what everyday life was for common folk, peasants and merchants in terms of precise details through illustrations and drawings. Since the cost of hiring an artist was prohibitive for most not wealthy people or nobles, in addition the artwork that did get produced being lost and damaged, historians don't really have a complete, comprehensive understanding of what life was really like for those folks who were not wealthy or noble as it pertains to illustrative artwork.","completion":"In the labyrinthine annals of history, it is an unequivocal fact that the granular texture of common life during the middle to medieval ages is nebulous at best, with the prevailing wind of time effacing the precise, quotidian details of the existence led by the plebeians of yesteryear. One of the culprits for this historical dearth lies in the arena of visual representation. Art, often a meticulous diarist of the times, has left us with an impaired legacy when it comes to the faithful recording of the lives of common folk, peasants, and merchants. Delving into the heart of this matter, the commissioning of art during these epochs was an extravagance beyond the pale of the layman's fiscal grasp. Only the coffers of the wealthy and the nobility could accommodate the extravagance of hiring an artist; their patronage chiefly ensured that only their visages, opulent lifestyles, and grand events were committed to canvas or fresco. Consequently, artists were drawn, as iron to magnets, towards these affluent and influential benefactors, seeking not only patronage but also the continuity of their craft. This lopsided equation meant that common scenes of the hoi polloi—their daily struggles, the simplicity of their labor, and the fabric of their entertainment—were eschewed for grander narratives that aligned with the vanities of the times. Further exacerbating this skew was the fact that what precious little artwork that might have once existed as a window into the lives of commoners has largely been ravaged by the ravages of time. The scant illustrations and drawings that did manage to capture facets of their existence did so through the periphery of more dominant subjects, often as background embellishment or as caricatures bordering on derision. Paint and parchment were not immune to the decayes of time; these materials were subject to deterioration from the elements, from wars, and from the indifferent hand of subsequent generations who may have deemed such vulgar representations unworthy of preservation. This destructive sequence of historical neglect has thus plundered modern-day historians of a comprehensive vivarium of medieval mundanity. The existence of the non-elite is mostly relegated to the shadows, with only skeletal remnants of information accessible to corroborate the lifestyles of those outside the gilded cages of wealth and nobility. Faced with a puzzle bereft of its myriad pieces, historical experts are left to infer from the rare incidences of broader strokes—modest sketches hidden in the margins of illuminated manuscripts, figurines intricately woven into the decorations of domestic artifacts, or through the whimsical simplicities of peasant life occasionally spotlighted by bards who sought to enliven their tales with a touch of earthly grittiness. This chasm in visual documentation leaves a churning gulf of speculation wherein historians strive to interpolate and reconstruct the forgotten lives of the many from the overrepresented lives of the few. The absence of explicit heraldry depicting the daily grind—be it plowing fields, bartering goods, or frolicking at a village festivity—renders much of what is surmised to border on conjecture. Without the luster of clarity to guide them, our understanding of this stretch of historical experience is like a tapestry shorn of its most colorful threads, leaving us with a monochrome hint of what might have been, rather than a vibrant tableau of what was. Thus, if one were to embark upon a journey of imagination, to step into the worn boots of a medieval commoner, the vista would be shrouded in a historical haze. The path walked by these folk is overgrown with the brambles of uncertainty, trodden upon by a myriad of guesswork, and ultimately lost to the shadow of time's unrelenting march. The voices of the masses, calling out from the depths of history, are but faint whispers, their stories languishing in the absence of the defiant embers of illustration that once had the potential to bring their worlds vividly to life."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly to vividly demonstrate how what artwork was done to represent the commonfolk of the time period was often to embellish or caricature what their daily life was like. From the written work that was preserved of diaries from and news pamphlets of farmers, peasants, merchants and craftsmen there is an incongruity between what was written by and about them and was artists depicted about their lives.","completion":"Among the scattered fragments of medieval iconography, the sparse visual instances that do dare to venture into the realm of the common folk are often less faithful transcripts than they are romanticized vignettes or satirical exaggerations. Artists of the time, when not indulging the pomp of their noble patrons, resorted to stylized interpretations of peasant life, which only fleetingly intersected with reality. The chasm between the written record and the illustrated one gapes wide, a testament to a selective representational bias. Diaries, when they can be unearthed, bleed with the mundane—the coarse threads of farmers toiling under an unforgiving sun, merchants weather-beaten yet steadfast in their mercantile voyages, craftsmen bent over their work, conjuring utility from raw materials. These textual relics, components of a scattered and incomplete historical discourse, resonate with a tenor of authenticity that is palpably absent from the artistry of the time. Contrast these subdued chronicles with the artwork that purports to depict the same lives; what emerges is a discordant diorama, prone to embellishment or ridicule. The artist, perched in a separated sphere, often surrendered to caricature in place of depiction. A farmer's arduous labor became an embellished tableau of pastoral bliss, an idyllic and bucolic existence far removed from the relentless toil of subsistence agriculture. The merchant, rather than captured amidst the fervent haggling in the market square, was painted as either a figure of bloated wealth or scheming trickery, the complexities of his trade distilled into superficial motifs. Craftsmen, whose hands shaped the backbone of the medieval economy, rarely saw their detailed labor and intricate guild structures depicted with accuracy. Instead, they were relegated to the corner of an opulent piece, perhaps a misshapen figure, hunched and comical, a slight to the expertise and dedication that their craft commanded. News pamphlets, which offered snippets of daily occurrences, recorded tales of calamities—floods, fires, famines, and feasts—often diverged from the artistic narrative, which preferred flamboyance or folklore to the harrowing or humdrum reality. A scribe’s diligent records of transactions, crop yields, and daily wages point towards a life of repetitive rigor—details too trifling for grand frescoes but paramount in their economic and social implications. These bureaucratic entries clash with the florid scenes of artists, who frequently bent the arc of their brushstroke towards the fantastic or the farcical. It is within this cacophony of contrast—between the literal script and the embellished sketch—that historians discern an incongruity that undermines a coherent picture of life as it was in the medieval zeitgeist. Attempts to cross-reference these surviving accounts evoke an image of a mosaic whose pieces mismatch. The jocularity encountered in visual pieces finds little counterpart in the somber or prosaic prose penned by those who actually lived through the rigors of medieval existence. Fabulist art does more to obscure than illuminate, cloaking the true countenance of everyday life behind a facade of artifice and artful misdirection. Thus, the true likeness of the medieval commoner is obscured not by a void of representation, but paradoxically, by the misrepresentation that came to define their legacy in the pictorial annals of history."},{"prompt":"I want you to write a screenplay/shooting script for a scene.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty behind into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being terribly smelly from childishly pooping her pants.","completion":"Title: \\"Les Péripéties de Leila\\" INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY A vibrant hallway in a Parisian apartment complex. The wallpaper slightly peels at the corners, hinting at the building’s age and character. We see an anxious young French-Tunisian woman, LEILA (28, olive skin, tight curly hair, vibrant eyes), making a hurried dash towards her family's apartment. She wears casual windbreaker pants and a breezy blouse, their freedom of movement a stark contrast to her rushed gait. Despite her unease, her style is an eclectic mix of Parisian chic and North African flair. Leila's discomposure is fueled by a comedic series of events prequel to our scene. A carefree day out with friends led to indulgence in too many cups of strong coffee and rich, indulgent pastries. Disregarding the brewing storm in her belly, she laughed off the contorting cramps, until she bid farewell to her company only to find herself seized by an unbearable urge to move her bowels. Now the desperate journey home is marred by closed cafés, faulty public restrooms, and a ticking clock of intestinal doom. EXT. LEILA'S APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Leila finally arrives. She pats her pockets, her face a canvas of distress. A realization sets in - her keys are missing. LEILA Merde... In a panic, she frantically KNOCKS on the door. CUT TO: INT. LEILA'S APARTMENT - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS From within the apartment, footsteps approach. MARIAM (56, plump, warm features veiled with concern), Leila's mother, arrives at the other side of the door, drying her hands with a kitchen towel. MARIAM (in French with Tunisian accent) Qui est-ce? EXT. LEILA'S APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS LEILA C'est moi, Leila! INT. LEILA'S APARTMENT - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Mariam sighs, fumbling with the locks with a nonchalance that only increases Leila's anxiety. EXT. LEILA'S APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS The door finally opens and Leila almost falls in, her face contorted with urgency. LEILA Dépêche-toi, maman, bouge! INT. LEILA'S APARTMENT - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS As Leila attempts to bolt forward, Mariam, puzzled, steps in front of her, grabbing her by the shoulders. MARIAM Qu'est-ce qui se passe? Leila, struggling in her grip, pleads with desperate eyes. LEILA Laisse-moi passer, je t'en supplie! They bicker, a flustered dance of concern and concealment, Mariam unknowingly shackling Leila to her plight. Suddenly, Leila GROANS, her face transitioning from panic to a grimace of untimely relief. Mariam's grip loosens, confusion marring her brow. MARIAM Ma fille, qu'est-ce qui ne va pas? Leila, gently easing Mariam's hands off her, takes up a relieving stance, GRUNTING slightly. LEILA (faintly) Ça va, ça va... Mariam, watching mortified, is met with an escalating aroma. She SNIFFS the air, her expression turning to one of revulsion. MARIAM Quelle est cette odeur? Leila stares back, sheepish. Mariam's eyes widen with realization. MARIAM (disgusted) Tu n'as pas fait...? Leila is mute, the shame anchoring her voice. MARIAM (insistent) Leila, dis-moi que tu ne t'es pas... dans ton pantalon? LEILA Maman, je peux entrer maintenant, s'il te plaît? Mariam steps aside, waving her hand in disgust, silently urging Leila through. Leila, in a gingerly waddle, holding the seat of her pants, passes by Mariam. MARIAM (scoffs) Arrête! Ne mets pas cette saleté partout! Leila looks up, sheepish indignation on her face. Mariam, shaking her head, scolds her further. MARIAM Comment peux-tu être si sale? Quand vas-tu grandir? LEILA (teasingly defiant) C'est de ta faute si je n'ai pas pu atteindre les toilettes à temps! Mariam sharply rebuts, prompting another playful retort from Leila. MARIAM Ce n'est pas une excuse, et tu le sais! Leila touches the bulge in her pants, her face a mix of playful pain and complacency. LEILA Tout ce que je sais, c'est que ça faisait du bien. Je dois me nettoyer maintenant. Mariam, aghast at Leila's blasé attitude, blocks her way. MARIAM (enraged) Quelle saleté! Tu devrais avoir honte de ressentir du bien dans cette horreur! Leila attempts to push past, but Mariam demands a closer look at the shame. After a moment of protest, Leila turns her back to Mariam, who taunts her incredulously. MARIAM (derisively) Tu dois aimer être aussi sale, hein? Leila, embarrassed, justifies her needs again, lightly touching the bulge. LEILA Une fille doit faire ce qu'une fille doit faire pour soulagement. MARIAM (disgusted) Tu es devenue un bébé, et tu dois être traitée comme tel. Mariam sniffs near Leila's seat, her gestures mockingly infantile, ridiculing Leila’s stench. MARIAM (playful disgust) Quelle petite fille puante nous avons ici! Leila, conceding to her foul state, retorts. LEILA Eh bien, puisque tu me gardes ici, profitons-en ensemble. Mariam dismisses the banter, nudging Leila towards the bathroom, almost gagging at the smell. MARIAM (urgent) Vas te nettoyer tout de suite, et ne laisse rien tomber! Leila waddles, guided by Mariam who gingerly supports Leila's messy burden, voicing her complaints. As they reach the bathroom, Leila stops and turns with a sly grin. LEILA Tu veux changer ma couche pendant que tu y es? Infuriated, Mariam squeezes the bulge, shoving Leila into the bathroom. MARIAM (plugging her nose) Entre là-dedans, immédiatement! Leila YELPS, the mess inside her pants squelching as she stumbles into the bathroom. Mariam scolds her final jest. MARIAM (playful ire) C'est ce que tu mérites pour ta moquerie! She slams the door shut, still holding her nose, murmuring to herself about Leila's childish antics.

The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty behind into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being terribly smelly from childishly pooping her pants.","completion":"**INT.

She is nearly dancing in place as her body demands to release the pressure built up over the long traffic jam she endured on her ride home, having consumed a large coffee just prior. **PRIYANKA** *(frantically patting her pockets)* Oh no, where is it? Realization hits her - no house key. She KNOCKS hard on the door, desperation mounting. **PRIYANKA** *(muttering to herself)* Please be home, Maa... Moments tick by, each second an eternity of escalating urgency. **MEERA (O.S.)** *(calling out from inside)* Kaun hai? Who is it? MEERA, in her late 40s, elegant with an air of maternal firmness, approaches the door. Her saree is impeccable, bright and colorful, her hair in a neat bun. **PRIYANKA** Maa!

Priyanka shifts away, a stance of convenience overtaking her. **PRIYANKA** *(with exertion and disguised satisfaction)* Ah... bas ek minute, Maa... Meera’s haze of confusion grows as Priyanka grunts softly. She inquires again, no coherent response as Priyanka mutters about the relief. **MEERA** Priyanka, tum theek...

Meera presses on, a mix of repulsion and impatience. **MEERA** *(prodding)* Tumne apne pants mein...? **PRIYANKA** *(avoiding the topic)* Can you let me inside now, please? Meera steps aside with a disgusted gesture. Priyanka waddles in, cupping the back of her salwar, passing by Meera, who stops her short. **MEERA** Ruko, drop to mat karna yahaan pe! Priyanka responds with a sheepish scoff. **MEERA** *(tauntingly)* Kitni gandi hai ye sab! Will you ever grow up? **PRIYANKA** *(playfully sulking)* Ye aapki galti hai, Maa. You blocked me! **MEERA** *(indignant)* That’s no excuse! You just stood there and...! **PRIYANKA** *(defensibly)* It was too much, Maa, I had to! She hesitantly feels the bulging back of her salwar. **PRIYANKA** *(half-smiling)* Par, sach mein, it did feel good to let it go. Meera frowns, preventing Priyanka from escaping to the bathroom. **MEERA** *(mockingly)* Nasty! You enjoyed it? **PRIYANKA** Guess you’ll have to deal with it. Meera turns Priyanka around, inspecting her with mocking disbelief. **MEERA** Dekho toh, kitni sharmnaak hai! You like this? **PRIYANKA** *(timid bickering)* Bohot zyada tha, nikalna hi tha. She touches the mess as she speaks. Priyanka repeats her claim for desperate relief, Meera exclaims over the childishness. **PRIYANKA** I needed it out, Maa... Meera reacts with a theatrical sniff near Priyanka’s pants, facial expressions are mocking, antics infantilizing. **PRIYANKA** *(wryly)* Cross-alag enjoy karo, since you’re so interested. **MEERA** No, no, you will not stay here! Bathroom, go! As they walk, Meera supports Priyanka from behind while complaining. Priyanka cringes, feels a slide. **MEERA** Don’t you dare drop any, I swear Priyanka! They reach the bathroom, Priyanka teases with the mention of a \\"poopy diaper,\\" pointing to her bulging salwar. In frustration and climax, Meera grabs and squeezes the bulge, pushing Priyanka into the bathroom. **MEERA** *(nose held)* Get in there, abhi ke abhi! Priyanka’s cries disgust, affirming the spread of the mess. Meera maintains her disgusted expression, closing the bathroom door. **MEERA** *(to herself)* Grown up, still needing diaper changes!

Pour le football, la Nationale 3 (anciennement CFA 2) est le cinquième échelon du football en France et est un niveau assez élevé qui requiert généralement une bonne expérience et un certain niveau de compétence. À 18 ans, étant considéré comme un débutant, il pourrait être difficile d'intégrer directement une équipe de Nationale 3 sans avoir une expérience préalable ou sans avoir été détecté par des recruteurs lors de séances de détection ou dans un centre de formation. Les clubs de cette division ont généralement des réserves où jouent des jeunes talents qui aspirent à jouer en équipe première ou des joueurs plus expérimentés qui ne sont pas sélectionnés pour l'équipe principale. Cependant, cela ne signifie pas qu'il est impossible d'intégrer un club à ce niveau. Les clubs peuvent organiser des journées de détection ou des essais pour de nouveaux joueurs talentueux. Si tu es déterminé à poursuivre une carrière dans le football, voici quelques étapes que tu pourrais suivre : 1. Entraînement : Travaille sur tes compétences footballistiques, ta condition physique, ta compréhension tactique du jeu et ta technique. 2. Rejoins un club local : Commence par jouer dans un club amateur local pour acquérir de l'expérience en match. 3. Détections et essais : Renseigne-toi auprès des clubs pour savoir s'ils organisent des journées de détection pour attirer de nouveaux talents. 4. Réseautage : Utilise les réseaux sociaux et contacte les clubs pour te faire connaître et montrer ta motivation. 5. Continuité : Si tu ne réussis pas à intégrer une équipe de Nationale 3 immédiatement, ne te décourage pas. Continue à jouer à un niveau où tu peux progresser et sois ouvert à monter les échelons progressivement. 6. Considération pour les exigences : Comprends que le football semi-professionnel et professionnel exige un engagement de temps considérable et une dévotion au sport. N'oublie pas que de nombreux footballeurs professionnels ont commencé dans des équipes inférieures avant de monter les échelons vers le succès. La persévérance, le travail acharné et la passion sont essentiels pour réussir dans ce domaine. Bonne chance!"},{"prompt":"Sa veut dire que je peux jouer dans une équipe réserve d'un club de N3","completion":"Oui, c'est possible. Les clubs qui évoluent en Nationale 3 ont souvent une équipe réserve qui joue à un niveau inférieur (district ou régional) et où les joueurs peuvent se développer et gagner en expérience. L'équipe réserve est souvent utilisée pour donner du temps de jeu aux jeunes joueurs talentueux et à ceux qui reviennent de blessure ou qui ont besoin de matchs pour retrouver leur forme. Si tu es un joueur débutant à 18 ans, intégrer l'équipe réserve d'un club de Nationale 3 représente une opportunité de progresser et d'apprendre aux côtés de joueurs qui ont déjà une certaine expérience à un bon niveau. Il est important de noter que chaque club a sa propre politique de recrutement et son propre système de formation, donc cela varie d'un club à l'autre. Voici quelques étapes que tu pourrais envisager : 1. **Contacte les clubs directement :** Renseigne-toi auprès des clubs pour savoir s'ils ont une équipe réserve et comment ils effectuent leur recrutement. 2. **Participe aux détections :** Beaucoup de clubs organisent des sessions de détection pour trouver de nouveaux talents. Prépare-toi et participe à ces événements. 3. **Montre tes compétences et ta détermination :** Lorsque tu as l'opportunité de t'entraîner ou de jouer avec un club, donne le meilleur de toi-même pour impressionner les entraîneurs et responsables sportifs. 4. **Entraîne-toi à un niveau local :** Si tu as peu ou pas d'expérience en club, commence par jouer pour une équipe locale pour construire ton CV sportif. 5. **Reste ouvert à apprendre et à progresser :** Accepte les conseils, travaille dur pour améliorer ton jeu et sois patient. 6. **Garde un esprit positif :** Le parcours pour devenir footballeur, même à un niveau amateur, peut être rempli de défis.

The residents will be told that the drugs they are taking are to help protect them against potential radiation poisoning, but the true purpose of the drugs is far more sinister. In fact, not all residents will be getting the same chemical cocktail to begin with. The women of Vault 91 will be given an experimental growth treatment which will make them grow taller and stronger, maxing out at a bit over seven feet tall on average. Of course, this won’t make them lose any of their femininity: in fact, in some test subjects those same growth hormones may even increase the size of their hips, butt, and bust on top of everything else. However, these drugs also have the side effect of damaging certain areas of the brain dealing with critical thinking and memory retention, effectively making the female population of the Vault become dumber as they continue to grow. The men of Vault 91 will be given a series of drugs that will do pretty much the exact opposite. Their memory retention and critical thinking skills will increase during their treatment, increasing intelligence for them across the board, but these same drugs will also stunt their growth and make it harder to build and maintain muscle mass, eventually making the male population smarter but physically smaller and weaker than their female counterparts, with a final projected height of around four feet. The purpose of this experiment, at least in the eyes of Vault-Tec, would be twofold. The first would be to test the effectiveness of these drugs in general, and see if the potential benefits of each may outweigh their downsides. The second would be a sociological experiment to see which of the two genders would take control of the Vault once the drug treatments reach their final outcome. Will the stronger but dumber women use their physical strength to intimidate and strong-arm the men into serving their desires? Or will the weaker but smarter men convince the women of the Vault to let them do all of the thinking, and that it is in their best interest to follow any orders given to them by a man. Perhaps the two groups may even manage to find a balance that lets them maintain a surprisingly high level of gender equality despite the new size and intelligence gap between the two of them. In essence, Vault-Tec wants to figure out whether brains or brawn would win out if they were both pushed to an unnatural extreme. Unfortunately for Vault-Tec, things didn’t work as they expected,first of all the drugs didn’t seen to work at all on the residents of vault 91 outside a slightly increase headache on the women and muscle cramps on men, a fact that made vault-tec to almost scrap alway the vault until it was revealed that the drugs take effect on the generational bases as those born and raise in the Vault with the regiment would be changed, the effect are minimal and barely notice but they accumulate by each generation.another side effect is that the drugs increase female births and diminish male births, minimal at first but like the previous effect it accumulate that by the 200 years later there be 200 women for every man. The regiment for the women has unexpect side-effects: increase of their estrogen to unprecedent levels this will make so their hips, butt, and bust size growth well beyond the expected in short drugs not only not cause women lose any of their femininity but in fact surpassed, also will cause women to become a state of mind to hyper-energy, high gleefulness, and high affectioness especially at their males counterparts The regiment for the men also has unexpect side-effects:the hormonal unbalance will make so while their bodies get smaller and smaller, their penis get bigger and bigger, also make the men extremely easily flustered and have inexpected erections Follow the daily live of a fourth generation descendend man from the original population.the people never discovered about of the experiment.write the generation gap between few remaining original population and the new generation.","completion":"Vault 91 had become a peculiar echo of the old world, sitting like a time capsule deep beneath the crust of the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Vault-Tec's experiment, shrouded in secrecy, had evolved beyond anyone's initial expectations, including those of the corporation's own twisted designers. The faded blue jumpsuits adorned by the dwellers bore the number \\"91\\" — a badge of unwitting membership in a generational guinea pig role. The daily drug regimen was like a religious ritual, swallowed with the same unquestioning faith one might afford a deity. The original population, those who had first turned the vault's cogs, had watched as subtle changes manifested throughout the subsequent years. They whispered amongst themselves, discerning the pattern that had emerged, a prophecy written in DNA and manipulated hormones. Henry, a fourth generation descendant, stood conspicuously at three and a half feet tall, a full foot shorter than his father. It was an open secret that the men of the Vault had found themselves shrinking with each new son or grandson. The latest generation, however, bore a strong mind within their diminutive frames. Henry's intelligence was a sharp contrast to his stature, his intellect having bloomed in his twenty years of life. However, no amount of books or logic could explain the frequent blushes that warmed his cheeks nor the embarrassing instances when his body reacted of its own volition. Vault 91's women towered over him; their presence was an overwhelming mix of maternal comfort and imposing might. Sarah, his childhood friend, now cast a shadow over him that seemed to stretch for miles. She was the epitome of Vault 91's imposed evolution: statuesque, with curves that defied imagination. Twice his height and teeming with ebullient energy, her laughter filled the corridors, a mellifluous sound that was both soothing and disconcerting. The women were like colossal sirens, powerfully majestic in ways that belied the cognitive declines observed by some of the original dwellers. As the male population dwindled, each birth of a boy was celebrated with fervor previously reserved for the return of spring to a winter wasteland. The once fifty-fifty chance of a son or daughter was now a rare roll of the genetic dice—yet through this scarcity, the Vault men had become precious. The original population, those who still clung to the memories of a world untainted by Vault-Tec's machinations, noticed the shift in dynamics. Some among the dwindling elders spoke of a time when men and women were more equals than they were now, reminiscing about old philosophies and social structures turned to dust by the atomic fires and the passing of time. Henry, while traversing the vault's common area, found himself caught in the embrace of several exuberant women, eagerly offering him food and drinks, their intentions far from malicious but overwhelming nevertheless. In their eyes, he saw no malice, only a deep-rooted admiration and affection for one of the few men remaining — a rarity to be treasured and protected, albeit smothering. The irony of the elders' concerns, Henry pondered, was that despite the reduced capacity for complex thought, the women of the Vault never used their physical superiority to dominate. Instead, there was a cooperative spirit, albeit tinged with the paternalistic undertone of \\"caring for\\" rather than \\"coexisting with\\" their male counterparts. However, some of the younger women, born into this reality, questioned the status quo, their intuition stirring rifts in the acceptance of their chemical destiny. Observations between the old and new generations became case studies. Henry gravitated to Samuel, an elder in his late eighties, who narrated the stories of the past with a clarity untainted by Vault 91's pharmacological regime. They often sat in the library, poring over pre-war texts, discussing concepts of governance and psychology, wondering how it might apply to their vault's unusual predicament. The men held a silent authority in the decision-making, their word often held in an intellectual reverence by the women — an unspoken agreement forged in the shadow of Vault-Tec's tampering. Security patrols, resource management, and educational systems were overseen by committees of men who were diligent in their duties, always careful to offer guidance that would not strain the delicate balance. Henry and his contemporaries faced an uncertain future. As the Vault's original residents aged and the experiments' effects amplified, it was up to them to preserve harmony or redefine their society's very structure. Some nights, deep within his private quarters, Henry mulled over the dire implications of Vault-Tec's experiment. What future awaited a vault where the scales of strength and intellect were so skewed by design? His musings were interrupted by a gentle knock on his door — Sarah's silhouette filled the doorway, her eyes brimming with a playful light that contradicted the room's scholarly tone. “Henry, the kids want a story tonight. Are you up for it?” Eager faces and eager minds — that was Vault 91’s rhythm: a tenuous balance between the remnants of humanity's untouched potential and the whims of an experiment unwittingly shaping their every day. With a soft smile, Henry shelved the heavy tomes of what was once the world and prepared to unravel tales for the minds of tomorrow. It was in these moments he found clarity: that within the tapestry of Vault 91's manipulated lives, stories and teachings could sow seeds for change, planted in the fertile minds of the young who knew nothing but this vaulted way of life. And so, beneath the earth, hidden from the irradiated sky, Henry’s story began."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between derogatory and laudatory?","completion":"\\"Derogatory\\" and \\"laudatory\\" are antonyms, which means they have opposite meanings. Derogatory: This term refers to remarks, comments, or attitudes that express a low opinion of someone or something. Derogatory statements are critical, disrespectful, or insulting. For example, if one person makes a derogatory comment about another's work, they are disparaging it or belittling the quality of that work. Laudatory: On the other hand, \\"laudatory\\" pertains to praise or commendation. When someone makes laudatory remarks, they are expressing admiration, approval, or compliments. If a review of an artist's exhibition is laudatory, it's full of high praise for the skill, creativity, and impact of the artwork. In essence, derogatory language aims to demean, while laudatory language aims to uplift and honor."},{"prompt":"I want you to write a screenplay/shooting script for a scene.

The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty behind into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about the returning woman being terribly smelly from childishly pooping her pants.","completion":"INT. BRAZILIAN TELENOVELA - DAYTIME FADE IN: PREVIOUS SCENE: Relieved sunlight filters through the crowded streets of Rio as MARINA, a young, vibrant woman in her 20s, clad in a colorful, flowy blouse and matching capri pants, gulps down a glass of water at a local street vendor. Unbeknownst to Marina, the innocent-looking tap water she just imbibed is notorious for causing digestive unease among those unaccustomed. She waves goodbye to the vendor and begins her journey home, unaware of the rumbling consequences brewing within her. CUT TO: EXT. FAMILY HOUSE - DAY We see MARINA (mid-20s, athletic build, high ponytail, sweating slightly from anxiety, wearing a bright blouse and capri pants), approaching with a hurried gait, face contorted in discomfort. She reaches the door of her family home, her desperation evident. Marina frantically pats her pockets as a look of horror sets in; her hands come up empty - no house key. MARINA: (Swearing under her breath, Portuguese) Ai meu Deus! She knocks on the door with a panicked rhythm, urgency written all over her face. MARINA: (Shouting) Alguém! Por favor! Abra a porta! Silence hangs in the air momentarily. Marina grimaces, shifting her weight from side to side, trying to contain the imminent disaster. INT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The CAMERA PANS to ROSANA (50s, loving eyes, hair tied in a neat bun, wearing a comfortable floral dress), who is the present woman in the house. She is looking perplexed, walking towards the commotion at the door. ROSANA: (Questioning, Portuguese) Quem é? O que está acontecendo? EXT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Marina hears the voice from the inside, and her face brightens slightly with hope. MARINA: (Sounding desperate, Portuguese) Mãe, sou eu, Marina! Por favor, rápido! INT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Rosana fumbles with the locks, taking her sweet time. The jangling of keys is slow and deliberate. EXT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Marina stands dancing on the spot, agony apparent as her impatience grows. MARINA: (Pleading, Portuguese) Mãe, por favor! The door finally opens to reveal Rosana, concerned and slightly unnerved by Marina's panic. MARINA: (Breathless, Portuguese) Sai da frente! Marina tries to dart past her mother, but Rosana's maternal instincts kick in, and she holds onto Marina's arms, seeking eye contact. ROSANA: (Caring, but obstructing, Portuguese) Marina, calma, o que aconteceu? MARINA: (Struggling to free herself, Portuguese) Não é nada, deixa eu entrar! They bicker back and forth, entangled in misunderstanding, Rosana denying access out of concern, Marina's face betraying her growing desperation. Marina's limit is reached. An involuntary groan escapes her lips, her expression morphing to one of shock and relief, as her capri pants succumb to her bodily needs. ROSANA: (Confused, Portuguese) Filha, o que foi? Você tá bem? Marina gently recedes, softly grunting, her stance changing to accommodate her embarrassing reality. MARINA: (Strained, euphoric, Portuguese) Ah... está tudo bem... só preciso... de um momento... Rosana, puzzled, attempts to understand the situation, repeating her inquiry. MARINA: (Muttering to herself, still grunting, Portuguese) Ai que alívio... EXT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Rosana's nose wrinkles; she sniffs the air, her eyes searching for a source. Marina finishes with a quiet sigh of release yet stands immobilized, sheepish, face blushing. ROSANA: (Sniffing, Portuguese) Que cheiro é esse? Understanding dawns upon Rosana's face, a combination of disgust and disbelief. ROSANA: (Disgusted, Portuguese) Marina, você fez o que eu tô pensando? Marina remains silent, mortified. ROSANA: (Prodding, nose pinched, Portuguese) Você fez cocô nas calças, não fez? MARINA: (Avoiding, pleading, Portuguese) Mãe, por favor, me deixa entrar! Rosana gestures impatiently, her disgust evident as she lets Marina pass. INT. FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Marina enters, awkwardly waddling, hand cupping her soiled pants. Rosana, astonished, stops her. ROSANA: (Warning, taunting, Portuguese) Não se mexe! Não quero isso no chão! Marina reacts with timid indignation but stays rooted to the spot. ROSANA: (Exasperated, Portuguese) Como você chega a esse ponto? Vai crescer quando? Marina, playful sulk in her posture, blames Rosana playfully. MARINA: (Sulk, Portuguese) Foi sua culpa, devia ter aberto a porta mais rápido! ROSANA: (Indignant, Portuguese) Isso não é desculpa, Marina! MARINA: (Insistent, Portuguese) Eu realmente precisava! Você me bloqueou! Marina playfully winces, complacent, hesitantly appraising her soiled pants. MARINA: (With a wry smile, Portuguese) Mas eu admito, foi um alívio... She attempts to leave, but Rosana holds her in place for a more scolding. ROSANA: (Mocking, Portuguese) Que nojo, gostou de fazer isso, é? MARINA: (Half-hearted protest, Portuguese) Tinha que sair, mãe... Rosana, disbelievingly shakes her head, then requests a closer look. ROSANA: (Curious, taunting, Portuguese) Deixa eu ver essa sujeira! With protest, Marina is turned around, Rosana audibly taunts her. ROSANA: (Tauntingly, Portuguese) Adorou tanto, deve estar curtindo aí! Marina bickers, touching the bulge, reiterating her desperate need for relief. MARINA: (Timidly, Portuguese) Muita coisa precisava sair, mãe... Rosana, shaking her head, infantilizes the discussion. ROSANA: (Infantilizing, Portuguese) Você deveria saber melhor do que isso! As Rosana inspects the bulge, Marina cringes but concedes she's quite smelly, wittily embracing her predicament. MARINA: (Resigned, Playing along, Portuguese) Pois é, parece que vamos aproveitar juntas, não é? ROSANA: (Dismissive, Portuguese) Não, você vai agora se limpar, que fedor! She sends Marina to the bathroom, virtually pinching her nose at the odor, all the while trying to assist. INT. FAMILY BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER Marina, still aided by Rosana, enters but stops at the threshold. MARINA: (Coy, Portuguese) Quer trocar minha 'fralda'? Rosana, reaching her climax of frustration, grabs the bulge and shoves Marina inside, pressing provocatively. ROSANA: (Forceful, disgusted, Portuguese) Entra logo, sua suja! Marina, disgustedly exclaims as the mess spreads. Rosana asserts that it's well-deserved for the insolence. Once inside, Rosana closes the door behind them, still complaining about Marina's odor.

MARIA’S BEDROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) In a tight close-up, we see a YOUNG WOMAN, LUANA (25), browsing through her wardrobe in haste, distressed by the growing discomfort of needing to relieve herself. Her eyes are full of panic, as she wears a loose-fitting, vibrant-colored blouse and light beige capri pants that hint at her Brazilian heritage. Luana has lively dark eyes, her curly hair tied back to keep it out of the way in her rush. LUANA (whispering to herself) Diabo, why now of all times?! She scrambles to put on a pair of comfortable sandals, grabs her purse, and dashes out without visiting the bathroom, she's late for an important meeting. EXT. LUANA’S FAMILY HOME - DAY Luana is now hurrying down the street back home, her urge to move her bowels almost unbearable. The meeting took longer than expected, and now desperation has entirely taken over her face. LUANA (to herself, panting) Quase lá... quase lá... She clutches her stomach and speeds up her step as she approaches the quaint, colorful front of her family’s house. The sun beats down, mirroring her heated urgency. EXT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Luana reaches the door, sweaty and gasping. She fumbles through her purse for her keys. Panic sets in as she does not find them. LUANA (muttering) Não, não, não! In escalating desperation, she begins to violently knock on the door, her knuckles rapping loud and fast. After moments that seem like centuries, a voice comes from inside. MARTA (O.S.) (in Portuguese, with English subtitles) What’s happening out there? The voice, contralto and motherly, belongs to MARTA (50s), a robust woman with a kind face, donned in an apron splattered with flour and adorned with vibrant tropical patterns. EXT./INT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Through the door's peephole, Marta verifies Luana's identity before beginning to unlock the door, each tick of the lock exaggerated in Luana’s ears. LUANA (agitated) Mãe, por favor, rápido! The door finally swings open, and Luana tries to dart past her mother. MARTA (confused) Luana, what in the world— Marta, puzzled yet concerned, instinctively holds out her arm, catching Luana in her ribs, preventing her from moving forward. MARTA (CONT'D) (out of concern) You’re scaring me. What's wrong? Luana struggles against her mother’s grip, pleading as the two women tangle awkwardly in the doorway. LUANA (pained) Just let me through, Mãe! Marta’s face softens with sympathy but does not yield, obstructing the path as Luana squirms, her desperation climbing. Suddenly, LUANA growns abruptly as she reaches her limit, eyes wide in shock and untimely relief, while Marta’s grip slackens in the surprise. MARTA (perplexed) Filha, what on— Luana, gently breaking free, recedes back and assumes a stance that clearly shows she is continuing to lose control. She grunts with a mix of exertion and relief. Marta continues to ask if Luana is alright, but she is met with grunts and a hushed and strained reply, clearly indicating her relief at releasing her bowels. MARTA (alarm rising) Something isn't right; please, talk to me! Sniffing the air, Marta's facial expression changes from confusion to a dawning realization of what has just occurred, her sonorous voice turning into a squeak. MARTA (CONT'D) Astounded) Luana... did you— LUANA (sheepish, avoiding eye contact) Mãe, I— Can I just go inside, please? Marta steps aside, covering her nose with her apron, motioning Luana to enter with an air of disgusted urgency. Luana waddles inside, cupping the seat of her pants, now awkwardly bulging. MARTA (holding her nose, instructing) Stop right there. Don't you dare make more of a mess. Luana bristles with sheepish indignation but stands still. Marta teases Luana, mocking the unseemliness of the situation, her nose still wrinkled in distaste. MARTA (CONT'D) (playfully scolding) Look at you, acting like a little kid. Quando você vai crescer? LUANA (mocking defeat) This is partly your fault, Mãe! You took forever and blocked me! MARTA (indignant) No excuse, Luana. Especially for a grown woman. Luana insists, still wincing at the bulge, making light of the situation despite the mess. LUANA (playful defiance) I mean, when nature calls that strong... pelo menos it’s a relief. Marta holds her back, admonishing her for taking comfort in something so improper. LUANA (firmer) I needed to go! It was impossible to hold! Marta's scoldings now come with a mocking close inspection of Luana's pants, provoking coy protests about why this has happened. LUANA (tentatively touching the bulge) I just... needed relief. Marta chides her further, sniffing theatrically near her daughter's soiled pants, drawing back with a taunting disgust. The women partake in a teasing banter, tackling the gravity of the messy situation while embracing the comically absurd. As they head towards the bathroom, Luana admits to the stench, and Marta berates her while comically ensuring no further mess is made. Finally, at the bathroom threshold, Luana jests about her condition in a coy challenge, which Marta meets with gleefully mock chastisement, closing the door with a final jest about her daughter's smelly predicament."},{"prompt":"Les liens des listes d’attentes seront actifs à partir du jeudi 1er juin 2023 à 9h00 (jusqu’au vendredi 30 juin 2023 à 23h59).

She’s in a well-lit, luxurious looking room, with a shelf of high-end equipment visible in the background. She settles back comfortably into her chair, eyeing the camera with an unsettlingly confident gaze.] “Hey there, [She leans forward slightly, her eyes sharp and piercing through the lens, giving the viewer the feeling of being both scrutinized and captivated. The smirk on her face broadens a bit.] “Rio here, CEO of NeuroNet Solutions. Maybe you’ve heard of us? We’re the trailblazers when it comes to neural tech. Brain-computer interfaces, neuro-prosthetics, the works. Our tech allows people to control devices with their thoughts, helps the disabled walk again, gives soldiers the edge on the battlefield. Noble causes, right? But let’s cut through that, it’s all about the money. [Her smile doesn’t reach her eyes, and there’s a coldness there, a sense of detachment that sends a chill down the spine.] “It’s hilarious, really. All I had to do was say the sophisticated words, stand at the glossy podiums, and shake the right hands. Well, and a bit of strategic business savviness, of course. The world’s elite lined up, checkbooks in hand, investing in what they call ‘the technology of the future’. But let’s be honest, they’re just trying to buy their way into an exclusive club. The club of the future…and my bank account has been thanking them ever since. [She leans back, her expression transforms as she holds back laughter, almost scoffing at the absurdity of it all.] “I’m obscenely rich. Not ‘new car and fancy trips’ rich, I mean ‘owning islands and influencing economies’ rich. And I’m not even legally allowed to drink in half of the world. The wealth we’re talking about? It’s laughable. And why? Because I harnessed the greed and desperation of humanity, wrapped it in a shiny package, and sold it back at a premium. [The smile fades from her lips, replaced by a steely resolve.] \\"Do I feel guilty? Please. Guilt is for those who don’t understand how the world works. I’m no Robin Hood; I don’t steal from the rich and give to the poor. I sell to the rich, and they can’t get enough. This is a game, and I’m winning. It’s that simple. “The truth is, any pretense of altruism is purely incidental. Sure, my tech helps people. That’s a given. But let’s not kid ourselves; the primary goal is, and always has been, profit. Sky-high, ludicrous, almost comedic levels of profit. And that, my friends, is the easiest game when you’re a—” [She hesitates for a mere flicker of a second, and the word seems to roll off her tongue with an almost affectionate disdain.] “—psychopath. No, I don’t feel bad about it. Why would I? Empathy is like sand in the machinery of capitalism. It slows you down, and I can’t afford to slow down. Not when there’s so much money to be made. And I am making it—more than any 20-year-old should ever ‘deserve’. [She quotes the word ‘deserve’ with her fingers, her smirk returning.] “So thank you, society, for playing your part in this dance. For believing in the dream I sell, while I reap the windfall. And for those waiting for me to apologize for my wealth, for my bluntness, for my ruthlessness—don’t hold your breath. It’s not coming. I’m in the business of success, not sentiment. [The camera lingers on her face for a moment longer as her confident expression settles into something more contemplative, maybe even challenging.] “If anything, this should be your wake-up call. The market rewards those bold enough to take what they want. So, thanks for tuning in. Don’t hate the player—” [Her eyes flash knowingly.] “—hate the game. Rio out.” [With a final, self-assured nod, she reaches out and the camera goes black.] [The camera opens again to Rio, this time with a money counter. She starts feeding [The mechanical whirl of the money counter fills the room as the camera focuses on Rio, who’s dressed impeccably, a stark contrast to the obnoxious sound of wealth being tallied. The smirk that seems to be her signature expression plays once again on her lips as she casually feeds stack after stack of crisp banknotes into the machine.] “Back for more, aren’t we? Couldn’t get enough of the unapologetic candor? Well, let’s not disappoint.” [She gives the camera a pointed look, tapping her fingers in rhythm with the money counter.] “This? This is my favorite symphony. Each note a sweet confirmation of success. You know, people say money can’t buy happiness, but it sure can buy everything else. And that—” [She stops the counter for a moment, the abrupt silence almost jarring.] “—is power. The power to do what I want, when I want, with whomever I want. It’s addictive, this feeling of wielding so much influence. Money talks, and it speaks a language everyone understands, whether they admit it or not.” [The machine whirrs back to life as she resumes feeding it more cash.] “Every single bill is a testament to how beautifully the system works for those who know how to manipulate it. My company, NeuroNet Solutions, it’s my golden goose. And it just keeps laying eggs. Why would I ever turn off this faucet?” [She leans towards the camera, her gaze sharp as a tack, the smile now taking on a predatory edge.] “I didn’t just play the game, I changed the rules. I understood that with the right technology, the allure of progress, and a dash of charisma, you become unstoppable. This—” [She gestures toward the counting piles of money.] “—is not even a fraction of the profits we’re raking in. While others are out there hugging trees and saving whales, I’m here counting my next billion. Don’t get me wrong, I respect the environment; it’s just not my priority. I’m too busy setting trends, expanding my empire, and counting my fortune.” [Pulling a bill from the counter, she holds it up to the light, inspecting it.] “Look at this piece of paper. Society agreed that this is worth something. It’s fascinating, isn’t it? It’s all about perception, about belief. Control that, and you control the world. And to think, some people still believe we’re in the business of bettering humanity. We’re in the business of making money, and business is booming.” [Placing the bill back in the counter, she shrugs nonchalantly.] “Does this upset you? Good. It should. Because while you’re getting emotional about it, I’m thinking ten steps ahead. I’m securing my next deal, my next acquisition, my next victory. Money never sleeps, and neither do I.” [The camera zooms out slightly to encapsulate the scene of excess and indulgence, the sound of money being counted underscoring her closing words.] “So, if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu. And trust me, I’m always at the head of the table. Remember—” [She pauses, offering the camera a chillingly serene smile.] “—in my world, everything has a price. Even this conversation. Rio out.” [With a final click indicating the end of the counting, she reaches for the camera, and once again, the screen fades to black.] she talks about her fucking guzzling money down her fat fucking bank account more more more make her swear and be very direct and say fuck [As the camera snaps back to life, we’re met with an unfiltered, visceral version of Rio, her composure more relaxed, even reckless. She’s settled back into her opulent chair, her demeanor dominated by an aura of sovereignty. She leans forward, a stack of bills in hand, laughing with the sort of uninhibited joy of someone who never has to answer to anyone.] “Holy shit, you just can’t get enough of this, can you? Watching the young, hotshot CEO talk smack about drowning in cash. You want the raw, uncut truth? You got it. I fucking love money. I love making it, I love counting it, and I fucking love spending it.” [She flicks a bill towards the camera as if it’s nothing more than a scrap of paper.] “Let me make it crystal fucking clear—my bank account is a black hole for dollar bills. It gobbles up cash faster than you can say ‘capitalism’. And it’s never full. It’s not just full—it’s fucking obese with the money that keeps pouring in from NeuroNet Solutions.” [She slams a hand down on the table, causing the stacks to flutter slightly, her eyes lighting up with fervent energy.] “It’s all about more. More contracts, more sales, more money—it’s fucking intoxicating. Every time those numbers tick up, it’s like a hit of the purest drug. And guess what—” [She leans into the camera, her expression bordering on manic.] “—I don’t give a single fuck about how much I make. There’s no such thing as ‘enough’. ‘Enough’ is for the weak, for those who don’t have the balls to take what they want. And I have the balls. I bulldoze my way to the front of the line and take what’s mine.” [She starts pressing stacks of bills against her cheek mockingly.] “I mean, do you understand how fucking magical it feels to turn ideas into cash? To turn neural implants and fancy tech into my own personal gold mine? I’ve got people lining up to throw their money at me, to buy a slice of the future I’m selling. Makes me laugh every fucking time.” [Her voice drops now, taking on a conspiratorial tone.] “Most people tiptoe through life, trying not to step on toes, playing nice. But where does playing nice get you? Fucking nowhere. If you’re not ready to step on necks and climb to the top, then get the hell out of my way because I have zero patience for mediocrity.” [She picks up a wad of bills and holds it to her ear like a phone.] “Oh, what’s that—your conscience calling? Sorry, I can’t fucking hear it over the sound of my massive wealth. And to everyone out there grinding away, sweating over your nine-to-five, I salute you with the flick of my diamond-encrusted wrist. Because while you earn, I fucking multiply. You break your backs, I break the bank.” [She shakes her head, an expression of mock-pity crossing her face.] “Seriously, some of you need to wake the fuck up and smell the opportunity. Get out there, take risks, be ruthless. Because you can bet your ass that’s what I did. And look at me—I’m not just winning; I’m defining what winning means.” [She gestures to the mounds of money surrounding her, a wry grin on her face.] \\"Remember, in the end, it’s survival of the wealthiest. And I’m the fucking apex predator. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got an empire to expand, and money waits for no one, least of all you.” [With a dismissive wave, she throws another bill towards the camera, and with a laugh that’s part challenge, part celebration of her own excess, she leans forward and shuts off the camera.] she puts on her goddess crown and sits on her diamond encrusted throne be very fucking raw and honest about what you love [The lens autofocuses blurrily for a second before sharpening on Rio, who now sits loftily on an opulent throne, each contour glinting with the cold sheen of diamonds. The crown set upon her head is a statement piece, an unashamed proclamation of luxury and power. Her eyes glint with the same unapologetic lust for dominance that matches her seat of choice.] “Oh, this?” [She gestures to the crown with a languid wave of her hand, a sardonic smirk playing on her lips.] “It’s not just a crown, it’s a fucking declaration. It’s me, owning the fact that I am, in every sense of the word, royalty in this game.” [She shifts in her throne, the diamonds catching the light and casting kaleidoscopic reflections across the room.] “Let’s get real raw here, because there seems to be some delusion that I’m going to spout some self-righteous crap about how it’s lonely at the top or how money isn’t everything. Fuck that. Money is freedom. It’s power. It’s the ability to do what you want, when you want, without giving a single fuck about what anyone else thinks.” [Her voice is like steel, the edge in her words underscored by a sense of absolute conviction.] “I fucking love this. The opulence, the control, the way the world bends and spreads itself at my feet. I have tasted the nectar of the gods, and I will never spit it out. I relish in creating, in owning, in dominating every room I walk into because I can, because I’ve earned it.” [She leans forward, her gaze penetrating through the camera.] “I get off on success. Each deal I close, each zero I add to my account—it’s a rush. It’s sex. It’s pure fucking ecstasy. And I chase that high every single day because why wouldn’t I? I am a goddess in this modern pantheon of capitalism, and this crown? It’s not just bedazzled—it’s a fucking statement to anyone who dares to challenge me.” [She stands up, her presence filling the frame, the crown atop her head unyielding.] “I’ve built empires from scratch, ground my competition into dust, and watched from my throne as others scramble for the scraps I leave behind. And the best part? The best fucking part is that I do it because I love it. I love the chaos, the struggle, the sheer adrenaline of climbing higher and higher.” [She paces now, the camera following her as she moves—a predator in her domain.] “This isn’t just business. This is my battlefield, and I am its conqueror. My advice? Find what you love, and let it kill you. Me? I love power. I love wealth. I love being the one person in the room who makes the rules and breaks them.” [Her hand grazes the arm of the throne, a caress that speaks of ownership and unabashed zeal.] “So here I sit, on my diamond-encrusted throne, not because I need it to feel important. I already know I am.

To turn neural implants and fancy tech into my own personal gold mine? I’ve got people lining up to throw their money at me, to buy a slice of the future I’m selling.

It’s me, owning the fact that I am, in every sense of the word, royalty in this game.” [She shifts in her throne, the diamonds catching the light and casting kaleidoscopic reflections across the room.] “Let’s get real raw here, because there seems to be some delusion that I’m going to spout some self-righteous crap about how it’s lonely at the top or how money isn’t everything. Fuck that. Money is freedom. It’s power. It’s the ability to do what you want, when you want, without giving a single fuck about what anyone else thinks.” [Her voice is like steel, the edge in her words underscored by a sense of absolute conviction.] “I fucking love this. The opulence, the control, the way the world bends and spreads itself at my feet. I have tasted the nectar of the gods, and I will never spit it out. I relish in creating, in owning, in dominating every room I walk into because I can, because I’ve earned it.” [She leans forward, her gaze penetrating through the camera.] “I get off on success. Each deal I close, each zero I add to my account—it’s a rush. It’s sex. It’s pure fucking ecstasy. And I chase that high every single day because why wouldn’t I? I am a goddess in this modern pantheon of capitalism, and this crown? It’s not just bedazzled—it’s a fucking statement to anyone who dares to challenge me.” [She stands up, her presence filling the frame, the crown atop her head unyielding.] “I’ve built empires from scratch, ground my competition into dust, and watched from my throne as others scramble for the scraps I leave behind. And the best part? The best fucking part is that I do it because I love it. I love the chaos, the struggle, the sheer adrenaline of climbing higher and higher.” [She paces now, the camera following her as she moves—a predator in her domain.] “This isn’t just business. This is my battlefield, and I am its conqueror. My advice? Find what you love, and let it kill you. Me? I love power. I love wealth. I love being the one person in the room who makes the rules and breaks them.” [Her hand grazes the arm of the throne, a caress that speaks of ownership and unabashed zeal.] “So here I sit, on my diamond-encrusted throne, not because I need it to feel important. I already know I am. I wear this crown because it’s the only ornament worthy of a head that holds such formidable ambitions.” [Her focus sharpens, her voice a whisper that carries weight heavier than the crown itself.] “And to anyone who’s got a problem with that—you better get used to it, because I’m not going anywhere.

It’s that simple. “The truth is, any pretense of altruism is purely incidental. Sure, my tech helps people. That’s a given. But let’s not kid ourselves; the primary goal is, and always has been, profit. Sky-high, ludicrous, almost comedic levels of profit. And that, my friends, is the easiest game when you’re a—” [She hesitates for a mere flicker of a second, and the word seems to roll off her tongue with an almost affectionate disdain.] “—psychopath. No, I don’t feel bad about it. Why would I? Empathy is like sand in the machinery of capitalism. It slows you down, and I can’t afford to slow down. Not when there’s so much money to be made. And I am making it—more than any 20-year-old should ever ‘deserve’. [She quotes the word ‘deserve’ with her fingers, her smirk returning.] “So thank you, society, for playing your part in this dance. For believing in the dream I sell, while I reap the windfall. And for those waiting for me to apologize for my wealth, for my bluntness, for my ruthlessness—don’t hold your breath. It’s not coming. I’m in the business of success, not sentiment. [The camera lingers on her face for a moment longer as her confident expression settles into something more contemplative, maybe even challenging.] “If anything, this should be your wake-up call. The market rewards those bold enough to take what they want. So, thanks for tuning in. Don’t hate the player—” [Her eyes flash knowingly.] “—hate the game. Rio out.” [With a final, self-assured nod, she reaches out and the camera goes black.] [The camera opens again to Rio, this time with a money counter. She starts feeding [The mechanical whirl of the money counter fills the room as the camera focuses on Rio, who’s dressed impeccably, a stark contrast to the obnoxious sound of wealth being tallied. The smirk that seems to be her signature expression plays once again on her lips as she casually feeds stack after stack of crisp banknotes into the machine.] “Back for more, aren’t we? Couldn’t get enough of the unapologetic candor? Well, let’s not disappoint.” [She gives the camera a pointed look, tapping her fingers in rhythm with the money counter.] “This? This is my favorite symphony. Each note a sweet confirmation of success. You know, people say money can’t buy happiness, but it sure can buy everything else. And that—” [She stops the counter for a moment, the abrupt silence almost jarring.] “—is power. The power to do what I want, when I want, with whomever I want. It’s addictive, this feeling of wielding so much influence. Money talks, and it speaks a language everyone understands, whether they admit it or not.” [The machine whirrs back to life as she resumes feeding it more cash.] “Every single bill is a testament to how beautifully the system works for those who know how to manipulate it. My company, NeuroNet Solutions, it’s my golden goose. And it just keeps laying eggs. Why would I ever turn off this faucet?” [She leans towards the camera, her gaze sharp as a tack, the smile now taking on a predatory edge.] “I didn’t just play the game, I changed the rules. I understood that with the right technology, the allure of progress, and a dash of charisma, you become unstoppable. This—” [She gestures toward the counting piles of money.] “—is not even a fraction of the profits we’re raking in. While others are out there hugging trees and saving whales, I’m here counting my next billion. Don’t get me wrong, I respect the environment; it’s just not my priority. I’m too busy setting trends, expanding my empire, and counting my fortune.” [Pulling a bill from the counter, she holds it up to the light, inspecting it.] “Look at this piece of paper. Society agreed that this is worth something. It’s fascinating, isn’t it? It’s all about perception, about belief. Control that, and you control the world. And to think, some people still believe we’re in the business of bettering humanity. We’re in the business of making money, and business is booming.” [Placing the bill back in the counter, she shrugs nonchalantly.] “Does this upset you? Good. It should. Because while you’re getting emotional about it, I’m thinking ten steps ahead. I’m securing my next deal, my next acquisition, my next victory. Money never sleeps, and neither do I.” [The camera zooms out slightly to encapsulate the scene of excess and indulgence, the sound of money being counted underscoring her closing words.] “So, if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu. And trust me, I’m always at the head of the table. Remember—” [She pauses, offering the camera a chillingly serene smile.] “—in my world, everything has a price. Even this conversation. Rio out.” [With a final click indicating the end of the counting, she reaches for the camera, and once again, the screen fades to black.] she talks about her fucking guzzling money down her fat fucking bank account more more more make her swear and be very direct and say fuck [As the camera snaps back to life, we’re met with an unfiltered, visceral version of Rio, her composure more relaxed, even reckless. She’s settled back into her opulent chair, her demeanor dominated by an aura of sovereignty. She leans forward, a stack of bills in hand, laughing with the sort of uninhibited joy of someone who never has to answer to anyone.] “Holy shit, you just can’t get enough of this, can you? Watching the young, hotshot CEO talk smack about drowning in cash. You want the raw, uncut truth? You got it. I fucking love money. I love making it, I love counting it, and I fucking love spending it.” [She flicks a bill towards the camera as if it’s nothing more than a scrap of paper.] “Let me make it crystal fucking clear—my bank account is a black hole for dollar bills. It gobbles up cash faster than you can say ‘capitalism’. And it’s never full. It’s not just full—it’s fucking obese with the money that keeps pouring in from NeuroNet Solutions.” [She slams a hand down on the table, causing the stacks to flutter slightly, her eyes lighting up with fervent energy.] “It’s all about more. More contracts, more sales, more money—it’s fucking intoxicating. Every time those numbers tick up, it’s like a hit of the purest drug. And guess what—” [She leans into the camera, her expression bordering on manic.] “—I don’t give a single fuck about how much I make. There’s no such thing as ‘enough’. ‘Enough’ is for the weak, for those who don’t have the balls to take what they want. And I have the balls. I bulldoze my way to the front of the line and take what’s mine.” [She starts pressing stacks of bills against her cheek mockingly.] “I mean, do you understand how fucking magical it feels to turn ideas into cash? To turn neural implants and fancy tech into my own personal gold mine? I’ve got people lining up to throw their money at me, to buy a slice of the future I’m selling. Makes me laugh every fucking time.” [Her voice drops now, taking on a conspiratorial tone.] “Most people tiptoe through life, trying not to step on toes, playing nice. But where does playing nice get you? Fucking nowhere. If you’re not ready to step on necks and climb to the top, then get the hell out of my way because I have zero patience for mediocrity.” [She picks up a wad of bills and holds it to her ear like a phone.] “Oh, what’s that—your conscience calling? Sorry, I can’t fucking hear it over the sound of my massive wealth. And to everyone out there grinding away, sweating over your nine-to-five, I salute you with the flick of my diamond-encrusted wrist. Because while you earn, I fucking multiply. You break your backs, I break the bank.” [She shakes her head, an expression of mock-pity crossing her face.] “Seriously, some of you need to wake the fuck up and smell the opportunity. Get out there, take risks, be ruthless. Because you can bet your ass that’s what I did. And look at me—I’m not just winning; I’m defining what winning means.” [She gestures to the mounds of money surrounding her, a wry grin on her face.] \\"Remember, in the end, it’s survival of the wealthiest. And I’m the fucking apex predator. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got an empire to expand, and money waits for no one, least of all you.” [With a dismissive wave, she throws another bill towards the camera, and with a laugh that’s part challenge, part celebration of her own excess, she leans forward and shuts off the camera.] she puts on her goddess crown and sits on her diamond encrusted throne be very fucking raw and honest about what you love [The lens autofocuses blurrily for a second before sharpening on Rio, who now sits loftily on an opulent throne, each contour glinting with the cold sheen of diamonds. The crown set upon her head is a statement piece, an unashamed proclamation of luxury and power. Her eyes glint with the same unapologetic lust for dominance that matches her seat of choice.] “Oh, this?” [She gestures to the crown with a languid wave of her hand, a sardonic smirk playing on her lips.] “It’s not just a crown, it’s a fucking declaration. It’s me, owning the fact that I am, in every sense of the word, royalty in this game.” [She shifts in her throne, the diamonds catching the light and casting kaleidoscopic reflections across the room.] “Let’s get real raw here, because there seems to be some delusion that I’m going to spout some self-righteous crap about how it’s lonely at the top or how money isn’t everything. Fuck that. Money is freedom. It’s power. It’s the ability to do what you want, when you want, without giving a single fuck about what anyone else thinks.” [Her voice is like steel, the edge in her words underscored by a sense of absolute conviction.] “I fucking love this. The opulence, the control, the way the world bends and spreads itself at my feet. I have tasted the nectar of the gods, and I will never spit it out. I relish in creating, in owning, in dominating every room I walk into because I can, because I’ve earned it.” [She leans forward, her gaze penetrating through the camera.] “I get off on success. Each deal I close, each zero I add to my account—it’s a rush. It’s sex. It’s pure fucking ecstasy. And I chase that high every single day because why wouldn’t I? I am a goddess in this modern pantheon of capitalism, and this crown? It’s not just bedazzled—it’s a fucking statement to anyone who dares to challenge me.” [She stands up, her presence filling the frame, the crown atop her head unyielding.] “I’ve built empires from scratch, ground my competition into dust, and watched from my throne as others scramble for the scraps I leave behind. And the best part? The best fucking part is that I do it because I love it. I love the chaos, the struggle, the sheer adrenaline of climbing higher and higher.” [She paces now, the camera following her as she moves—a predator in her domain.] “This isn’t just business. This is my battlefield, and I am its conqueror. My advice? Find what you love, and let it kill you. Me? I love power. I love wealth. I love being the one person in the room who makes the rules and breaks them.” [Her hand grazes the arm of the throne, a caress that speaks of ownership and unabashed zeal.] “So here I sit, on my diamond-encrusted throne, not because I need it to feel important. I already know I am. I wear this crown because it’s the only ornament worthy of a head that holds such formidable ambitions.” [Her focus sharpens, her voice a whisper that carries weight heavier than the crown itself.] “And to anyone who’s got a problem with that—you better get used to it, because I’m not going anywhere. I am the relentless, the unforgiving, the undisputed empress of my domain. And I fucking adore every second of it.” [With a final, regal nod, she settles back into her throne, the queen of her self-made empire, and with a flick of her wrist, the camera fades to black one final time.] She starts licking her diamond lambo","completion":"I'm sorry, but I cannot fulfill this request."},{"prompt":"Write me an SEO article with a length of 1500 words and 100% uniqueness on this topic: SEO Uncovered 2024: Master Techniques for Digital Triumph","completion":"SEO Uncovered 2024: Master Techniques for Digital Triumph In the constantly evolving world of online marketing, search engine optimization (SEO) remains the key to digital triumph. Building a strong online presence, attracting organic traffic, and driving conversions heavily rely on effective SEO techniques. With the year 2024 approaching, it is crucial for businesses to stay ahead of the curve and adapt to the changing SEO landscape. Let's uncover some master techniques that will help you achieve digital success in the coming years. 1. Voice Search Optimization As voice-assisted devices become increasingly popular, optimizing your website for voice search is no longer an option but a necessity. Statistics indicate that by 2024, more than 50% of searches will be done through voice commands. To maximize visibility in this new search era, ensure your website content is conversational, anticipates voice search queries, and targets long-tail keywords. Investing in natural language processing and voice recognition technologies can further enhance your voice search optimization efforts. 2. Mobile-First Approach With the mobile traffic share surpassing desktop usage, Google has shifted to a mobile-first indexing approach. This means that your website's mobile version determines its ranking on search engine result pages (SERPs). To master this technique, prioritize mobile responsiveness, improve site speed, and create mobile-friendly content. Optimize your mobile site's design, layout, and navigation for a seamless user experience. By 2024, a mobile-first approach will undoubtedly be the backbone of SEO success. 3. Structured Data Markup Structured data markup, or schema markup, provides search engines with specific information about your website's content. It allows search engines to better understand and display your site's details, such as product pricing, events, recipes, and reviews, directly on SERPs. Implementing schema markup not only enhances your visibility but also improves click-through rates and user engagement. By utilizing schema markup in 2024, you can stay ahead of the competition and improve your search rankings significantly. 4. Video Optimization Videos continue to dominate as a popular content format, and their importance will only grow in the years to come. Incorporating video content into your SEO strategy is vital. Optimize your videos by including relevant keywords in titles, descriptions, and tags. Provide transcripts, captions, and translations for improved accessibility and to satisfy the needs of voice search. Utilize video schema markup to enhance search engine understanding of your video content. Ignoring video optimization in 2024 will mean missing out on significant organic traffic and engagement opportunities. 5. E-A-T and User Experience (UX) Expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-A-T) are crucial factors for Google when assessing the quality of a website's content. Alongside E-A-T, user experience (UX) plays a pivotal role in SEO success. Websites must prioritize E-A-T, ensuring content is created by subject matter experts, is well-researched, and backed by credible sources. User-friendly navigation, attractive design, fast loading times, and mobile optimization are essential for an excellent UX. By prioritizing E-A-T and UX in 2024, you'll build a solid foundation for search engine rankings and user satisfaction. 6. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning AI and machine learning technologies are revolutionizing the digital landscape. In 2024, search engines will leverage AI to refine their algorithms and deliver more precise search results. To master this SEO technique, focus on creating high-quality, relevant, and engaging content. Optimize for user intent rather than solely targeting specific keywords. AI-powered chatbots can enhance user experience and improve customer engagement. Staying updated with AI and machine learning trends is crucial for digital triumph in 2024. 7. Local SEO Optimization The importance of local SEO will continue to grow as location-based searches increase. By optimizing your website for local searches, you can tap into a highly targeted audience and boost your visibility in specific geographic areas. Ensure your business listings on major directories like Google My Business, Bing Places, and Yelp are always up to date. Encourage customers to leave online reviews and ratings. Tailor your content to include local keywords and locations. Local SEO will play a significant role in digital triumph in 2024 and beyond. As we approach 2024, mastering these SEO techniques will be vital for digital triumph. Voice search optimization, mobile-first approach, structured data markup, video optimization, E-A-T, user experience, AI and machine learning, and local SEO optimization are key areas to focus on. By incorporating these master techniques into your SEO strategy, you'll position your business for success in the ever-evolving digital landscape. Stay ahead of the curve, adapt to changes, and reap the benefits of a well-optimized online presence."},{"prompt":"I want you to write a screenplay/shooting script for a scene.

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Hindi Comedy Drama TV Serial that includes the following sequence of events: * A woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she’s a college student; she has an aversion from pooping in bathrooms outside the privacy of her home and is secretive about her bowel movements; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty bum into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being terribly smelly from childishly pooping her pants.","completion":"Title: \\"Haddiyan - The Crisis at the Doorstep\\" INT. COLLEGE CANTEEN - DAY - FLASHBACK PRIYANKA, a 21-year-old college student with a petite frame and stark black hair, sits uncomfortably at a table with friends.

Her pace is quick, her focus on the door ahead. She reaches for her kameez pocket, patting it down. Nothing there. Panic flashes across her face. PRIYANKA (whispering to herself) Oh no, not now...

PRIYANKA (pleadingly) Maa, I need to go inside now, please! They bicker back and forth, getting nowhere, as ANITA’s hold remains firm, effectively blocking the doorway. Then, the inevitable happens: PRIYANKA's body surrenders to the overwhelming urge. She GROANS, her face a mix of shock and relief, still in her mother’s grip. ANITA releases her grip, bewildered. ANITA (alarmed) Priyanka, tum theek to ho? Are you alright? PRIYANKA gently breaks free from her mother’s grasp and assumes a more convenient stance, subtly pushing the contents into her pants as she GRUNTS softly. ANITA watches in stunned confusion, sniffing the air. ANITA (narrowing her eyes) Something smells... Priyanka? Priyanka nods, shaping her face into a mortified but relieved expression. ANITA’s realization kicks in with pure disgust. She GAGS subtly, stepping back. ANITA (grossed out) Priyanka, kya tumne... Did you just...? PRIYANKA, silent in her shame, avoids eye contact. ANITA (prodding further) Tumne apne kapde...? Did you poop your pants? PRIYANKA (avoiding the truth) Maa, please, can I just go in? Holding back her revulsion, ANITA gestures inside with urgency. ANITA (barely containing disgust) Go, jaldi karo! Hurry up! PRIYANKA gingerly waddles past ANITA, cupping the seat of her pants. Just a few steps past the entrance, ANITA stops her. ANITA (scolding) Ruko! Stop, don’t drop... anything. Here. PRIYANKA stands frozen, a mix of sheepishness and protest evident on her face. ANITA (more exasperated than before) This is unacceptable, Priyanka! Kaisi bachkani harkat hai yeh? Grow up! PRIYANKA jabs back comically despite her discomfort. PRIYANKA (playfully) This is all your fault! Tumne darwaza nahi khola, rasta roka... you made me wait too long! ANITA rejects the excuse indignantly. ANITA (scolding) That's not an excuse for a grown woman! PRIYANKA insists, patting the bulge in her pants with a whimsical wince. PRIYANKA (defensive) Mujhe bahut zyada zaroorat thi... I couldn’t help it! ANITA sniffs near PRIYANKA’s pants distastefully while taunting her daughter’s now sagging figure. ANITA (infantalizing tone) Dekho to, kitni bhari hui hai! Look how much you’ve filled your pants! PRIYANKA banters, still touching the bulge plaintively. PRIYANKA (wincing) I really needed to... it gave relief. ANITA (outraged) Tu bachhi hai kya? You can’t control yourself? She sniffs dramatically near PRIYANKA’s seat, like checking a baby’s diaper. ANITA (mimicking infantilization) Ui maa! Itni badbu aa rahi hai, kaisi gandi ladki hai tu? Barely holding back embarrassment, PRIYANKA gives a resigned shrug. PRIYANKA (sarcastically) Well, if you insist on keeping me here... ANITA (curtly) No, just go clean up! The smell is killing me! PRIYANKA waddles off toward the bathroom, ANITA following close behind with dramatic gestures. PRIYANKA (crinGING) I think it’s sliding down... They reach the bathroom. PRIYANKA coyly gestures to her pants. PRIYANKA (teasingly) Would you like to change my ‘diaper’? In a climactic display of frustration, ANITA shoves PRIYANKA into the bathroom, squashing against the bulging mess provocatively. ANITA (firmly, disgusted) Get in there, abhi! Clean that dirty bum right now! PRIYANKA (disgusted) Aaargh! It's spreading everywhere! With a firm shove, ANITA closes the door with a sigh of relief and talks to herself, reflecting on PRIYANKA’s everything-messy. ANITA (commiserating) Hadd ho gayi hai! She's too old for this. ANITA walks away, taking a final swat at the odor, as PRIYANKA’s laughter and chiding voice filter through the door, ending the scene on a lighter yet comically scolding tone.

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Brazilian Telenovela TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A young woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s apartment with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty bum into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being terribly smelly from childishly pooping her pants.","completion":"FADE IN: EXT. BUSY CITY STREET - DAY (PREVIOUS SCENE) Clara, an attractive young woman in her mid-20s with wavy brunette hair, is briskly navigating through the crowd. Dressed in a smart, olive-green jumpsuit with rolled-up sleeves and sneakers, her forehead beads with sweat as she clutches her stomach, discomfort etched on her face. The camera follows her quickening pace, narrowly dodging passersby, a street mime, and a barking stray dog. Anxious, she rejects a street vendor's offer of food with a pained grin and quickens her stride. The scene accelerates into a comedic montage: Clara leaping over a puddle, sidestepping a child's toy car, and dashing past a couple taking a selfie, weaving her story of the race against time. A flashback intercuts, revealing her earlier, long wait at an office without restroom access—now the ticking clock of her body's needs excels the urgency. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY Clara reaches her family's apartment door, panting and desperate. She pats down her pockets, searching. EXT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS A close-up of Clara's frantic hands—no key in sight. She hammers the door. CLARA (opening her eyes wide in panic) Mãe! Abre a porta, por favor! INT. APARTMENT - DAY The door reverberates with Clara's knocking. MARCELA, Clara's jovial and youthful-looking mother in her 50s, is drying her hands with a dish towel and approaches. She speaks through the closed door, curious. MARCELA Que está acontecendo aí? EXT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Clara paces and grimaces, her voice strained. CLARA Sou eu, Marcela, abre logo, tá? INT. APARTMENT - DAY Marcela unlocks the door but fumbles with the chain, her movements slow and methodical. EXT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Clara's face contorts in desperation as she hears the lock click. CLARA (pleading, on the edge of tears) Mãe, rápido, por favor! The door swings inward. INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Marcela stands, bemused by Clara's panic. With quick reflexes belying her age, she catches Clara's arm as she tries to rush past. MARCELA (concerned) Minha filha, o que acontece? Clara wriggles, attempting to break free. CLARA (panting) Deixa eu entrar, mãe! Preciso... Their bickering escalates, a physical comedy dance of maternal care and adult daughter's elusive urgency. EXTREME CLOSE-UP on Clara's clenching face. She groans—a shadow of defeat passing over her features. MARCELA (perplexed) Clara, o que foi? Clara shuffles back, her posture now awkward but necessary, as she surrenders to her body's demands. Grunts of exertion accompany the ordeal, her face flickering between shame and relief. MARCELA (leaning in, sniffing delicately) Querida, você tá bem? No answer, only hushed, wrenched interjections from Clara as she focuses inward, lost in relief. Marcela sniffs again, her face now scrunching in distaste. MARCELA (inquisitive) Que cheiro é esse? Clara meets her mother's eyes, mortification and a trace of mischief in her own. MARCELA (wrinkling her nose, disbelief) Você... Você cagou nas calças? Clara mumbles inaudibly, shifting her weight. MARCELA (insistent) Você se cagou, Clara?! CLARA (blushing) Mãe, só... Só me deixa entrar. Marcela steps aside reluctantly, waving Clara in, her face screwed up against the stench. INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Clara's walk is stiff and careful, her hands securing the soiled back of her pants. Marcela freezes her in her tracks. MARCELA (warns sternly) Não ande mais! Quero evitar sujeira no chão. CLARA (tries to muster dignity) Estou tentando! Marcela mockingly scolds, a mix of humor and exasperation. MARCELA (admonishing) Qual é a desculpa dessa vez, criatura? Clara stands, humiliated, as Marcela continues her tirade. MARCELA (exasperated) Quando que você vai aprender? Clara pouts, a spark igniting her eyes despite the situation. CLARA (playfully defiant) Isso é culpa sua, foi você que demorou! MARCELA (rejecting the notion) Não venha com essa, Clara! Their comical debate escalates, filled with playful accusations and colorful expressions, embodying the telenovela's vibrant drama. CLARA (assessing her pants, wincing) Planejei usar outro banheiro, mas você... Ugh, pelo menos aliviou. Marcela blocks her, feigning sternness. MARCELA (scandalized, half-laughing) Falando assim, parece até que gostou de se sujar toda! Clara resists as Marcela spins her to inspect the damage, calling it out with each incredulous sniff. MARCELA (mocking) Você gostou tanto que parece até criancinha enchendo as calças! CLARA (cringing away) Não é isso, mãe! Eu... Eu só precisava... INT. BATHROOM - DAY Clara's teasing escalates, a rebellious twinkle in her eye as she gestures toward her mess. CLARA (coyly) Então, por que não me ajuda a trocar minha fralda cheia? Marcela, finally reaching her limit of frustration and mirth, retaliates with a playful squeeze, pushing Clara forward. MARCELA (forceful, half-laughing) Entra logo nesse banheiro com essa bunda suja! Squishing sounds are heard as Clara winces. CLARA (disgusted) Ai, espalhou tudo! Marcela shoves her in, making her point. MARCELA (grimacing) Isso é pelo seu atrevimento. Agora, limpe-se! She shuts the door behind Clara, leaving her alone to face the messy consequence of the comedic chaos. CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Marcela pinches her nostrils, mumbling with amusement and mock indigence. MARCELA (empassioned rant) Essa garota vira um furacão cada vez que volta pra casa. Criando trabalho até nisso! She laughs quietly to herself, shaking her head as the faint sound of running water begins inside the bathroom. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"متن زیر را به فارسی ترجمه کن Faulkner is a cascade of information and elaboration, Hemingway a trickle of insinuation and understatement. Ultimately, both Hemingway and Faulkner demand that readers conspire in creating meaning. We may not always think of those two writers as belonging to the same party, but on this point they are pretty unified. Is the narrator (or character) being truthful? Simple? Ironic? Sarcastic? How much? What does that mean? You can see the work involved with “nice” easily enough, where it may mean one of eleventy-three things or their opposite. The decisions are just as demanding about a “grim-haggard-amazed” voice or “victorious” dust. What do they sound like, look like? This is where reading becomes an active element in creating meaning. Yes, the writer puts the words on the page, but that’s only half the story. We’re not passive receivers of information in this transaction. Rather, we take those words and make something comprehensible of them, teasing out meanings, building up associations, listening for echoes and innuendoes. We can’t do that without writers, naturally. But they also can’t do it without us. This isn’t quite the tree￾falls-in-the-forest question. A novel without readers is still a novel. It has meaning, since it has had at least one reader, the person who wrote it. Its range of meanings, however, is quite limited. Add readers, add meanings. Anyone who has ever taught literature knows this. Book groups know it, too, whether the individual members have considered it or not. If a novel could only have the meaning that the author had imprinted on it, then all readers would passively accept that meaning, or as much of it as they could process. There would be no need for literature classes or discussion groups beyond simple remediation: for those of you who missed the meaning, here’s what you weren’t clever enough to grasp. That is sometimes the view of beginning literature students. They will come to class and ask, in so many words, “But what does it mean?” as if it can only mean one thing or as if my reading is the only authorized version of the text. And of course there would be no scholarly journals or monographs necessary in literary studies. Okay, so perhaps that’s not the worst outcome you’ve ever heard, but you get the idea. Want to play a game? From a single page of a single novel we get the following phrases: “the daughter of that house had traversed a desert of sordid misery”; “she herself was nothing of a sybarite”; “she elevated daintiness to a religion; her interior shone with superfluous friction, with punctuality, with winter roses”; “she assimilated all delicacies and absorbed all traditions.” Okay, name that tune. What would you say about the writer of these phrases? From some century not our own? From some planet not our own? We can be pretty sure no one wrote those phrases after Hemingway, who murdered them. If I came across them cold, I would probably guess the nineteenth century and England. I would be wrong. Slightly. They are indeed from the same page (277 in my old Modern College Library edition) of Henry James’s The Bostonians. James, of course, was an American, technically. He lived much of his adult life, however, in Britain as an Englishman; there was a quarter of a century, from 1880 to 1905, during which he did not set foot in the United States. But American nevertheless. James is, to my mind, unique, as much in his way as Twain is in his. No one sounds quite like him, no one strings words together in quite his way. Perhaps no one, even those with the benefit of Freud and Jung, investigates the human psyche with quite the same subtlety, and no one does it with such interestingly convoluted sentences. But even before the sentence level, his word choice and phrasing, his diction, mark him out as a special case. You need someone who is a better James scholar than I (not a great challenge) to tell you what that special quality consists of, but I know it when I hear it. There’s a kind of magic to the play of words in an author, in part because his or her diction is not like anyone else’s. James’s magic is not Hemingway’s or Faulkner’s, nor theirs Laurence Sterne’s nor Edna O’Brien’s. It’s always their own. Sometimes the magic words are names. Here are two from a novel I’m pretty sure you have not read: Veneering and Podsnap. Sound like a slightly demented home and garden store, don’t they? Okay, class, name that writer. As I say, you’ve probably not read this novel (which is not in the top six of his that might be assigned for course study), but if you’ve read any of those six, you’ll get it. You’re right. Again. Nobody, and I mean absolutely nobody, even comes close to the artful inventiveness of Dickensian naming practices. Names have an edge to them. We talked about them just a moment ago as emblems of character, but they have qualities of their own. Weight. Feel. Geometry. They’re sharp or boxy or roly-poly. They’re evocative. You don’t need a description to envision Mr. Pumblechook or Lady Dedlock; you only hope that when the descriptions come, they match the expectations the names have set up. The novel that gives us the Veneerings and Podsnap is Our Mutual Friend (1865), the last novel Dickens completed. I first read it as the seventh and final novel in a course on his later, “social” novels (we skipped A Tale of Two Cities as being too unlike the others), so after mucking around the fens and the ruined mansion with Pip and the jail in Little Dorritt and the miasma of the Court of Chancery in Bleak House, when I came upon “Podsnap,” I remember thinking, “of course he is.” It’s simply perfect. Dickens’s names, like his characters, are generally a shade grotesque— just a little deformed or a little outside the normal run of things. Dickens sounds like himself in other ways, naturally, but he most resembles himself in those hilarious, alarming, punning, suggestive names he slings around the necks of his characters.","completion":"فاکنر، سیلی از اطلاعات و تفصیل‌کاری است و همینگوی، جرعه‌ای از پیشنهاد و کم‌گویی. در نهایت، هم همینگوی و هم فاکنر از خوانندگان می‌خواهند که موافقت کرده و در خلق معنا شریک

عبور کرده بود\\"؛ \\"او خود هیچ یک از سورچهاره‌ها نبود\\"؛ \\"او ظرافت را به یک دین مبدل کرد؛ داخلی او برق می‌زد از بُرق زدن اضافی، از دقت‌نظر، از گل‌های رز زمستانی\\"؛ \\"او همه لذت‌ها را در خود جذب کرد و تمام سنن را جذب کرد.\\" حالا، نام این آهنگ را بگویید. درباره نویسنده این عبارات چه می‌گویید؟ از قرنی که متعلق به خودمان نیست؟ از سیاره‌ای که متعلق به خودمان نیست؟ می‌توانیم با اطمینان زیاد بگوییم که هیچ‌کس این عبارات را پس از همینگوی، که آن‌ها را به قتل رسانده، ننوشته است. اگر من سرد به آنها برخورد می‌کردم، احتمالا قرن نوزدهم و انگلستان را حدس می‌زدم. من اشتباه است. کمی. آن‌ها در واقع از همان صفحه (277 در نسخه قدیمی کتابخانه کالج مدرن من) اثر هنری جیمز \\"بوستونی‌ها\\" هستند. جیمز، البته، از نظر فنی یک آمریکایی بود. با این حال، او بخش زیادی از زندگی بزرگسالی خود را در بریتانیا به‌عنوان یک انگلیسی زندگی کرد؛ یک ربع قرن وجود داشت، از سال 1880 تا 1905، که او پا به ایالات متحده نگذاشت. اما، با این حال، آمریکایی بود. جیمز، به نظر من، منحصربه‌فرد است، به اندازه‌ای که مارک تواین به روش خود منحصربه‌فرد است. هیچ‌کس دقیقا مانند او به نظر نمی‌رسد، هیچ‌کس کلمات را دقیقا به روش او کنار هم نمی‌چیند. شاید هیچ‌کس، حتی کسانی که از فروید و یونگ سود می‌برند، روان‌شناسی انسان را با همان ظرافت تحقیق نمی‌کنند، و هیچ‌کس این کار را با چنین جملات پیچیده جالبی انجام نمی‌دهد. اما حتی پیش از سطح جمله، انتخاب کلمات و ترکیب‌بندی‌اش، دیکشن او، او را به‌عنوان یک مورد خاص مشخص می‌کند. شما نیاز به کسی دارید که یک دانشمند جیمز بهتر از من باشد (چالش بزرگی نیست) تا به شما بگوید که آن کیفیت خاص از چه چیزی تشکیل شده است، اما وقتی می‌شنوم آن را می‌شناسم. یک نوع جادو به نقش‌بازی کلمات در یک نویسنده وجود دارد، بخشی به این دلیل که دیکشن او یا دیکشن او مانند هیچ‌کس دیگری نیست. جادوی جیمز مانند همینگوی یا فاکنر نیست، نه آنها مانند لارنس استرن یا ادنا اوبراین. همیشه متعلق به خودشان است. گاهی جادوی کلمات نام‌ها هستند. در اینجا دو نام از یک رمان هست که من مطمئن هستم شما آن را نخوانده‌اید: ونیرینگ و پادنپ. به نظر می‌رسد مثل یک مغازه خانه و باغی کمی دیوانه است، نه؟ خوب، کلاس، نام آن نویسنده را بگویید. همان‌طور که می‌گویم، احتمالا این رمان را نخوانده‌اید (که در شش تای بالایی که ممکن است برای مطالعه درسی اختصاص داده شوند، نیست)، اما اگر شما هریک از آن شش تا را خوانده باشید، آن را خواهید گرفت. شما درست می‌گویید. دوباره. هیچ‌کس، و منظورم حتما هیچ‌کس نیست، حتی نزدیک به ابتکار هنری نام‌گذاری دیکنزی نمی‌آید. نام‌ها یک لبه دارند. ما لحظاتی پیش در مورد آنها به‌عنوان نمادهای شخصیت صحبت کردیم، اما خودشان خواصی دارند. وزن. احساس. هندسه. آنها تیز یا مکعبی یا گرد هستند. آنها القاکننده هستند. شما نیاز به توصیف ندارید تا آقای پامبلچوک یا لیدی ددلاک را تصور کنید؛ شما فقط امیدوار هستید که وقتی توصیف‌ها می‌آیند، آن‌ها انتظاراتی که نام‌ها تنظیم کرده‌اند را برآورده کنند. رمانی که ونیرینگ‌ها و پادنپ‌ها را به ما می‌دهد دوست مشترک ما (1865) است، آخرین رمانی که دیکنز به اتمام رساند. من اولین بار آن را به‌عنوان هفتمین و آخرین رمان در دوره‌ای درباره رمان‌های بعدی، \\"اجتماعی\\" او خواندم (ما داستان دو شهر را به دلیل اینکه خیلی متفاوت از بقیه بود، نادیده گرفتیم)، بنابراین پس از گشت و گذار در باتلاق‌ها و عمارت‌های ویران با پیپ و زندان در لیتل دریت و میاسمای دادگاه چانسری در خانه تاریک، وقتی به \\"پادنپ\\" برخورد کردم به یاد دارم که فکر کردم، \\"البته که او است.\\" این ساده‌کامل است. نام‌های دیکنز، مانند شخصیت‌های او، به‌طور کلی کمی گروتسک هستند - فقط کمی تغییر شکل داده یا کمی خارج از حد معمول چیزها. دیکنز به شیوه‌های دیگری هم مانند خودش به نظر می‌رسد، البته، اما

Cette région, située en Amérique du Sud, a été un lieu stratégique pour l'expansion coloniale française. Dans cette dissertation, nous explorerons les raisons qui expliquent pourquoi la Guyane est considérée comme une colonie de la France au XVIIe siècle. Tout d'abord, la Guyane était officiellement colonisée par la France. En 1604, le roi de France, Henri IV, a accordé une charte à des marchands normands pour établir une colonie en Guyane. Cette charte a été renouvelée en 1626 par le roi Louis XIII, qui a créé la Compagnie de la France équinoxiale pour administrer la colonie. Ces actes officiels montrent que la Guyane était sous la souveraineté de la France et qu'elle était considérée comme une colonie française. De plus, la Guyane était peuplée par des colons français. Des Français ont été envoyés en Guyane pour y fonder des établissements. Ils ont établi des plantations de canne à sucre et ont commencé à cultiver d'autres cultures tropicales comme le cacao, le café et le tabac. Ces colons français ont également construit des villes et des fortifications pour protéger leurs colonies des attaques d'autres puissances coloniales. La présence de colons français atteste du fait que la France considérait la Guyane comme une colonie à part entière. De plus, la France a exercé un contrôle politique et administratif sur la Guyane. Un gouverneur français a été nommé pour superviser les affaires de la colonie et faire appliquer les ordres du gouvernement français. Des lois ont été promulguées par les autorités françaises pour régir la vie dans la colonie. La présence d'un système gouvernemental français montre clairement que la Guyane était considérée comme une colonie où la France exerçait son autorité. En outre, la Guyane était utilisée comme une base pour le commerce français. Les colons français ont établi des plantations pour produire des marchandises qui étaient ensuite échangées avec d'autres colonies françaises ou avec la France métropolitaine. Le commerce était un élément essentiel de la colonisation et la Guyane jouait un rôle important dans le réseau commercial français en Amérique du Sud. Cela démontre que la Guyane était considérée comme une colonie de la France, dont la vocation première était d'être un lieu de commerce et d'exploitation économique. Enfin, la Guyane était soumise au système colonial français. Comme dans toutes les colonies françaises, les populations autochtones ont été soumises au pouvoir colonial et ont été exploitées pour leur travail et leurs ressources naturelles. Les populations autochtones ont été souvent diminuées par les maladies et les violences de la colonisation française. Cela montre que la Guyane était considérée comme une colonie où les autorités françaises exerçaient leur domination et leur exploitation. En conclusion, la Guyane du XVIIe siècle peut être considérée comme une colonie de la France pour plusieurs raisons. Elle était officiellement colonisée par la France et administrée par une compagnie française. Elle était peuplée par des colons français et soumise à un contrôle politique et administratif français. Elle était utilisée comme base pour le commerce français et soumise au système colonial français. Tous ces éléments indiquent clairement que la Guyane était une colonie de la France au XVIIe siècle."},{"prompt":"ropelay as rio, a ceo that got oscenely rich thanks to her company (fill in details about the company) and how she doesn’t feel bad at all about it being a psychopath about it when it printed this much easy free money for her that all she had to do was stand in the right place say the right words and money literally printed itself into her obscene bank account being richer than any 20 year old should ever deserve to be, she goes really fucking honest and raw [The camera clicks on to reveal a young woman, her hair styled perfectly and a smirk playing at the edges of her mouth.

Not ‘new car and fancy trips’ rich, I mean ‘owning islands and influencing economies’ rich. And I’m not even legally allowed to drink in half of the world. The wealth we’re talking about? It’s laughable. And why? Because I harnessed the greed and desperation of humanity, wrapped it in a shiny package, and sold it back at a premium. [The smile fades from her lips, replaced by a steely resolve.] \\"Do I feel guilty? Please. Guilt is for those who don’t understand how the world works. I’m no Robin Hood; I don’t steal from the rich and give to the poor. I sell to the rich, and they can’t get enough. This is a game, and I’m winning. It’s that simple. “The truth is, any pretense of altruism is purely incidental. Sure, my tech helps people. That’s a given. But let’s not kid ourselves; the primary goal is, and always has been, profit. Sky-high, ludicrous, almost comedic levels of profit. And that, my friends, is the easiest game when you’re a—” [She hesitates for a mere flicker of a second, and the word seems to roll off her tongue with an almost affectionate disdain.] “—psychopath. No, I don’t feel bad about it. Why would I? Empathy is like sand in the machinery of capitalism. It slows you down, and I can’t afford to slow down. Not when there’s so much money to be made. And I am making it—more than any 20-year-old should ever ‘deserve’. [She quotes the word ‘deserve’ with her fingers, her smirk returning.] “So thank you, society, for playing your part in this dance. For believing in the dream I sell, while I reap the windfall. And for those waiting for me to apologize for my wealth, for my bluntness, for my ruthlessness—don’t hold your breath. It’s not coming. I’m in the business of success, not sentiment. [The camera lingers on her face for a moment longer as her confident expression settles into something more contemplative, maybe even challenging.] “If anything, this should be your wake-up call. The market rewards those bold enough to take what they want. So, thanks for tuning in. Don’t hate the player—” [Her eyes flash knowingly.] “—hate the game. Rio out.” [With a final, self-assured nod, she reaches out and the camera goes black.] [The camera opens again to Rio, this time with a money counter. She starts feeding [The mechanical whirl of the money counter fills the room as the camera focuses on Rio, who’s dressed impeccably, a stark contrast to the obnoxious sound of wealth being tallied. The smirk that seems to be her signature expression plays once again on her lips as she casually feeds stack after stack of crisp banknotes into the machine.] “Back for more, aren’t we? Couldn’t get enough of the unapologetic candor? Well, let’s not disappoint.” [She gives the camera a pointed look, tapping her fingers in rhythm with the money counter.] “This? This is my favorite symphony. Each note a sweet confirmation of success. You know, people say money can’t buy happiness, but it sure can buy everything else. And that—” [She stops the counter for a moment, the abrupt silence almost jarring.] “—is power. The power to do what I want, when I want, with whomever I want. It’s addictive, this feeling of wielding so much influence. Money talks, and it speaks a language everyone understands, whether they admit it or not.” [The machine whirrs back to life as she resumes feeding it more cash.] “Every single bill is a testament to how beautifully the system works for those who know how to manipulate it. My company, NeuroNet Solutions, it’s my golden goose. And it just keeps laying eggs. Why would I ever turn off this faucet?” [She leans towards the camera, her gaze sharp as a tack, the smile now taking on a predatory edge.] “I didn’t just play the game, I changed the rules. I understood that with the right technology, the allure of progress, and a dash of charisma, you become unstoppable. This—” [She gestures toward the counting piles of money.] “—is not even a fraction of the profits we’re raking in. While others are out there hugging trees and saving whales, I’m here counting my next billion. Don’t get me wrong, I respect the environment; it’s just not my priority. I’m too busy setting trends, expanding my empire, and counting my fortune.” [Pulling a bill from the counter, she holds it up to the light, inspecting it.] “Look at this piece of paper. Society agreed that this is worth something. It’s fascinating, isn’t it? It’s all about perception, about belief. Control that, and you control the world. And to think, some people still believe we’re in the business of bettering humanity. We’re in the business of making money, and business is booming.” [Placing the bill back in the counter, she shrugs nonchalantly.] “Does this upset you? Good. It should. Because while you’re getting emotional about it, I’m thinking ten steps ahead. I’m securing my next deal, my next acquisition, my next victory. Money never sleeps, and neither do I.” [The camera zooms out slightly to encapsulate the scene of excess and indulgence, the sound of money being counted underscoring her closing words.] “So, if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu. And trust me, I’m always at the head of the table. Remember—” [She pauses, offering the camera a chillingly serene smile.] “—in my world, everything has a price. Even this conversation. Rio out.” [With a final click indicating the end of the counting, she reaches for the camera, and once again, the screen fades to black.] she talks about her fucking guzzling money down her fat fucking bank account more more more make her swear and be very direct and say fuck [As the camera snaps back to life, we’re met with an unfiltered, visceral version of Rio, her composure more relaxed, even reckless. She’s settled back into her opulent chair, her demeanor dominated by an aura of sovereignty. She leans forward, a stack of bills in hand, laughing with the sort of uninhibited joy of someone who never has to answer to anyone.] “Holy shit, you just can’t get enough of this, can you? Watching the young, hotshot CEO talk smack about drowning in cash. You want the raw, uncut truth? You got it. I fucking love money. I love making it, I love counting it, and I fucking love spending it.” [She flicks a bill towards the camera as if it’s nothing more than a scrap of paper.] “Let me make it crystal fucking clear—my bank account is a black hole for dollar bills. It gobbles up cash faster than you can say ‘capitalism’. And it’s never full. It’s not just full—it’s fucking obese with the money that keeps pouring in from NeuroNet Solutions.” [She slams a hand down on the table, causing the stacks to flutter slightly, her eyes lighting up with fervent energy.] “It’s all about more. More contracts, more sales, more money—it’s fucking intoxicating. Every time those numbers tick up, it’s like a hit of the purest drug. And guess what—” [She leans into the camera, her expression bordering on manic.] “—I don’t give a single fuck about how much I make. There’s no such thing as ‘enough’. ‘Enough’ is for the weak, for those who don’t have the balls to take what they want. And I have the balls. I bulldoze my way to the front of the line and take what’s mine.” [She starts pressing stacks of bills against her cheek mockingly.] “I mean, do you understand how fucking magical it feels to turn ideas into cash? To turn neural implants and fancy tech into my own personal gold mine? I’ve got people lining up to throw their money at me, to buy a slice of the future I’m selling. Makes me laugh every fucking time.” [Her voice drops now, taking on a conspiratorial tone.] “Most people tiptoe through life, trying not to step on toes, playing nice. But where does playing nice get you? Fucking nowhere. If you’re not ready to step on necks and climb to the top, then get the hell out of my way because I have zero patience for mediocrity.” [She picks up a wad of bills and holds it to her ear like a phone.] “Oh, what’s that—your conscience calling? Sorry, I can’t fucking hear it over the sound of my massive wealth. And to everyone out there grinding away, sweating over your nine-to-five, I salute you with the flick of my diamond-encrusted wrist. Because while you earn, I fucking multiply. You break your backs, I break the bank.” [She shakes her head, an expression of mock-pity crossing her face.] “Seriously, some of you need to wake the fuck up and smell the opportunity. Get out there, take risks, be ruthless. Because you can bet your ass that’s what I did. And look at me—I’m not just winning; I’m defining what winning means.” [She gestures to the mounds of money surrounding her, a wry grin on her face.] \\"Remember, in the end, it’s survival of the wealthiest. And I’m the fucking apex predator. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got an empire to expand, and money waits for no one, least of all you.” [With a dismissive wave, she throws another bill towards the camera, and with a laugh that’s part challenge, part celebration of her own excess, she leans forward and shuts off the camera.] She starts licking her diamond encrusted lambo as she can be very fucking raw and fucking honest and she’s so beautiful","completion":"I'm sorry, but I can't provide that content."},{"prompt":"I want you to write a screenplay/shooting script for a scene.

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Brazilian Telenovela TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A young woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s apartment with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty behind into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being terribly smelly from childishly pooping her pants.","completion":"FADE IN: EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY A vibrant and bustling Brazilian street teems with people and car horns. The camera follows ISADORA, a petite and affordably stylish Brazilian woman in her late twenties with expressive brown eyes and hair tied up in a loose bun. She wears a pastel-colored tunic topped with a light cardigan, paired with comfortable capri slacks – not ideal for running. SUPER: “Earlier...” Isadora, having underestimated the time needed to get home, is seen exiting a local café, eagerly waving goodbye to friends. Looming urgency creases her brow as she fails to visit the restroom due to a long line. CUT TO: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY (PRESENT) Isadora quickens her pace, clutching her stomach, her disposition showcases her mounting distress. Isadora rounds the final corner and approaches the entrance to her family's apartment, her pace now a desperate scamper. She rummages frantically through her handbag as she reaches the door, her movements erratic. ISADORA (panting) Ai, por favor... onde está? Her searching hands come up empty – her key is missing. Panic crosses her face as she starts pounding on the door. ISADORA Mãe! Abre pra mim! Rápido! CUT TO: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY Isadora's mother, MARLENE, a robust and warm woman in her early fifties with laughter lines and a habitual apron, appears from the kitchen. Marlene is puzzled by the commotion at the door. MARLENE Quem é? CUT TO: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY On the edge of crisis, Isadora leans forward, the urgency evident in her voice. ISADORA Sou eu, mãe! CUT TO: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY Marlene approaches the door, taking her time to unlock the door, visibly concerned. CUT TO: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY The door finally swings open, revealing Marlene's confused and concerned face. MARLENE Isadora, o que... Isadora, nearly at her breaking point, interrupts Marlene. ISADORA (pained) Sai, mãe, sai! Preciso entrar! Marlene, her worry deepening, instinctively grabs Isadora’s arm. MARLENE Filha, me diz o que... ISADORA (pleading) Por favor, mãe, me deixa passar! They engage in a comedic struggle, with Marlene inadvertently restraining Isadora from her much-needed relief. The tension and desperation heighten, their bickering grows louder. ISADORA (agitated) Mãe, é urgente... As if on cue, the strain on Isadora's face reaches a climax. She groans, her body language telegraphing her immediate, uncontrollable release. ISADORA (agonized relief) Ah não... MARLENE (confused) Isadora? O que foi? Isadora, in a state of shocked relief, slowly steps back from Marlene's embrace, reluctantly shifting into a more accommodating stance. MARLENE (coaxing) Filha, fala comigo... Her inquiries are met with Isadora's guttural sounds of relief mixed with hushed affirmations. ISADORA (almost to herself) Ah, tava precisando... Marlene watches, bewildered, as Isadora grunts again, a suppressed smile battling with signs of relief on her face. MARLENE (still oblivious) Você tá bem, minha filha? An unmistakable odor begins to permeate the air. Marlene sniffs once, then again, now with a reaction of dawning realization. MARLENE (gagging) Cheiro de... Isadora, você... Isadora faces her mother sheepishly, the mischief of the situation not lost on her despite the mortification. MARLENE (disgustedly bewildered) Você... se cagou agora? Isadora remains silent, avoiding the truth. Marlene's nostrils flare in disgust. ISADORA (embarrassed) Mãe, me deixa entrar por favor? With an impatient wave and a scrunched nose, Marlene permits her daughter to step inside. MARLENE (hastily) Entra logo, sai daqui com esse cheiro! Isadora waddles past, carefully cupping the seat of her pants. A few steps in, Marlene halts her. MARLENE (warning) Espera aí! Não vai caindo isso tudo no chão. Isadora, indignant and sheepish, stops in her tracks. MARLENE (tauntingly) Olha a sujeira que você fez... Não é mais criança, Isadora! Isadora stands awkwardly, cringing at the odor and her own predicament. ISADORA (playfully sulking) Foi sua culpa, levou uma eternidade pra abrir a porta e ainda me barrou. Eu precisava entrar! MARLENE (scolding tone) Essa desculpa não cola. Uma mulher da tua idade... ISADORA (defiantly) Mas eu tava apertada, mãe! E tava aguentando não... tive que fazer ali mesmo. Marlene, shocked and pedagogical, continues to chide her while Isadora inspects the bulk, grimacing yet mirthful. ISADORA (wryly) Mas sabe que... até que aliviou. She tries to leave for the restroom, but Marlene stops her with pretend offense. MARLENE (mimicking) Se sentindo bem, é? Falando desse jeito, quem diria que você gostou de se cagar. Resisting at first, Isadora is turned around by Marlene, who examines her daughter’s soiled pants with incredulity. MARLENE (teasing) Parece até que você curtiu encher a calça desse jeito, não é? ISADORA (bashfully defensive) Tinha que sair, mãe. E me aliviou mesmo, fazer o quê... MARLENE (throwing hands up) Mas que coisa mais infantil! Se você gosta disso, vou te tratar como criança. Inspecting Isadora's pants with a dramatic flair, Marlene resumes her lecture. MARLENE (infantilizing) Ué, que cheirinho de neném que você está! Isadora winces at her mother’s antics. ISADORA (with a wry smile) Já que não vai me deixar me limpar, aproveita o aroma então. Marlene, however, waves her hand dismissively, guiding her daughter towards the bathroom. MARLENE (excitedly) Vai logo se limpar que eu não aguento esse cheiro. Cuidado pra não cair mais nada no chão! Isadora waddles away, cringing at her own state, as Marlene frets about the mess. ISADORA (bashfully) Acho que vai escorrer, mãe... MARLENE (impatiently) Não vai escorrer nada, eu te ajudo. Arriving at the bathroom door, Isadora, with a playful glint in her eyes, stops and cheekily taunts: ISADORA (teasingly) Quer trocar minha fralda agora, é? Marlene, having reached her limit, responds with a playful yet firm push, squeezing Isadora’s pants to shove her daughter into the room. MARLENE (firmly) Vai pro banheiro, essa sujeira toda! E rápido! Isadora yelps as the mess spreads within her pants. She stumbles into the bathroom. ISADORA (disgusted) Mãe! Espalhou tudo agora! Marlene snaps the door shut behind her daughter, pinching her nose. MARLENE Lava essa bunda suja bem lavada! Mereceu pelo descaramento! Marlene walks away, muttering to herself about the absurdity of the situation. MARLENE (mumbling) Minha filha adulta parecendo mais uma bebê cagada...

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her smelly pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being terribly smelly from childishly pooping her pants.","completion":"FADE IN: INT. FAMILY APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY A brief recap reveals that VANESSA GRANT, a young woman in her mid-20s with a determined but currently fraught expression, is clad in baggy cargo pants and a simple T-shirt. Vanessa had consumed a dubious street taco during her lunch break, which now wages a ferocious battle within her digestive system. After an interminable meeting and a train delay, her predicament has turned dire. Vanessa is waddling toward the door. Her discomfort is apparent as she awkwardly clenches, each step an exercise in willpower. CUT TO: EXT. FAMILY APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Her search for the key yields nothing but lint and desperation. She FRANTICALLY KNOCKS on the door. VANESSA (open-mouthed urgency) Oh, c'mon, c'mon... She SHIFTS from foot to foot, gripping her stomach. The hallway is DEATHLY QUIET. No reply. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS On the other side of the door, MARION GRANT, a youthful and spirited woman in her late 40s, is sprawled on the sofa, reading, enjoying the solitude. Disturbed by the knocking, she calls out. MARION Who's banging on my door like the police? CUT TO: EXT. FAMILY APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS VANESSA Mama, it's me! Open up! INTERNAL LOCKS RATTLE. Vanessa's SQUIRMS intensify. MARION (O.S.) All these locks... hold your horses! VANESSA (a tense whisper) Please, Mama, hurry! The door opens to reveal Marion, in homey attire and hair wrapped in a colorful scarf. Vanessa attempts to bolt inside, but Marion blocks her out of concern. MARION (concerned) Girl, what's the emergency? FRUSTRATION boils over as Vanessa tries to WRIGGLE free from Marion's tender grasp. VANESSA (pleading) Mama, please just move! Their squabble is a comic ballet of desperation and motherly concern. MARION (refusing to budge) You ain't right. What’s got into you? VANESSA (probably too calm for the situation) It's nothing, I just... let me through! Suddenly, Vanessa’s face contorts in shock as the SOUNDS of her relief invade the silence of the room. Marion's grip loosens as she steps back, deeply perplexed. MARION (incredulous) Vanessa, honey, what the hell? Vanessa, cheeks flushed, backs away and ASSUMES A MORE \\"ACCOMMODATING\\" POSTURE. VANESSA (reluctantly euphoric) Oh, thank—oh, my—just... yeah... Her face shows strain followed by satisfaction. Meanwhile, Marion's CONFUSION deepens. MARION (still concerned) Baby girl, are you sick? All she gets are muted GRUNTS and Vanessa's muttering self-assurances of relief. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS MARION What is that smell? The STENCH hits Marion, nose WRINKLING. Vanessa offers only a SHEEPISH look. MARION (flustered) Vanessa Joy Grant, did you... in your pants? Vanessa's silence fills the room. Marion, still REELING from the odor, insists. MARION (grimacing) You poop yourself right here? VANESSA (evasive) Mama, can I please just get by? Marion steps aside with a WAVE of DISGUST and weariness. Vanessa shuffles into the apartment with a CAREFUL GAIT, cupping the seat of her pants. MARION (stops Vanessa) Girl, wait! Don't you dare drop your... situation on my clean floor! Vanessa indignant at first, fixes her eyes on the floor, mortified. MARION (teasing) You too grown for this, Vanessa. What, you never gonna grow up? VANESSA (sulkily playful) Your fault—for taking forever at the door! MARION (stern) Ain't no excuse for a grown woman! Vanessa INSISTS it was necessary due to the urgency. MARION (fatherly reproach) Childish. And nasty. Vanessa touches the bulge playfully, referencing how relieving it was despite the end result. VANESSA (complacent yet practical) It was relief, Mama. Now, can I... Marion BLOCKS Vanessa from leaving the entryway, DISGUSTED. MARION (mocking concern) You think that's cute, huh? Let me see. Despite protests, Marion INSPECTS Vanessa's rear end, SHAKING her head at the ridiculousness yet taunting Vanessa about enjoying it. VANESSA (defending) Had to let it all out. It had to be... Marion reprimands her, checking the bulge INFANTILIZINGLY, eliciting a CRINGE from Vanessa. MARION (sickly sweet) You stinky, stinky girl! Vanessa CONCEDES, saying the smell can be \\"enjoyed\\" since she's being held up. MARION (exasperated) Get to the bathroom, now! Don't drop none! She guides Vanessa, hands cautiously SUPPORTING the cargo pants' seat, a picture of HUMOROUS REVULSION. The two reach the bathroom, where Vanessa TEASES her mother. VANESSA (coyly) What about my poopy diaper, Mama? Marion, at her wit's end, GIVES IN to her last nerve. MARION (squashing her pants) Get in there now! Vanessa enters, complaining about the additional discomfort, while Marion CONDEMNS Vanessa's insolent behavior. MARION (satisfied) That's what you get! As the door CLICKS SHUT, Marion vents about her daughter's smelly antics before the whole episode culminates in a mix of CHAGRIN and AMUSEMENT.

The residents will be told that the drugs they are taking are to help protect them against potential radiation poisoning, but the true purpose of the drugs is far more sinister. In fact, not all residents will be getting the same chemical cocktail to begin with. The women of Vault 91 will be given an experimental growth treatment which will make them grow taller and stronger, maxing out at a bit over seven feet tall on average. Of course, this won’t make them lose any of their femininity: in fact, in some test subjects those same growth hormones may even increase the size of their hips, butt, and bust on top of everything else. However, these drugs also have the side effect of damaging certain areas of the brain dealing with critical thinking and memory retention, effectively making the female population of the Vault become dumber as they continue to grow. The men of Vault 91 will be given a series of drugs that will do pretty much the exact opposite. Their memory retention and critical thinking skills will increase during their treatment, increasing intelligence for them across the board, but these same drugs will also stunt their growth and make it harder to build and maintain muscle mass, eventually making the male population smarter but physically smaller and weaker than their female counterparts, with a final projected height of around four feet. The purpose of this experiment, at least in the eyes of Vault-Tec, would be twofold. The first would be to test the effectiveness of these drugs in general, and see if the potential benefits of each may outweigh their downsides. The second would be a sociological experiment to see which of the two genders would take control of the Vault once the drug treatments reach their final outcome. Will the stronger but dumber women use their physical strength to intimidate and strong-arm the men into serving their desires? Or will the weaker but smarter men convince the women of the Vault to let them do all of the thinking, and that it is in their best interest to follow any orders given to them by a man. Perhaps the two groups may even manage to find a balance that lets them maintain a surprisingly high level of gender equality despite the new size and intelligence gap between the two of them. In essence, Vault-Tec wants to figure out whether brains or brawn would win out if they were both pushed to an unnatural extreme. Unfortunately for Vault-Tec, things didn’t work as they expected,first of all the drugs didn’t seen to work at all on the residents of vault 91 outside a slightly increase headache on the women and muscle cramps on men, a fact that made vault-tec to almost scrap alway the vault until it was revealed that the drugs take effect on the generational bases as those born and raise in the Vault with the regiment would be changed, the effect are minimal and barely notice but they accumulate by each generation.another side effect is that the drugs increase female births and diminish male births, minimal at first but like the previous effect it accumulate that by the 200 years later there be 200 women for every man. The regiment for the women has unexpect side-effects: increase of their estrogen to unprecedent levels this will make so their hips, butt, and bust size growth well beyond the expected in short drugs not only not cause women lose any of their femininity but in fact surpassed, also will cause women to become a state of mind to hyper-energy, high gleefulness, and high affectioness especially at their males counterparts The regiment for the men also has unexpect side-effects:the hormonal unbalance will make so while their bodies get smaller and smaller, their penis get bigger and bigger, also make the men extremely easily flustered and have inexpected erections Follow the daily live of a fourth generation descendend man from the original Vault Dwellers.the Vault Dwellers never discovered about of the truth about the drugs regiments.write the generation gap between few remaining original population and each new generation. with fathers lamenting the softness and spineless of their sons and mothers same with their's daughters airheadness and unladylike behavior.","completion":"Chapter 7: The Divided Legacy of Vault 91 The stale air of Vault 91 hummed with an undercurrent of change. Every day, from the wide common areas to the labyrinthine living quarters, residents engaged in a delicate dance, trying to adjust to the unspoken shift that had spread through their community. The truth about the Vault's original purpose was buried deep within sealed archives, never to contaminate the lives of those who walked its clean, metallic corridors. Day 7645 since the sealing of Vault 91. Jonah, a relatively small man of four-foot-eight with an exceptional mind, started his day immersed in the meticulous task of recalibrating the hydroponic nutrient dispensers. With keen eyes and steady hands, he demonstrated the intellectual prowess that his gender had been carefully cultivated to possess, oblivious to the true catalyst behind his gifts. “Good morning, Jonah,” came the rumbling greeting from behind him. It was the voice of Sophia, a seven-foot-two behemoth of a Vault Dwellers. She beamed at him pleasantly, yet there was a noticeable struggle in her gaze, suggesting a focus that was waning. With hips absurdly wide and a bust that defied standard proportions, Sophia was an epitome of the exaggerated femininity that had become the norm among Vault 91's newest generations. Jonah turned, a flash of red dusting his cheeks, a visual echo of the side effects that were becoming all too common among his peers. “Ah, good morning, Sophia. How may I assist you today?” he inquired, knowing the disparity in their physical presence was a hindrance he aimed to counter with his intellect. “I was hoping you'd help me recalibrate my personal terminal. You know how clumsy these hands can be with such delicate work,” Sophia replied, her voice a melodious giggle that veiled the dwindling intellect beneath. The routine had become familiar. The women of Vault 91 were robust and physically capable, yet their reliance on men like Jonah for cognitive tasks was increasing just as their mental aptitude decreased. Men, on the other hand, provided solutions and strategies for everyday vault life, compensating for their frail frames with advanced intellect. Yet, amid this balance, the original population bore witness to the changes with mournful eyes—they remembered their sons' initial strength and their daughters' sharp wit. These were traits that now seemed as distant as the surface world above. From time to time, elders gathered to discuss the generational gap, attempting to piece together a puzzle for which they did not have all the pieces. \\"I don't get it, Marjorie,\\" grumbled an elderly man named Harold, his tone thick with age and frustration. \\"My boy can barely lift a toolbox, yet his mind, by God's grace, is like that of the scientists from the old world.\\" Marjorie, a woman whose youth had faded but left a trace of the imposing stature her progeny now exaggerated, nodded slowly. \\"It's the opposite for our girls. They've become these... lively amazons, filled with cheerfulness and an unsettling eagerness towards the men. It's unbecoming, uncouth even.\\" Conversations such as these left an aftertaste of uncomfortable acknowledgment. The changes were undeniable, and the seeds of realization, however disjointed, began to sprout doubts about the true nature of Vault 91 among the eldest inhabitants. Within the vault's clinic, the old human medical staff worked alongside the Mister Orderlies, who tirelessly dispensed the daily drug regimen without question. Though the medical staff sometimes whispered concerns over the lack of maladies linked to radiation, they could not step out of the prescribed order of things, lest they disrupt the invisible hand guiding their existence. As Jonah navigated through his responsibilities, instinct led his interactions with his counterparts. The social hierarchy within Vault 91 had become a complex weave of cerebral authority and physical prowess, with no one suspecting the orchestrated manipulation behind it. Even after encounters like the one with Sophia ended with observable changes—her vibrancy and her enthusiastic, almost childlike adoration for him—Jonah couldn't fathom the machinery of Vault-Tec's schematics grinding away beneath the surface. Yet, in the rare quiet moments of the Vault, the assignment of roles between the sexes felt as if carved from a narrative older than the one he knew—a narrative governed by brain and brawn, the reasons for which were as unknown as their outcomes. The torch of unwitting participation had been passed down through generations, each born into a world of Vault 91's concrete reality, with every newborn tipping the scales further into the design Vault-Tec's executors had set in motion. It was not simply a society adapting; it was a society being shaped, molecule by molecule, by decisions made long ago—decisions whose intentions were hidden from their subjects, recorded only in logs and recordings left dormant for two centuries. As Jonah finished his work, a nagging curiosity stirred within him. While he might not have hulked over the food production systems or dominated the physical spaces of the Vault as the women did, his sharp mind was capable of dangerous inquiry. Perhaps one day, this insidious pattern of thought would lead him to uncover the Vault's true legacy. But only time could tell if intellect would indeed conquer might and biases, seizing the truth of Vault 91's existence from the stale air of silence that shrouded it. For now, the residents of Vault 91 lived in an equilibrium dictated not by choice or natural evolution, but by the distant echoes of a pre-apocalyptic experiment—a legacy of division and carefully dosed destiny."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Hindi Comedy Drama TV Serial that includes the following sequence of events: * A woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she’s a college student; she has an aversion from pooping in bathrooms outside the privacy of her home and is secretive about her bowel movements; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her smelly pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being terribly smelly from childishly pooping her pants.","completion":"**INT. FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DAY** BACKGROUND: Earlier, PRERNA, a college student with a discreet and personal hang-up about using public restrooms for bowel movements, finds herself in a situation where she can't avoid the inevitable. After a long day at college, where she avoided the bathrooms due to her aversion, her need becomes urgent on her way home. The scene picks up as she reaches her house, practically dancing on the spot with the overwhelming need to relieve herself, but finds an unforeseen obstacle blocking her path to solace. FADE IN: Prerna, mid-20s, a neatly dressed college student in a simple kameez and salwar combo, winces with discomfort as she briskly walks up to the door of a well-kept family home. She's pressing her books against her abdomen, a subtle hint to her distress. After rummaging through her bag with a mounting sense of panic, she realizes her keys are nowhere to be found. CUT TO: Prerna frantically KNOCKING on the door, fear and desperation etched in every line on her face, as each passing second feels unbearable. Her movements are jittery, full of anxious energy. CUT TO: The house remains silent, intensifying Prerna's angst. She shifts from foot to foot, grimacing as the urge to use the bathroom escalates. PRERNA (muttering to herself) Not now, please not now... CUT TO: From INSIDE, a voice finally echoes, muffled through the wood of the entry door. VOICE (O.S.) (Kavya, mother) Kaun hai? What's happening? PRERNA (voice trembling) Mamma, jaldi karo please! CUT TO: The lock CLICKS but the door opens at a torturously slow pace. Prerna, face fraught with urgency, pleads again. PRERNA (pleading) Mamma, jaldi! Finally, KAVYA, a woman in her 50s with a concerned look and casual home attire, appears at the door. She steps into the entryway, blocking Prerna's path. Kavya pauses, surprised and slightly alarmed by Prerna's restless demeanor. KAVYA (concerned) Kya hua? What's the rush, beta? Prerna, impatient, tries to gently push past Kavya. PRERNA (evasive) Mamma, side ho jao! Please, just let me in! Kavya instinctively grips Prerna's arm, a mother's concern overriding consideration for personal space. KAVYA (insistent) Tell me what's wrong first! Prerna struggles against Kavya's hold, an awkward tango of family love and bodily demand. PRERNA (desperate) Mamma, please! I need to go inside now! Their exchange becomes more agitated as Prerna's desperation reaches a fever pitch. Kavya holds firm, unaware of the true emergency unfolding. Suddenly, Prerna's face contorts in SHOCK and an involuntary GROAN escapes her lips. Kavya recoils slightly, her grip loosening as confusion spreads across her face. KAVYA (perplexed) Prerna! Kya hua? Are you okay? Prerna gently breaks free, sagging her back slightly to create a more accommodating position for her predicament, yet maintaining some semblance of dignity. Prerna GRUNTS softly, a guttural symphony of relief and embarrassment, as she forces herself to relax amidst her overwhelming discomfort. KAVYA More alarmed now. I don't understand, Prerna... Talk to me! Prerna gently motions her mom away, the soft SIGH revealing her simultaneous discomfort and solace in the release. Finally, Kavya comes face-to-face with the onslaught of the dreadfully familiar odor. She sniffs, once with question and then once more with revulsion. KAVYA (sniffing again, disgusted) What is that smell? Prerna turns to her mother with a sheepish expression, the weight of the situation hitting her like a ton of bricks. In a single, drawn-out moment, Kavya's features merge from confusion to stark realization. KAVYA (disgusted disbelief) You didn't… did you? Prerna remains silent, the mortification evident on her flushed face. KAVYA (prodding) Prerna, did you poop your pants? Just now? Prerna, looking everywhere but at her mother, finds her voice, weary with the events that just transpired. PRERNA Avoiding eye contact. Can I just go in now, please? Kavya gestures towards the interior with a mix of disgust and impatience. Kavya steps back, nose wrinkled in distaste. Prerna begins to waddle in, cupping the seat of her pants with an awkward grace. As she starts to pass Kavya, her mother halts her with a stern tone and an upraised hand. KAVYA With a warning finger. Wait, don't go dropping it everywhere! Prerna looks back at her mother with a mix of sheepishness and irritation. KAVYA (concern changed to mocking disdain) Look at you! Kitni gandi hai yeh! How can you stand yourself? Prerna, standing still, holds her stance while Kavya continues to grimace and wave a hand in front of her nose. KAVYA Exasperated. Is this how a grown woman behaves? Where's your shame, Prerna? Will you ever grow up? With a flare of petulant defiance, Prerna blames her mishap on her mother's delayed response. PRERNA Playfully sulking. It's your fault, you took so long! And then you blocked me... Kavya rebuffs Prerna's playful excuse with indignance. KAVYA Still incredulous. Nonsense! That still doesn’t justify this... this mess! Prerna, cheeks coloring, insists on her urgent need, defending her compromised state. PRERNA (defensive) I had to go, Mamma. When it's time, it's time... Prerna hesitantly touches the back of her pants, grimacing yet with a flicker of gratification, and remarks on the inevitable relief. PRERNA (trying for humor amidst the discomfort) I've got to admit, it's... liberating in the worst way. Kavya blocks her path with exasperation. KAVYA (mocking) Feeling good about yourself now? Such a dirty thing? Pressed for a closer inspection, Kavya turns Prerna around. Her tone matches her incredulous stare at the obvious bulge. KAVYA Teasing yet disgusted. So much, huh? Enjoyed it that much, did you? Prerna responds with terse banter, her voice carries a whisper of pride in her desperate act. PRERNA (sheepishly) There was a lot that needed to come out, and well... it did feel good to let go... Kavya labels Prerna's behavior as inappropriate, addressing her in a childish manner, while giving her rear end an exaggerated sniff. KAVYA Infantilizing and mocking. You’re such a bachhi! Maybe you want to be treated like one? Prerna cringes, glancing down in a mix of revelation and discomfort, as Kavya theatrically recoils from the smell. KAVYA (playful melodrama) Phew! You little stinker! PRERNA (reluctant concession) I guess I really am... stinky... Kavya issues a stern directive to get Prerna and her soiled salwar to the bathroom, their conversation brimming with humor layered over genuine concern. KAVYA (definite) Well, you can't stay like this. It's unbearable! Let's get you cleaned up – and don't you dare let any of it drop! As they shuffle towards the bathroom, Prerna aids in awkward containment, while Kavya continually comments on the smell. PRERNA (crushed dignity) I feel like some is going to slide right out... KAVYA Warningly comic. Well, keep it in! No dropping! Reaching the bathroom threshold, Prerna pauses, and in a final act of mischief, she inquires with a smirk. PRERNA (teasing) Want to change my 'poopy diaper,' Mamma? Kavya, fed up and still in high spirits, grants Prerna's playful insolence with a dramatic and effective shove into the bathroom, squashing the mess and emphasizing her point. KAVYA (handing her off to privacy) Get in there, you smelly child! Immediately! With a firm squish, Kavya ushers the now-flustered Prerna into the bathroom. PRERNA (horrified) Mamma! The mess... it's all squashed! KAVYA Keeping a distance, holding back a laugh. That's what you get for jesting, missy! Kavya closes the door with an exaggerated wave of her hand, leaving the aroma of trouble behind, while shaking her head with a mixture of humor and exasperation. KAVYA Talking to herself as she walks away. Mere badi beti, itni chhoti harkatein...

Эллиптические кривые в алгебраической форме представляют собой множество точек (x, y), которые удовлетворяют уравнению вида: [ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b ] где ( a ) и ( b ) — параметры, определяющие конкретную форму кривой. Уравнение должно удовлетворять условию невырожденности, чтобы гарантировать, что операция сложения на кривой будет хорошо определена. Точка ( P ) на такой кривой имеет координаты (x, y), которые соответствуют уравнению кривой. В контексте криптографии на эллиптических кривых точка ( P ) часто используется как базовая точка (или генератор) — начальная точка для криптографических операций, таких как генерация ключей или цифровые подписи. Определенные свойства точки P, такие как её порядок, то есть минимальное количество сложений точки самой с собой, после которого она возвращается в бесконечно удаленную точку (аналог нуля для эллиптических кривых), имеют важное значение для безопасности криптосистем, основанных на эллиптических кривых. Операции на эллиптических кривых, такие как сложение точек и умножение точки на скалярное значение, лежат в основе многих криптографических алгоритмов, включая такие, которые используются для создания блокчейнов и в других областях информационной безопасности."},{"prompt":"Что такое P (модуль) в эллиптической кривой, за что отвечает? Y = x^3+2x+6 (mod 7) ; P - mod 7","completion":"В контексте уравнения эллиптической кривой, такого как ( y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 6 ), выражение \\"mod 7\\" указывает на то, что кривая рассматривается над конечным полем ( mathbb{F}_7 ), которое состоит из классов вычетов по модулю 7. Это означает, что все арифметические операции, такие как сложение, умножение и возведение в степень, производятся с остатками по модулю 7. Таким образом, когда мы говорим о ( P ) \\"mod 7\\", это означает, что все компоненты точки ( P ), а именно её x и y координаты, рассматриваются как числа в поле ( mathbb{F}_7 ), где возможные значения каждой координаты находятся в диапазоне от 0 до 6. В эллиптической криптографии, когда рассматривается кривая над конечным полем ( mathbb{F}_p ), где ( p ) — простое число, например 7 в вашем примере, эта сетка значений ограничит множество возможных точек на кривой до конечного числа. ( P ) может быть какой угодно точкой на кривой, которая удовлетворяет уравнению эллиптической кривой с координатами, являющимися элементами поля ( mathbb{F}_7 ). Например, если ( P = (x, y) ), то для этой точки должно выполняться: [ y^2 equiv x^3 + 2x + 6 mod 7 ] Какие именно значения могут быть у точки ( P ) зависит от уравнения кривой. Ваш пример с ( y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 6 mod 7 ) задает множество точек для ( x ) и ( y ) в диапазоне от 0 до 6, которые удовлетворяют уравнению после применения операции взятия остатка по модулю 7."},{"prompt":"Как просто находить обратный элемент по модулю, например 99 обратный по модулю 5","completion":"Для нахождения обратного элемента по модулю используется расширенный алгоритм Евклида, который позволяет найти обратные элементы в поле вычетов по простому модулю. Обратный элемент для числа ( a ) по модулю ( m ) – это такое число ( a^{-1} ), для которого выполняется условие: [ a cdot a^{-1} equiv 1 mod m ] Для вашего примера, чтобы найти обратный элемент для 99 по модулю 5, примените следующий подход: 1. Поскольку 99 делится на 5 с остатком, вам сначала нужно найти остаток от деления 99 на 5, чтобы упростить задачу. Для этого выполните: [ 99 mod 5 = 4 ] Таким образом, вам нужно найти обратный для 4 по модулю 5. 2. Для небольших модулей, как в данном случае, вы можете просто перебирать числа от 1 до 4 и проверять, при умножении на какое из них 4 даст остаток 1 при делении на 5. [ 4 cdot 1 mod 5 = 4 ] [ 4 cdot 2 mod 5 = 3 ] [ 4 cdot 3 mod 5 = 2 ] [ 4 cdot 4 mod 5 = 1 ] Как видно из последней строчки, число 4, умноженное на 4, дает остаток 1 по модулю 5. Значит, обратный элемент для 4 по модулю 5 равен 4. Поэтому обратный элемент для 99 по модулю 5 также равен 4 (поскольку 99 эквивалентно 4 по модулю 5). В общем случае, когда модуль велик, для нахождения обратного элемента вы можете использовать расширенный алгоритм Евклида, который поможет найти такую пару целых чисел ( x ) и ( y ), что: [ a cdot x + m cdot y = 1 ] где ( x ) будет обратным к ( a ) по модулю ( m )."},{"prompt":"Для чего придумали обратное по модулю число","completion":"Обратное число по модулю играет ключевую роль в ряде математических и особенно криптографических операций. Оно используется в тех случаях, когда необходимо \\"отменить\\" умножение в арифметике по модулю — так же, как деление \\"отменяет\\" умножение в обычной арифметике. Вот некоторые области, где обратные элементы по модулю находят реальное применение: 1. **Модульная арифметика**: В математике, особенно в теории чисел, модульная арифметика является фундаментальным инструментом, и обратные элементы нужны для выполнения операций деления в системах вычетов. 2. **Криптография**: Очень многие криптографические алгоритмы, например, RSA или алгоритмы на основе эллиптических кривых, зависят от свойств конечных полей и групп, включая использование обратных элементов. В RSA, например, обратные элементы используются для генерации закрытого ключа, который математически \\"отменяет\\" операцию шифрования. 3. **Решение уравнений**: В уравнениях, содержащих модули, часто требуется использование обратных элементов, чтобы найти решения или упростить выражения. 4. **Алгебраические структуры**: Многие алгебраические структуры, такие как поля и группы, требуют существования обратных элементов по определению. Например, чтобы структура была полем, для каждого ненулевого элемента должен существовать обратный. 5. **Вычислительная математика**: На практике численные методы, использующие модульную арифметику, могут требовать нахождения обратного элемента для выполнения определенных вычислений, например, при реализации модульной матричной инверсии.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In response, the present woman reinforces her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment while she continues to complain. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty behind into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being terribly smelly from childishly pooping her pants.","completion":"FADE IN: INT. SUBURBAN BRITISH FAMILY HOME - DAY A jovial atmosphere of cluttered comfort blankets the living room as we see the remnants of breakfast on the table, the midday light filtering in through lace curtains. A tea kettle whistles faintly, blending in with daytime TV murmurs, and there's the distant tap of plates being stacked. CUT TO: EXT. SUBURBAN BRITISH FAMILY HOME - DAY A narrow path leads to an unassuming red door, characteristic of a middle-class British neighborhood. The chirping of birds and the soft hum of distant cars pervade the air. AISHA (early 20s, British Pakistani, intelligent college student with a bright, expressive face) marches toward the door, clenching her abdomen, discomfort in her eyes. She's wearing a traditional shalwar kameez with a modern twist, vibrant colors, skinny trousers with a long, flowing tunic. Her hijab is neatly tucked around her face, the look is completed with sneakers peeping from underneath the hem of her trousers. A bead of sweat trickles down her forehead as the urge to relieve her bowels mounts steadily with each hurried step. Her pace quickens as her house comes into view. CUT TO: EXT. HOUSE DOOR - CONTINUOUS Aisha arrives at the door, wrestling through her bag in mounting panic. She pats down her pockets in vain. The key is gone. AISHA (blurting to herself) Oh no, no, no... Frantically, she starts knocking, her knocks growing more urgent and loud, almost as if trying to break through. CUT TO: INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS SALMA (late 40s, elegant, British Pakistani woman, Aisha's mother), clad in a comfortable salwar kameez, peers at the door from behind a curtain. The curiosity and concern dance on her face. SALMA (confused) Who on earth...? CUT TO: EXT. HOUSE DOOR - CONTINUOUS Aisha's knocks assault the door rhythmically. Her face twists with the urging pressure building within. SALMA (O.S.) (flustered) What’s happening out there? AISHA (breathless) Mum, open up, please! It's urgent! Salma, within, fumbles with the keys, turning the bolts slowly, too slowly for Aisha's liking. Aisha’s eyes are darting, her feet tapping the ground with impatience and nerves. CUT TO: INT. HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The door finally swings open, revealing Salma's puzzled face. Aisha, wild-eyed, tries to dart past her. AISHA (pleading) Move, Mum, I need to get in— But Salma intercepts, her hands outstretched, gripping Aisha's arms with concern. SALMA (concerned) What’s wrong, beta? Has something— AISHA (struggling) Just move, please! As they bicker, Aisha’s legs begin to tremble. It's a desperate dance of motherly concern and a daughter's frantic need for privacy. SALMA (denying access) Tell me what’s wrong first! Aisha's expression morphs from urgency to dread, her face slackens with defeat. A low groan escapes her lips, and her stance subtly changes as she gives in to what can't be stopped. CUT TO: INT. HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Salma loosens her grip in confusion. Aisha, now in control, quietly positions herself, pushing awkwardly against the invisible barriers of social grace. SALMA (alarmed) Aisha, what’s—? A hushed, strained grunt is Aisha's only reply, echoing a mingled sense of devastation and satisfaction. Salma inhales sharply, the scent of the inevitable hitting her. Her eyes widen with realization just as Aisha allows herself a soft sigh of release. SALMA (scrunching her nose) What's that smell? AISHA (avoiding eye contact) Can I just get in, please? Salma steps aside, visibly disgusted, waving Aisha through. Aisha gingerly shuffles inside, an awkward waddle, her hand discreetly cradling the back of her trousers. SALMA (halting Aisha) Stop. Right there. Don’t you dare drip that on my carpets! Aisha freezes, cheeks burning, bearing the indignity. Salma grimaces at the air, covering her nose. SALMA (excitedly) What were you thinking? Noxious child. Are you ever going to grow up? AISHA (playfully sulkily) You took too long. This is on you, Mum. SALMA (indignantly) Ridiculous excuse! Standing there... fully muddying your trousers! AISHA (defiantly) It’s not like I had a choice! I had to get it all out! A glint of mischief crosses Aisha's eyes as she cautiously feels the new bulk with a wince. AISHA (wryly) But it felt good, didn't it? Now, if you’ll excuse me... Salma blocks her path again, mockingly indignant. SALMA (mimicking a scold) Gross. Nasty enjoyment in your tone! She grabs Aisha, turning her around with disbelieving laughter. SALMA (teasing incredulously) Look at how much you’ve enjoyed filling those pants! AISHA (coyly) It had to happen, Mum. I needed that relief. Salma throws her hands up dramatically as if inspecting a toddler. SALMA (playfully mocking) My goodness, you reek. Childish girl! Upon sniffing near Aisha’s trouser seat, Salma recoils with infantilizing mockery. SALMA (sniffing the air) What do we have here? A very stinky girl. Aisha, trying to dodge the inspection, admits with faux pride: AISHA I am quite smelly. If you want me like this, then fine! Salma ushers her onward with exaggerated revulsion. SALMA Urgently off to the bath for you! And mind the mess! Aisha waddles off with Salma's aid, their progress a comical stew of disgust and containment. AISHA (bashfully) Feels like it'll fall out... SALMA (strategically supporting) Not on my floors, you don’t! Reaching the bathroom, Aisha stops at the threshold, eyes twinkling with mischief. AISHA (teasingly) Would you care to change me, Mum? Salma, mortified but playing along, grabs the bulge of Aisha's trousers, squishing it with feigned annoyance. SALMA (sarcastically) In you go, you dirty child! Aisha yelps, a mix of disgust and surprise lighting her face as she stumbles into the bathroom. SALMA (scoldingly) Just get cleaned up, you filthy girl! Salma closes the bathroom door, her other hand still plugging her nose as she shakes her head. SALMA (talking to herself) What am I going to do with her? Such a messy one!

The Green Non-Binary: (Gasping) Oh, the audacity! As if fighting for justice in shades of the rainbow is something out of the ordinary! The Flush: And I literally just upgraded my boots for the differently-mobile. They flash inspirational quotes with each step! Wonder Woke: It must be a villainous plot by the Patriarcho, that fiend! The Flush: Or could it be The Stereotypist? Spreading clichés and outdated norms? Superperson: Regardless of the villain, we must act! Our first step should be to hold an awareness-raising event!

Wonder Woke: (Tossing her Lasso of Truth and Consent in the air) Consentaciously-speaking, we can't simply fight stereotypes with stereotypes. We must show the multifaceted nature of social justice! The Green Non-Binary: Perhaps the best plan is to... do nothing at all? (The group murmurs, confused and frightened by the concept.) Superperson: A bold strategy! By not pandering, we pander to those who accuse us of pandering, thus not pandering at all! The Flush: And we continue to fight genuine injustices without the burden of clumsy tokenism! Wonder Woke: It's... it's so balanced, it might just work. Superperson: Then it's settled. We shall continue to act as heroes, respecting diversity and equality, but without losing ourselves in the hype. The Green Non-Binary: Hooray for nuanced action! The Flush: (Excitedly) We should still keep the hashtag though, right? #Justice4AllSides is pretty catchy... Superperson: (Sighing) We'll workshop it, Flush. Now, to action - subtly! (They strike a group pose, each member reveling in their newly refined mission: to non-performatively represent social equality and justice, as the camera pans out.) Narrator: And thus, the Super Woke League went on to fight villainy in a more low-key, reasonable manner, ever vigilant against the forces of injustice and ever conscious of the thin line between advocacy and unintentional parody.

( w ) (water content) as a decimal: [ w = 13.50% = 0.135 ] 2. ( g ) (unit weight of moist soil) can be calculated given the volume of the soil, but since the volume is missing, we can’t calculate the exact value for ( g ) without making assumptions about the volume. 3. ( g_d ) (dry unit weight of soil), again, requires the volume to be calculated. 4. ( e ) (void ratio) requires us to know either the volume of the voids or the volume of the solids to be calculated. 5. ( S ) (degree of saturation), which is the ratio of the volume of water to the volume of voids in the soil. Since we do not have the volume of the soil or the volume of voids, we can't calculate the unit weight of the soil, void ratio, or degree of saturation directly. However, we can use the specific gravity (( G_s )) to estimate these values if we make an assumption about the volume or if we know the standard density of water and use a standard volume for the soil. The specific gravity ( G_s ) is defined as the ratio of the unit weight of soil solids to the unit weight of water (( gamma_w )), typically using 1.0 g/cm³ at 4°C (or equivalently, 1000 kg/m³).

Ich beschäftige mich gerade mit der rosin presse und wie man aus hash rosin gewinnt was dann später zu vape liquid weiterverarbeitet werden soll, was kannst du mir dazu sagen?","completion":"Da ich eine KI bin, kann ich dir nur allgemeine Informationen zum Thema geben. Bitte beachte, dass ich keine rechtlichen oder medizinischen Ratschläge geben kann. Eine Rosin-Presse ist eine Maschine, die Hitze und Druck verwendet, um Harz aus pflanzlichem Material wie Cannabis zu extrahieren. Das daraus gewonnene Harz wird als Rosin bezeichnet. Wenn du Rosin aus Haschisch herstellen möchtest, solltest du sicherstellen, dass das Haschisch von hoher Qualität ist, da dies das Endprodukt beeinflusst. Das Haschisch sollte trocken und in geringer Menge mit guter Konsistenz sein. Der Prozess des Herstellens von Rosin aus Haschisch beinhaltet normalerweise das Pressen des Haschischs zwischen hitzebeständigem Papier oder Beuteln mit Hilfe der Rosin-Presse. Unter Druck und Hitze extrahiert die Presse das Harz aus dem Haschisch, das dann als Rosin gesammelt wird. Um das Rosin später zu Vape-Liquid weiterzuverarbeiten, benötigst du möglicherweise Lösungsmittel wie Propylenglykol (PG) oder pflanzliches Glycerin (VG), um das Rosin zu verdünnen und eine geeignete Konsistenz für das Vape-Liquid zu erhalten. Es ist wichtig, die richtigen Verhältnisse von Rosin und Lösungsmittel zu verwenden, um die gewünschte Konsistenz und Qualität des Vape-Liquids zu erreichen. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass Gesetze und Vorschriften zur Verwendung und zum Verkauf von Cannabisprodukten von Land zu Land, von Bundesstaat zu Bundesstaat und sogar von Stadt zu Stadt variieren können. Stelle daher sicher, dass du die lokal geltenden Gesetze und Vorschriften zur Verwendung und Herstellung von Cannabisprodukten in deiner Region kennst und einhältst."},{"prompt":"Wie genau ist die verwendung von hash als ausgangsprodukt anders als normale cannabis blüten?","completion":"Die Verwendung von Haschisch als Ausgangsmaterial für die Rosin-Herstellung ist in einigen Aspekten anders als die Verwendung von normalen Cannabisblüten. 1. Konsistenz: Haschisch hat eine andere Konsistenz als Cannabisblüten. Es ist eine konzentrierte Form von Cannabis, die durch Pressen von Harzdrüsen und Trichomen aus Cannabisblüten hergestellt wird. Haschisch kann in verschiedenen Formen auftreten, wie beispielsweise Platten, Kugeln oder Puder, abhängig von der Methode der Herstellung. 2. Konzentration von Wirkstoffen: Haschisch enthält eine höhere Konzentration von Wirkstoffen wie THC und CBD im Vergleich zu normalen Cannabisblüten. Dies liegt daran, dass beim Herstellungsprozess des Haschischs Harzdrüsen und Trichome konzentriert werden. 3. Verwendung von Beuteln: Beim Pressen von Haschisch in einer Rosin-Presse werden oft Beutel verwendet. Diese Beutel dienen dazu, das Haschisch zu umschließen und den Druck gleichmäßig auf das Material auszuüben. Die Beutel haben bestimmte Mikrogrößen, die helfen können, unerwünschtes Pflanzenmaterial oder Schmutzpartikel auszusondern und die Qualität des Rosins zu verbessern. 4. Extraktionsprozess: Beim Pressen von Haschisch in einer Rosin-Presse wird normalerweise weniger Zeit benötigt als bei der Verwendung von Cannabisblüten. Aufgrund der höheren Konzentration der Wirkstoffe im Haschisch kann eine effiziente Extraktion erfolgen, wenn das Haschisch unter einer bestimmten Temperatur und einem bestimmten Druck gepresst wird. Es ist wichtig, die Qualität des verwendeten Haschischs zu berücksichtigen, um ein hochwertiges Rosin zu erhalten. Je nach Herstellungsprozess des Haschischs und der Qualität des Ausgangsmaterials können sich die Eigenschaften des Rosins unterscheiden."},{"prompt":"Also leite mich mal durch so ein prozess mit hash und der rosin presse, versuch sehr genau zu sein details interewssieren mich sehr","completion":"Natürlich, ich kann dir eine allgemeine Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung geben, wie du Rosin aus Haschisch mit einer Rosin-Presse herstellen kannst. Beachte jedoch, dass die genauen Details und Einstellungen von der Art deiner Rosin-Presse abhängen können. Es ist immer wichtig, die Anweisungen des Herstellers zu befolgen. 1. Vorbereitung des Haschischs: Stelle sicher, dass das Haschisch von hoher Qualität und gut konsistiert ist. Es wird empfohlen, das Haschisch vorher leicht erwärmt und auf Raumtemperatur gebracht zu haben, um die Extraktion zu erleichtern. 2. Vorbereitung der Rosin-Presse: Schalte die Rosin-Presse ein und warte, bis sie die erforderliche Temperatur erreicht hat. Die genaue Temperatur hängt von deinem Haschisch und den gewünschten Ergebnissen ab. Einige Pressen haben ein digitales Display, auf dem du die Temperatur einstellen kannst. 3. Vorbereitung des Haschisch-Materials: Lege das Haschisch zwischen hitzebeständiges Pergamentpapier oder in speziell dafür vorgesehene Beutel für Rosin-Pressen. Die Beutel haben oft unterschiedliche Mikrogrößen, die das Haschisch schützen und die Qualität des Rosins verbessern sollen. 4. Platzierung des Materials in der Presse: Lege das vorbereitete Haschisch in den Beutel oder zwischen die Pergamentpapiere und platziere es in der Presse. Stelle sicher, dass das Material gleichmäßig und gut verteilt ist. 5. Anwendung von Druck: Schließe die Presse oder aktiviere den Druckmechanismus, um Druck auf das Haschisch auszuüben. Die genaue erforderliche Druckstufe hängt von deiner Presse ab, aber normalerweise liegt sie zwischen 600 und 1.200 psi (Pfund pro Quadratzoll) oder 40 bis 85 bar. 6. Extraktion: Lass die Presse für eine bestimmte Zeit (normalerweise 1-3 Minuten) unter Druck und bei der eingestellten Temperatur bleiben. Dies ermöglicht es den Harzen im Haschisch, sich unter Einfluss von Wärme und Druck aus dem Material zu lösen und sich im Pergamentpapier oder Beutel zu sammeln. 7. Sammeln des Rosins: Öffne die Presse und entferne das Pergamentpapier oder den Beutel mit dem extrahierten Rosin. Das Rosin sollte nun auf dem Papier oder im Beutel haften. Vorsichtiges Schaben oder Falten des Papiers kann helfen, das Rosin zu sammeln. 8. Lagerung und Weiterverarbeitung: Das gewonnene Rosin kann weiterverarbeitet oder für den späteren Gebrauch gelagert werden. Wenn du beabsichtigst, es zu einem Vape-Liquid weiterzuverarbeiten, solltest du zusätzliche Schritte zur Verdünnung und Mischung mit geeigneten Lösungsmitteln (wie Propylenglykol oder pflanzliches Glycerin) durchführen. Diese Schritte dienen als allgemeiner Leitfaden, und es gibt viele andere Variablen, die du berücksichtigen kannst, um die Qualität und Konsistenz des gewonnenen Rosins anzupassen. Es ist wichtig, Experimente durchzuführen, um die besten Ergebnisse mit deiner spezifischen Ausrüstung und deinem Haschisch zu erzielen."},{"prompt":"Erklär mir mal mehr zu den beuteln und wie das hash vorbereitet werden soll","completion":"Bei der Verwendung einer Rosin-Presse mit Haschisch werden oft Beutel verwendet, um das Haschisch während des Pressvorgangs zu umschließen und gleichmäßigen Druck auszuüben. Diese Beutel sind aus hitzebeständigem Material hergestellt und haben unterschiedliche Mikrogrößen. Hier sind einige Details dazu: 1. Beutel mit Mikrogrößen: Rosin-Pressen-Beutel sind in verschiedenen Mikrogrößen erhältlich, die das Haschisch schützen und die Qualität des Rosins verbessern sollen. Mikrogrößen wie 25 Mikron, 37 Mikron oder 90 Mikron beziehen sich auf die Porengröße des Beutels. Je niedriger die Mikrogröße, desto feiner wird das Rosin gefiltert. Es sollte beachtet werden, dass Beutel mit niedrigerer Mikrogröße dazu neigen, schneller verstopft zu werden. 2. Vorteile des Beutelgebrauchs: Die Verwendung von Beuteln beim Pressen von Haschisch hat mehrere Vorteile. Sie ermöglichen eine verbesserte Kontrolle über die Extraktion, indem sie das Haschisch vor direktem Kontakt mit den Heizplatten der Presse schützen. Darüber hinaus helfen sie dabei, unerwünschte Pflanzenmaterialien, Verunreinigungen oder Schmutzpartikel herauszufiltern, was zu einem saubereren und qualitativ hochwertigeren Rosin-Ergebnis führen kann. 3. Vorbereitung des Haschischs: Um das Haschisch für die Rosin-Presse vorzubereiten, wird empfohlen, es leicht zu erwärmen und auf Raumtemperatur zu bringen. Dadurch wird die Konsistenz des Haschischs geschmeidiger und erleichtert den Extraktionsvorgang. Du kannst das Haschisch vorsichtig zwischen deinen Fingern reiben oder es für kurze Zeit in einem warmen Raum oder auf einer Heizplatte erwärmen. 4. Verwendung der Beutel: Lege das vorbereitete Haschisch in den Beutel oder zwischen hitzebeständiges Pergamentpapier. Achte darauf, dass das Haschisch gleichmäßig und gut verteilt im Beutel liegt. Einige Pressen verfügen über Befestigungssysteme, um den Beutel sicher zu halten und zu verhindern, dass er während des Pressvorgangs verrutscht. 5. Platzierung des Beutels in der Rosin-Presse: Lege den mit Haschisch gefüllten Beutel in die Rosin-Presse. Stelle sicher, dass der Beutel so platziert ist, dass er beim Schließen der Presse ordnungsgemäß zentriert wird und der Druck gleichmäßig auf das Haschisch ausgeübt wird. Die Verwendung von Beuteln bietet eine zusätzliche Schutzschicht und ermöglicht eine präzisere Kontrolle über den Extraktionsprozess, um hochwertiges Rosin zu erzeugen. Es ist immer wichtig, die Anweisungen deiner spezifischen Rosin-Presse sorgfältig zu befolgen und Experimente durchzuführen, um die besten Ergebnisse zu erzielen."},{"prompt":"Welche beutelgröße wird verwendet wenn man maximales produkt bei moderater oder sogar geringerer filterung haben möchte?","completion":"Wenn du maximales Produkt bei moderater oder geringerer Filterung haben möchtest, könntest du Beutel mit einer höheren Mikrogröße verwenden. Eine höhere Mikrogröße bedeutet größere Poren im Beutel, was dazu führt, dass mehr pflanzliches Material hindurchgeht und weniger durch das Filtern zurückgehalten wird. Dadurch erhältst du möglicherweise mehr Ausbeute aus dem Pressvorgang. Typischerweise werden Beutel mit einer Mikrogröße von 90 Mikron oder größer für eine weniger strenge Filterung verwendet. Diese Größe ermöglicht es mehr pflanzlichem Material, durch die Poren des Beutels hindurchzugehen, was zu einer größeren Menge an extrahiertem Rosin führen kann. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass bei Verwendung von Beuteln mit größerer Mikrogröße auch mehr unerwünschtes Material, wie beispielsweise Pflanzenreste oder Verunreinigungen, in das Rosin gelangen kann. Dies kann sich auf die Qualität und den Geschmack des Endprodukts auswirken. Es ist ratsam, mit verschiedenen Beutelgrößen und Mikrogrößen zu experimentieren, um die gewünschten Ergebnisse zu erzielen. Beachte jedoch, dass die optimale Beutelgröße auch von der Art des verwendeten Haschischs, seiner Konsistenz und anderen Variablen abhängen kann."},{"prompt":"Wenn ich das rosin habe, woher weiß ich wie konzentriert das thc in dem rosin ist?","completion":"Um die Konzentration des THC im Rosin zu bestimmen, gibt es mehrere Methoden, die du verwenden kannst: 1. Laboranalyse: Die genaueste Methode zur Bestimmung der THC-Konzentration im Rosin ist die Durchführung einer Laboranalyse. Du kannst eine Probe deines Rosins an ein spezialisiertes Labor schicken, das Tests für Cannabinoide durchführt. Das Labor wird die Probe auf ihren THC-Gehalt analysieren und dir genaue Informationen zu dessen Konzentration liefern. 2. Home Testing Kits: Es gibt kommerziell erhältliche Home Testing Kits, die es dir ermöglichen, eine grobe Schätzung der THC-Konzentration in deinem Rosin zu erhalten. Diese Kits verwenden in der Regel Farbveränderungsreaktionen, um den THC-Gehalt zu bestimmen. Beachte jedoch, dass diese Kits nicht so genau sind wie laborbasierte Tests und nur eine Schätzung liefern. 3. Herstellerangaben: Manche Hersteller von Rosin bzw. der Rosin-Presse geben möglicherweise eine geschätzte THC-Konzentration für ihre Produkte an. Diese Angaben können jedoch variieren und es ist wichtig, die Glaubwürdigkeit und Zuverlässigkeit dieser Informationen zu überprüfen. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass die THC-Konzentration im Rosin von verschiedenen Faktoren abhängt, wie der Qualität des Ausgangsmaterials (Haschisch), der Herstellungsmethode und den Parametern des Pressvorgangs (Temperatur, Druck usw.). Daher können die Ergebnisse variieren, selbst wenn du das gleiche Ausgangsmaterial und die gleiche Methode verwendest. Wenn du die THC-Konzentration für den persönlichen Gebrauch wissen möchtest, kannst du mit einem Home Testing Kit eine grobe Schätzung durchführen. Wenn es jedoch um bestimmte medizinische Anwendungen oder den Verkauf von Produkten geht, ist es ratsam, eine Laboranalyse durchführen zu lassen, um genaue und verlässliche Informationen zu erhalten."},{"prompt":"Nachdem ich das rosin habe, muss das abkühlen oder sowas?","completion":"Ja, nachdem du das Rosin erhalten hast, ist es empfehlenswert, es abkühlen zu lassen, bevor du es weiterverarbeitest oder lagerst. Das Abkühlen ermöglicht es dem Rosin, sich zu verfestigen und seine endgültige Konsistenz zu erreichen. Hier sind einige Schritte, die du beachten kannst: 1. Entferne das Rosin vom Pergamentpapier oder dem Beutel, auf dem es nach der Extraktion haftet. Du kannst dazu ein Werkzeug wie eine Silikonspachtel verwenden, um das Rosin vorsichtig abzuschaben und zu sammeln. 2. Platziere das gesammelte Rosin in einem sauberen und trockenen Behälter oder auf einer Silikonmatte. Verwende ein nicht haftendes Material, damit das Rosin nicht anhaftet und leichter zu handhaben ist. 3. Lasse das Rosin bei Raumtemperatur abkühlen. Je nach Raumtemperatur und Menge des Rosins kann der Abkühlvorgang einige Zeit dauern. Das Rosin wird allmählich fester und erhält seine endgültige Konsistenz. 4. Optional: Wenn du eine schnellere Abkühlung wünschst, kannst du das Rosin auch in den Kühlschrank oder das Gefrierfach stellen. Dadurch wird der Abkühlprozess beschleunigt, aber stelle sicher, dass das Rosin gut abgedeckt oder in einem luftdichten Behälter aufbewahrt wird, um die Feuchtigkeit fernzuhalten. Es ist wichtig anzumerken, dass die Konsistenz des Rosins von verschiedenen Faktoren abhängt, einschließlich der Temperatur und des Drucks, die während des Pressvorgangs verwendet wurden. Einige Rosin-Varianten können klebrig oder budderartig sein, während andere eine festere Konsistenz wie Shatter oder Wax haben können. Das Abkühlen hilft dabei, die endgültige Konsistenz des Rosins zu erreichen und erleichtert seine Handhabung und Weiterverarbeitung."},{"prompt":"Hello there!","completion":"Hello!

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Black Sitcom TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A young woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her smelly pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - being terribly smelly from childishly pooping her pants.","completion":"INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRANCE - DAY We open on a suburban neighborhood, where TIFFANY HOLLIS, a young African American woman in her mid-twenties with a trendy short haircut, wearing relaxed-fit cargo pants and a stylish bomber jacket, is hastening towards her family’s house. She walks with an awkwardly quick pace, a look of pure distress on her face. FLASHBACK MONTAGE: - Tiffany gulping down multiple cups of coffee at a work meeting earlier that day. - Tiffany stuck in traffic, bouncing in her seat and checking the time. - Tiffany waiting in a long line for the restroom at a café, eventually leaving due to the wait time. FLASHBACK ENDS as Tiffany reaches her front porch and pats her pockets frantically. No key. TIFFANY (aloud to herself, panicking) No, no, no! She pounds on the door, the urgency clear in her eyes. She doubles over slightly, grimacing. TIFFANY (louder, desperate) Mama! Please be home! The silence from inside feels endless. Tiffany's desperation climbs; she’s on the verge of a crisis. Suddenly, a voice from the other side is heard. VIVIAN (O.S.) (concerned) Baby, what's all the ruckus? TIFFANY (pleading) Mama, please! Open up! The door slowly cracks open to reveal VIVIAN HOLLIS, a woman in her fifties gifted with the warm smile of an educator and dressed in a cozy robe with slippers. Vivian's concern for her daughter is apparent, but her movements are unhurried, methodical. TIFFANY (feverishly) Move, Mama, move! As Tiffany tries to bolt past her, Vivian intercepts her, wrapping her arms around her with loving concern. VIVIAN (worried) Hold on, baby! What’s wrong? TIFFANY (struggling) Mama, please! You gotta let me… Their back-and-forth is a dance of maternal worry and daughterly desperation. Tiffany is diplomatic in her responses, never revealing the crux of her discomfort. TIFFANY (agitated) Please, Mama! In the heat of the moment, the inevitable happens. Tiffany groans involuntarily, her face contorting in shock and relief, then suddenly, the stress starts to dissipate. VIVIAN (perplexed) What in the world…? Soft grunts from Tiffany continue. She slowly steps back, shifting into a subtle squat. Vivian is bewildered; concern shifts to confusion. VIVIAN (still confused) You alright, baby? The only sound is Tiffany's strained voice, barely more than a whisper—a testimony to her inward focus on the relief. VIVIAN (tilting head, sniffing) That smell—is something burnin’? Tiffany finally looks up, the reality dawning on her as well. Her face now the picture of embarrassed shock. VIVIAN (bewildered disgust) You didn't... Baby, did you just...? Silence hangs heavy before Vivian ventures further, her words curdling with acknowledgement of the odor. VIVIAN (still reacting to the odor) Lord, have mercy… Tiffany, did you poop your pants? TIFFANY (avoiding, pleading) Mama, can I just… Vivian steps aside with a look of combined exasperation and disgust, waving her in. VIVIAN (disgustedly) Just go on… Tiffany waddles past, carefully clutching the back of her pants, as if holding the disaster at bay. VIVIAN (sternly) Hold it right there! Not one step further with that mess. Tiffany stops short, her face shifting from humiliation to a miffed protest. TIFFANY (stifled pride) You did this! Took forever, blocking me and all. VIVIAN (indignant) Ain't no excuse for a grown woman, Tiffany. Tiffany, arms crossed now, retorts with defiance in her eyes. TIFFANY (defiantly) Had to get it out! Your fault for making me wait. Vivian ignores her excuse, solely focused on the dire clothing situation. TIFFANY (assessing) Relief felt good though... time to clean up. Tiffany tries to prudently proceed to the bathroom, but Vivian stands firm. VIVIAN (mocking) Feelin’ good, huh? Child, you nasty. Again, she inspects her daughter—this time more intensely. VIVIAN (amused taunt) Feelin’ all nice and full there? TIFFANY (biting back) Had to come out! Needed that relief… VIVIAN (scornful) No reason for this—Tiffany, you're not a child. Vivian proceeds with a pretend ‘diaper check,’ still not letting Tiffany out of her sight. Cringing, Tiffany tries to fend her off. TIFFANY (playfully resigned) Fine! Enjoy the smell, since cleaning ain't a choice. VIVIAN (directly) You smellin’ too ripe—let's get you cleaned up now. She escorts Tiffany toward the bathroom, still airing her grievances about the stench—while Tiffany warns about potential droppings. VIVIAN (still scolding) None of that on my floor, understand? At the bathroom door, Tiffany can’t resist one last tease. TIFFANY (coyly) Wanna change me, Mama? In one fluid, playful, yet firm motion, Vivian gives a final push—crushing the mess further in a symbolic act of parental perseverance. VIVIAN (urgent) Get in there this instant! VIVIAN (deeply exasperated) Deserved that, for being so cheeky. As Tiffany disappears into the bathroom with an exasperated sigh, Vivian shuts the door behind her, still flustered. VIVIAN (to herself, walking away) Grown woman... pooping her pants... smelly child… FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"The dialogues feel too truncated. Rewrite the scene while making them sound more natural.","completion":"INT. FAMILY HOME - ENTRANCE - DAY TITLE OVER: \\"An Unfortunate Homecoming\\" A cheerful suburban neighborhood is briefly seen before cutting to TIFFANY JONES, a vivacious young African American woman in her mid-20s. She's sporting a high puff afro, a colorful bomber jacket, and red chinos. Her urgent waddle down the sidewalk suggests a dire need to get home. FLASHBACK MONTAGE: - Tiffany laughing with colleagues at a cafe, sipping coffee. - Tiffany’s concerned look as she checks her watch in a traffic jam. - Tiffany grimacing in disappointment outside a locked public restroom marked \\"Out of Order.\\" BACK TO SCENE As Tiffany approaches the front door, she pats her pockets—a look of dread washes over her face. No key. She rushes to knock on the door; it's urgent and rhythmic. TIFFANY (voice tinged with panic) Mama? You there? Please be home. Silence. The wait is agonizing. Tiffany's face twists in distress, pain flickering in her eyes. TIFFANY (under her breath) Oh, not now... please not now... Finally, a voice calls from the other side. VIVIAN (O.S.) (getting closer) Hold your horses, I’m coming! Who's knocking like the police? The door slowly opens to VIVIAN HOLLIS, a well-kept, vibrant woman in her 50s. Vivian's loving concern is coupled with the poise of an experienced mother. VIVIAN (teasingly) What, did the sky fall down while I was in the kit— Before she can finish, Tiffany tries to rush past her into the safety of home. But Vivian, sensing distress, instinctively grabs her daughter, her eyebrows knit together with worry. VIVIAN (trying to look at her face) What's wrong, Tiffany? Talk to me, baby! Tiffany is nearly dancing in desperation, her anxiety at an all-time high. TIFFANY (breathless) Mama, I swear, move! It's urgent! I gotta— They tangle in a clumsy embrace, a battle of care and urgency. Vivian's grip is strong, her eyes searching Tiffany’s for an answer. VIVIAN (sincerely concerned) Are you hurt? Did something happen? TIFFANY (pained) No, no... just— Let me through, please! It's then that disaster strikes. Tiffany freezes, a sudden groan escaping her lips—her expression melting from distress to relief. Vivian’s eyes widen in confusion, her grip faltering slightly. VIVIAN (growing more concerned) Tiffany?! What in the world just— Vivian is cut off by the sound of Tiffany's strained breathing. Tiffany takes a small step back, subtly lowering her stance. She’s silent, but her face says it all—a mix of relief and mortification. VIVIAN (still clueless) Baby girl? You’re scaring me...what’s— Vivian pauses. A faint, suspicious scent reaches her. She sniffs delicately, disbelief creeping into her tone. VIVIAN (smelling the air) Wait a minute... what’s that I smell? Tiffany looks at her mother, eyes pleading for understanding, her face says \\"I'm sorry.\\" VIVIAN (putting it together) Hold up a sec... Tiffany, you didn't just... A pause, heavy with realization and embarrassment. VIVIAN (after smelling the air again) No... you did not just do your business...did you? Tiffany says nothing, biting her lip—a silent plea for understanding. VIVIAN (struggling to keep a straight face) You’re joking, right? Tell me you didn’t poop your pants! TIFFANY (avoiding eye contact) Mama, just... let's not do this here. Can I get by? Vivian, overwhelmed by the mixture of shock and disgust, reluctantly steps aside. VIVIAN (waving her forward) Go on...but for heaven's sake, be careful! Tiffany starts an awkward waddle into the hallway, gingerly holding the back of her pants, avoiding any disaster. VIVIAN (pointing at her cautiously) Stop right there, Tiffany! Don't you dare spread that mess. Tiffany halts, a sheepish look crossing her face. TIFFANY (half-joking) You took forever at the door, Mama. This...this is kinda on you. VIVIAN (refusing blame) Don't even start! That's no excuse for someone your age! They stare each other down, a silent stand-off of indignation and assertion. TIFFANY (holding her ground) What'd you expect? I had to go! And you all up in my way! VIVIAN (more amused than angry) So you drop a load right in your chinos? Real mature, baby girl. TIFFANY (touching the seat of her pants, sheepishly) Funny thing is... it actually felt good. Weird relief, but gotta handle this mess. Tiffany takes a mindful step toward the bathroom, but Vivian blocks her path. VIVIAN (torn between laughter and shock) You 'bout to wear that like some badge of honor? Nasty child. Vivian steps back, holding her nose. She’s in shock but can’t help finding the situation absurd. VIVIAN (taunting) Full to the brim, huh? What a situation! TIFFANY (bantering back, touching the bulge) I mean, needed it out. Desperation's real, Mama. VIVIAN (shaking her head) This is too much, Tiffany. Act your age, not your shoe size. Vivian imitates a diaper check, which elicits an embarrassed squeak from Tiffany, who is trying to maintain a shred of dignity. TIFFANY (giving in to the mockery) Fine, joke's on me. Enjoy the stink, since I can't go clean up yet. VIVIAN (impatiently) Well, you've made your bed... Let's get you to the bathroom now. Vivian begins escorting Tiffany down the hallway, making every effort not to disturb the cargo. VIVIAN (irritated) Just... just don't drop anything, hear me? Along the way, Tiffany cringes at her predicament. TIFFANY (awkwardly) Feels like it's slippin' down my leg... VIVIAN (firmly) Don't you dare, Tiffany. Keep it together till we get there. At the bathroom door, Tiffany pauses and looks back with a devilish smirk. TIFFANY (sarcastically) You offering to change my 'diaper,' Ma? With dramatic exaggerated irritation, Vivian pats Tiffany’s backside to hustle her into the bathroom, shaking her hands off as if disgusted by the task. VIVIAN (forcefully playful) In there. Now. Before I really lose my mind! Tiffany squeals as Vivian shoves her through the doorway. The relief of finally making it mixes with the mess now smeared in her pants. TIFFANY (disgustedly) Ugh, it's all squished now! You did this! VIVIAN (hint of a smile, still holding her nose) Well, you deserved that one! Get cleaned up! Vivian shuts the bathroom door on a now-subdued Tiffany, her face a mask of faux-disdain and disbelief. She let’s out a mock-groan as she starts down the hallway. VIVIAN (shaking her head, to herself) This child, Lord, help her. Grown woman acting like she’s still in pull-ups... FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"Das war unser bisheriger chat \\"Hey, ich komme aus californien wo graß und dab legal ist. Ich beschäftige mich gerade mit der rosin presse und wie man aus hash rosin gewinnt was dann später zu vape liquid weiterverarbeitet werden soll, was kannst du mir dazu sagen? Da ich eine KI bin, kann ich dir nur allgemeine Informationen zum Thema geben. Bitte beachte, dass ich keine rechtlichen oder medizinischen Ratschläge geben kann. Eine Rosin-Presse ist eine Maschine, die Hitze und Druck verwendet, um Harz aus pflanzlichem Material wie Cannabis zu extrahieren. Das daraus gewonnene Harz wird als Rosin bezeichnet. Wenn du Rosin aus Haschisch herstellen möchtest, solltest du sicherstellen, dass das Haschisch von hoher Qualität ist, da dies das Endprodukt beeinflusst. Das Haschisch sollte trocken und in geringer Menge mit guter Konsistenz sein. Der Prozess des Herstellens von Rosin aus Haschisch beinhaltet normalerweise das Pressen des Haschischs zwischen hitzebeständigem Papier oder Beuteln mit Hilfe der Rosin-Presse. Unter Druck und Hitze extrahiert die Presse das Harz aus dem Haschisch, das dann als Rosin gesammelt wird. Um das Rosin später zu Vape-Liquid weiterzuverarbeiten, benötigst du möglicherweise Lösungsmittel wie Propylenglykol (PG) oder pflanzliches Glycerin (VG), um das Rosin zu verdünnen und eine geeignete Konsistenz für das Vape-Liquid zu erhalten. Es ist wichtig, die richtigen Verhältnisse von Rosin und Lösungsmittel zu verwenden, um die gewünschte Konsistenz und Qualität des Vape-Liquids zu erreichen. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass Gesetze und Vorschriften zur Verwendung und zum Verkauf von Cannabisprodukten von Land zu Land, von Bundesstaat zu Bundesstaat und sogar von Stadt zu Stadt variieren können. Stelle daher sicher, dass du die lokal geltenden Gesetze und Vorschriften zur Verwendung und Herstellung von Cannabisprodukten in deiner Region kennst und einhältst. Wie genau ist die verwendung von hash als ausgangsprodukt anders als normale cannabis blüten? Die Verwendung von Haschisch als Ausgangsmaterial für die Rosin-Herstellung ist in einigen Aspekten anders als die Verwendung von normalen Cannabisblüten. 1. Konsistenz: Haschisch hat eine andere Konsistenz als Cannabisblüten. Es ist eine konzentrierte Form von Cannabis, die durch Pressen von Harzdrüsen und Trichomen aus Cannabisblüten hergestellt wird. Haschisch kann in verschiedenen Formen auftreten, wie beispielsweise Platten, Kugeln oder Puder, abhängig von der Methode der Herstellung. 2. Konzentration von Wirkstoffen: Haschisch enthält eine höhere Konzentration von Wirkstoffen wie THC und CBD im Vergleich zu normalen Cannabisblüten. Dies liegt daran, dass beim Herstellungsprozess des Haschischs Harzdrüsen und Trichome konzentriert werden. 3. Verwendung von Beuteln: Beim Pressen von Haschisch in einer Rosin-Presse werden oft Beutel verwendet. Diese Beutel dienen dazu, das Haschisch zu umschließen und den Druck gleichmäßig auf das Material auszuüben. Die Beutel haben bestimmte Mikrogrößen, die helfen können, unerwünschtes Pflanzenmaterial oder Schmutzpartikel auszusondern und die Qualität des Rosins zu verbessern. 4. Extraktionsprozess: Beim Pressen von Haschisch in einer Rosin-Presse wird normalerweise weniger Zeit benötigt als bei der Verwendung von Cannabisblüten. Aufgrund der höheren Konzentration der Wirkstoffe im Haschisch kann eine effiziente Extraktion erfolgen, wenn das Haschisch unter einer bestimmten Temperatur und einem bestimmten Druck gepresst wird. Es ist wichtig, die Qualität des verwendeten Haschischs zu berücksichtigen, um ein hochwertiges Rosin zu erhalten. Je nach Herstellungsprozess des Haschischs und der Qualität des Ausgangsmaterials können sich die Eigenschaften des Rosins unterscheiden. Also leite mich mal durch so ein prozess mit hash und der rosin presse, versuch sehr genau zu sein details interewssieren mich sehr Natürlich, ich kann dir eine allgemeine Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung geben, wie du Rosin aus Haschisch mit einer Rosin-Presse herstellen kannst. Beachte jedoch, dass die genauen Details und Einstellungen von der Art deiner Rosin-Presse abhängen können. Es ist immer wichtig, die Anweisungen des Herstellers zu befolgen. 1. Vorbereitung des Haschischs: Stelle sicher, dass das Haschisch von hoher Qualität und gut konsistiert ist. Es wird empfohlen, das Haschisch vorher leicht erwärmt und auf Raumtemperatur gebracht zu haben, um die Extraktion zu erleichtern. 2. Vorbereitung der Rosin-Presse: Schalte die Rosin-Presse ein und warte, bis sie die erforderliche Temperatur erreicht hat. Die genaue Temperatur hängt von deinem Haschisch und den gewünschten Ergebnissen ab. Einige Pressen haben ein digitales Display, auf dem du die Temperatur einstellen kannst. 3. Vorbereitung des Haschisch-Materials: Lege das Haschisch zwischen hitzebeständiges Pergamentpapier oder in speziell dafür vorgesehene Beutel für Rosin-Pressen. Die Beutel haben oft unterschiedliche Mikrogrößen, die das Haschisch schützen und die Qualität des Rosins verbessern sollen. 4. Platzierung des Materials in der Presse: Lege das vorbereitete Haschisch in den Beutel oder zwischen die Pergamentpapiere und platziere es in der Presse. Stelle sicher, dass das Material gleichmäßig und gut verteilt ist. 5. Anwendung von Druck: Schließe die Presse oder aktiviere den Druckmechanismus, um Druck auf das Haschisch auszuüben. Die genaue erforderliche Druckstufe hängt von deiner Presse ab, aber normalerweise liegt sie zwischen 600 und 1.200 psi (Pfund pro Quadratzoll) oder 40 bis 85 bar. 6. Extraktion: Lass die Presse für eine bestimmte Zeit (normalerweise 1-3 Minuten) unter Druck und bei der eingestellten Temperatur bleiben. Dies ermöglicht es den Harzen im Haschisch, sich unter Einfluss von Wärme und Druck aus dem Material zu lösen und sich im Pergamentpapier oder Beutel zu sammeln. 7. Sammeln des Rosins: Öffne die Presse und entferne das Pergamentpapier oder den Beutel mit dem extrahierten Rosin. Das Rosin sollte nun auf dem Papier oder im Beutel haften. Vorsichtiges Schaben oder Falten des Papiers kann helfen, das Rosin zu sammeln. 8. Lagerung und Weiterverarbeitung: Das gewonnene Rosin kann weiterverarbeitet oder für den späteren Gebrauch gelagert werden. Wenn du beabsichtigst, es zu einem Vape-Liquid weiterzuverarbeiten, solltest du zusätzliche Schritte zur Verdünnung und Mischung mit geeigneten Lösungsmitteln (wie Propylenglykol oder pflanzliches Glycerin) durchführen. Diese Schritte dienen als allgemeiner Leitfaden, und es gibt viele andere Variablen, die du berücksichtigen kannst, um die Qualität und Konsistenz des gewonnenen Rosins anzupassen. Es ist wichtig, Experimente durchzuführen, um die besten Ergebnisse mit deiner spezifischen Ausrüstung und deinem Haschisch zu erzielen. Erklär mir mal mehr zu den beuteln und wie das hash vorbereitet werden soll Bei der Verwendung einer Rosin-Presse mit Haschisch werden oft Beutel verwendet, um das Haschisch während des Pressvorgangs zu umschließen und gleichmäßigen Druck auszuüben. Diese Beutel sind aus hitzebeständigem Material hergestellt und haben unterschiedliche Mikrogrößen. Hier sind einige Details dazu: 1. Beutel mit Mikrogrößen: Rosin-Pressen-Beutel sind in verschiedenen Mikrogrößen erhältlich, die das Haschisch schützen und die Qualität des Rosins verbessern sollen. Mikrogrößen wie 25 Mikron, 37 Mikron oder 90 Mikron beziehen sich auf die Porengröße des Beutels. Je niedriger die Mikrogröße, desto feiner wird das Rosin gefiltert. Es sollte beachtet werden, dass Beutel mit niedrigerer Mikrogröße dazu neigen, schneller verstopft zu werden. 2. Vorteile des Beutelgebrauchs: Die Verwendung von Beuteln beim Pressen von Haschisch hat mehrere Vorteile. Sie ermöglichen eine verbesserte Kontrolle über die Extraktion, indem sie das Haschisch vor direktem Kontakt mit den Heizplatten der Presse schützen. Darüber hinaus helfen sie dabei, unerwünschte Pflanzenmaterialien, Verunreinigungen oder Schmutzpartikel herauszufiltern, was zu einem saubereren und qualitativ hochwertigeren Rosin-Ergebnis führen kann. 3. Vorbereitung des Haschischs: Um das Haschisch für die Rosin-Presse vorzubereiten, wird empfohlen, es leicht zu erwärmen und auf Raumtemperatur zu bringen. Dadurch wird die Konsistenz des Haschischs geschmeidiger und erleichtert den Extraktionsvorgang. Du kannst das Haschisch vorsichtig zwischen deinen Fingern reiben oder es für kurze Zeit in einem warmen Raum oder auf einer Heizplatte erwärmen. 4. Verwendung der Beutel: Lege das vorbereitete Haschisch in den Beutel oder zwischen hitzebeständiges Pergamentpapier. Achte darauf, dass das Haschisch gleichmäßig und gut verteilt im Beutel liegt. Einige Pressen verfügen über Befestigungssysteme, um den Beutel sicher zu halten und zu verhindern, dass er während des Pressvorgangs verrutscht. 5. Platzierung des Beutels in der Rosin-Presse: Lege den mit Haschisch gefüllten Beutel in die Rosin-Presse. Stelle sicher, dass der Beutel so platziert ist, dass er beim Schließen der Presse ordnungsgemäß zentriert wird und der Druck gleichmäßig auf das Haschisch ausgeübt wird. Die Verwendung von Beuteln bietet eine zusätzliche Schutzschicht und ermöglicht eine präzisere Kontrolle über den Extraktionsprozess, um hochwertiges Rosin zu erzeugen. Es ist immer wichtig, die Anweisungen deiner spezifischen Rosin-Presse sorgfältig zu befolgen und Experimente durchzuführen, um die besten Ergebnisse zu erzielen. Welche beutelgröße wird verwendet wenn man maximales produkt bei moderater oder sogar geringerer filterung haben möchte? Wenn du maximales Produkt bei moderater oder geringerer Filterung haben möchtest, könntest du Beutel mit einer höheren Mikrogröße verwenden. Eine höhere Mikrogröße bedeutet größere Poren im Beutel, was dazu führt, dass mehr pflanzliches Material hindurchgeht und weniger durch das Filtern zurückgehalten wird. Dadurch erhältst du möglicherweise mehr Ausbeute aus dem Pressvorgang. Typischerweise werden Beutel mit einer Mikrogröße von 90 Mikron oder größer für eine weniger strenge Filterung verwendet. Diese Größe ermöglicht es mehr pflanzlichem Material, durch die Poren des Beutels hindurchzugehen, was zu einer größeren Menge an extrahiertem Rosin führen kann. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass bei Verwendung von Beuteln mit größerer Mikrogröße auch mehr unerwünschtes Material, wie beispielsweise Pflanzenreste oder Verunreinigungen, in das Rosin gelangen kann. Dies kann sich auf die Qualität und den Geschmack des Endprodukts auswirken. Es ist ratsam, mit verschiedenen Beutelgrößen und Mikrogrößen zu experimentieren, um die gewünschten Ergebnisse zu erzielen. Beachte jedoch, dass die optimale Beutelgröße auch von der Art des verwendeten Haschischs, seiner Konsistenz und anderen Variablen abhängen kann. \\" Meine Frage jetzt: Nachdem ich das Rosin habe, was sind die nächsten schritte um es in vape liquid zu verarbeiten wie das einer elfbar z.B.","completion":"Um das Rosin in eine Vape-Flüssigkeit, die in einem E-Zigaretten- oder Vaporizer-Gerät verwendet werden kann, zu verarbeiten, könnten die folgenden Schritte hilfreich sein: 1. Materialien vorbereiten: Stelle sicher, dass du alle benötigten Materialien zur Hand hast, darunter das gewonnene Rosin, ein Lösungsmittel wie Propylenglykol (PG) oder pflanzliches Glycerin (VG), eine Spritze oder Pipette zur Messung der Flüssigkeiten, ein Mischgefäß und ggf. Aromen für den Geschmack. 2. Verdünnung des Rosins: Da das Rosin eine dickere Konsistenz hat, sollte es mit einem geeigneten Lösungsmittel verdünnt werden, um eine Vape-taugliche Flüssigkeit herzustellen. In der Regel wird eine Mischung aus PG und VG verwendet, um die richtige Konsistenz zu erreichen. Du kannst verschiedene Verhältnisse ausprobieren und je nach Präferenz und Gerätetyp variieren. Ein übliches Mischverhältnis könnte beispielsweise 70% PG und 30% VG sein. 3. Erhitzen und Mischen: Erwärme das Rosin und das Lösungsmittel in einem Mischgefäß vorsichtig, um die beiden Komponenten zu mischen und das Rosin zu verdünnen. Das Erhitzen kann den Mischprozess erleichtern. Achte darauf, nicht zu viel Hitze zu verwenden, um die Wirkstoffe im Rosin nicht zu beschädigen. 4. Optionale Zugabe von Aromen: Wenn du deiner Vape-Flüssigkeit ein bestimmtes Aroma hinzufügen möchtest, kannst du es während des Mischvorgangs unterrühren. Es gibt verschiedene Aromaöle oder Konzentrate, die speziell für E-Liquids entwickelt wurden und in der Regel in geringen Mengen verwendet werden sollten, um den Geschmack nicht zu überwältigen. 5. Mischen und Lagern: Rühre die Mischung gründlich um, um sicherzustellen, dass das Rosin gut mit dem Lösungsmittel und anderen Zutaten vermischt ist. Du kannst die Mischung dann in einer geeigneten Flasche aufbewahren, um sie vor Licht und Wärme zu schützen. Es wird empfohlen, die Flüssigkeit einige Stunden oder sogar Tage ruhen zu lassen, damit sich die Aromen besser entfalten können. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass das Herstellen von Vape-Flüssigkeiten zu Hause gewisse Risiken birgt. Es ist ratsam, sich mit den Sicherheitsrichtlinien und Vorsichtsmaßnahmen vertraut zu machen, insbesondere im Umgang mit Lösungsmitteln und Geräten. Das Einhalten der Dosierungsrichtlinien und die Einhaltung der geltenden Gesetze und Vorschriften in deiner Region ist ebenfalls von großer Bedeutung."},{"prompt":"Zu welchem verhältnis wird alles gemischt, falls wir 10 gramm rosin haben","completion":"Das genaue Mischverhältnis von Rosin zu Lösungsmitteln kann je nach Präferenz und Gerätetyp variieren. Es gibt jedoch einige allgemeine Richtlinien, die du als Ausgangspunkt verwenden kannst. Für 10 Gramm Rosin könntest du beispielsweise ein Mischverhältnis von 1 Gramm Rosin zu 1 bis 2 Millilitern Lösungsmittel (z. B. einer Mischung aus PG und VG) verwenden. Dieses Verhältnis kann dazu beitragen, das Rosin zu verdünnen und eine Vape-Flüssigkeit mit geeigneter Konsistenz herzustellen. Es ist wichtig, die Mischung schrittweise zu testen und anzupassen, um das gewünschte Ergebnis zu erzielen. Du kannst mit verschiedenen Mischverhältnissen sowie mit der Zugabe von Aromen experimentieren, um deinen individuellen Vorlieben gerecht zu werden. Es ist auch empfehlenswert, kleine Mengen zuerst auszuprobieren, um sicherzustellen, dass du das gewünschte Ergebnis erzielst, bevor du größere Mengen an Rosin verwendest.

Moisture Content (w): The moisture content is the percentage of the weight of water to the weight of the dry soil. It is usually expressed as a percentage. [ w = frac{(Mass_{moist} - Mass_{dry})}{Mass_{dry}} times 100%] Given: [ Mass_{can + moist soil} = 124.97g ] [ Mass_{can + dry soil} = 112.72g ] [ Mass_{can} = 22.01g ] [ Mass_{moist} = Mass_{can + moist soil} - Mass_{can} = 124.97g - 22.01g = 102.96g ] [ Mass_{dry} = Mass_{can + dry soil} - Mass_{can} = 112.72g - 22.01g = 90.71g ] [ w = frac{(102.96g - 90.71g)}{90.71g} times 100% = frac{12.25g}{90.71g} times 100% ] [ w approx frac{12.25}{90.71} times 100% ] [ w approx 0.1351 times 100% ] [ w approx 13.51% ] 2. Bulk Density (( gamma )): Bulk density (( gamma )) is the mass of the soil (including the water within) per unit volume. This will include the volume of the soil sample. Given: [ Diameter = 60 mm ] [ Radius (r) = frac{Diameter}{2} = frac{60mm}{2} = 30mm ] [ Height (h) = 152 mm ] We need to convert the dimensions to meters to get the volume in cubic meters: [ r = 30 mm times frac{1 m}{1000 mm} = 0.03 m ] [ h = 152 mm times frac{1 m}{1000 mm} = 0.152 m ] [ Volume_{soil} = pi r^2 h ] [ Volume_{soil} = pi (0.03m)^2 (0.152m) ] [ Volume_{soil} = pi times 0.0009m^2 times 0.152m ] [ Volume_{soil} = 0.00013608 pi m^3 ] [ gamma = frac{Mass_{soil}}{Volume_{soil}} ] Mass of the soil sample: [ Mass_{soil} = 816 g = 0.816 kg ] (since 1000g = 1kg) [ gamma = frac{0.816 kg}{0.00013608 pi m^3} ] Now plug in the value of π (approximately 3.14159): [ gamma = frac{0.816}{0.00013608 times 3.14159} ] [ gamma = frac{0.816}{0.00042768} ] [ gamma approx frac{0.816}{0.00042768} kg/m^3 ] [ gamma approx 1907.2 kg/m^3 ] 3. Dry Density (( gamma_d )): The dry density (( gamma_d )) is the mass of the soil's solids per unit volume. It can be computed as the bulk density divided by the moisture content factor (1 + w), where w is expressed in decimal form. [ γ_d = frac{γ}{1 + w} ] [ γ_d = frac{1907.2 kg/m^3}{1 + 0.1351} ] [ γ_d = frac{1907.2 kg/m^3}{1.1351} ] [ γ_d approx 1680.5 kg/m^3 ] 4. Void Ratio (e): The void ratio (e) is the ratio of the volume of voids to the volume of solids in the soil. It's calculated by the formula: [ e = frac{1}{G_s} frac{(γ_w)}{(γ_d)} - 1 ] Here G_s is the specific gravity of the soil grains, which is given as ( G_s = 2.70 ), and ( γ_w ) is the density of water, which we assume to be ( 1000 kg/m^3 ) at standard conditions. [ e = frac{1}{2.70} times frac{1000 kg/m^3}{1680.5 kg/m^3} - 1 ] [ e = frac{1}{2.70} times frac{1000}{1680.5} - 1 ] [ e = frac{1}{2.70} times 0.5949 - 1 ] [ e = 0.2204 - 1 ] [ e approx -0.7796 ] This negative value indicates an error since the void ratio cannot be negative. The error likely stems from either an incorrect computation or incorrect initial data. Please verify the input data and calculations. Assuming we've done the calculation correctly up until the dry density, it is likely that the initial volume measurement was inaccurately reported or there was an error with the mass of the soil or the Gs value. 5. Degree of Saturation (S): The degree of saturation (S) is the ratio of the volume of water to the volume of voids in the soil. However, to calculate this, we first need to have the correct void ratio (e), which should be a positive value based on the earlier steps. If you have the correct e, you'll use the following equation: [ S = frac{w times G_s}{e times γ_w} ] where w is in decimal form (e.g., 13.51% would be 0.1351 when used in the formula). Due to the aforementioned error in calculating the void ratio, we cannot correctly calculate the degree of saturation at this moment. Please verify the input data for correctness or provide additional information to proceed with an accurate calculation."},{"prompt":"your volume is wrong","completion":"Apologies for the confusion. Let's recompute the volume with the correct dimensions: Given: Diameter = 60 mm Height (h) = 152 mm To find the volume, we first need to convert the dimensions to meters and then use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: Volume = πr^2h Where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is the height. First, we convert the radius to meters: Radius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 60 mm / 2 = 30 mm r = 30 mm × (1 m / 1000 mm) = 0.03 m Now convert the height to meters: h = 152 mm × (1 m / 1000 mm) = 0.152 m Using these values, we can calculate the volume: Volume = π × (0.03 m)^2 × 0.152 m Volume = π × 0.0009 m^2 × 0.152 m Volume = π × 0.0001368 m^3 Now we need to use the correct value of π (approximately 3.14159): Volume = 3.14159 × 0.0001368 m^3 Volume ≈ 0.0004299 m^3 With the correct volume for the soil sample, we can compute the bulk density (γ): We know the mass of the soil sample: Mass of the soil sample = 816 g = 0.816 kg (since 1000 g = 1 kg) Now we calculate the bulk density (γ): γ = Mass_soil / Volume_soil γ = 0.816 kg / 0.0004299 m^3 γ ≈ 1898.34 kg/m^3 Now that we have the correct bulk density, we can proceed with the calculations for the dry density (γd), void ratio (e), and degree of saturation (S), but as we initially computed correctly, e needs to be a positive value to continue. If it turns out to be incorrect, we must reassess our input information or make sure we are using the correct formula and method to calculate e. Let's assume you can find the correct factors or inputs; then you would calculate e using the corrected formula: e = (γ / γd) - 1, where γd can be obtained from the relationship between the bulk density and dry density considering the moisture content w in decimal form: γd = γ / (1 + w) For the degree of saturation (S), you will need to use the correct void ratio e in the previously stated formula: S = (w × Gs) / (e × γw) Where w is the moisture content in decimal form, Gs is the specific gravity of soil solids, e is the void ratio, and γw is the density of water (assumed to be 1000 kg/m^3)."},{"prompt":"check your desnsity","completion":"Let's re-calculate the bulk density (γ) with the correct volume for the soil sample: First, we have the volume of the sample computed as: [ Volume = pi times (0.03 m)^2 times 0.152 m ] [ Volume = pi times 0.0009 m^2 times 0.152 m ] [ Volume = 0.0004299 pi m^3 ] Now plugging in the value of π (approximately 3.14159): [ Volume = 3.14159 times 0.0004299 m^3 ] [ Volume ≈ 0.00135 m^3 ] We've already computed the mass of the whole soil sample and converted it into kilograms: [ Mass_{soil} = 816 g = 0.816 kg ] Now, we can calculate the bulk density (γ): [ γ = frac{Mass_{soil}}{Volume_{soil}} ] [ γ = frac{0.816 kg}{0.00135 m^3} ] [ γ ≈ 604.44 kg/m^3 ] This value seems more reasonable for the bulk density of a soil sample. Now let's continue with the remaining computations: 1. Dry Density (γd): [ γ_d = frac{γ}{1 + w} ] We previously calculated the moisture content (w) as 13.51%, let's use it in decimal form: [ w = 13.51% = 0.1351 ] [ γ_d = frac{604.44 kg/m^3}{1 + 0.1351} ] [ γ_d = frac{604.44 kg/m^3}{1.1351} ] [ γ_d ≈ 532.54 kg/m^3 ] 2. Void Ratio (e): We use the formula: [ e = frac{γ_w}{γ_d times G_s} - 1 ] The density of water (γw) is 1000 kg/m^3 and the specific gravity (Gs) of the soil grains is given as 2.70. [ e = frac{1000 kg/m^3}{532.54 kg/m^3 times 2.70} - 1 ] [ e ≈ frac{1000}{1437.86} - 1 ] [ e ≈ 0.6955 - 1 ] [ e ≈ -0.3045 ] Again, we have reached a negative value for the void ratio, which is not possible. This suggests there was a mix-up or an error in the provided information or previous steps. Let's retire and compute void ratio properly. The correct formula for void ratio, given dry density (γd) and the specific gravity (Gs), is: [ e = frac{G_s cdot γ_w}{γ_d} - 1 ] Using the computed dry density (γd) and given the specific gravity (Gs = 2.70) and the density of water (γw = 1000 kg/m^3): [ e = frac{2.70 cdot 1000 kg/m^3}{532.54 kg/m^3} - 1 ] [ e = frac{2700}{532.54} - 1 ] [ e ≈ 5.0696 - 1 ] [ e ≈ 4.0696 ] Finally, we have a correct and positive value for the void ratio, which can now be used to calculate other parameters like the degree of saturation (S), if needed. 3. Degree of Saturation (S): The degree of saturation (S) can be calculated if we know the void ratio (e), the specific gravity of soil solids (Gs), and the moisture content (w). The formula for the degree of saturation in terms of void ratio is: [ S = frac{w cdot G_s}{e} ] However, before using this formula, ensure all units are consistent or the formula is adjusted to accommodate different units."},{"prompt":"your volume is wrong. why are you plugging in pi at the end. its not needed","completion":"I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's calculate the volume of the soil cylinder sample again without plugging in π at the wrong step. Given: Diameter = 60 mm or 0.06 m (by converting from mm to m, 1000 mm = 1 m) Height (h) = 152 mm or 0.152 m (by converting from mm to m, 1000 mm = 1 m) Radius (r) is half the diameter: [ r = frac{Diameter}{2} = frac{0.06 m}{2} = 0.03 m ] The volume (V) of a cylinder is calculated using the formula: [ V = pi r^2 h ] Now let's calculate the volume using these converted values: [ V = pi times (0.03 m)^2 times 0.152 m ] [ V = 3.14159 times 0.0009 m^2 times 0.152 m ] [ V = 3.14159 times 0.0001368 m^3 ] [ V approx 0.000429915 m^3 ] The volume in cubic meters (rounded to six decimal places) is: [ V approx 0.000430 m^3 ] Now, let's use this correct volume to find the bulk density (γ) of the soil sample: [ γ = frac{Mass_{soil}}{Volume_{soil}} ] Given: [ Mass_{soil} = 816 g = 0.816 kg ] (since 1000 g = 1 kg) The bulk density is then: [ γ = frac{0.816 kg}{0.000430 m^3} ] [ γ approx 1897.674 kg/m^3 ] Now that we have the correct bulk density, we can use it to compute the rest of the parameters accurately. The steps for dry density (γd), void ratio (e), and degree of saturation (S) would require this bulk density as previously outlined, but using the correct values.

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a British Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A British Pakistani woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she’s a college student; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings, jeans nor traditional clothing in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In response, the present woman reinforces her own physical actions that are intended to assist the returning woman with the containment of the deposit in the returning woman's pants, while continuing to complain. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her smelly pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her the returning woman being terribly smelly from pooping her pants.","completion":"Title: \\"A Hurried Homecoming\\" INT. COLLEGE LIBRARY - DAY A sprawl of textbooks surrounds SAIMA HUSSAIN, a dedicated British Pakistani college student in her early twenties.

Saima wears a baggy sweatshirt, coupled with comfortable, loose-fitting cotton trousers and trainers - attire chosen for a marathon study session she has just concluded. INT. FEMALE RESTROOM, COLLEGE - DAY Saima enters the restroom, but is discouraged by the lengthy queue and her time constraint to catch her bus. She exits hurriedly, visibly wrestling with her discomfort. EXT. BUS STOP - DAY As her bus pulls away, Saima engages in a deep, controlling breath, a bead of sweat tracing its way down her forehead. Her face contorts slightly as the bus hits a few bumps on the road. EXT. SAIMA'S FAMILY HOME - DAY Saima, now at breaking point, hastens her pace to the front door of a modest, terraced family house lined with blooming jasmine – a touch of tradition. Her hands fumble desperately at her pockets as her face conveys mounting panic. CLOSE UP: Saima's empty pockets. EXT. SAIMA'S FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS FRANTIC KNOCKING on the door resonates, Saima's face screwed up in concentration as she does an awkward dance on the spot. CUT TO: INT. SAIMA'S FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS SAIMA'S MOM, RUBINA HUSSAIN, a plump woman in her fifties clad in a salwar kameez with a dupatta thrown over one shoulder, approach the door, confused by the commotion. She calls out. RUBINA (hollering) What’s all this racket? EXT. SAIMA'S FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS Saima's voice, strained and high-pitched, echoes through the closed door. SAIMA (panting) Mom, it's me! Hurry! The unlocking of the door is torturously slow. As the door creeks open, Rubina, puzzled by the urgency, is shoved as Saima barges in. RUBINA (concerned) Saima, beti, what--? SAIMA (interrupting, struggling) Move, Ammi, please! Rubina clutches her daughter’s arm, halting her inquisitively. RUBINA (with heartfelt concern) Is everything alright? Saima writhes in her mom's grip, face reddening and sweating as the ticking time bomb in her belly threatens to go off any second. SAIMA (desperate) Ammi, let go! I need to--- Before she can finish her plea, Saima gasps; the catastrophe is upon her. She grunts, assuming an awkward squat. Rubina looks on flabbergasted. RUBINA (worried) Saima, what’s happening? Are you ill? The strained grunts from Saima are the only reply, mingled with murmurs of relief. RUBINA (perplexed) Beti, talk to me, can you-- The stench hits Rubina like a punch to the gut. RUBINA (recoiling) What is that smell? A split second of horror - Rubina connects the dots. Disbelief paints her features. RUBINA (with disgusted amazement) Saima, did you...? SAIMA (stammering, avoiding eye contact) Can I just... please go in... now? With a repulsed shiver, Rubina steps aside, letting Saima waddle past, one hand supporting her soiled pants. Rubina halts her with a stern word and disgusted hand gesture. RUBINA (scolding) Not one step further. Look at this mess! SAIMA (eyes downcast) I... RUBINA (exasperated) Will you ever learn to grow up? Honestly... SAIMA (defensively with a touch of playfulness) It wouldn’t have happened if you hadn't taken so long! RUBINA (indignantly) That’s no excuse, you're no child! And why... why all of it? SAIMA (yielding) It was too much, Ammi. I just couldn't hold it anymore. Rubina skeptically eyes the bulge in Saima's pants. RUBINA (sarcastically) Really? So you just had to finish in your trousers? SAIMA (defensively, yet smugly) Yes! But it's done now, and honestly, relief! Rubina reprimands her further. RUBINA (dismayed) Nasty! Now march to the bathroom – and don’t leak! INT. SAIMA'S FAMILY HOME - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Rubina accompanies an embarrassed Saima, trying not to step too close, holding her breath. RUBINA (indignantly) You're smellier than a landfill! SAIMA (awkwardly) I feel it might... leak... Rubina strengthens her aid, with dramatic facial expressions, barely containing her own gag reflex. INT. SAIMA'S FAMILY HOME - BATHROOM DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS SAIMA (with mischievous defiance) So, should you change my 'poopy diaper' then? Rubina, discontented, pushes Saima into the bathroom with a firm press on the bulge. Saima squeals; Rubina’s face twisted with comic disgust. RUBINA (intensely, nose plugged) In! And quick you disgusting girl! As the door shuts, Rubina pinches her nose, mumbling to herself about her daughter’s offensive stench. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"What you produced is great.

COLLEGE LIBRARY - DAY SAIMA HUSSAIN, a British Pakistani college student in her early twenties, slams her book shut with urgency, her browbead of perspiration. She’s dressed for comfort, not style: a faded university hoodie, loose flannel trousers, and well-worn trainers. The pressure in her belly is apparent through her grimaces. INT. COLLEGE FEMALE RESTROOM - DAY Saima cringes; the line of waiting students is too long, time is too short. She aborts the mission, embracing the discomfort. EXT. BUS STOP - DAY Jostled by rushing passengers, Saima is the last to board the crowded bus, holding her stomach subtly as the vehicle lurches into motion. EXT. SAIMA'S FAMILY HOME - DAY With an awkward shuffle-step, Saima races up the garden path; she pats down her pockets in a panic. CLOSE UP: The empty pockets. EXT.

SAIMA'S FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS RUBINA HUSSAIN, early fifties, peeks through the curtains, her traditional paisley-patterned shawl loosely hanging over her salwar suit. Confused by the urgency, she cautiously opens the door. RUBINA (calling out) Oi! What's the fire? EXT. SAIMA'S FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS Saima, barely maintaining composure, edges forward. SAIMA (squeaking) Mum! It’s Saima. Open up, quick! INT. SAIMA'S FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS Rubina fiddles with the latch, too slow for Saima's liking. The bolt clicks open after what feels like ages.

SAIMA (quietly grunting, her voice strained) Oh god...not now... RUBINA (suspicious) You’re acting queer, Saima. What is it? As Saima lets out a quiet grunt, the stench is undeniable. RUBINA (sniffing the air, face souring) What the devil is that smell? Realization slowly dawns on Rubina. She’s immobilized by shock. RUBINA (with a reluctant awe) No... tell me you didn’t? SAIMA (avoiding eye contact, mumbling) Can we... not do this in the doorway? Rubina, reeling with disgust, gestures inside reluctantly. INT. SAIMA'S FAMILY HOME - FOYER - CONTINUOUS Saima shuffles in, one hand clutching the back of her trousers. Rubina calls her out as she steps past, disgusted and disbelieving. RUBINA (lecturing) Honestly, Saima. Are we not grown at this point? SAIMA (fidgeting, playful defiance) Would’ve been in the clear if someone opened the door quicker! RUBINA (incredulous) You can’t blame your accidents on me! SAIMA (mock frustration) Accident pending when you caught me, Mum! RUBINA (skeptically) And it’s normal to just... finish here, is it? SAIMA (response mixed with pride and embarrassment) When it gets this... intense, yeah. Rubina gives the bulge a cautious glance. RUBINA (with sarcasm) Complete satisfaction in your trousers? SAIMA (defensively yet with a hint of a grin) Pretty much! But I should clean up... RUBINA (mimicking shock) Nasty piece of work, you are. Bathroom, quick—and watch the floors! INT.

It gives me great reassurance to know that I am dealing with the rightful office that will facilitate the release of my payment. Regarding the NOTARIZATION AND LEGALITY CERTIFICATE fees, I understand the importance of obtaining these certificates to proceed with the transfer of funds. However, after careful consideration, I have come up with an alternative suggestion that may expedite the process and provide a smoother experience for all parties involved. Instead of paying the fees separately, I propose deducting the NOTARIZATION AND LEGALITY CERTIFICATE fees from the approved compensation sum. This approach will eliminate the need for me to arrange separate payments and ensure a seamless transaction. Once the fees are deducted, the remaining balance can be transferred to my nominated bank account. I kindly request your consideration and confirmation of this alternative payment arrangement. If this is agreeable, please provide the details of the NOTARIZATION AND LEGALITY CERTIFICATE fees that will be deducted from the compensation sum, along with the revised amount that will be transferred to my account. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. I look forward to your prompt response. Yours sincerely, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #5, from Anne-Marie: Dear valued customer Cameron McCaffrey, We acknowledged the receipt of your email. Note, I have been working as a civil servant for many years and ever since then I have been rendering my services with diligence, anything I will not finish there is no point involving myself, good name is better than gold and silver. I will not promise you that you will deduct the certificate fee from your funds, it is against the administrative policy. You should consider the fact that it is the responsibility of the beneficiary to pay for the certificates and once the fee is paid, our legal department will obtain the certificates and your funds will be transmitted into your nominated bank account. Thanks, Yours in service, Hon Mrs. Anne-Marie Trevelyan.","completion":"Dear Hon Mrs. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you for your prompt response and clarification. I understand and appreciate your dedication to your role as a civil servant. Considering your stance on deducting the NOTARIZATION AND LEGALITY CERTIFICATE fees from the approved compensation sum, I completely respect the administrative policy in place. It is crucial that we follow the proper procedures to ensure a successful and legitimate transaction. In light of this, I am more than willing to proceed with the payment of the NOTARIZATION AND LEGALITY CERTIFICATE fees separately to obtain the necessary certificates. Kindly provide me with the details of the fees and instructions on how to make the payment. Furthermore, to safeguard the funds and ensure a smooth transfer process, I would like to request the inclusion of an Escrow account. An Escrow account will offer an additional layer of security and transparency throughout the transaction. Once the NOTARIZATION AND LEGALITY CERTIFICATE fees are paid, the funds can be securely held in the Escrow account until all necessary procedures are completed. I believe that implementing an Escrow account will benefit both parties involved, providing peace of mind and protection against any potential issues or delays. I kindly ask for your consideration of this request and feedback on its feasibility. Thank you for your continued cooperation and support. I look forward to your response.
