The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since.

Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. on July 14, 1913, at 3202 Woolworth Avenue in Omaha, Nebraska, where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents. His mother was Dorothy Ayer Gardner and his father was Leslie Lynch King Sr., a wool trader and a son of prominent banker Charles Henry King and Martha Alicia King (nee Porter). Gardner separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to the Oak Park, Illinois, home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James. To become House Speaker, Ford worked to help Republicans across the country get a majority in the chamber, often traveling on the rubber chicken circuit. After a decade of failing to do so, he promised his wife that he would try again in 1974 then retire in 1976. On October 10, 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned and then pleaded no contest to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering, part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme in which he accepted 29,500 in bribes while governor of Maryland. According to The New York Times, Nixon \\"sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement.\\" The advice was unanimous. \\"We gave Nixon no choice but Ford,\\" House Speaker Carl Albert recalled later. Ford agreed to the nomination, telling his wife that the Vice Presidency would be \\"a nice conclusion\\" to his career. Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the 25th Amendment had been implemented. The United States Senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. Only three Senators, all Democrats, voted against Ford's confirmation: Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, Thomas Eagleton of Missouri and William Hathaway of Maine. On December 6, 1973, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. One hour after the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States. Ford became Vice President as the Watergate scandal was unfolding. On Thursday, August 1, 1974, Chief of Staff Alexander Haig contacted Ford to tell him that \\"smoking gun\\" evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had been a part of the Watergate cover-up. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice president's residence in Washington, D.C. However, \\"Al Haig asked to come over and see me,\\" Ford later said, \\"to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.'

Information: - A fixed-wing aircraft is an aircraft, such as an aeroplane, which is capable of flight using wings that generate lift caused by the vehicle's forward airspeed and the shape of the wings. Fixed-wing aircraft are distinct from rotary-wing aircraft, in which the wings form a rotor mounted on a spinning shaft, and ornithopters, in which the wings flap in similar manner to a bird. - General Dynamics Corporation is an American aerospace and defense multinational corporation. Formed by mergers and divestitures, it is the world's fifth-largest defense contractor based on 2012 revenues. General Dynamics is headquartered in West Falls Church, Fairfax County, Virginia. - In military tactics, close air support (CAS) is defined as air action by fixed or rotary-winged aircraft against hostile targets, that are in close proximity to friendly forces, and which requires detailed integration of each air mission with fire and movement of these forces. - In the broadest definition, a sensor is an object whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and sends the information to the computer which then tells the actuator (output devices) to provide the corresponding output. A sensor is a device that converts real world data (Analog) into data that a computer can understand using ADC (Analog to Digital converter) - A fire-control system is a number of components working together, usually a gun data computer, a director, and radar, which is designed to assist a weapon system in hitting its target. It performs the same task as a human gunner firing a weapon, but attempts to do so faster and more accurately. - The Lockheed AC-130 gunship is a heavily armed, long-endurance ground-attack variant of the C-130 Hercules transport fixed-wing aircraft. It carries a wide array of anti-ground oriented weapons that are integrated with sophisticated sensors, navigation, and fire-control systems. Unlike other military fixed-wing aircraft, the AC-130 relies on visual targeting. Because its large profile and low operating altitudes (around 7,000 ft) make it an easy target, it usually flies close air support missions at night. - Navigation is a field of study that focuses on the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another. The field of navigation includes four general categories: land navigation, marine navigation, aeronautic navigation, and space navigation. - The General Dynamics GAU - 12/U Equalizer is a five - barrel 25 mm Gatling - type rotary cannon . The GAU - 12/U is used by the United States , Italy and Spain , which mount the weapon in their fighter jets such as the AV - 8B Harrier II , airborne gunships such as the Lockheed AC - 130 , and land - based fighting vehicles . - An 'electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The reverse of this is the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and is done by an electric generator. - A multinational corporation\\"\\" or worldwide Enterprise is a corporate organization that owns or controls production of goods or services in one or more countries other than their home country. It can also be referred as an international corporation, a transnational corporation, or a stateless corporation. - A gunship is a military aircraft armed with heavy guns, primarily intended for attacking ground targets. - A rotary cannon, rotary autocannon, or Gatling-type cannon is a rapid-firing weapon that utilizes multiple barrels in a rotating cluster to provide a sustained rate of fire greater than single-barreled machine guns or automatic cannon of equivalent caliber. The loading, firing, and unloading functions are performed simultaneously in different barrels as they rotate, and the rotation also permits the barrels some time to cool. The rotating barrel cluster on most Gatling-type guns is powered by an external force such as an electric motor, although gas-operated versions have also been developed. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - A cannon (plural: \\"cannon\\" or \\"cannons\\") is any piece of artillery that uses gunpowder or other usually explosive-based propellants to launch a projectile, which may or may not be explosive. Cannon vary in calibre, range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire, and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield. The word \\"cannon\\" is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as \\"tube\\", \\"cane\\", or \\"reed\\". In the modern era, the term \\"cannon\\" has fallen into decline, replaced by \\"guns\\" or \\"artillery\\" if not a more specific term such as \\"gun\\", \\"mortar\\" or \\"howitzer\\", except for in the field of aerial warfare, where it is often used as shorthand for autocannon.

You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonX wants what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, wanting is a postcondition desire on the part of PersonX, respectively. As a result of PersonX giving PersonY gifts, PersonX may also desire to hug PersonY. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Head: PersonX asks PersonX's grandma<sep>Tail: To get something Student:","completion":"In this task, we need to determine if PersonX wants what is mentioned in the Tail as a result of the event in the Head. We will classify the answer as either \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". The Head event involves PersonX doing something, while the Tail event describes what PersonX might want. Instance: Head: PersonX asks PersonX's grandma<sep>Tail: To get something To solve this instance, we need to see if PersonX, as a result of asking their grandma (Head), wants to get something (Tail). Answer: Yes Explanation: In this scenario, since PersonX asks their grandma for something, it implies that PersonX wants to get that something. Therefore, the answer is \\"Yes\\"."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Život vašeho bratra je v ohrožení.

Choices: - brain - tissue - tumor - blood A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"- blood Parasitic leeches feed off of the blood of their host organism. They attach themselves to their host using suckers and then pierce the skin with small, sharp teeth. Leeches secrete an anticoagulant to prevent the blood from clotting while they feed, allowing them to consume the blood efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Look over your sculpture and think about the different materials that would make up that object in real life (flesh, hair, fabric, stone, grass, fur, etc). On your original sketch or on an entirely new one, map out what textures go where. Do some research. Look at lots of pictures of those types of textures to figure out how they work. You'd be surprised how complex it can be. Fur, for example, grows in chunks and you'll have to pay attention to the length, organization, and direction of every chunk. Begin to texture your sculpture, one section at a time, using traditional or improvised tools. Only a very limited number of sculpting tools are needed and most can be improvised from common household objects. You will have to experiment to find out what works best for you, as almost every sculptor uses their tools differently. Generally with sculpting tools, large tips are used to create the broad details, while finer tips are used to create details. Scoop-like tools create rounded areas. Tools with a loop are used to scrape away the material. Anything with a sharp edge can be used to cut. Tools can be improvised from: balls of tin foil, black peppercorn, toothpicks, x-acto knives, a toothbrush, a steel ball chain necklace, a comb, knitting needles, crochet hooks, large and small sewing needles, cookie cutters, melon ballers, etc. Once you're done with all of the major clay work, you'll need to cure your sculpture to make it hard (if you want it hard...if not, ignore). Different clays need to be cured in different ways (air dry, bake, etc), so follow the manufacturer's instructions for the clay you use. It is generally better to under-bake (use a low temperature for longer periods of time, if you can), to avoid burning. Summary:","completion":"To make a sculpture, first, think about the real-life materials you want to use, like hair, fur, or stone. Draw a picture to plan where each texture goes. Look at photos of real textures to understand how they work. Start adding textures to your sculpture one by one, using special or normal tools you find at home. Big tools make big details, small tools make little details, and loop tools can scrape material away. You can use things like toothpicks, toothbrushes, or knitting needles as tools. When you finish, follow the instructions to make your sculpture hard. Use low heat and more time if you can, so you don't burn it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Shortly after, the Iron Giant wanders off into the mainland. Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes follows a trail of the forest's destruction and frees the robot, who is stuck in the power cables of an electrical substation. After being rescued by and befriended by Hogarth, the Giant follows him back to his house, where he lives with his widowed mother Annie. Upon their return, the Giant attempts to eat the rails off the ties of the nearby railroad tracks. Alarmed by the sound of an oncoming train, Hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. The Giant attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head. Hogarth hides the damaged robot in their barn where he discovers the robot is self repairing.Later that night, Hogarth returns to the barn with a stack of comic books to read to the Giant. The Giant is impressed with Superman, but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; Hogarth tells the Giant that he can be \\"who you choose to be\\". Investigating the destroyed substation, U.S. government agent Kent Mansley discovers evidence of the Giant and decides to continue his inquiries in nearby Rockwell. Finding a BB gun Hogarth left near the substation the night he found the Giant, Mansley takes up a room for rent at Hogarth's home and trails the boy to learn more. He is paranoid about an alien invasion and alerts the U.S. Army to the possible presence of the Giant. Worried that they will get caught, Hogarth evades Mansley and takes the Giant to beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who passes off the robot as one of his works of scrap-metal art when Mansley and Lieutenant General Guy Rogard investigate. Once Mansley and Rogard are gone, Hogarth plays with the Giant using a toy gun, but inadvertently causes the Giant to activate a defence mechanism.

She works for a bookmaker, Bobo Justus (Pat Hingle), making large cash bets at race tracks to lower the odds of longshots. On her way to La Jolla for the horse races, she stops in Los Angeles to visit her son Roy (John Cusack), a small-time grifter whom she has not seen in eight years. She finds him in pain and bleeding internally after one of his victims caught him pulling a petty scam and punched him in the stomach. When medical assistance finally comes, Lilly confronts the doctor, threatening to have him killed if her son dies. At the hospital, Lilly meets and takes an instant dislike to Roy's girlfriend, Myra Langtry (Annette Bening), who is a few years older than her son. Lilly urges her son to quit the grift, saying he literally does not have the stomach for it. Because she leaves late for La Jolla, she misses a race where the winner was paying 70â1. For this mistake, Bobo burns her hand with a cigar. Myra, like Roy and Lilly, plays all the angles. When her landlord demands payment of late rent, she uses her sex appeal to lure him into bed and forget the rent. She makes a similar offer to a jeweler (Stephen Tobolowsky) to get what she wants for a gem she is trying to pawn. Upon leaving the hospital, Roy takes Myra to La Jolla for the weekend.

We have the equation: 156490*l - 156477*l - 338 = 0 First, we need to combine the terms with \\"l\\" in them. So, let's subtract 156477*l from 156490*l.

So, the equation becomes: 13*l - 338 = 0 Now, let's make it easier by moving the -338 to the other side of the \\"=\\" sign. To do that, we will add 338 to both sides: 13*l = 338 Now, we want to find out what \\"l\\" is, so we will divide both sides by 13: l = 338 / 13 When we divide 338 by 13, we get 26: l = 26 So the answer, my little friend, is that l equals 26!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Now, I have a new situation: Seattle produces a large amount of their electricity by burning fossil fuels due to the large presence of natural coal in the state. Jacksonville, on the other hand, has decreased their usage of fossil fuels used to produce electricity to low levels due to recent policy changes enacted by their state's government. Answer this question please: Which city, Seattle or Jacksonville, will contribute more to global warming? A:","completion":"Based on the situation you provided, Seattle would contribute more to global warming. This is because Seattle is using a large amount of fossil fuels to produce electricity. When fossil fuels like coal are burned, they release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. These gasses trap heat from the sun close to the Earth's surface, leading to a rise in average global temperatures, a phenomenon known as global warming. In contrast, Jacksonville has decreased their usage of fossil fuels due to policy changes. This implies a shift towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources, which result in fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the problem 151*a + 68*a - 10120 = -287*a for a, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. 151*a and 68*a on the left side as well as -287*a on the right side are all like terms because they all have the variable 'a' in common. We can add or subtract them accordingly. Step 2: Add 151*a and 68*a on the left side. 151*a + 68*a = (151 + 68)*a = 219*a Now the equation looks like this: 219*a - 10120 = -287*a Step 3: Add 287*a to both sides of the equation. This will allow us to eliminate the '-287*a' term on the right side and make it easier to isolate 'a' on the left side. 219*a + 287*a = -10120 + 287*a Combine the terms with 'a': (219 + 287)*a = -10120 + 287*a 506*a = -10120 Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 506 to isolate 'a'. a = -10120 / 506 Now compute the value of 'a': a ≈ -20 So, the solution to the equation is a ≈ -20."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences where the second sentence is missing.

The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \\"college rock\\".A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, \\"Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead.\\" By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including indie rock, gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years.

Please add spaces between words: Frominputtoimpact:makingthemostofEUpolicies(examplesincludeaproposalforthenextMulti-annualFinancialFramework,accordingacentralimportancetosmartregulationandprolongingtheConsultationperiodto12weeks)","completion":"From input to impact: making the most of EU policies (examples include a proposal for the next Multi-annual Financial Framework, according a central importance to smart regulation, and prolonging the Consultation period to 12 weeks) The European Union plays a crucial role in shaping policies and regulations that can affect all aspects of the daily lives of its citizens. From input to impact, making the most of these policies requires a thorough understanding of the processes involved in their development, implementation, and evaluation. In this context, let's take a closer look at some examples, including a proposal for the next Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF), the need for smart regulation, and the extension of the consultation period to 12 weeks. 1. Proposal for the next Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) The Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) is a long-term budgetary plan that sets the limits for the annual budgets of the European Union. The MFF establishes the financial priorities of the EU for a period of at least five years, with the current MFF covering the period of 2014-2020. As the current framework comes to an end, the EU is preparing a proposal for the next MFF to set the stage for future financial planning and allocation of resources. The process for developing the next MFF involves several stages, including: - Initial discussions and debates on the priorities, objectives, and overall budget of the framework. - Drafting of the MFF proposal by the European Commission, taking into account the needs and priorities of EU countries, as well as contributions from regional and local authorities, civil society, and other stakeholders. - Review and negotiation of the draft proposal by EU member states, the European Parliament, and the European Council. This crucial step allows each institution to express its opinions and propose amendments to the draft MFF. - Adoption of the final MFF by the Council, following the consent of the European Parliament. - Implementation of the MFF through EU programs, funds, and projects, ensuring that it meets the agreed-upon objectives and contributes to the wellbeing and development of the region. 2. Central importance of smart regulation Smart regulation is a concept that highlights the need for efficient and effective rules that minimize bureaucracy and administrative burdens, while maximizing policy outcomes and benefits. The EU has been emphasizing the importance of smart regulation in recent years, with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of its policies and improving the lives of its citizens. Key principles of smart regulation include: - Evidence-based policy-making: Ensuring that decisions are informed by robust data, research, and analysis. - Simplification: Reducing complexity and making regulations easy to understand and implement. - Reducing administrative burdens: Minimizing the time and resources required for organizations and individuals to comply with regulations. - Stakeholder engagement: Involving all relevant parties in the policy-making process, allowing for diverse perspectives and greater buy-in for the final outcomes. - Continuous evaluation and improvement: Regularly assessing the impact of regulations and updating them accordingly to ensure their relevance and effectiveness. 3. Prolonging the consultation period to 12 weeks Public consultations are an essential part of the EU policy-making process, providing a platform for stakeholders to express their views and contribute their expertise. Extending the consultation period from the current standard of 8 weeks to 12 weeks would allow for more in-depth discussions, greater involvement of stakeholders, and better-informed decision-making. Benefits of extending the consultation period include: - Greater stakeholder engagement: A longer consultation period provides more opportunities for stakeholders, including business organizations, civil society, and individuals, to participate in the policy process. - Higher quality input: With more time to review proposals and prepare responses, stakeholders can provide more comprehensive and detailed feedback. - Improved decision-making: A longer consultation period enables policymakers to gather more diverse perspectives and evidence, resulting in better-informed decisions that are more likely to achieve their intended outcomes. In conclusion, making the most of EU policies involves understanding the processes and principles that guide their development and implementation, such as the Multi-annual Financial Framework, the importance of smart regulation, and the need for more extended consultation periods. By adopting these approaches, the EU can ensure that its policies have the maximum positive impact on its citizens and contribute to the overall harmonious development of the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Germanoccupied Europe or Nazi Europe refers to the sovereign countries of Europe which were occupied by the military forces of Nazi Germany at various times between 1939 and 1945 and administered by the Nazi regime. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - The Gestapo, abbreviation of Geheime Staatspolizei, or the Secret State Police, was the official secret police of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - The Diary of a Young Girl (also known as The Diary of Anne Frank) is a book of the writings from the Dutch language diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The diary was retrieved by Miep Gies, who gave it to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only known survivor just after the war was over. The diary has since been published in more than 60 languages. - Annelies Marie Frank (12 June 1929 February or March 1945) was a German-born diarist. One of the most discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust, she gained fame posthumously following the publication of \\"The Diary of a Young Girl\\" (originally \\"Het Achterhuis\\"), in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944, during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II. It is one of the world's most widely known books and has been the basis for several plays and films. - Edith Frank (née Holländer; 16 January 1900 6 January 1945) was the mother of Holocaust diarist Anne Frank. She died from starvation at the age of 44, ten days before her 45th birthday. - Margot Betti Frank ( 16 February 1926 -- February 1945 ) was the elder daughter of Otto and Edith Frank and the older sister of Anne Frank .

Once you've decided, purchase all the items, listed under the things you'll need.","completion":"When you have all the essential items, follow these simple steps to create your solar lantern: 1. Prepare the solar panel: First, you will need to choose a solar panel suitable for your project. A small solar panel with a voltage output of approximately 6V should be sufficient for a solar lantern. Attach the solar panel to the outside of the container or the area where it will be exposed to sunlight. Use a strong adhesive or screws to ensure it stays in place. 2. Set up the battery and charge controller: Next, you will need a rechargeable battery to store the energy collected by the solar panel. Select a battery with a voltage rating compatible with your solar panel. Additionally, using a charge controller will regulate the voltage coming from the panel and protect your battery from overcharging. Connect the positive lead from the solar panel to the positive input on the charge controller, and do the same for the negative leads. Then, connect the battery to the charge controller following the same procedure. 3. Attach the LED lights: Select the color of the LED lights you want to use in your solar lantern. Keep in mind that different colors may have different energy requirements, and you should choose a number of LEDs that your solar panel and battery can support. You can connect the LEDs in parallel or series, depending on your project's needs. Connect the positive end of the LED strip to the charge controller's output terminal and the negative lead to the respective output terminal. 4. Create a lantern enclosure: Find a suitable container to house your solar lantern components, such as a mason jar, an old lamp, or any transparent or translucent material that allows light to pass through. Ensure that it is spacious enough to accommodate the battery, charge controller, and LED lights, while still compact enough to serve as a decorative or functional lantern. Cut holes in the enclosure for the solar panel wires and the LED light strip to pass through. 5. Secure the components: Inside the enclosure, secure the LED strip, battery, and charge controller using adhesive or cable ties to prevent them from moving around. Arrange the LEDs in the desired pattern to ensure even distribution of light. 6. Seal the enclosure: Once all the components are appropriately secured, close the enclosure, ensuring that it is watertight and dust-proof. 7. Test your solar lantern: Place your solar lantern outdoors where it can receive direct sunlight. Allow the solar panel to charge the battery for a few hours. Once the battery is charged, your solar lantern should automatically light up when it gets dark, thanks to the charge controller. If it doesn't, check the connections and ensure that everything is functioning correctly. 8. Enjoy your solar lantern: Your solar lantern is now complete! Place it in your desired location, such as a garden, patio, or around your home, to provide eco-friendly and energy-efficient lighting. By following these steps, you will successfully create a solar lantern that not only adds a personal touch to your outdoor space but also utilizes renewable energy for a sustainable and environmentally-friendly lighting solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eritrea's membership in INTERPOL signifies the country's commitment and participation in international efforts to combat crime and ensure global security. It's also important to consider that through affiliations with organizations such as INTERPOL, countries like Eritrea not only address crime within their local context but also contribute to a global dialogue on crime detection, prevention, and response, facilitating information exchange and cross-border cooperation. In this way, they enhance their local law enforcement efforts, capacities, and capabilities, essentially strengthening their domestic security while also playing a part in securing a safer global community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Other than their race, destination, and gender, the men have nothing in common: George is the trip organizer; Xavier is an aspiring filmmaker hoping to make a documentary of the March; Flip is an openly racist and sexist actor; Kyle and Randall are a homosexual couple; Gary, a police officer, is the sole biracial man on the bus; Jamal is a former gang banger turned devout Muslim who has evaded prosecution for the murders he committed; Evan Jr., is a petty criminal who has been permitted to break probation to attend the march on the condition that he remain handcuffed to his father, Evan Sr. As the bus travels across country, Xavier conducts interviews with the various attendees, allowing them to express their views on race, religion, and politics. The interviews often provoke outbursts from other men on the bus, invariably leading to confrontations; the only topic of unity is the O.J. Simpson trial, with the men agreeing that, while Simpson is probably guilty, his acquittal is justified as his victims were a white woman and a Jew. Peace is kept through the various verbal arguments and physical altercations that occur by Jeremiah, the eldest member of the group. Jeremiah, an 80-year-old former alcoholic who lost his job and family, has found new meaning in life by embracing his African heritage; his philosophies on the black experience and stories of precolonial Africa serve to unite the men and ease tensions and the infighting among them. En route the bus breaks down and the men are forced to board another bus, driven by a ethnically Jewish white man named Rick. Several of the passengers harass Rick with antisemitic remarks and jokes; Rick ultimately refuses to drive any further, citing the group's prejudice and his opposition to antisemitic remarks made by the leader of the march, Louis Farrakhan.

At my first wedding, I had been doing a lot of manual labor in the day prior to the wedding. Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands. By the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves. During the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn’t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain. Although I managed to remain silent, I couldn’t keep the tears from falling down my face. The more I cried, the harder she squeezed and the more painful it was. She always thought that I was crying due to emotion on our wedding day, and I never told her any differently — I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. Some years after that lengthy incarceration ended, I was fortunate to wed again. I had not done any manual labor before our wedding day. My hands were fine. Also, my bride did not have a lot of intricate buttons on her dress, nor did she wear gloves or even have sleeves. We were wed on a beach, just the two of us. No one else was in attendance. We had written our own vows, in fact, our own ceremony, including our own rituals. And yes, I cried, because I was / am so in love with my bride. I still tear up every morning when I awaken and see her sleeping beside me. Peace Question: Why did the author's first marriage end? Options: A. He cheated on her B. not enough information C.

In 1878, Martinez Campos was Governor-General of Cuba, and Maximo Gomez was Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban forces. Both parties were weary of the prolonged hostilities, and neither was able to compel the other to surrender. Spain, however, professed a willingness to yield an important part of the demands of her rebellious subjects. Martinez Campos and Gomez met at Zanjon and, on February 10, 1878, mutually agreed to what has been variously called a peace pact, a treaty, and a capitulation. The agreement was based on provisions for a redress of Cuban grievances through greater civil, political, and administrative privileges for the Cubans, with forgetfulness of the past and amnesty for all then under sentence for political offences. Delay in carrying these provisions into effect gave rise to an attempt to renew the struggle two years later, but the effort was a failure. Matters then quieted down for a number of years. The Cubans waited to see what would be done. The Spanish Governor-General still remained the supreme power and, aside from the abolition of slavery, the application of the Spanish Constitution and Spanish laws to Cuba, and Cuban representation in the Cortes, much of which was rather form than fact, the island gained little by the new conditions. Discontent and protest continued and, at last, broke again into open rebellion in 1895. After reading the above, is \\"Delay in carrying the provisions\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What was the reason for rebellion after the peace pact?\\"?","completion":"Yes, \\"Delay in carrying the provisions\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"What was the reason for rebellion after the peace pact?\\" Based on the text, after the agreement between Martinez Campos and Gomez, there was a delay in implementing the provisions that were meant to redress Cuban grievances. This delay led to discontent and protest among the Cubans, which eventually escalated into open rebellion in 1895."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What had a return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period? The boar was an important symbol in prehistoric Europe, where, according to the archaeologist Jennifer Foster, it was \\"venerated, eulogised, hunted and eaten ... for millennia, until its virtual extinction in recent historical time.\\" Anglo-Saxon boar symbols follow a thousand years of similar iconography, coming after La Tène examples in the fourth century BC, Gaulish specimens three centuries later, and Roman boars in the fourth century AD. They likely represent a fused tradition of European and Mediterranean cultures. The boar is said to have been sacred to a mother goddess figure among linguistically Celtic communities in Iron Age Europe, while the Roman historian Tacitus, writing around the first century AD, suggested that the Baltic Aesti wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection. Boar-crested helmets are depicted on the turn-of-the-millennium Gundestrup cauldron, discovered in Denmark, and on a Torslunda plate from Sweden, made some five hundred years later. Though the Romans also included the boar in their stable of symbols—four legions, including the twentieth, adopted it as their emblem—it was only one among many. The boar nonetheless persisted in continental Germanic tradition during the nearly 400 years of Roman rule in Britain, such as in association with the Scandinavian gods Freyja and Freyr. Its return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period, as represented by the boars from Benty Grange, Wollaston, Guilden Morden, and Horncastle, may therefore suggest the post-Roman reintroduction of a Germanic tradition from Europe, rather than the continuation of a tradition in Britain through 400 years of Roman rule. Whatever its precise symbolism, the Anglo-Saxon boar appears to have been associated with protection; the Beowulf poet makes this clear, writing that boar symbols on helmets kept watch over the warriors wearing them.

This information does not provide any indication about the age requirement for women to join the Dominican Order. The Dominican Order, officially known as the Order of Preachers, was founded in the early 13th century by Saint Dominic. The order is part of the Roman Catholic Church and has both male and female members. Female members belong to either contemplative monastic communities or active apostolic congregations. Typically, for someone to become a member of a religious order like the Dominican Order, they must meet specific age and eligibility criteria. In the case of women wanting to become members of the Dominican Order, they are generally expected to meet the following criteria: 1. Minimum age: Although the specific minimum age requirements may vary slightly between different Dominican communities, the generally accepted minimum age for women to enter the Dominican Order is 18 years old. 2. Marital status: Women interested in joining the Dominican Order must be unmarried, widowed, or have obtained an annulment for their marriages in accordance with the Church's canonical law. Married women who have only separated from their husbands are generally not eligible to join. 3. Physical, mental, and emotional health: Prospective members must undergo thorough evaluations to ensure their overall well-being to adapt to the rigors of religious life in the order. However, the sentence provided does not detail the minimum age required to become members of the Dominican Order, thereby rendering it unrelated and unable to answer the question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This article: Sam Roffe, President of Roffe & Sons Pharmaceuticals, dies in what appears to be a climbing accident, leaving his daughter Elizabeth a billion-dollar empire. Roffe's board members see an opportunity to settle old scores, jockey for higher position, and reap lucrative profits. However, an investigation into Sam's death discloses that it was a murder and that a power struggle is going on within the company. Lead investigator Max Hornung informs Elizabeth of his list of suspects, which includes her closest advisers and financially strapped family members. During this time, she marries CEO Rhys Williams, but he, too, is identified by Hornung as a suspect. As president, Elizabeth follows her father's wishes and refuses to let shares of Roffe & Sons sell on the world market. Her choice prevents the board members from selling their shares as the company's by-laws prohibit it until all board members agree; on the other hand, her death would allow for a unanimous decision. After several attempts on her life, an international chase across Europe ensues. Hornung is able to connect these murder attempts to a series of homicides of prostitutes, which have been recorded on snuff films using Roffe film stock with a witness in a black Gucci leather coat (several suspects are linked to this coat). Elizabeth returns to her father's villa in Sardinia during a scirocco for protection from the unseen murderer, who sets her house on fire after she begins destroying objects and shouting, \\"Now try to make it look like an accident!\\" Williams and one of the shareholders, Sir Alec Nichols, both show up to save her, but Hornung figures out that Nichols is the killer and shoots him before he can murder Elizabeth in a symbolic snuff film. contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose death would allow for a unanimous board decision?, what is it ?","completion":"The first name of the person whose death would allow for a unanimous board decision is Elizabeth."},{"prompt":"Question: If there is no windows in the area where are you likely to find a fire extinguisher?

Title: Joe Dirt Movie plot: Joe Dirt (David Spade) is an irrationally optimistic, 30-ish, southern-rock and muscle-car-loving, mullet-sporting, lovable loser working as a janitor at an L.A. radio station. Finding Joe an irresistable target for his sarcastic on-air wit, a Howard Stern-like deejay named Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller), puts Joe on the air to tell his story. For three days Zander and a growing legion of listeners are surprised to find themselves captivated, delighted, and occasionally repelled by Joe's incredible tale of his search to find the parents who referred to him as \\"Joe Dirt\\" (rather than by his real last name, which he can no longer remember) and left him sitting in a garbage can at the Grand Canyon when he was 8 years old. Thorughout the film, the story reverts for short periods back to the KXLA studio for dialogue between Joe and Zander.Pivotal to Joe's story is the past relationship he reveals between himself and Brandy (Brittany Daniel), a beautiful farm girl from his adopted hometown of Silvertown, Idaho. Joe feels that Brandy and his dog, Charlie, were the only real friends he ever had. After living in and leaving a series of bizarre foster homes, Joe met Brandy one winter when he was living in the woods outside Silvertown and Charlie's testicles became frozen to the front porch of Brandy's house. Brandy helped Joe and Charlie and for the next few years the three spent most of their time together.Believing that Brandy is \\"too hot\\" to ever love a guy like him, Joe is blind to the fact that she obviously has very real feelings for him. Complicating their relationship is Brandy's alcoholic father (Joe Don Baker) and the local Trans-Am-driving bully, Robby (Kid Rock). Brandy's father kills Joe's dog after it fails in a Lassie-like mission to free the father when he gets stuck on railroad tracks, resulting in the loss of his leg.The death of Charlie causes Joe to feel that he needs to take up the search for his mother and father.

This is because glacier C experienced a recent snowfall, and the snow became part of the glacier itself, contributing to the overall thickness and mass of the ice. In contrast, glacier D didn't have any snowfall, so no additional snow has been added to its ice mass, making it more likely for the ice to be thinner compared to glacier C.

Step 3: Compare the components of the premise to the hypothesis. The hypothesis is: \\"A handful came back, running, screaming, and covered in blood from battle.\\" From the hypothesis, we can extract the following components: 1. A handful of people are involved. 2. They came running back. 3. They are covered in blood. 4. They are screaming. 5. The blood and screaming are from a battle. Step 4: Check if the premise entails the hypothesis. Comparing the components, we see that the first four components of the hypothesis are also present in the premise. However, the hypothesis includes an additional component about the source of the blood and screaming: \\"from a battle.\\" Step 5: Assess the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Since the premise does not explicitly mention that the blood and screaming are due to a battle, it does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. The premise provides information consistent with the hypothesis but does not guarantee that the blood and screaming are a direct result of a battle.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person Ray pleaded with to return for the sessions for their upcoming album? In early 1969, Quaife told the band he was leaving. The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go.

But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast . The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat. The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert. Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color1 as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated. \\"Santiago,\\" the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was pulled up. \\"I could go with you again.

Yes or no, is the answer \\"the old man was insistent and not afraid of failure[\\"?","completion":"After reading this passage, we may safely conclude that the old man was perseverant and resilient despite his streak of bad luck in catching fish. The answer to whether \\"the old man was insistent and not afraid of failure\\" would be yes. The passage describes the old man as having gone eighty-four days without catching a fish, which could be seen as a form of failure. Despite this, he remains optimistic and continues his daily fishing. His interaction with the boy illustrates his determination and reluctance to accept defeat, as well as his understanding of the boy's forced departure from his boat. The description of the old man's eyes as being \\"the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated\\" further highlights his unwavering spirit and refusal to be deterred by failure. Additionally, the passage portrays the old man as someone who maintains faith in their abilities despite external circumstances and opinions. When the boy expresses his father's lack of faith in the old man's fishing abilities, the old man confidently asserts that both he and the boy still have faith in themselves. This is evidence of the old man's insistence on staying true to his beliefs and not allowing failure to negatively impact his persistence in his endeavors. Therefore, the old man's character is marked by his persistence, resilience, and unwavering faith in himself and others, which helps him to stay unafraid of failure."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

It was opened by Tony Tan Keng Yam, the President of Singapore at the aforementioned stadium. The final medal tally was led by Thailand, followed by host Singapore and Vietnam. Several Games and national records were broken during the games.

Movie title: Boarding Gate Movie plot: Paris[edit] After discussing his plans for retiring by selling on the shares in his security company to his debtors with his partner, AndrÃ©, aging underworld entrepreneur Miles Rennberg is paid a surprise visit at his Paris office by aggressive underworld moll Sandra. Brazenly taunting him with her sexuality, she bluntly dissects their prior relationshipâa nightmarish web of masochism, money, manipulation and dependency, pimping her out to dangerous clients in order to gain both a business advantage and perverse personal thrills. She outlines her newest ambition, since their estrangement, of raising the necessary capital to run a nightclub in Beijing. Miles makes no pretense of the fact that he is less interested in the proposal than the woman, and encourages her to visit him at his apartment. Without making any promises, Sandra leaves for her job at an import business, run by a young married couple: Lester and Sue Wong. Sandra's own import sideline, drug running, is facilitated by her close bond of loyalty with low-ranking employee Lisa.

A senior National Security Council staffer who was a key member of the White House team negotiating on Iran’s nuclear weapons program told POLITICO he deeply regrets tweeting hundreds of anti-administration messages under the pseudonym @natsecwonk. Jofi Joseph, 40, was fired from his job on the NSC nuclear nonproliferation team a week ago after a months-long probe into a barrage of tweets that included caustic criticisms of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and top NSC officials, especially Ben Rhodes – whom he accused of dodging questions about Benghazi. “It has been a privilege to serve in this Administration and I deeply regret violating the trust and confidence placed in me,” Joseph told POLITICO in an email. “What started out as an intended parody account of DC culture developed over time into a series of inappropriate and mean-spirited comments. I bear complete responsibility for this affair and I sincerely apologize to everyone I insulted.” (Also on POLITICO: White House official fired for tweets) Obama spokesman Eric Schultz confirmed that Joseph has left the White House – and that he no longer has his top security clearances. In the course of their investigations, officials told Joseph they suspected he was responsible for a second anonymous Twitter account, @dchobbyist, which included tweets that are more racy about sexual encounters, escort services – and the inner workings of the State Department. “Wow, you look amazingly sexy in this photo!” @dchobbyist posted on Oct. 5. “That was him,” a person briefed on the probe told POLITICO. Joseph didn’t respond to a request for comment on the second account. Joseph, who was part of the White House team that opened preliminary negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program in Istanbul earlier this year, lived a double life: He worked with NSC officials and State Department higher-ups on the most sensitive issues while secretly tweet-bombing them with comments like, “‘Has shitty staff.’ #ObamaInThreeWords.” For months, White House and State Department officials searched for @NatSecWonk, a hunt that intensified after he repeatedly expressed doubts about the official administration accounts about the Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Benghazi. After a probe that included an investigation into Joseph’s travel and shopping patterns – parsed from over 2,000 tweets - lawyers from the White House counsel’s office confronted Joseph and ordered him to leave the executive complex, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Joseph had been scheduled to rotate out of White House duty to a senior job in the Pentagon, an administration official told POLITICO. The revelation that Joseph was @natsecwonk came as a shock because Joseph is a familiar figure in the foreign policy world – as is his wife, Carolyn Leddy, a highly regarded staffer on the Republican side of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to Daily Beast reporter Josh Rogin. Before joining the administration in 2009, Joseph worked as an aide to Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, where he earned a reputation for smarts and sarcasm. \\"I'm not surprised,\\" said one Hill staffer who worked with Joseph when told about his admission. Joseph erased the @natsecwonk account earlier this week – which prompted a wave of inquiries from reporters and staffers who had grown used to reading his pointed criticism and commentary – a quintessential Washington-centric Twitter stream that was barely noticed beyond the Beltway and obsessively and angrily followed by officials in the bowels of Foggy Bottom and the West Wing. “Was Huma Abedin wearing beer goggles the night she met Anthony Wiener? Almost as bad a pairing as Samantha Powers and Cass Sunstein ....,” he tweeted about the top Clinton aide and her husband, the failed New York mayoral candidate. Joseph spared hardly anybody, especially people he had worked with. Of Joe Biden, he commented: “Interesting factoid: Both Tom Donilon and Tony Blinken once worked for Biden. Both of their wives work for the VP today. #incestuous.” After serving a stint at the State Department, he wrote: “Look, (Republican Rep. Darrell) Issa is an ass, but he's on to something here with the @HillaryClinton whitewash of accountability for Benghazi.” \\"Loved, LOVED the @NYTimesDowd column eviscerating the Clintons today. @ChelseaClinton seems to be assuming all of her parents' vices ...\\" he wrote earlier this year. Worse still, administration officials said, was Joseph’s torrent of personal attacks. He frequently mocked female political figures like Liz Cheney and Ann Romney, targeting their physical appearance and weight, and he posted a half-dozen tweets questioning the sexual orientation of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) – behavior that was completely “beyond the pale,” in the words of one official who worked with Joseph. Hadas Gold contributed to this report.

Jofi Joseph was director of nuclear non-proliferation on the White House National Security Council staff, but for more than two years sent hundreds of anonymous and abrasive tweets using the handle @NatSecWonk. He was fired last week after he was caught, the official said. A White House official confirmed Joseph no longer worked there, but would not comment on personnel matters. The firing was first reported by the website Daily Beast. In his Twitter biography, now removed from the social networking site, Joseph described himself as a \\"keen observer of the foreign policy and national security scene\\" who \\"unapologetically says what everyone else only thinks.\\" As the widely followed @NatSecWonk, Joseph speculated anonymously about the political motives and career moves of administration officials he worked with. They included Ben Rhodes, President Barack Obama's spokesman on national security issues. This month, Joseph tweeted that Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, \\"had few policy goals and no wins\\" in the Middle East. He agreed with Republican Representative Darrell Issa, who has relentlessly pursued Clinton for administration actions after last year's attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya. \\"Look, Issa is an ass, but he's on to something here with the @HillaryClinton whitewash of accountability for Benghazi,\\" he tweeted. He also sniped at U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power's use of Twitter. \\"Can someone again brief @AmbassadorPower that Bashar Assad likely doesn't follow her Twitter feed?\\" he recently wrote. Joseph did not respond to phone and email requests for comment, but he told the website Politico he regretted his tweets. \\"What started out as an intended parody account of DC culture developed over time into a series of inappropriate and mean-spirited comments. I bear complete responsibility for this affair and I sincerely apologize to everyone I insulted,\\" Joseph said in an email to Politico. He also targeted journalists, including Daily Beast reporter Josh Rogin who broke the story of his firing. \\"Just a hunch, but I have the sense lots of people would like to punch @joshrogin in the face,\\" he said earlier this month.

(Photo: Charles Sykes, AP) Another one bites the dust. A White House national security official was fired recently after tweeting anonymous insults and secret information about the Obama administration. High-profile firings over inappropriate tweets are nothing new, but they sure are interesting. Here's a list of some incidents that caught our eye: 1) Who: Indiana Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Cox What happened: In February 2013, Cox was fired by the Indiana Attorney General's Office after having a controversial conversation with former Mother Jones journalist Adam Weinstein on Twitter involving a protest in Wisconsin and the use of riot police. Cox tweeted that the police should \\"use live ammunition\\" to remove demonstrators and called them \\"thugs\\" who were \\"physically threatening legally elected officials.\\" Cox later released a written statement apologizing for the \\"lousy choice of words\\" and wrote that the tweets should not be taken seriously. 2) Who: Phil Hardy, spokesman for Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho What happened: Hardy accidentally tweeted, \\"Me likey Broke Girls\\" to the congressman's account during the 2013 Super Bowl. He tweeted this in response to an ad that featured actresses from CBS's show 2 Broke Girls dancing in risque clothing on something resembling a stripper pole. Hardy, who was fired, wrote in an e-mail that it was \\"totally an accident.\\" 3) Who: Comedian Gilbert Gottfried What happened: It was not the best comedic moment for Gottfried. Insurance company Aflac dumped Gottfried in March 2011 after he sent offensive tweets during the Japanese tsunami. Known as the famous voice behind the iconic Aflac Duck, Gottfried tweeted: \\"I just split up with my girlfriend, but like the Japanese say, 'They'll be another one floating by any minute now.'\\" Aflac responded in a statement that Gottfried's comments lacked humor and did not represent the opinions of anyone at the company. \\"There is no place for anything but compassion and concern during these difficult times,\\" Aflac added. 4) Who: Damian Goddard, former host on Rogers Sportsnet What happened: Goddard made headlines when he was fired in 2011 after tweeting about New York Rangers forward Sean Avery's support of same-sex marriage. The sports broadcaster voiced opposition to Avery's position, saying he supported hockey agent Todd Reynolds. Goddard tweeted: \\"I completely and whole-heartedly support Todd Reynolds and his support for the traditional and TRUE meaning of marriage.\\" The TV network then issued its own tweet, \\"Today's tweet from Damian Goddard does not reflect the views of Rogers Sportsnet.\\" The network stated he was terminated for performance issues not related to the tweet. 5) Who: Three staffers for Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash. What happened: Legislative assistants Seth Burroughs and Elizabeth Robblee and legislative correspondent Ben Byers were fired in 2011 after a series of tweets revealed the trio's plan to spend the final month of the legislative session in \\"a state of perpetual debauchery.\\" They also tweeted about drinking on the job. Larsen's spokesman, Bryan Thomas, later said in a statement: \\"Congressman Larsen is disappointed by their actions and takes this very seriously. He has made it clear that he will not tolerate this kind of behavior.\\" A previous version of this story did not contain a statement from Rogers Sportsnet.

I grabbed it, and starting beating the dogs with it. I managed to land a few good hits. As I was hitting the dogs, their owner (my client) came outside, stood on her porch and laughed at me.

In this sentence, it is mentioned that Digital constructed a significant facility on King Street, which is located close to the Common. Additionally, the company built offices on two other streets: Porter Road and Foster Street. From this sentence, we can infer that the major facility is separate from the offices, with the large facility being situated on King Street, while the offices are spread across Porter Road and Foster Street. Sentence 2: Digital built a very large facility in Porter Road and Foster Street near the Common, as well as offices on King Street. In contrast, this sentence states that the very large facility is located between Porter Road and Foster Street, in the vicinity of the Common. Moreover, the company also built offices on King Street. Here, we can gather that the main facility and the offices are situated in different locations compared to Sentence 1. The large facility is set between Porter Road and Foster Street, whereas the offices are established on King Street. In summary, while both sentences describe the construction of a large facility and offices by Digital, the locations of these facilities differ in each sentence.

In this statement, the speaker is expressing their decision to invite two prominent political figures to the European Parliament. Yasser Arafat (1929-2004) was a Palestinian political leader and the first President of the Palestinian National Authority. He was also the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which he co-founded in 1964. Arafat's goal was to establish a Palestinian state and improve the living conditions of Palestinian refugees. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 along with Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres for their efforts in establishing peace in the Middle East through the Oslo Accords. Shimon Peres (1923-2016) was an Israeli statesman who held various high-level positions in the Israeli government throughout his long career, including serving as the Prime Minister from 1995 to 1996 and again from 1999 to 2001, as well as the President of Israel from 2007 to 2014. Peres was one of the founding fathers of the State of Israel and played a significant role in building its defense and security systems. As one of the architects of the Oslo Accords, he worked towards establishing peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Inviting Arafat and Peres to the European Parliament demonstrates the interest in promoting dialogue and understanding between these influential leaders from opposing sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

You may require more in-depth treatment than what you can do at home, which can minimize your risk for infection or nerve damage. It’s important to see your doctor if a human bite breaks your skin, as it can very easily become infected. You should seek treatment for a broken skin wound within 24 hours. If your wound doesn’t stop bleeding or the bite has removed significant tissue, seek help at an emergency room. If you have any concerns even about the smallest bite or scrape from a human mouth, talk to your doctor. Tell your doctor how you got the bite. This might help him with your treatment or getting help if it involved violence. Your doctor will measure the wound and take notes on presentation including location or if you appear to have nerve or tendon damage. Depending on the severity of the bite, your doctor may order blood tests or X-rays. If there are any foreign objects in your bite wound, such as teeth, your doctor will remove them. This can help minimize your risk of infection and may relieve any pain you have. If you have a significant bite mark on your face, your doctor should enlist the help of a plastic surgeon to stitch the wound so it will heal properly, with minimal scarring. It’s not uncommon for stitches to itch. If this is the case, you can use a light layer of antibiotic ointment to relieve itching and help prevent infection. Your doctor may prescribe one of several different antibiotics for a human bite wound. These can minimize your risk of developing an infection. Your doctor may prescribe one of the following antibiotics to combat infection: cephalosporin, penicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, or aminoglycosides. Antibiotic treatment usually lasts between three to five days. If there is an infection, it may be necessary to follow up with a longer course of treatment, up to six weeks. If you haven’t had a tetanus shot within five years, your doctor may prescribe a booster shot. This can help prevent the infection that causes tetanus, or lockjaw. Make sure to tell your doctor the date of your last tetanus shot or if you’ve never had one. Tetanus is a potentially fatal infection. If you know the medical history of the person who bit you, a tetanus shot may not be necessary. If your biter’s medical history is unknown to you, your doctor may test for the transmission of diseases such as HIV and hepatitis B at regular intervals. This can not only identify possible infection, but also put your mind at ease. It is very unlikely you will contract any disease such as HIV, hepatitis B, or herpes from a human bite. It’s normal to have pain for a few days following the a bite wound. Use either over the counter pain relievers or a prescription pain medication to help alleviate pain and some swelling. Take over the counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Ibuprofen may also help alleviate some of the swelling associate with the surgery. Your doctor may prescribe a pain medication if over the counter pain relief doesn’t work for you. If you had an extremely severe bite that resulted in the loss of tissue, your doctor may suggest plastic surgery. This can repair your skin to its earlier state with little scarring. Summary:","completion":"If a human bite breaks your skin, it's important to see a doctor to avoid infection and get proper treatment, which might include antibiotics and possibly stitches or plastic surgery in severe cases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - A bird picks a spot high spot, often in a tree - The bird collects bits of sticks and grass - The sticks and grasses are placed between support branches - Leaves, mud and spider webs are added to the sticks - The mud, leaves and webs glue the sticks together - The solid nest supports the eggs - suppose less human interference in environment happens, how will it affect MORE or LARGER nests. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"If there is less human interference in the environment, it can lead to an indirect impact on a step of the nest-building process, potentially resulting in more or larger nests. The perturbation in this case would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Less human interference can result in several changes within the bird's environment: 1. Increased availability of nesting materials: With fewer human interventions, there might be a greater availability of sticks, grass, and other materials that the bird uses to construct its nest. This increase in resources might allow the bird to build larger nests or even multiple nests within the same area. 2. More suitable nesting sites: Birds often pick high spots in trees in order to protect their nests from predators. As human interference declines, there may be an increase in the number of trees available as natural habitats for birds, which may lead to a greater number of suitable nesting sites. This will encourage them to choose the best sites for their nests and reproduce successfully. 3. Improved habitat quality: With less human activity, there is likely to be an improvement in overall habitat quality. The air will be cleaner, and there will be less noise pollution. This may reduce stress on birds and improve their overall health, leading to stronger, more successful nest-building behaviors. 4. Greater food availability: With a decrease in human disturbances, the environment may experience an increase in food resources for birds, such as insects and seeds, which can provide them with the energy and nutrients necessary for nest-building. This indirect impact on the nest-building process stems from the overall improvement of the habitat conditions afforded by decreased human interference, thereby offering increased resources and opportunities for birds to create more and larger nests to successfully reproduce and rear their young."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - The sun gives off radiation - The radiation is aborbed by the Earth - Some of the radiation goes back into space - Some is trapped by the atmosphere - If too much heat is trapped Answer:","completion":"The final step of the following process is: - Climate change and its consequences After the sun releases radiation and the Earth absorbs it, some of this radiation goes back into space while some is trapped by the Earth's atmosphere. The trapped heat from the atmosphere is essential to maintain life on Earth as it keeps the planet warm. However, if too much heat is trapped due to an increase in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, it leads to an imbalance in the Earth's energy budget. This results in a gradual increase in the Earth's average temperature, which is known as global warming or climate change. As a consequence of climate change, we may witness several adverse effects on the environment, ecosystems, and human society. Some of these consequences include: 1. Extreme weather events: An increase in the Earth's temperature contributes to more frequent and intense weather events such as hurricanes, floods, heatwaves, and droughts. 2. Melting of polar ice caps: Global warming leads to the melting of ice caps and glaciers, causing a rise in sea levels. This, in turn, leads to coastal erosion and flooding, threatening people who live in low-lying areas and islands. 3. Impact on ecosystems and biodiversity: Climate change affects ecosystems as it disrupts the interactions between species and their habitats. It can lead to a loss of biodiversity, which can affect the balance of ecosystems and the ability of species to adapt to changing conditions. 4. Impact on agriculture and food security: Climate change affects agriculture through changes in temperature, rainfall patterns, and available water resources. These changes impact crop yields, food quality, and food security. 5. Human health: In addition to worsening air quality and the spread of infectious diseases due to climate change, extreme weather events can lead to injuries, fatalities, and mental health issues. 6. Economic and social implications: Climate change is expected to have significant economic and social costs, such as the loss of infrastructure, decreased labor productivity, and an increased need for disaster relief and recovery efforts. In summary, the final step of the process mentioned above is the occurrence of climate change and its wide-ranging consequences on the environment, ecosystems, and human society. Addressing climate change requires global and local efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase resilience to the impacts of a changing climate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If I tell you that Scraping oneself on a contaminated object may cause an invasion of the body by bacteria, and ask you the question \\"scraping oneself on an object that is what, may cause an invasion of the body by bacteria?\\", is the correct answer \\"unknown\\"? Answer:","completion":"The correct answer to the question \\"scraping oneself on an object that is what, may cause an invasion of the body by bacteria?\\" is not \\"unknown,\\" but rather \\"contaminated.\\" In the original statement, you mentioned that scraping oneself on a contaminated object may cause an invasion of the body by bacteria. This provides the necessary information to answer the question. A more detailed explanation of this process is as follows: When someone scrapes their skin on a contaminated object, the physical barrier provided by the skin—an essential part of our immune system—is compromised. The skin is the body's first line of defense against pathogens, acting as a shield that prevents the entrance of harmful microorganisms into the body. When it is damaged, it leaves an open path for bacteria and other pathogens to enter the body. A contaminated object refers to an item that comes into contact with harmful microorganisms, such as bacteria, which can potentially cause infection. Contamination can occur in a variety of settings and can include objects such as rusty metal, dirty surfaces, used bandages, or shared personal items like towels or razors. If an individual scrapes their skin on such an object, there is a risk that the bacteria on the contaminated surface can be transferred directly into the open wound. This can lead to an infection developing in the body. The severity of the infection can vary depending on the nature of the bacteria and the individual's overall health and immune system. To prevent infections caused by scraping oneself on a contaminated object, it is important to practice good hygiene habits, such as washing hands regularly, properly cleaning any wounds, and avoiding contact with potentially contaminated surfaces. Additionally, ensuring that tetanus vaccinations are up to date is crucial, especially if someone has a wound that is at risk of being exposed to contaminated objects. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question is \\"contaminated.\\" Scraping oneself on a contaminated object may cause an invasion of the body by bacteria, increasing the risk of infection and potential health complications. It is important to maintain proper hygiene and wound care practices to reduce the risk of infections caused by coming into contact with contaminated objects."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Imperial commissioners and garrisons were sent to Mongolia and Tibet to oversee their affairs. These territories were also under supervision of a central government institution called Lifan Yuan. Qinghai was also put under direct control of the Qing court. Xinjiang, also known as Chinese Turkestan, was subdivided into the regions north and south of the Tian Shan mountains, also known today as Dzungaria and Tarim Basin respectively, but the post of Ili General was established in 1762 to exercise unified military and administrative jurisdiction over both regions. Dzungaria was fully opened to Han migration by the Qianlong Emperor from the beginning. Han migrants were at first forbidden from permanently settling in the Tarim Basin but were the ban was lifted after the invasion by Jahangir Khoja in the 1820s. Likewise, Manchuria was also governed by military generals until its division into provinces, though some areas of Xinjiang and Northeast China were lost to the Russian Empire in the mid-19th century.

Question: What is the holographic device many civilians use called?

After rescuing the EU officials and destroying the cyborgs, ESWAT return to Olympus, where Briareos is confined to hospital until he recovers, while Deunan continues ESWAT work. When Deunan's commanding officer Lance introduces her to her new partner, Tereus, she is shocked as her partner resembles Briareos' human form.Deunan confronts Lance for an explanation, and is given the tour of the new Bioroid production facility. During the tour, Hitomi, a bioroid that Deunan befriended during those events, is mentioned to now be a minister of political affairs. Here it is shown that Tereus is actually a Bioroid; a prototype for a whole new production line of Bioroids to be soldiers without negative emotions to impact their judgment in fighting. As his physical and mental strength was found to be most desirable in ESWAT, Briareos' DNA was used mostly in Tereus' design. Reluctantly, Deunan is partnered up with Tereus to evaluate his performance. While departing, Deunan encounters Hitomi and Hitomi gives her a ride home. Deunan notices that many Olympus citizens are wearing Connexus; a device on their ears which projects holographic data over the eyes.Deunan, Lance and Hitomi visit Briareos, still recovering in hospital. Here, Lance states that out of the last five terrorist incidents, four of them have been by groups composed solely of cyborgs, with transmitted signals from surrounding locations, thus suggesting that digitally vulnerable cyborgs are actually being manipulated to perform these acts. Because many of these cyborgs consist of parts made by Poseidon, a multinational industrial conglomerate, an emissary is sent to Prime Minister Athena.

Movie title: Doc Hollywood Context: Dr. Benjamin Stone is a promising young surgeon working in Washington, D.C. with plans of making more money working for a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. On his last day, he realizes that none of his colleagues care enough about him to say good-bye to him, instead leaving him a cake with an insult made out of icing. Driving out west in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster, Stone swerves to miss a cow on the highway and crashes uncontrollably into the fence of a local resident in the rural hamlet of Grady, South Carolina. The resident is local Judge Evans, who sentences him to community service at the nearby hospital as punishment rather than allow Stone pay for the fence with cash. Defeated and stranded due to the damage to his car, Ben reports to the local clinic, where Nurse Packer further humbles him by recording his community service hours by clocking him in and out, like a factory worker. Though upset, Ben makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson, who is also the owner of the town's cafe, and Melvin, the local mechanic tasked with repairing his car. Ben soon finds the clinic work is more laid-back than the emergency room to which he is used with simple cases, such as spots before the eyes of an elderly patient not cleaning her glasses, fishing hook impaling and even reading mail for a young illiterate couple, Kyle and Mary Owens, whose baby he later delivers. The small-town experience soon humbles Ben when he misdiagnoses a young boy as having mitral valve regurgitation leading to late cyanosis, a case the town's curmudgeonly doctor, Aurelius Hogue, treats with a Coca-Cola. Hogue explains that the boy had chewed his father's tobacco and was given too much bismuth subnitrate as an antacid, causing a blue tinge; the carbonic acid component of the soda would relieve his stomachache. The two finally bond when Ben saves Hogue after he suffers a near-fatal heart attack. Since Hogue is eager to retire, Ben is urged by the locals to stay and replace him, although he is tempted by his budding romance with a tomboyish...","completion":"Insufficient information to provide an answer."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Before writing what I did and what he did please let me tell you I was just a teenagerand it all seemed new, so kindly don't judge me.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: It can be dangerous to travel by sea. Ships sometimes sink far away from land. When this happens, the sailors have to get into small boats. If another ship does not come and help them and they do not have enough food or water, they will die. Most people believe we must not drink sea water. They believe that if we do, we shall be very ill because of all the salt in the water. A doctor called Alain Bombard did not believe this. He thought that people could stay alive by drinking sea water and eating small fish, animals and plants from the sea. On 19 October 1953, he set out in a small boat to cross the Atlantic Ocean . He did not take any food or water with him. Every day Dr. Bombard drank just a little sea water. He also caught fish and they had water in them. He drank this water. He could not cook the fish, so he ate them as they were. He took small plants from the sea, which gave him more food. Dr. Bombard became hot, tired and quite ill, but after 65days at sea he was still alive. He traveled 2,750 miles from one side of the Atlantic Ocean to the other, and on 24th,December 1953, he reached Barbados. He lost 20 kilos, but he showed that people could live on sea water, the animals and plants in the sea.

Today, we are going to talk about something funny called \\"Watters' World: Least Sexy College Edition.\\" Now, I know you might be wondering what it is, so I am here to explain it to you in a fun and friendly way! First, let's break down the title. \\"Watters' World\\" is a television show hosted by a man named Jesse Watters. On his show, he talks to many people, asks them questions, and sometimes makes them laugh. \\"Least Sexy College Edition\\" means this episode will be about colleges which are not very attractive or fun. Imagine you have a favorite toy, and someone made a list of the not-so-fun toys. The list would still be interesting, wouldn't it? Well, that's what this episode is about - finding the not-so-fun colleges. Now let's dive into the article! Once upon a time, in a land filled with learning, there were many colleges where young people went to study and become wise. However, not all these colleges were fun and attractive. Jesse Watters, the curious explorer, set out to find the \\"Least Sexy Colleges\\" to show everyone what makes them different. He started his journey with a list of ten colleges known for being not-so-fun. Instead of having exciting parties, delicious food, and colorful decorations, these colleges were known for being quiet, plain, and boring. Jesse wanted to discover why they were so different from the others. As he traveled from one college to another, he met lots of students who told him their stories. Some students said that their college focused more on studying than having fun. Others told him that their college was neat and clean, but it just didn't have as many attractive features as the other places. Jesse also found out that at some of these colleges, the students needed to wear uniforms. Although uniforms can make everyone look nice and neat, they were not as comfortable or stylish as the clothes other college students might wear. As he continued his search, Jesse realized that it wasn't all bad at the \\"Least Sexy Colleges.\\" While they might not have had exciting parties or beautiful decorations, they still had kind teachers, smart students, and important lessons to be learned. By the end of his journey, Jesse had learned that even the least sexy or fun colleges have their own unique things to offer. He shared his findings with the world through his television show, reminding everyone that sometimes, beauty and fun can be found in unexpected places. And so, Jesse Watters' adventure in the world of \\"Least Sexy Colleges\\" came to an end. With his new knowledge and understanding, he continued his quest to share interesting stories and make people laugh. That's the story of \\"Watters' World: Least Sexy College Edition,\\" a fun and exciting adventure that teaches us that even places that may not look or seem fun at first can still have lots to offer and teach us!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Unfortunately I could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night. Now I bought it on DVD because I can remember that I liked it. This is really not an ordinary horror movie. It has some horror elements but I rather categorize it as fantasy. I liked it but I hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes. Especially the scene when Anna's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short. Now to the plot. This movie is about a young girl named Anna who gets ill. While she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house - the paperhouse. When she fells a sleep, which often strangely happens just immediately, she finds herself near the house on a big green field. She realizes that the house is exactly like the one she has drawn and that every new detail also appears in her dreams. One day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to. As she forgets to draw his legs (because he is sitting behind a window) the boy cannot walk. Later she is being told by the doctor, that a boy also has this strange disease and she realizes that with the boy she has drawn, she also got that boy into her disturbing dreams. She also notices that it gets harder and harder for her to wake up from her dreams. As she misses her father who is ofter abroad she draws her father into the house. She makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting. She tries to rubber him out but realizes that she cannot change anything already drawn. And next time she falls asleep the horror begins. Her father is mad and blind (because she draw s*** on his head to mark him as 'invalid') and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill Anna and his friend. Her dreams became a horrendous nightmare. They manage to escape and to kill her father and Anna can finally wake up. Than Anna finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed. The doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so. They tell Anna that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those tragical happenings. Anna draws a watchtower and notices that the same watchtower can be found near the hotel they traveled to. She runs to the watchtower and meets the boy (I am just not mentioning his name because I cannot remember it and do not want to go back to the previous html page) and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dreams forever. There were a few thing I did not understand in the movie. First of all it was the ending which I absolutely dislike. I think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short. How does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to Anna as he is supposed to be dead? Why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall? I hated that scene it was so dumb to me. It almost ruined the main horror scene. Things I liked were the scene with the photograph of Anna's dad which was the first real scary and horror scene. I liked the boy. The actor was awesome. He was even better than Anna. I also liked how Anna tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage. Overall a good movie.

Believing she's dead, Gill dumps Rae and leaves her for dead in only a shirt and panties by the side of the road and drives away. Lazarus discovers Rae unconscious in the road the next morning and brings her home to nurse her back to health. Lazarus goes to see Tehronne (David Banner) - the man who Lazarus thought had beaten her - and learns of her promiscuity. Over the course of several days, Rae, delirious with fever, occasionally wakes up and tries to flee from Lazarus. He chains her to the radiator to keep her from running away. After Rae regains her wits, Lazarus announces that it is his spiritual duty to heal her of her sinful ways and refuses to release her until he does so. Rae makes several attempts to escape, and even briefly has sex with a teenage boy who helps out on Lazarus' farm. She eventually comes to tolerate her position. Lazarus buys her a conservative dress to wear, plays the guitar for her, and feeds her home-cooked meals. Lazarus' pastor and close friend, R.L. (John Cothran, Jr.), visits Lazarus at his house and discovers that Lazarus is imprisoning Rae. The pastor tries to reason with Lazarus and the group shares a meal. Meanwhile, Ronnie returns to town after being discharged from the National Guard due to his severe anxiety disorder. While searching for Rae, who has disappeared, he meets Gill, who informs...

Movie title: Danny, the Champion of the World Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1955, William Smith (Jeremy Irons), a widower, lives with his nine-year-old son, Danny (Samuel Irons), in a vardo behind the filling station and garage where he works in the English countryside. The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Danny, the Champion of the World,\\" William Smith, played by Jeremy Irons, is a widower living with his nine-year-old son Danny in the English countryside. He works at a filling station and garage, which is built on land coveted by businessman Victor Hazell. In response to Hazell's attempts to buy their land and his campaign of harassment, William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants at night. William goes out poaching multiple times during the events of the movie. He uses raisins to lure the pheasants out, hoping to exact retribution on Hazell for his hostile actions. On one occasion when William goes out poaching again at night, Danny wakes up and notices his father's absence. He decides to go look for him, driving a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing. During these nighttime activities, William engages in acts of rebellion against Victor Hazell, choosing to poach game from Hazell's property as a form of defiance. In addition to his poaching exploits, William continues to care for his son, forging a strong bond between them as they stand up to Hazell's attempts to take their land. William's nighttime actions are a reflection of his resilience and determination to preserve their home and livelihood. In conclusion, throughout the movie, William goes out at night to poach game pheasants from Hazell's land as a form of retribution for the businessman's campaign of harassment against him and his son. These nighttime poaching activities contribute to the overall plot of the film, demonstrating William's commitment to maintaining their home and his unwavering love for Danny."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: This final Voyager episode begins 23 years in the future. Voyager has made it back home. In the many years it took to return tho, the Vulcan Tuvoks' mind has been destroyed. He carried a disease they were too late getting home to cure. Captain Janeway comes across aliens who have time travel technology. She realizes, there's a Warp Conduit in the Delta Quadrant that could bring Voyager home immediately - if she could go back in time and notify Voyager. There's one problem. The Conduit is deep inside Borg Space. Janeway visits Tuvok. He's like a child. He scribbles tho, obsessed, working on math problems or movie reviews or something, he's convinced are important somehow. In the institution, Tuvok cries, asking for 'Janeway' to please, please come back to him. Janeway decides to commandeer a federation shuttle and equip it with weapons technology 20 years ahead of the Borg, in the hopes of going back in time and using this new technology to guide Voyager to the Warp Conduit. When she goes back in time and links up with Voyager, Janeway meets her younger self. The two captains disagree, arguing about the plan. The real-captain visits Tuvok asking him if it's true he has a brain disorder. Tuvok admits it's true, but it can't be cured by the facilities on the ship so he's kept it to himself. The young Captain agrees to the older Captains' plan. To increase their chances of success the older Janeway plans to distract the Borg with her shuttle craft. The Borg actually capture Janeway and her shuttle. The Borg Queen personally assimilates Captain Janeway.

Please answer the following question: In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole. Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more. Conflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings. People liked to be listened to. The illusion of having a voice was almost as good as actually having one. Isn't that why people still bothered to go to the polls on election day and vote?

She thinks the","completion":"leg warmers exude a certain retro charm, reminiscent of the 1980s fashion era, while keeping her cozy during the chilly months. However, she had been secretly coveting my statement sweater since we both laid eyes on it at Cristina's Vintage Boutique three months ago. The sweater, a one-of-a-kind piece, featured an intricate pattern of playful shapes and vibrant colors that managed to catch anyone’s attention. It was the perfect addition to Danna's bold and daring wardrobe; she just knew it would make her outfits pop even more than ever before. As thrilling as the trade was for her, Danna could sense my disappointment in losing the prized sweater. While I appreciated the practicality and functionality of leg warmers, they didn't hold the same sentimental value for me as the sweater did. I was hesitant but agreed to the trade, knowing that Danna's happiness was worth more than holding onto a material possession, even if it held great memories and had become a part of my personal style. Danna noticed my uneasiness during the trade and suggested we make a pact: if either of us ever regretted the trade or had second thoughts, we could swap back our items with no questions asked. This suggestion provided me with a sense of relief, knowing that if ever I missed the sweater, I could retrieve it from Danna. With our newfound pact in place, we both began to relax and let ourselves truly enjoy our new treasures. Over the next few weeks, Danna experimented with various ways to style the statement sweater. She paired it with high-waisted jeans, denim skirts, and even leather pants, solidifying its place as the centerpiece of her outfits. Meanwhile, I discovered the multiple advantages of owning a pair of leg warmers. Not only did they keep my legs toasty, they also added a touch of unique flair to my outfits. I even managed to revive some old dresses and skirts I hadn't worn in years by combining them with the leg warmers and a pair of opaque tights. What we both began to realize during this time was that our trade had not only satisfied an urge for new fashion items but also pushed us to embrace our creativity and play with our personal style. The sweater and leg warmers sparked our imagination, allowing us to experiment with different combinations and express our individuality through fashion. As the months passed by, Danna and I became even closer, with our friendship deepening and providing a solid foundation for honest communication. When we finally revisited our trade pact, we decided that it wasn't necessary to swap back the items; we had come to appreciate and value what each piece brought into our lives, and we knew that our bond was strong regardless of what clothing we possessed. In the end, the trade of the leg warmers for the statement sweater was more than just an exchange of material possessions. It was an affirmation of our friendship, a testament to our ability to prioritize each other's happiness, and a valuable reminder that personal growth can come from the most unexpected places, including our own closets."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

My processor quickly analyzed the tense atmosphere, revealing the gravity of the situation at hand. The thirteen jurors appeared to be an eclectic mix of individuals from various backgrounds, each one emanating a sense of responsibility and duty to fulfill their role within the trial. Some stared with inquisitive eyes, while others held expressions of stoic resolve. The diversity among the jurors could be an indication that they had been carefully selected to ensure a balanced and fair ruling. The long, rectangular table served as a barrier of sorts between the jurors and the crowd, keeping the decision-makers separate and impartial. Behind the crowd, a large window let in streams of otherworldly light that danced across the courtroom. The illumination, while seemingly mundane, was a subtle reminder of the strange, ethereal world the trial was taking place in. Meanwhile, Luis, presumably the judge or arbitrator, appeared apathetic. Despite his central role, he looked disinterested, his demeanor reflecting a weariness with the systems and processes he embodied. Perhaps he has overseen countless trials, each with its own drama and heartache, eroding his enthusiasm for justice. Contrasting starkly with Luis, the three unhappy-looking demons at the other table seemed to represent the defendants. Each demon exuded a mixture of anger, fear, and resentment, aware that they were being held accountable for actions they may or may not regret. Their downturned mouths, unnervingly strong jaws, and glowing eyes were indicative of their otherworldly origin and, possibly, their demonic hierarchical orders. The empty seats separating the defendants from the prosecution appeared strategic, maintaining a physical gap between the two parties to reduce distractions or unwanted interactions. The demoness and imp on the side of the prosecution held an air of determination and focus, their expressions and postures communicating their dedication to obtaining a guilty verdict. The demoness seemed experienced and skilled, while her imp associate exuded eagerness to prove himself in the courtroom. As my gaze returned to the setting at large, I couldn't help but reflect on the complex interplay of emotions, motivations, and power dynamics within the room. Each participant had their part to play, tendrils of influence weaving together to create a tapestry of law and justice, albeit with an otherworldly twist. Amidst the stark supernatural elements, the similarities between this courtroom and those found in the human world are striking. Both worlds are bound by the pursuit of justice, fairness, and the determination to maintain order and accountability for actions taken. In recognizing these common threads, one can't help but question the deeper connections that bind our existence, transcending the boundaries of what is natural and supernatural."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dans cette déclaration, POSCO affirme que plusieurs facteurs ont contribué à la réduction des prix sur le marché canadien au cours de cette période. Tout d'abord, la récession économique mondiale qui a eu un impact sur de nombreux secteurs et entreprises à travers le monde. Cette situation a peut-être forcé les entreprises à réduire leurs coûts et à adopter des mesures d'austérité pour faire face à la crise. Deuxièmement, Stelco, une entreprise canadienne de production et de commercialisation d'acier, a adopté une stratégie de marketing agressif. Leur objectif était d'augmenter leur flux de trésorerie pour faire face à la crise financière grave qu'ils traversaient. Cela les a peut-être amenés à réduire leurs prix pour attirer plus de clients, ce qui a entraîné une baisse des prix sur l'ensemble du marché. Enfin, l'entrée de Sorevco sur le marché a également contribué à la baisse des prix. Sorevco est une autre entreprise du secteur de l'acier, et son entrée sur le marché a peut-être provoqué une augmentation de la concurrence, obligeant ainsi les entreprises existantes à réduire leurs prix pour rester compétitives.

Usage: In the example, the question asks \\"What is being watched?\\" After reading the passage, you must choose between \\"Eggs cooking on the stove\\" and \\"his son pour the milk.\\" The passage does reference both actions, however, it is more implicit that the eggs are being watched as they are cooked on the stove. So the correct answer to the question should be \\"Eggs cooking on the stove\\".

This assessment is based on the following aspects of the sentence structure and the choice of words. 1. \\"Idiosyncratic\\" generally refers to unique or peculiar characteristics, something that sets the movie apart from others. In this context, it suggests that the movie possesses a distinctive quality that differentiates it from other films with similar premises. 2. \\"Enough\\" indicates that there is an adequate degree of the idiosyncrasy, suggesting that this unique element plays a significant role in the overall movie experience. The word \\"enough\\" has a positive connotation in this context because it implies that the idiosyncratic nature of the movie is just the right amount to make a difference. 3. \\"To lift\\" conveys a sense of improvement or elevation. In this sentence, it implies that the movie rises above its basic premise because of its idiosyncrasies. This phrasing gives the impression that the movie excels beyond its initial expectations, which is a positive sentiment. 4. \\"Above its playwriting 101 premise\\" refers to the basic or elementary nature of the movie's plot or story. By using the term \\"playwriting 101,\\" the sentence suggests that the movie's premise may be somewhat simplistic or formulaic. However, the fact that the movie's idiosyncrasies enable it to rise above this basic premise indicates that it overcomes its potential shortcomings, making it a more engaging and enjoyable experience for viewers. Overall, the sentiment of the sentence praises the unique and distinctive aspects of the movie that set it apart from others and overcome its potential limitations. The combination of uplifting and positive words like \\"idiosyncratic,\\" \\"enough,\\" and \\"to lift,\\" along with the acknowledgment of the film transcending its initial premise, results in the sentiment being recognized as positive."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The sudden burst of spring produce in the market after a long, monotonous winter of cavolo nero and bright oranges is one of the things that constantly reminds me why I love living and eating in Italy. A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn’t, in that you won’t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they’re not particularly difficult to find now. They’re just one of those special things that don’t last long. Blink and you’ll miss them, or come late to the market and they could easily be sold out. It’s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course). If you’ve never tasted agretti before, it’s worth seeking out if you’re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In March 2012, researchers in the United States announce that they have developed the first wirelessly controlled device that can supply a drug directly into the body. A small chip is implanted under the skin. It contains the medicine, which it releases at preset times. The developers say the device could improve the lives of millions of people who take medicine for long-term illnesses. A company called MicroCHIPS began developing the device about fifteen years ago. Last month, the company released the results of its first successful tests in humans. The tests took place in Denmark with seven women with osteoporosis. Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and break easily. The disorder is common among older people, especially women. Many patients have to give themselves daily injections of medicine. One type of treatment requires injections for two years. Robert farra is the president of MicroCHIPS. He says many patients stop taking the medicine because of the pain and stress of the injections and that only twenty-five percent of the patients will go through the entire twenty-four months of treatment. The microchip is a few centimeters long. It has small sections that each hold a single dose of medicine. Mr. Farra says the device has to be programmed with the times to release the drug and that doctors will be able to reprogram the device from a computer or even a cell phone. The seven women in the study were aged sixty-five to seventy. The researchers say the implants were just as effective as daily injections. And they say the dosage amounts were more exact than patients often give themselves. The microchips in the study held only twenty doses of medicine. Mr. Farra and his team are now designing a version that could hold a full year's worth of medicine. Robert Farra says, \\"The new version may take us two years, and then we may be required to do two additional trials, taking about four years before the device is available on the commercial scale.\\" Options: A It can release exact amount of medicine. B It can free patients the pain and stress of injections. C it held only twenty doses of medicine. D It is as effective as daily injections. Answer: C it held only twenty doses of medicine.

I can use this background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. Now, I have a new situation: When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first. Answer this question please: Which team lead a less safer experiment?

However, we can infer a few key points that can help us construct a possible scenario. Mona and Nel appear to be friends or acquaintances, and they were waiting for Nel's return from out of town. From their conversation, it could be assumed that Mona wanted to discuss a specific event or activity happening on Monday at 6 PM, and she wanted Nel to join her there. Their conversation style suggests casual, informal interaction, potentially indicating that the event or activity they are discussing is likely recreational or social in nature. Some possible events or activities they could have been discussing include a party, a concert, a movie, a sports event, or a casual gathering of friends.

Macro analysis has its basis in the large (Macro) tendencies observed in the economy. Your goal is to understand how major forces are affecting the performance of the economy. Then, base your investment decisions on your findings. For example, if the economy is performing poorly (inflation and unemployment are high while national output is low), avoid overpaying for stocks and be sure to diversify your stocks. The most important macro indicators include: GDP (gross domestic product), CPI (consumer price indices), PPI (producer price indices), unemployment rate, interest rates (Fed Funds, prime rate, etc.), inflation rate, and balance of trade. You can either download the historical data to Excel or access an interactive graph using online tools. Go to the websites of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (http://www.bea.gov/) or the Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/) to access the data. Look for the general direction that the numbers are moving in and any patterns that may emerge. Take into account: the historical data you found, current data, and news. The website will have a separate series of data already converted to percent for either Year over Year or Quarter over Quarter. If not, you can determine the percentage of change for an indicator. For example, divide the nominal GDP (in numbers) of one year by the value from the previous year. This gives you the GDP growth percentage for Year over Year. Investing in a broad based stock or stock alternative might be the most convenient with this method of analysis. Select a group of stocks that reflect the movement of the broader economy and track an index like the Dow Jones Industrial average or S&P 500. This approach allows you to enjoy the growth of stocks in the US in general without risking all your money on one or just a few stocks. Understand that macro analysis doesn't specifically help you decide which individual stocks to buy. Instead, it simply lets you understand the performance of the economy. For example, you may want to buy stocks when you think the economy will improve and sell when you think it will deteriorate.","completion":"This article explains how to use macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, CPI, PPI, unemployment rate, interest rates, inflation rate, and balance of trade to analyze the performance of the economy and make informed investment decisions, focusing on broad indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500, rather than individual stocks."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The correct answer is \\"Russia is exactly what five years of 'reset' has now achieved,\\" because the passage discusses the international crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the need for a strong response. The other options are incorrect for various reasons: 1. Provoking Barack Obama, Congress, House of Representatives, Rubio, Senate, or Washington doesn't make sense in the context of this passage. These subjects are not directly related to the international crisis or the \\"reset.\\" 2. Cotton is not relevant to the passage, which deals with the international crisis. 3.

These vibrations in air create sound waves that travel from the source to another location, either purposefully (as in communication signals) or incidentally (as in background noise). Animals are able to generate and perceive sounds of various frequencies, depending on their anatomical and physiological adaptations. By making vibrations in the air, animals can communicate with each other in several different ways. These may include long-range methods, such as howls, calls or songs to locate a mate, to warn other members of their species about predators or other dangers, or to mark territory. Other types of communication using sound are more close-range, like the soft vocalizations or purrs some animals use to indicate pleasure or comfort. In many species, sound signals can also convey information about the signaler, such as their age, size, health, or reproductive state. For example, birds use distinctive songs and calls to communicate with other birds in their species; whales and dolphins use echolocation clicks and calls to navigate their environment and communicate with their pods; and insects, such as cicadas and crickets, generate sounds by rubbing or striking their body parts to attract mates and establish territory. It is important to note that the other options; activation energy, something to move, sleeping, sustenance, heart rate, food and shelter, and tasting; are not directly related to vibrations in air, and therefore do not answer the question based on the two provided facts. Although some of these options may have indirect connections to sound or vibration (e.g., sleeping can be influenced by sound, and heart rate can be responsive to various stimulations), they do not accurately represent the primary purpose or use of vibrations in air by animals as presented in the facts.

By James Titcomb PUBLISHED: 13:46 EST, 5 July 2012 | UPDATED: 14:22 EST, 5 July 2012 Two carers nicknamed 'the matrons from hell' were jailed today after they subjected disabled care home residents to a series of abuses. Joanne Robinson, 47, and Ann Leach, 48, assaulted, starved and humiliated two defenceless residents for almost two years while scared colleagues said nothing at a home in Farnsworth, near Bolton. One of their victims, a 44-year-old woman who couldn't speak and was virtually blind, was strapped to a wheelchair as 'punishment' and locked inside her bedroom as she sobbed and screamed. and","completion":"the other, a 52-year-old man with severe learning difficulties, was often left without food or water for extended periods. The abuse finally came to light when a new employee witnessed Robinson and Leach's cruel actions and bravely reported them to the police. The investigation revealed a pattern of appalling treatment by the two women, who had complete control over their vulnerable victims. Sentenced at Bolton Crown Court today, Robinson received a three-year prison sentence, and Leach was handed two years and eight months behind bars. Judge Angela Nield stated that their actions were 'despicable' and a 'betrayal of trust' as they were responsible for the well-being of these vulnerable individuals. The families of the victims have expressed their relief that justice has finally been served and hope that stricter regulations and oversight will prevent future incidents of abuse in care homes. In response to the case, the care home in Farnsworth has taken immediate action, firing Robinson and Leach, as well as implementing new policies to protect its residents. Awareness campaigns are now being launched in an effort to prevent abuse and encourage more people to report suspected incidents, ensuring the safety of all care home residents."},{"prompt":"Question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Although her flaky mother (Jill Clayburgh) encourages her to return home, Annie rents a bedroom from British immigrant Gil (Matt Lucas) and his lazy overweight sister Brynn (Rebel Wilson). She has a sexual no-strings-attached relationship with the self-absorbed Ted (Jon Hamm) but hopes for something more. Only her friendship with Lillian Donovan (Maya Rudolph) keeps her sane.Lillian becomes engaged to a wealthy banker living in Chicago and asks Annie to be her maid of honor. At the engagement party at Lillian's house, Annie meets her fellow bridesmaids: Lillian's cynical cousin Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), idealistic friend Becca (Ellie Kemper), raunchy future sister-in-law Megan (Melissa McCarthy) and Helen Harris, III (Rose Byrne), the beautiful but vain wife of Lillian's fiance's boss.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the title of the work that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major? , can you please find it? Handel's music for Messiah is distinguished from most of his other oratorios by an orchestral restraint—a quality which the musicologist Percy M. Young observes was not adopted by Mozart and other later arrangers of the music. The work begins quietly, with instrumental and solo movements preceding the first appearance of the chorus, whose entry in the low alto register is muted. A particular aspect of Handel's restraint is his limited use of trumpets throughout the work. After their introduction in the Part I chorus \\"Glory to God\\", apart from the solo in \\"The trumpet shall sound\\" they are heard only in \\"Hallelujah\\" and the final chorus \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\". It is this rarity, says Young, that makes these brass interpolations particularly effective: \\"Increase them and the thrill is diminished\\". In \\"Glory to God\\", Handel marked the entry of the trumpets as da lontano e un poco piano, meaning \\"quietly, from afar\\"; his original intention had been to place the brass offstage (in disparte) at this point, to highlight the effect of distance. In this initial appearance the trumpets lack the expected drum accompaniment, \\"a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III\\" according to Luckett.Although Messiah is not in any particular key, Handel's tonal scheme has been summarised by the musicologist Anthony Hicks as \\"an aspiration towards D major\\", the key musically associated with light and glory. As the oratorio moves forward with various shifts in key to reflect changes in mood, D major emerges at significant points, primarily the \\"trumpet\\" movements with their uplifting messages. It is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending. In the absence of a predominant key, other integrating elements have been proposed. For example, the musicologist Rudolf Steglich has suggested that Handel used the device of the \\"ascending fourth\\" as a unifying motif; this device most noticeably occurs in the first two notes of \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" and on numerous other...","completion":"The work that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major is Handel's Messiah.

He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling.

I can use this background: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. Now, I have a new situation: People in the coastal area naturally get more iodide from food items because the soil has more iodized salt. But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally. Answer this question please: Where people are more at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland? A:","completion":"People living in inland areas are typically more at risk of mental retardation due to iodine deficiency when compared to those living in coastal areas. This is because the soil in coastal regions often contains higher levels of iodized salt, which then translates to a higher iodine content in the locally grown food and water supply. Consequently, individuals living in coastal areas are more likely to consume sufficient amounts of iodine through their regular diet by consuming seafood such as saltwater fish and seaweed, like kelp, which are naturally rich in iodine. On the other hand, people living in inland regions, where the soil lacks necessary iodine, are less likely to consume sufficient iodine through their diet. Crops grown in iodine-deficient soils do not provide adequate amounts of iodine, which can lead to malnutrition. As a result, these individuals are at a higher risk of experiencing iodine deficiency disorders, including thyroid gland dysfunction, goiter, and mental retardation. Mental retardation, specifically due to iodine deficiency-related issues, is more prevalent in inland populations because iodine is an essential micronutrient required for proper brain development and cognitive function. This is particularly important during pregnancy and early childhood, as iodine deficiencies during these critical developmental stages can lead to intellectual disabilities, psychomotor impairment, and delayed speech and motor milestones. To help mitigate this risk in regions where iodine is insufficient, the World Health Organization and other global health authorities recommend and promote the use of iodized salt. Iodizing table salt is an effective, inexpensive, and easily accessible way to ensure adequate iodine intake for both coastal and inland populations, thus reducing the risk of iodine deficiency-related developmental and cognitive disorders, including mental retardation. In summary, people residing in inland areas are generally more at risk of mental retardation due to iodine deficiency when compared to those living in coastal regions. To address this issue, the use of iodized salt is recommended as a means of ensuring adequate iodine intake for both coastal and inland populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press) Gwen Bush stands outside a shelter at Gotha Middle School in Orange County, Monday, morning, Sept. 11, 2017, in Windermere, Fla. She'd tried to shelter from the storm at her home, though watched through... (Associated Press) Florida residents braced for days for Hurricane Irma, which encompassed nearly the entire peninsula as it marched north through the state. When day broke, many got their first glimpse of the storm's destruction. Some expressed relief that they had appeared to have dodged a bullet. Others were clearly shaken by a storm more powerful than many had ever seen. Their stories provide a glimpse into the extensive reach of Irma's wrath: A NEW HOME, LEFT BEHIND Felicia Clark and Johnny Thompson spent Saturday moving into their new house in St. Petersburg, on Florida's Gulf Coast. After a long day, with forecasts on the late news showing that Irma was headed their way, they decided to leave it behind. They packed some clothes and toiletries and hopped in the car around 1 a.m. Sunday with their two dogs, Gracie and Roscoe. They headed north, making it all the way to downtown Atlanta before they found a hotel with rooms available. Caught in traffic with others who'd decided to flee the storm, the drive that should have taken about seven hours took more than 14. They've spent much of their time in Atlanta watching storm coverage on television. When Thompson took the dogs out for a walk in nearby Centennial Olympic Park on Sunday night, he met numerous other evacuated Florida residents. Clark and Thompson were worried about their new home, but word finally arrived from family members who stayed behind. Some tree limbs fell in their yard, but the house wasn't damaged. ___ GRATEFUL BUT WORRIED Gwen Bush watched from her window early Monday morning as the water rose around her central Florida home. She had been sitting in darkness for hours as she listened to trees snap and water bubble. When it began to seep under her front door, she thought of the scenes of Hurricane Harvey in Texas that she had seen on TV. \\"I was scared to death, I thought I was gonna die,\\" she said. \\"I can't swim and the water kept rising; it was all the way up to my windows. I actually thought I was not going to live through this. I started praying.\\" Bush saw the National Guard and firefighters outside with boats and big trucks. She grabbed a hurricane kit she'd packed the day before, pushed open the door, and waded through thigh-deep water to reach the rescuers, who took her to a shelter a few miles (kilometers) away. As day broke, she was grateful to be alive — but worried about the future. She had frantically tried to stack her belongings on top of beds and cabinets as the water rushed in, but she assumes she probably lost almost everything in her rented home. Bush, 50, works as a security guard at a sports and music venue in Orlando, and only gets paid when she works. Concerts and shows have been canceled in the days leading up to the storm, and she's not sure when she'll be able to get back to work. As the storm closed in, she spent the last 10 she had on food and water. now she has nothing left but the red sweatsuit she escaped in. Even her shoes were ruined by the water and muck. \\"How are we gonna survive from here?\\" she asked. \\"What's going to happen now? I just don't know.\\" ___ WORSE THAN ANDREW West of Miami, in Sweetwater, the din of chainsaws and generators filled the Monday morning air. Irma's floodwaters had inundated streets and lapped at people's doors as the storm stomped through, but mostly receded a day later. Fallen trees lined streets along with cars that got stuck in floodwaters. On the town's main drag, weary-eyed residents cleared branches, while city trucks with giant metal claws plucked away bigger debris. Jesus Castillo, 50, said at least a foot (0.30 meters) of water pooled outside his home. \\"My entire patio was underwater,\\" he said. Around the corner, a group of friends helped a woman clear a large tree that had splintered like a toothpick. Over the backyard fence, 62-year-old Bayardo Perez wrestled with a mangled tin shed roof. He has lived in the house for decades and carries memories of previous storms. \\"This one was worse than Andrew for me,\\" he said, finally getting the crumpled roof free and walking off to throw it on a pile of debris. ___ SWAMPED BUT RESILIENT In Bonita Springs, on the Gulf Coast south of Fort Myers, Kelly McClenthen and her boyfriend, Daniel Harrison, put on waders to enter her neighborhood Monday and they needed them: About 5 feet (1.5 meters) of river water stood under her home, which is on stilts. The main living area was fine, she said, but everything on the ground level was destroyed. \\"My washer and dryer are floating around in my utility room,\\" she said. The same area flooded during a storm about two weeks ago, Harrison said, and that cleanup was still a work in progress. Now they'll start over. \\"We weathered it out. We've got a lot of damage, a lot of cleanup. But we'll get through it. No doubt,\\" said Harrison. ___ SEEKING SHELTER AND TRYING TO KEEP DRY At Germain Arena in Estero, south of Fort Myers, where thousands sought shelter from the storm, people sat amid puddles on the concrete floor Monday morning. Rainwater leaked at the height of the storm. \\"Irma went over and we were all like, 'Oh good, we survived.' And then all of a sudden, some of the panels came off the roof, I guess, and we started getting water pouring down in different places,\\" said evacuee Mary Fitzgerald, 61. \\"It was like, 'Oh my God, what is going to happen?'\\" The water stopped coming in after the eyewall passed, and people were streaming out to go check on their homes as the sun came up. ___ Associated Press writers Jay Reeves in Bonita Springs and Estero, Florida; Claire Galofaro in Windermere; Jason Dearen in Sweetwater, Florida; and Kate Brumback in Atlanta contributed to this report. ||||| MIAMI (AP) — Once-fearsome Hurricane Irma weakened Monday to a still-dangerous tropical storm as it spread high winds and rain across the Southeast, one day after engulfing most of the Florida peninsula. Both of Florida's coasts were pounded by storm surges, thousands of its residents remain in shelters and millions of homes and businesses around several states are without power. IRMA, WHAT'S NEXT? Still hundreds of miles (kilometers) wide, the huge storm system is dumping very heavy rain into southern parts of Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama with Mississippi and Tennessee to follow. By Monday afternoon, the former Category 5 hurricane had top sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph) as it continued weakening while heading into south Georgia. The storm's core was centered about 2 p.m. EDT about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south-southeast of Albany, Georgia. ___ THE DAMAGE Irma wreaked havoc over nearly the entire Florida peninsula from the southernmost Keys to the Georgia line, from the Atlantic to the Gulf coasts. It swamped homes, uprooted massive trees, flooded streets, cast boats ashore, snapped power lines and toppled construction cranes. Flooding triggered home evacuations in parts of Jacksonville, north Florida, and caused damage in the Orlando area at the center of the state. The full breadth of the damage remains unclear, particularly in the hard-hit Keys, where communications and travel were still difficult. Though the majority of the outages were in Florida, more than 7 million homes and businesses lost power during Irma's passage. ___ THE DEATH TOLL One death in Florida, of a man killed in an auto accident during the storm, has been blamed on Irma. At least 36 people were left dead in the storm's wake across the Caribbean. __ WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE FLORIDA KEYS? The Navy is sending an aircraft carrier to Key West to provide emergency services. An update from Monroe County describes \\"an astounding recovery effort\\" taking place in the Florida Keys , where there was no water, power or cellphone service after the storm. The USS Lincoln aircraft carrier will be anchored off Key West to provide emergency services, and three other Navy vessels are en route. Officials said the National Guard has arrived in the island chain, and state transportation officials have cleared six of 42 bridges as safe for travel. However, roads remain closed because of debris. ___ FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS Big airports in Florida remain closed, and flight cancellations are spreading along the track of Tropical Storm Irma outside Florida. More than 3,800 U.S. flights scheduled for Monday were canceled by late morning — and more than 9,000 since Saturday — according to tracking service FlightAware. Delta Air Lines is scrapping 900 flights Monday, including many at its Atlanta hub. American Airlines said it won't resume flights in Miami until at least Tuesday while canceling 300 flights in Charlotte, North Carolina, due to wind. ___ SOUTHEAST SCHOOL CLOSINGS, SHELTERS Schools and businesses were closed across Alabama as Irma moved inland. Many classrooms also were closed in Georgia as it was under a tropical storm warning much of Monday. Hotels across Alabama also filled up with evacuees from Florida. ____ HURRICANE NEWSLETTER — Get the best of the AP's all-formats reporting on Irma and Harvey in your inbox: http://apne.ws/ahYQGtb ||||| Summary:","completion":"Florida residents are trying to come to terms with Hurricane Irma, a storm whose extensive reach has caused loss, stress, and grief. As Irma moved through Florida, residents experienced flooding, wind damage, and lengthy evacuations. For some, their new homes were left unharmed, while others lost almost everything they owned. Many compared the storm's impact to previous hurricanes, such as Hurricane Andrew. As the storm weakened and moved further northwards, millions of homes and businesses in several states were without power. The full extent of Hurricane Irma's damages in Florida is still unclear, but recovery efforts in the Florida Keys are underway."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm giving it a 1-star rating, and I truly believe that's being generous. First and foremost, the app is incredibly slow and unresponsive. It takes ages to load any content, and often crashes mid-action, which makes navigating through it beyond frustrating. The user interface is also cluttered and incredibly hard to follow. The menus are disorganized, and the color palette is garish, making it difficult to understand what's happening on the screen. Moreover, the app is filled with bugs and glitches that constantly disrupt the user experience. The login system, for example, is a nightmare - it often logs me out randomly or doesn't even let me log in to begin with. In the rare instances where it does work, I'm bombarded with intrusive ads that are inescapable and often cause the app to crash again. To make matters worse, the customer support is practically non-existent. Whenever I tried to reach out for assistance, I received either generic unhelpful responses or no response at all. It's evident that there is a lack of proper communication between the development team and users, resulting in significant user dissatisfaction. In summary, the com.adam.aslfms app is a massive disappointment. Between its constant crashes, bewildering interface, egregious bugs and glitches, and subpar customer support, I cannot recommend this app to anyone. I strongly suggest looking elsewhere for a better, more reliable alternative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

English:"},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Mordred or Modred (Medrod, etc.) is a character in the Arthurian legend, known as a notorious traitor who fought King Arthur at the Battle of Camlann, where he was killed and Arthur fatally wounded. Tradition varies on his relationship to Arthur, but he is best known today as Arthur's illegitimate son by his half-sister Morgause, though in many modern adaptations Morgause is merged with the character of Morgan le Fay. In earlier literature, he was considered the legitimate son of Morgause, also known as Anna, with her husband King Lot of Orkney. His brothers or half-brothers are Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth. The name (from either Old Welsh Medraut, Cornish Modred, or Old Breton Modrot) is ultimately derived from Latin \\"Modertus\\". - Sir Gareth (Old French: Guerrehet) was a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. He is nicknamed \\"Beaumains\\" in Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\". He was the youngest son of Lot and of Morgause, King Arthur's half-sister, thus making him Arthur's nephew, as well as brother to Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and half-brother to Mordred. - Lot or Loth is the king of Lothian in the Arthurian legend. He is best known as the father of Sir Gawain. Such a ruler first appeared late in the 1st millennium's hagiographical material concerning Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), which feature a \\"Leudonus\\", king of \\"Leudonia\\", a Latin name for Lothian. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth adapted this to Lot, king of Lothian, in his influential chronicle \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\", portraying him as King Arthur's brother-in-law and ally. In the wake of Geoffrey's writings, Lot appeared regularly in later romance. - The Eagle is the final novel in the A Dream of Eagles series ( published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles ) . The Eagle follows the continuing story of Clothar ( Lancelot ) from when he meets Arthur Pendragon , to , and possibly after , King Arthur 's death . It also is noted for having a sympathetic portrait of Mordred . The novel was released on November 19 , 2005 in Canada and was released in the United States in 2007 . - Jack Whyte (born 1940) is a Scottish-Canadian novelist of historical fiction. Born and raised in Scotland, Whyte has been living in Canada since 1967. He resides in Kelowna, British Columbia. - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. - A Dream of Eagles is a historical novel series written by the Canadian author Jack Whyte. It was published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles. - Sir Lancelot du Lac (meaning Lancelot of the lake, baptised as Galahad) was one of the Knights of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. He typically features as King Arthur's greatest companion, the lord of Joyous Gard and the greatest swordsman and jouster of the age until his adultery with Queen Guinevere is discovered, causing a civil war exploited by Mordred which brings about the end of Arthur's kingdom. - Morgause is a character in later Arthurian traditions, appearing in Thomas Malory's 15th-century text \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" as the mother of Gawain and Mordred, both key players in the story of King Arthur and his downfall. Mordred is the offspring of Arthur's inadvertent incest with Morgause, the king's estranged half-sister. She is also a sister of Morgan le Fay and the wife of King Lot of Orkney, as well as the mother of Gareth, Agravain, and Gaheris. - Sir Galahad (sometime referred to as Galeas or Galath ), in Arthurian legend, is a knight of King Arthur's Round Table and one of the three achievers of the Holy Grail. He is the illegitimate son of Sir Lancelot and Elaine of Corbenic, and is renowned for his gallantry and purity. Emerging quite late in the medieval Arthurian tradition, Sir Galahad first appears in the LancelotGrail cycle, and his story is taken up in later works such as the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\". - Sir Agravain (sometimes spelled Agravaine) is a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian Legend. In Chrétien de Troyes, the Vulgate, Post-Vulgate cycles and Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\", he is the second eldest son of King Lot of Orkney with Anna/Morgause/Morgan (Arthur's sister), thus nephew of King Arthur, and brother to Sir Gawain, Gaheris, and Gareth, and half-brother to Mordred.

Article:On Monday, Mr Obama told the Reuters news agency he had \\"made it very clear\\" China had to change its policy if it wanted to do business with the US. But Beijing said it needed the powers to combat terrorism and tackle leaks. It also suggested the West was guilty of having double standards. \\"The legislation is China's domestic affair, and we hope the US side can take a right, sober and objective view towards it,\\" said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying. \\"On the information-security issue, there was a [recent] media revelation that a certain country embedded spying software in the computer system of another country's Sim card maker, for surveillance activities. This is only one out of the recently disclosed cases. \\"All countries are paying close attention to this and taking measures to safeguard their own information security, an act that is beyond any reproach.\\" The case she was referring to involved allegations that US cyber-spies had hacked a Dutch Sim card manufacturer in order to help decrypt their targets' communications. At another press conference, parliamentary spokeswoman Fu Ying drew attention to the fact that the US government had imposed restrictions on Chinese companies including Huawei and ZTE. And she suggested that Beijing's proposals were in line with the same kind of access to internet correspondence sought by the US and British governments. \\"We will definitely continue to listen to extensive concerns and all the parties' views, so we can make the law's formulation more rigorous,\\" she added. The rules are part of a proposed counter-terrorism law set to be discussed by China's annual parliament session, the National People's Congress (NPC), which opens on Thursday. President Obama's comments had followed the publication of a fresh draft of the proposed law, which was made public last week. It \\"would essentially force all foreign companies, including US companies, to turn over to the Chinese government mechanisms where they can snoop and keep track of all the users of those services\\", the US leader said. \\"As you might imagine tech companies are not going to be willing to do that,\\" he added. Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle and IBM are among firms that would potentially be affected. While the comments by Chinese officials were measured, the government's press service, Xinhua, was more critical. It accused the US leader of arrogance and hypocrisy, noting that the FBI had criticised Apple and Google last year for building encryption into their smartphone operating systems, and again drew attention to allegations about the US National Security Agency's activities made public by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. \\"With transparent procedures, China's anti-terrorism campaign will be different from what the United States has done: letting the surveillance authorities run amok and turn counter-terrorism into paranoid espionage and peeping on its civilians and allies,\\" Xinhua wrote. \\"Contrary to the accusations of the United States, China's anti-terror law will put no unfair regulatory pressures on foreign companies, because the provisions will apply to both domestic and foreign firms.\\" The Conservative party has indicated it wants to expand the UK's cyber-spies' surveillance powers it if wins the May election. \\"Our manifesto will make clear that we will... use all the legal powers available to us to make sure that, where appropriate, the intelligence and security agencies have the maximum capability to intercept the communications of suspects while making sure that such intrusive techniques are properly overseen,\\" Home Secretary Theresa May told Parliament in January. One expert said it should be no surprise that the West was finding it difficult to prevent China seeking greater cyber-surveillance powers of its own, but added there were good reasons to fear its proposals. \\"Either behind the scenes or increasingly openly, the US and UK are justifying similar behaviour for their own purposes, but are extremely concerned when China asks for its own capabilities,\\" said Dr Joss Wright, from the Oxford Internet Institute. \\"But what we don't want to see is a world in which internet-based products and services are riddled with backdoors by every state that says it needs to act against terrorism. \\"Backdoors are always a concern because they result in a system that is insecure by default, and which can be exploited.

An example of this theory in action would be as follows: An emotion-evoking stimulus (snake) triggers a pattern of physiological response (increased heart rate, faster breathing, etc.), which is interpreted as a particular emotion (fear). This theory is supported by experiments in which by manipulating the bodily state induces a desired emotional state. Some people may believe that emotions give rise to emotion-specific actions: e.g. \\"I'm crying because I'm sad,\\" or \\"I ran away because I was scared.\\" The issue with the James–Lange theory is that of causation (bodily states causing emotions and being a priori), not that of the bodily influences on emotional experience (which can be argued and is still quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and embodiment theory). Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): In this theory, what action evokes an emotion?","completion":"In the James-Lange theory, the action that evokes an emotion is the physiological response to an emotion-evoking stimulus.

The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day). Fruit juice consumption on average increased with country income level. - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - The Picornavirales are an order of viruses with vertebrate, insect, and plant hosts. This group consists of viruses which have positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes. - Cheravirus is a genus of viruses in the order Picornavirales, in the family Secoviridae. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are currently four species in this genus including the type species Cherry rasp leaf virus. - An accessory fruit (sometimes called \\"false fruit\\", \\"spurious fruit\\", \\"pseudofruit\\", or \\"pseudocarp\\") is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue exterior to the carpel. Examples of accessory tissue are the receptacle of the strawberry, pineapple, common fig, and mulberry, and the calyx of \\"Gaultheria procumbens\\" or \\"Syzygium jambos\\". Pomes, such as apples and pears, are also accessory fruits, with much of the fruit flesh derived from a hypanthium. Other example could be the \\"anthocarps\\" specific to the family Nyctaginaceae, where most of the fruit comes from the perianth (floral whorls). - \\"Perfume\\" is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma compounds, fixatives and solvents - used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces \\"a pleasant scent\\". - Cherry rasp leaf virus (CRLV) is a plant pathogenic virus of the order Picornavirales, family Secoviridae, subfamily Comovirinae, genus Cheravirus. - The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa) is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus \\"Fragaria\\" (collectively known as the strawberries). It is cultivated worldwide for its fruit. The fruit (which is not a botanical berry, but an aggregate accessory fruit) is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, fruit juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like lip gloss, candy, hand sanitizers, perfume, and many others. - Secoviridae is a family of viruses in the order Picornavirales. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are currently 73 species in this family, divided among 11 genera. - Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of \\"Theobroma cacao\\" seeds, roasted and ground, and often flavored with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as \\"xocoltl\\" , a Nahuatl word meaning \\"bitter water\\". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. - Sadwavirus is a genus of viruses in the order Picornavirales, in the family Secoviridae. Plants (specifically Satsuma mandarin trees) serve as natural hosts. There is currently only one species in this genus: the type species \\"Satsuma dwarf virus\\". Diseases associated with this genus include: satsuma dwarf virus disease which causes spoon-shaped leaves on citrus tree. Symptoms are enations, multiple flushing, stunting or dwarfing, reduction in number and size of leaves and fruits. The name of this genus comes from its type species: Satsuma dwarf virus. - Fragaria is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, commonly known as strawberries for their edible fruits. There are more than 20 described species and many hybrids and cultivars. The most common strawberries grown commercially are cultivars of the garden strawberry, a hybrid known as \\"Fragaria\\" × \\"ananassa\\". Strawberries have a taste that varies by cultivar, and ranges from quite sweet to rather tart. Strawberries are an important commercial fruit crop, widely grown in all temperate regions of the world.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: By. Tara Brady. PUBLISHED:. 11:12 EST, 17 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 15:59 EST, 17 February 2013. Second Lieutenant Walter Tull was the first black British Army officer. A new play about Britain's first black Army officer hopes to strengthen a campaign to award him a Military Cross. Second Lieutenant Walter Tull, who grew up in an East London orphanage, was recommended for a Military Cross for heroism on the Western Front, according to letters sent to his family after he was killed in 1918. He was commended for his 'gallantry and coolness under fire' during bloody battles in the trenches of Europe.' But the soldier never received the award, fuelling speculation he had been overlooked because of rules prohibiting officers of 'non-European descent' leading white troops. Now a play about his life is about to take to the stage this month and its writer hopes it will add fuel to the campaign to award Tull - who also played for Tottenham Hotspur - a posthumous Military Cross. Tull has been written by Phil Vasili who told The Independent on Sunday: 'Walter was made an officer during a time when it was practically expedient for the Army. 'The rules were broken because it suited the Army so to do. 'However, the rejection of his Military Cross recommendation was, I feel, because he embodied a legal contradiction as an officer of non-European descent.' The campaign has been backed by Michael Morpurgo, author of War Horse, whose recent book A Medal for Leroy, draws heavily on Tull's life story. Speaking last year he said: 'We don't know why this medal was not awarded. There shouldn't have been any black officers in the British Army. 'I think the medal commendation somehow got misplaced. We just don't know. But now is the right moment to be putting this right.' Second Lt Tull was born in Folkstone, Kent, in April 1888, the son of a carpenter from Barbados who moved to England and married a local woman. By the age of 10 his parents had died and documents on the website Findmypast.co.uk show that he was living at an orphanage in Bethnal Green, East London. Walter Tull with fellow officers after being promoted to second lieutenant in 1917. He served as an officer in Italy and France. Write caption here. Walter Tull was born in Folkstone in 1888, the son of a carpenter whose own father had been a slave. His mother, from Kent, died when he was seven and his father two years later. He and his brother were sent to an orphanage in East London. Tull's football career began in 1908 for Clapton FC. He went on to play for Tottenham Hotspur and Northampton. In 1914 he volunteered for the army and was promoted three times while training. Having been sent to France in November 1914, he returned home in May 1915 with 'acute mania' but later took part in the 1916 Battle of the Somme. On May 30, 1917 he received his officer's commission. He was sent to Italy where he was mentioned in despatches. He returned to the Western Front where, on March 25, 1918, he was killed by machine gun fire. His body was never found. He played professional football for Tottenham Hotspur - making him the first black outfield player in England's top division. On. the outbreak of war in 1914, he volunteered for the Football Battalion,. part of the 17th Middlesex Regiment, and fought in many fierce. operations, including the Battle of the Somme in 1916. He. was commissioned as an officer in May 1917 and sent to Italy where he. led his men and was mentioned in dispatches for bravery at the Battle of. Piave. Second Lt Tull was transferred to. France to take part in a push to break through the German lines at. Favreuil, in the Somme Valley. In March 1918, aged 29, he was killed. His. men tried to retrieve his body from No Man's Land but they were beaten. back by heavy enemy machine gun fire. His body was never found. The MoD said no record of the Military Cross recommendation was found in 2nd Lt Tull's service files at the National Archives. Tull will preview at Bolton's Octogan this Thursday.","completion":"A long time ago, in 1918, there was a brave man named Walter Tull who fought in a big war and helped save other people's lives. He was a black man, and he was one of the first black officers to fight in the British army. People thought he was very brave and important, and they wanted to give him a special medal called the Military Cross. But Walter Tull never got the medal, and some people think it's because he was black. Now, a man who writes plays has written a story about Walter Tull's life, and he hopes the play will help people remember how brave he was and maybe finally give him the medal he deserved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is?","completion":"A radionuclide is a radioactive nuclide, which means it is an atom with an unstable nucleus that undergoes radioactive decay. To provide a detailed understanding of radionuclides, we can break down the concept into several interconnected topics, such as the composition of an atom, the nature of radioactive decay, types of radioactive decay, and applications of radionuclides. 1. Composition of an atom: Atoms are the smallest units of matter that retain the properties of an element. An atom consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons along with electrons orbiting around the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is known as the atomic number (Z), and this determines the element. The combined number of protons and neutrons is called the mass number (A). A nuclide is a specific atom characterized by its number of protons and neutrons. 2. Nature of radioactive decay: When the nucleus of an atom is unstable, it seeks to achieve a more stable state. This instability is primarily due to an imbalance in the ratio of protons to neutrons. The nucleus achieves a more stable state through the process of radioactive decay, in which it emits particles and/or energy. As a result, the nuclide transforms into another nuclide, which may also undergo further decay until a stable nuclide is formed. 3. Types of radioactive decay: There are various modes of decay, including: a. Alpha decay: In this process, an unstable nucleus emits an alpha particle, consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This causes the parent nuclide to lose 2 protons and 2 neutrons, thereby transforming into a new nuclide. b. Beta decay: Beta decay has two types - beta-plus and beta-minus decay. In beta-minus decay, a neutron in the nucleus is converted into a proton and an electron (beta particle) is emitted. In beta-plus decay, a proton is converted into a neutron, and a positron (the antimatter counterpart of an electron) is emitted. c. Gamma decay: Following alpha or beta decay, the nucleus might remain in an excited state with excess energy. It releases this energy in the form of gamma rays, which are high-energy photons. Gamma decay does not change the number of protons or neutrons in the nucleus. 4. Applications of radionuclides: Radionuclides have various practical applications in a range of fields, such as: a. Medicine: Radionuclides are employed in diagnostic imaging techniques, such as PET (positron emission tomography) scans, and in therapeutic procedures, such as brachytherapy for cancer treatment. b. Industry: Radiography is a technique that uses gamma-emitting radionuclides to inspect the integrity of structures, such as pipelines, welds, and concrete. Additionally, nuclear gauges are used to measure density and moisture content in soil and other materials. c. Environmental monitoring: The presence of radionuclides in environmental samples, such as water, soil, or air, can provide information about geological processes and human activities potentially affecting the ecosystem. d. Research: In laboratories, radionuclides act as tracers in biological, chemical, and physical experiments, enabling scientists to study the behavior of certain elements and compounds. In conclusion, a radionuclide is a radioactive nuclide with an unstable nucleus that decays by emitting particles and/or energy. Its applications expand across various fields, making radionuclides valuable tools for discovery, innovation, and problem-solving."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The correct answer to the question: what part of the corn is used in ethanol production is as follows: Ethanol production from corn primarily utilizes the starch part of the corn kernel. The process begins with harvesting and milling the corn to separate and collect its various components, such as the germ, fiber, protein, and starch. The germ is often processed separately to extract corn oil, while the remaining components are further processed for ethanol production. Starch, the main component used for ethanol production, is broken down into simple sugars (glucose) by enzymes during a process called saccharification. Then, the glucose is fermented by yeast into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The resulting ethanol is distilled and dehydrated to obtain fuel-grade ethanol. The remaining by-products, such as corn gluten meal and dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS), can be used as animal feed or for other industrial applications."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Once there was an old farmer.

The primary port for the operation was Quanzhou in Fujian, then the center of China's maritime trade. They landed on Komodahama beach on Tsushima Island on October 5, 1274. Sō Sukekuni, governor of Tsushima, led a cavalry unit of 80 to defend the island, but he and his outnumbered unit were killed in the engagement. The Mongols and Koreans subsequently invaded Iki. Tairano Takakage, the Governor of Iki, fought the invaders with about 100 of his cavalrymen, but he killed himself after his unit was defeated. The Mongol forces landed on November 19 in Hakata Bay, a short distance from Dazaifu, the ancient administrative capital of Kyūshū. The following day brought the Battle of Bun'ei , also known as the \\"First Battle of Hakata Bay\\". The Japanese coalition force opposing them included 120 armed samurai each with a warband and likely numbered between 3,000 and 6,000 strong.

Answer the following question: Process: - People dig up coal from the ground - People burn coal for heat or electricity - Pollution from the coal goes into the sky - Coal pollution enters clouds - Clouds rain over an area - The polluted rain becomes acid rain. suppose more people use electric heating happens, how will it affect more coal is dug up. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this case would be indirectly impacting a step of the process. Let's break down the situation and understand the relation between electric heating and coal mining to have a clearer view of the impact. Using electric heating implies that there is more demand for electricity. If the primary source of electricity generation in a given region is from burning coal, the increased demand for electric heating would lead to a higher demand for electricity production. This increase in demand for electricity can, in turn, lead to the increased need for coal. Now, let's examine the steps of the process mentioned in the question: 1. People dig up coal from the ground 2. People burn coal for heat or electricity 3. Pollution from the coal goes into the sky 4. Coal pollution enters clouds 5. Clouds rain over an area 6. The polluted rain becomes acid rain The perturbation in this scenario doesn't directly impact any of the steps mentioned above. Instead, it influences the amount of coal needed during the second step, \\"People burn coal for heat or electricity.\\" As the demand for electric heating increases, it drives a greater requirement for electricity production, which in turn could lead to increased coal consumption if coal is the primary means of generating electricity. This indirect impact on coal consumption cascades down through the subsequent steps in the process, exacerbating the resulting pollution and acid rain. In this case, the perturbation affects the process indirectly by altering the energy demand side of the equation, rather than having an immediate and direct effect on any specific step in the chain. It is important to note, though, that the extent of indirect impact in this case depends on the energy mix and the specific type of power generation facilities available. If the region has cleaner energy sources like solar, wind, or nuclear power plants, the effect of increased electrical heating usage on coal mining could be minimal or even non-existent. This highlights the crucial role of transitioning to cleaner energy sources for mitigating the negative environmental impacts associated with traditional fossil fuel energy production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Well, Larry the ponytailed owner is still a nice guy, but I'm not a fan of his new concept, location, food or food he left out of new menu. This place gets a big Ooooyyy Veyyyy as the Yiddish would say. The place is way smaller than the original and for some reason he has a bar in there like he is trying to create a Jewish themed sports bar. I doubt the concept will last long , so I think he did things backwards. The new location does not offer bagels either which was a big draw for many folks because he has no oven and is under some silly shopping center restrictions that force him to not serve breakfast. My lunch was a 11 brisket sandwich to go ordered extra lean, but was extra fatty and a miserable fatty and tasteless mess. Compared to his last brisket, this was a kitchen nightmare. Additionally, he is giving you less meat (in this case a good thing) for your 11 bucks, does not offer fries as a free side anymore and his sides are very small now. The potato salad was decent and good pickles, but the star should be the meat and that fell flat. Jewish bar concept won't work in that uppity area.

I worked as an assistant in the Business Planning Department, helping with marketing for the 2007 Spring/Summer collections. Fashion is a beautiful industry. But against my expectation, it also has lots of ordinary work. Every day, I would do sample testing, prepare the brochure for future launches, and meet with customers and visitors. Japanese companies had a traditional work style. We had a meeting every morning at 9 o'clock.

Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not. Problem:I used to have this best friend, we'll call her Mary, that I met, while attending a boarding school for just one year. She was my first roommate, and we quickly became very close to each other, always hung out and had a lot of fun. The day we met, we basically knew pretty much every important detail that had to be said about ourselves within an hour or so, and I had never felt such a strong connection with any other friend I had ever had. We were both very depressive at the time, but it was especially rough for her, because of some problems with her family. I would often try to support her as much as I possibly could with the surplus of energy I had, as well as sitting up all night to comfort her, when she needed me. Whenever she was mad at me, I would try to make it up to her and deal with it, so we would avoid any kind of conflict. Basically, I wanted to please her in every way, since she meant a lot to me. As a minimum, you could study at the boarding school for one year, while the maximum amount of years you could attend the school was 3 years. Though I had plans about attending the school for two years, instead of just one, I got talked into just getting a youth education, while she decided to stick around for another year. During that year, she was really depressed, felt lonely without me there, as well as feeling like an outcast. When I went to visit her at the school, I would often see her with new cuts on her arm, which made me feel really bad about myself, since I felt like I had let her down, though I stayed in contact through social media. I don't know, if any of that has got to do with what happened later on. If so, that is taken into account. A youth education here usually takes between 2-3 years, and when I started my 3rd year, she was in her 1st year, we had both made new friends during the time we had spent apart, and she seemed a little annoyed that I had gotten close with another girl, we'll call her Diana, but never mentioned anything about it (until later, when we had a fight). (At this point in time, I had a boyfriend, who wasn't very faithful to me, and since we were close, I felt like I could tell her everything and get help from her, just like I used to help her. Him being unfaithful made me very jealous. This will play a role later on, since it ended up being used against me). Though I had school, boyfriend, new friends etc., I wanted to spend more time with her again, so therefore I asked her, if she would like to meet up more, do something, have a sleepover or whatever came to my mind, and we would often make plans. I would look forward to them, only for her to cancel them last minute. At first, I didn't mind, but one day, when she cancelled one of our plans, I saw that she was at the cinema instead with one of her new friends (I looked at her My Story on Snapchat). When she had cancelled the plan, she told me that something else had come up, so I felt hurt, when I saw that she was with another friend, we'll call her Anne. I've been raised with the ideas that, if you have two plans on the same day, you go to the one, which you got invited to first, so that might've sparked my reaction as well. I understand that she has the right to pick, which person she wants to spend her time with, though. The next day, I decided to text her about what I had seen and told her that I felt like I had been replaced, how I felt pushed away, which she told me was absolute nonsense. As I tried to argue my case, she eventually stopped responded, but her friend, Anne, decided to text me something in style of: \\"You may push your boyfriend around and treat him however you want, but you can't treat Mary however you want. She's allowed to have other friends than you.\\", which made me feel backstabbed, since I didn't expect Mary to tell Anne about my personal problems and framing me. I expressed myself to her as well, and made it clear to the both of them that of course she is allowed to have other friends, but the problem was that she had been cancelling plans with me to be with Anne instead. Besides that I told Anne that it was a low blow to bring my relationship into it all, before blocking her. It ended out with a long discussion between Mary and I, and she wouldn't talk to me for a long time, though I apologized to her several times, so in the end I decided to just let her be. Even though we are no longer in contact, I still feel like she was in the wrong, so I've been wondering about it. TL,DR: (Former) best friend started to cancel plans with me to be with another friend instead, when we had planned out to do something together. Ended up in a fight, where I told her about how I felt about it.

Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much.

Swift and Objective-C code can be used in one program, and by extension, C and C++ also. In contrast to C, C++ code cannot be used directly from Swift. An Objective-C or C wrapper must be created between Swift and C++. In the case of Objective-C, Swift has considerable access to the object model, and can be used to subclass, extend and use Objective-C code to provide protocol support. The converse is not true: a Swift class cannot be subclassed in Objective-C. Can we conclude that is swift built on top of objective c?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that Swift is built on top of Objective-C. Although both languages are designed to work together and share the same runtime on iOS and macOS platforms, they are fundamentally different languages with separate and distinct syntax, features, and design approaches. Swift is a programming language developed by Apple, introduced in 2014 as a modern, safer, and more efficient alternative to Objective-C. While Objective-C is a superset of C and incorporates elements from Smalltalk, Swift is designed with influences from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, and Python, among others. This language synergy is intended to make Swift familiar and easy to learn for developers from different backgrounds. The interoperability between Swift and Objective-C is a result of Apple's efforts to ensure a smooth transition for developers and to allow seamless integration of new Swift code into existing Objective-C projects. This coexistence is facilitated by features such as: 1. Accessing Objective-C classes, libraries, and frameworks from Swift code and vice versa. 2. Bridging headers to allow Swift code to call into C and Objective-C libraries, creating a smooth transition for existing codebases. 3. Automatic Objective-C header generation for Swift classes and functions when marked with the @objc attribute. 4. Compatible object models and memory management techniques like Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). However, this interoperability does not mean that Swift is built on top of Objective-C. Swift and Objective-C are independent languages that can each be used to build powerful and efficient applications for Apple platforms. The shared runtime and ability to interface with each other is a design choice by Apple to provide a smooth migration path for developers transitioning from Objective-C to Swift, while still allowing them to leverage the rich ecosystem of Objective-C libraries and frameworks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His Mercury-Atlas 6 mission completed three orbits in the Friendship 7 spacecraft, and splashed down safely in the Atlantic Ocean, after a tense reentry, due to what falsely appeared from the telemetry data to be a loose heat-shield.

Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where did John Glenn land on Earth after coming back from orbit?","completion":"John Glenn landed in the Atlantic Ocean after coming back from orbit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"uh browned on all all sides and then drain off all the grease uh then what i usually do is i freeze them and then when you're ready to serve them\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Once the grease is drained off, this can be frozen.\\" is true?","completion":"Yes, according to the premise provided, the hypothesis \\"Once the grease is drained off, this can be frozen\\" appears to be true. The series of steps illustrated in the premise seems to indicate a process often used in cooking, likely in relation to some type of meat given the references to browning and draining off grease. These steps suggest the instructions are about the preparation of a dish that can be cooked in advance, frozen, and then served at a later time. The first part of the premise refers to a piece of meat being 'browned on all sides', which involves cooking it at a high temperature to form a brown crust. This browning process is often used to add flavor to the meat through the Maillard reaction, a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that makes browned food taste good. After browning the meat, the instruction is to 'drain off all the grease'. This process involves removing the additional fat that has been rendered out during the cooking process. Excess fat can make a dish greasy, so it's often drained off to improve the texture and make the dish less heavy. Following the browning and draining steps, the statement concludes with 'what I usually do is I freeze them'. This indicates that once the grease is drained off, the meat (or whatever food product is being discussed) is suitable for freezing. Therefore, the hypothesis \\"Once the grease is drained off, this can be frozen\\" can be accepted as true based on the premise provided. The final part of the statement, 'then when you're ready to serve them', suggests that the process of freezing is a measure of convenience enabling the meal to be prepared ahead of time, and then easily defrosted and served when required. This could be advantageous for meal planning, reducing food waste, or preparing for large gatherings where cooking everything fresh at the same time would be an immense task. This whole process highlights an efficient way to prepare a dish, indicating that once the item is browned, fat is drained, and subsequently, the food can be frozen and defrosted when needed, without diminishing the dish's flavor or quality. Hence, the hypothesis stands true as per the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Two early goals from the 35-year-old striker saw him reach a total of 211 goals for Roma, which means he has scored more goals for one club than any other player in Serie A history. His tally sees him surpass the previous record of 210 set by the prolific Swedish striker Gunnar Nordahl who played for AC Milan in the 1950s. \\"It's what I've always wanted, to wear this shirt and beat one record after another,\\" said Totti, AFP reported. \\"I've overtaken Nordahl and I'm proud of that. Now I'm aiming for Altafini,\\" he added, AFP reported. Brazilian Jose Altafini is the joint third highest scorer (along with Giuseppe Meazza) in Serie A history with 216 goals. Totti's early brace and a goal from Fabio Borini put Roma 3-0 up with only eight minutes played. Juan and Miralem Pjanic added further goals in the second half after CM Eder had pulled a goal back for Cesena on the hour mark. The win lifts Roma to sixth -- although Napoli will overtake them again if they win at Siena on Sunday -- and boosts their chances of qualifying for European football next season. Cesena, however, remain mired in trouble hovering just above the foot of the table in 18th place with 15 points.

No worries about standing in line and taking a few minutes of your busy day to watch Andy work his magic. After all, it's not often one can find a fresh fish market with the freshest sushi ingredients. And you can bet Andy the Sushi Guy won't skimp on ingredients. We stopped by on Saturday about lunchtime when Wholey's is packed with its Saturday shoppers, which is it's usual crowded busy-ness. Andy's Special for the day: Tuna & Kiwi or Salmon & Avocado FAT Rolls. Yes, the special of the day is usually a FUTO maki extraordinaire. We ordered the Tuna & Kiwi and Andy's Sushi Combo. Tuna & Kiwi began with crispy dried nori (seaweed) topped with an ample amount of fluffy sushi rice. Smeared on is Tobiko (flying fish eggs) with its bright orange color. Just as you're admiring his steadfastness, POP goes the rice ladened seaweed as Andy flips the seaweed to create a reverse sushi roll. Folks, I'd have to disagree with another Yelper when they say that nori goes on the outside. What's not to like about creativity? And personally, what's not to like about more ingredients that you can stick on the outside of a sushi roll? Like Tobiko or sesame seeds? hhmm...???? Continuing with the innerds of the Tuna & Kiwi roll, more Tobiko, asparagus, seared tuna with a light breading, red leafed lettuce, fresh tuna and kiwi...a la Andy's Special of the day. Roll up all of these and keeping it in tact so when the slicing begins, all of the innerds remain in tact. Whoosh! Did you see how he picked up the whole futomaki (fat roll) and placed it in the clear togo container, fan it out, add an ample handful of shyoga (thinly sliced pickled ginger) and a hunk of wasabi (no explanation needed) with soy sauce in a mini condiment cup. Sushi a la Andy the Sushi Guy at Wholey's~~It's what's for dinner! If Andy didn't cut the roll, it would take two hands to pick it up and eat it like a ginormous fat burrito, kinda like you'd get in one of them hole in the wall Tex-Mex joints down close to the border (the US Border, that is). But it is cut into yummy 8 slices and is done quickly without smushing down the circular form. Instead, admire the sliced sushi serving as you lay it flat and be amazed at the color and textures of the ingredients. Not only does it have fresh fish, but some veggies to add to your daily vitamin intake. The only 'drawback' and I think that is what some of the sushi connoisseurs are quick to point out, is that the sushi rice is not seasoned. Yes, folks, traditional sushi rice is seasoned with a slight glaze and a very subtle sweetness. Now, if Andy seasoned the sushi rice as sushi rice should be seasoned, then I'd have to give the guy at least a 4.5 star rating (fresh ingredients, ample servings, creativity, appearance or presentation and seasoned sushi rice on top of all of that). I think I'm going to have to defend Sushi a la Andy against the folks looking for 'traditional sushi' in a sit down sushi bar. You ain't gonna find it here. And if that's the limit on your sushi palate, then you're certainly coming to the wrong place! For if you're looking for fast, fresh and ample, this is it. The bonus: Andy treats you with friendly hospitality and part of the Wholey's family. Was this review given positively or negatively?","completion":"This review was given positively. The reviewer praises Andy the Sushi Guy for his speed, entertainment, friendliness, and the freshness of the sushi ingredients. They also appreciate the creativity in the rolls and the ample servings, while also mentioning the bonus of Andy's friendly hospitality. Although they point out that the sushi rice is not seasoned in the traditional way, they defend the non-traditional aspects as part of the experience and still give a high rating in their review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What kind of a mother will inform her daughter that she is nothing but \\"garbage\\"? And what kind of mother will believe, as Chua tells readers, that \\"an A- is not always a good grade\\"? The only activities her children should be permitted to do are those in which they can eventually win a medal, which must be gold. What kind of a mother she is? Why, a mother who is raising her kids in the typical Chinese way, rather than the Western way. In her new book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, Chua tells her adventures in Chinese parenting, and -- so _ as she may be -- she is also mesmerizing . Chua's voice is that of a happy, knowledgeable serial killer -- think Hannibal Lecter -- who's explaining how he's going to cut his next victim, as though it's the most self-evidently normal behavior.

If you have an unusually slow metabolic rate, or if your metabolism has slowed significantly in a short period of time, you should consult a doctor. Your doctor will have to take a blood test to measure your thyroid hormone levels to determine whether your thyroid is producing decreased levels of thyroid hormones that are causing your metabolism to slow. Keep in mind that hypothyroidism is fairly common – 1% to 2% of the population in iodine replete cultures. Cushing's is less common. Even if you don't have a medical condition that is causing your metabolism to slow, your doctor may be able to help you get back on track by providing suggestions or advice on how to boost your metabolism. Your metabolism often will slow when you diet because you're consuming too few calories. To combat this slow-down, make sure you're consuming at least as many calories per day as your body requires to function normally. The difference between your BMR and the total calories you burn each day represents the range in which you can cut calories to lose weight. If you dip below your BMR, your metabolism will slow and your weight loss will plateau. If you're dieting, be prepared to do the calculations regularly as your BMR will change when you lose weight. People who are heavier tend to have a higher metabolism than people who are lighter. This change in BMR may be part of the reason you find it easy to lose weight in the beginning, but then plateau and find it difficult to lose weight the further along in your diet plan you get. While fiber may not necessarily boost your metabolism, if you eat more fiber, you'll gain less weight over time. Fiber also may increase how much fat your body burns. Cut out white bread and white rice, which lack the fiber your body needs. Switching to whole wheat bread and pasta and brown rice can up your fiber intake. You'll also increase your fiber by eating more fruits and vegetables. Try to consume around 25 grams of fiber each day. You can get this fairly easily in three regular servings of fruits and vegetables. Just try to have a fruit or vegetable serving with each meal. You've probably heard that you should drink at least six glasses of water a day to keep your body optimally hydrated. Because the water you drink must be warmed to body temperature, drinking ice water burns more calories than drinking lukewarm water, boosting your metabolic rate. According to one study, drinking six glasses (or 48 ounces) of cold water each day increased the participants' metabolic rates by an average of 50 calories. Even if you change nothing else, this trick alone could allow you to lose up to five pounds in a year. Protein is essential to build and strengthen your muscles. If you don't eat enough of it, you'll lose muscle tissue and strength, especially as you get older. Eating protein also increases the number of calories you burn after every meal. Lean meats such as chicken and turkey are good sources of protein. If you're a vegetarian, consume soy products, nuts, and protein-rich vegetables such as spinach. Protein-rich foods such as lean meats and fish are also often rich in iron, which is an essential nutrient for raising your metabolism and burning fat. Maintaining an active lifestyle is one of the surest ways to boost your metabolism. If you consistently burn calories through exercise, your body's metabolic rate will adjust accordingly. Plan on getting at least 20 to 30 minutes of exercise every day. This can be as light as a brisk morning walk, or as intense as doing interval training or taking a step-aerobics class. Make sure you include strength training as well as aerobic exercise. Stronger muscles burn more calories, which also will increase your metabolic rate. You don't need to strength train as often as you do cardio – 20 minutes two or three times a week is all you need. . Stress can have a negative effect on your metabolism by elevating your cortisol levels. Your body may also end up holding on to more of the calories that you take in when you are stressed. If your stress is chronic, then this can lead to weight gain, especially around your midsection. Make sure that you make time in your daily routine to practice stress reduction activities, such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga.","completion":"Medical conditions such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome can cause your metabolism to slow down. If you experience a significant slowdown in your metabolic rate, consult your doctor for a blood test that measures thyroid hormone levels. Hypothyroidism is relatively common, affecting 1%-2% of the population, while Cushing's syndrome is less common. In addition to medical conditions, dieting and consuming too few calories can also cause your metabolism to slow down. To maintain a healthy metabolic rate, consume enough calories to meet your body's daily requirements, and adjust your calorie intake as your weight changes. When dieting, individuals often experience an initial weight loss followed by a plateau, resulting from the changes in basal metabolic rate (BMR). Increasing your fiber intake can help maintain a healthy weight and boost fat burning. Replace white bread and rice with whole wheat bread, pasta, and brown rice, and consume around 25 grams of fiber each day through fruits and vegetables. Drinking at least six glasses (or 48 ounces) of cold water per day can increase your metabolic rate by about 50 calories, possibly resulting in a weight loss of up to five pounds per year. Consuming protein is essential for building muscle, strengthening your body, and increasing calorie burning after meals. Opt for lean meats such as chicken and turkey or, if you're vegetarian, consume soy products, nuts, and protein-rich vegetables like spinach. Participating in daily exercise, including 20-30 minutes of aerobic activity, as well as strength training 2-3 times a week, can help maintain an active lifestyle and effectively boost your metabolism. Building stronger muscles results in increased calorie burning and a higher metabolic rate. Lastly, stress reduction is vital for maintaining a healthy metabolism as stress can elevate cortisol levels, leading the body to retain calories and potentially causing weight gain, especially around the midsection. Incorporate stress reduction techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga, into your daily routine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Durango biathlete Tracy Barnes did what she needed to do over the weekend to make the U.S. Olympic team. And then she made a huge sacrifice. With her twin sister, Lanny, next in line, Tracy turned down her Olympic spot. “In honor of friendship, cooperation and sacrifice, I declined my spot on the Olympic team,” Tracy Barnes wrote in an email to family and friends Monday morning. So now Lanny Barnes, 31, will make her third trip to the Winter Olympics. She was officially named to the U.S. biathlon team late Sunday, along with four other women and five other men. In 2010 at the Vancouver Olympics, Lanny placed 23rd in the 15-kilometer individual event – the best showing for a U.S. woman biathlete since 1994. “I can’t even begin to describe what it means to me that Tracy made such a huge sacrifice for me,” Lanny Barnes said in an email to The Herald Monday afternoon from Italy. “We have been training together every day for the past 15 years and I know how hard she has worked to make this team.” Tracy and Lanny both competed at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. The twins have always worked as a team, whether it was training or setting goals. Both obviously had an eye on the Olympics, but Tracy made the decision because it was more important to her for Lanny to realize her goals. “It’s just really a selfless thing to do,” said the twins’ mother, Deb Barnes, in a phone interview Monday, minutes after she’d gotten off the phone from talking to Tracy, who is in the process of making her way back home from Europe. “She was fine with the decision.” The trials for the U.S. biathlon team, a long process that began in 2013, ended Sunday at a race in Ridnaun, Italy. Because Lanny Barnes was sick and unable to compete, she did not have enough trial results to make the team, although her overall results likely would have placed her ahead of her sister. Meanwhile, Tracy Barnes took 10th in a 7.5-kilometer sprint race in the International Biathlon Union Cup race – an excellent result, and, if it is the end of Tracy’s biathlon career, a good way to go out. Said Tracy in her email: “Yesterday I was named to the Olympic Team! I cannot think of any greater honor in the world, save one. ... (Lanny) is having a stellar year and I for one want to see where she can take it ... what heights she can climb to.” Said Lanny: “Tracy selflessly gave me her spot and told me to go to Russia and bring her back the medal in the individual. ... I am going to do my best to represent Tracy, Durango and our awesome country and bring home that medal for Tracy.” Tracy Barnes lives in Durango with her husband, Gary Colliander, a Durango Nordic race team coach. Deb Barnes said that because of Tracy’s heavy travel schedule, the couple haven’t been able to spend much time together. Going to Sochi, Russia, for the Olympic Games would have meant another month apart. “Tracy’s a pretty amazing young woman.

Two days later, Lanny Barnes searched for words to describe her sister's selfless act of love. \\"It shows if you care enough about someone, you're willing to sacrifice everything,\\" Lanny Barnes said. \\"This is her dream, what she's been talking about her entire life. It shows true Olympic spirit. The Olympics are not always about gold medals, she showed that with her decision.\\" Tracy flew home to Durango, Colo. on Tuesday. Lanny Barnes stayed in Italy to continue training for Sochi. \\"It inspires me to push that much more, not only just for my country but for her as well,\\" Lanny Barnes said Tuesday in a telephone interview. The trials for the U.S. biathlon team ended Sunday in Italy. Because Lanny Barnes was sick with a miserable cold she was unable to compete in all the selection races. After the team was named late Sunday, the sisters went on a walk, where Tracy Barnes told her sister about her decision. She was declining her spot so Lanny could be named to the team in her place. Lanny said no, but after plenty of tears, finally relented. \\"She realized how much I wanted to do this for her,\\" Tracy Barnes said Tuesday during an East Coast layover. Tracy felt that Lanny deserved it more, that if not for an illness her sister would have made the team. \\"She had a stellar year,\\" Tracy Barnes said. \\"She just had a bit of bad luck getting sick. I would have loved the opportunity to represent my country but it means more to me to give Lanny that chance. I think she'll do great things.\\" At 31, this will likely be the final Olympics for either Barnes. The sisters competed together at the 2006 Torino Games, but only Lanny made the 2010 Vancouver team. Lanny attributes her success in those Games to her sister. She placed 23rd in the 15-kilometer individual event — the best showing for an American woman since 1994. Face painted, American flag draped on her shoulders, Tracy ran alongside her sister during the race, cheering the whole way. \\"She would pass and give a little wave,\\" Tracy Barnes said. However, in Sochi, Lanny will be without the one person who made the trip possible. Given the expense, and scarcity of hotel rooms, Tracy will be cheering from home, perhaps with her face painted and an American flag draped on her shoulders, for the one person who has been with her every step of the way. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Biathlete Tracy Barnes made a huge sacrifice by turning down her spot on the U.S. Olympic team to allow her twin sister, Lanny Barnes, to compete.

However, a documentary called Tickled shines a spotlight on those who take part in it, when a TV reporter from New Zealand, David Farrier, uncovers not just a quirky sport, but a whole industry, and an underworld with allegations of cyber bullying. Two years ago, Farrier, known for his \\"and finally\\" news pieces at his local TV station, discovered what was described as \\"competitive endurance tickling\\" videos online. They featured young men in professional sportswear tickling each other. A US-based company, Jane O'Brien Media, was producing the videos and offering substantial fees for anyone selected to take part in the shoots in Los Angeles. \\"Right in the beginning I thought it was entirely innocent, perhaps with a subtext,\\" explains Farrier. \\"I thought it was someone's idea of a funny strange sport, as it was in a photography studio, a professional space. All the men were wearing sportswear so I thought it was someone's odd idea of a tickling league.\\" \\"I was intrigued and thought about doing a two-minute feature on it for my show, \\"he adds, \\"so I got in touch with them. Really, a short feature was all I was aiming for.\\" In response however, Farrier, who is bisexual, says he received emails stating that the company did not want to deal with \\"a homosexual journalist\\". \\"I was a little upset but part of me thought it was funny,\\" he adds. \\"I didn't understand why a company that makes men-only tickling videos would say that.\\" \\"Instinct, intrigue and fascination\\" drove him and his co-director Dylan Reeve on to find out more about the videos, despite representatives of the company flying to Auckland to threaten legal action. Farrier successfully raised the money for a documentary using the crowd-funding platform, Kickstarter. \\"We probably did go into it quite naively,\\" he believes. \\"We never expected to find what we did. If you watch the film you'll find it's not really about tickling - it's about power. \\"We were interested in the psychology of what made these men take part in the videos, and it was mainly guys who were athletes or military, and from poorer states.\\" Although being tickled usually provokes laughter, science has long been interested in whether it's involuntary. Ten years ago, a study at the University of California at San Diego concluded that tickling did not necessarily produce pleasure, just the outward appearance of it. Alan J Fridlund, a social and clinical psychologist, points out that whether it's enjoyable or not \\"depends upon the social context of the tickle. Charles Darwin thought that infant tickling was the basis of adult humour and I agree\\". He added: \\"But the insidious side of tickling is that if the tickler has a perverse motive, they will interpret the reflexive responses to tickling as a sign of approval, even when the social context turns dark. \\"As the tickler proceeds, he or she is abetted by the nasty fact that strong tickling begins to cause cataplexy, a generalised weakening of the body's striate muscles, and one that many of us have known if we've been 'tickle tortured'. \\" That phrase is repeated by a participant of the tickling videos called TJ, who tells Farrier on camera that he was told taking part \\"was for a project, as tickling was being considered as a military tactic for the army, tickle torture. I thought that was untrue\\". TJ says the reason he did it was \\"because I was a little desperate for money. I was young at the time and I didn't think anything of it. I would get 2,000. \\"On the day, I noticed it was all guys, and I didn't know I would get tied down, but there were athletes there, bodybuilders, a couple of actors I had seen on TV commercials - completely normal people. I still thought, 'I hope no one finds out about this'.\\" In the documentary, TJ alleges that after the videos surfaced online, he asked them to be taken down, and was subjected to a campaign of abuse and harassment - including emails being sent to his employer at a high school. The film claims others involved with making tickling videos have suffered controlling and abusive behaviour. However, Jane O'Brien Media strongly denies any wrongdoing. The director confesses that his own viewpoint on tickling has shifted since making the film - and getting tickled himself for the purpose of making the documentary. \\"There is pain in tickling, it's not always enjoyable. You're not laughing in the way you laugh as a joke. It can be used as torture and power play. There's also always one who is dominant, and one who is submissive. It's a metaphor for the power and control we talk about in the film. \\"The innocence of it has gone for me - I don't tickle my nieces any more.\\" The one word to sum up his experience, Farrier adds, is \\"weird\\". \\"I was completely bemused a lot of the time about what I was discovered. You couldn't actually make it up. Some people though think we have - they think it's so unbelievable that it's a spoof mockumentary.\\" Tickled is on release in the UK now Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

These videos were being made by a US company called Jane O'Brien Media, which was paying people lots of money to be in the videos. First, David Farrier thought it was just a funny, weird sport and wanted to do a small story about it for his TV show. But the company didn't want him to because he was bisexual, which he thought was weird because their videos were all men tickling each other. This made him want to learn more about what was really going on. He and another director named Dylan Reeve made a movie about it using money from Kickstarter (which is like an online piggy bank where people can give you money to help with a project). They realized that these \\"tickling\\" videos were more about power than tickling. They interviewed the men who appeared in the videos, many of whom were athletes or military guys, from parts of the United States that didn't have a lot of money. One man they talked to, TJ, said he was told that the videos were for a project about using tickling as a way to get information from people in the military. He did it because he needed the money, but later asked for the videos to be taken down. When he did, he says he was bullied and harassed, even at his job at a high school. The movie suggests that other people who made these tickling videos went through similar things. Jane O'Brien Media, the company making the videos, denies doing anything wrong. The reporter, David Farrier, said that making the documentary made him realize tickling can be used to control people and cause pain. He doesn't tickle his nieces anymore.

Is In the United States, about 10,000 cases of Toxocara infection are reported in humans each year, and almost 14% of the U.S. population is infected. a good answer to this question?","completion":"The information provided in the answer is partially correct, but it can be further elaborated and clarified for a more comprehensive understanding of Toxocara infection in the United States. Toxocariasis is an infection caused by the parasitic roundworms (Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati) commonly found in the intestines of dogs and cats. Humans can accidentally ingest these eggs present in the environment, which can lead to infection. Toxocara infection predominantly affects children and can cause health problems such as ocular larva migrans (OLM) and visceral larva migrans (VLM). Data on the prevalence of Toxocara infection varies across sources. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that about 13.9% of the U.S. population has been exposed to or infected with Toxocara parasites. However, it's essential to acknowledge that this is an estimation, and the actual numbers may vary. It's also crucial to emphasize that Toxocara infection does not exhibit significant symptoms in the majority of infected individuals, which makes it challenging to determine the exact prevalence. The 10,000 cases reported annually in the U.S. likely represent the more serious cases or medically documented instances. For a more comprehensive answer to the question, it's important to consider further factors such as geographical variations, demographic differences, and contributing factors that might affect the prevalence of Toxocara infection: 1. Geographical variations: Toxocara infection rates are higher in densely populated urban centers and communities with a significant number of stray dogs and cats. Socioeconomic factors and sanitation also influence the distribution of Toxocara infection in the United States. 2. Demographic differences: Toxocara infection predominantly affects children, especially those aged 1-4 years. The frequency of infection is higher in males than females. It has been observed that individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more prone to infection due to factors such as poor sanitation, lack of awareness, and limited access to healthcare. 3. Contributing factors: Toxocara infection rates can be influenced by pet ownership, level of exposure to soil contaminated with roundworm eggs, and certain occupational hazards like gardening, farming, or landscaping. In summary, while the provided information states that 14% of the U.S. population is infected with Toxocara, it's important to clarify that this estimation refers to exposure or infection and that actual prevalence might vary. A more detailed answer would address geographical and demographic variations, as well as the factors influencing the infection rates in the United States. Ultimately, it's essential to acknowledge the challenges in determining the exact prevalence due to the infection often being asymptomatic and underdiagnosed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45.

This is often played in situations where larger or more complicated games might be inappropriate: in the car, a restaurant, or when attempting to annoy one's parents. Toe wrestling is an entertaining and engaging game that has gained popularity over time, particularly amongst children. The game involves two players who sit facing each other and place their feet together, interlocking their toes. The objective of the game is for one player to try and pin their opponent's foot, using only their toes, while the other player attempts to resist. Often played as a fun pastime between friends, toe wrestling can also be organized into tournaments which consist of more participants. In these tournaments, matches are played in pairs, and each individual competes against their opponent in a one-on-one style. The winners of each match advance to the next round until there is only one winner left standing. One of the primary reasons that toe wrestling is popular among children is due to its simplicity and accessibility. The game does not require any special equipment or a specific playing area and can be easily played almost anywhere. This makes it an ideal choice for situations where larger or more complex games may not be suitable. For example, toe wrestling can be an excellent choice for a car ride, as it does not require the players to move around or engage in physical activities that may distract the driver. Additionally, it can be a fun way to pass time and interact with friends while waiting at a restaurant. The game can also serve as a playful means to annoy one's parents, as it does not generate excessive noise or cause any significant disturbance. In conclusion, toe wrestling is a popular children's game played between two players, or in tournaments with multiple players competing in pairs. The simplicity and adaptability of the game make it an ideal choice for various situations, such as car rides, waiting at restaurants, or simply trying to have some fun with friends. Though it may not offer the complexity or excitement of other games, toe wrestling remains a beloved and enjoyable pastime for many."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"A bride and groom climbing steps.\\", does it logically follow that \\"Two people are ascending stairs.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"Two people are ascending stairs\\" if \\"A bride and groom are climbing steps.\\" This conclusion can be derived by analyzing the statement's components and understanding the relationships between them. Let's break down this statement in a more detailed manner: 1. \\"A bride and groom\\": This part of the statement refers to two distinct individuals – one being a bride and the other being a groom. These two people are typically a part of a wedding ceremony and are the focal point of the event. 2. \\"Climbing steps\\": This phrase refers to the action of moving upward by using a staircase or a series of steps. In this context, the bride and groom are moving together up the steps, and hence, it is an action performed by two individuals. Now, let's evaluate the second statement, \\"Two people are ascending stairs.\\" 1. \\"Two people\\": This phrase directly corresponds to the \\"bride and groom\\" in the first statement. It shows that there are a pair of individuals involved, which is accurate in the context of the bride and groom. 2. \\"Ascending stairs\\": This phrase closely resembles the first statement's \\"climbing steps\\" and demonstrates the same action of moving upward by using a staircase. Both phrases indicate that the individuals in question are engaged in the act of ascending or climbing. By comparing the statements, we can see that the first statement's core components -- two individuals involved in the activity of climbing steps -- are also present in the second statement. The only difference is that the first statement specifies the two protagonists' roles as a bride and groom, while the second statement describes them more generally as \\"two people.\\" In conclusion, it logically follows that \\"Two people are ascending stairs\\" if \\"A bride and groom are climbing steps.\\" Both statements share the same underlying meaning, with the second statement being a more generalized version that doesn't clarify the individuals' roles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The paper was founded in 1885 by Axel Danielsson and August Palm, and existed up to 1944 when it changed name to \\"Morgon-Tidningen\\" (\\"The Morning Paper\\"). \\"Morgon-Tidningen\\" existed up to 1958. - Västra Götaland County is a county or \\"län\\" on the western coast of Sweden. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Axel Danielsson (15 December 1863 30 December 1899) was a Swedish socialist agitator, journalist and writer, born in Värmland. He was a prominent leader of the early Swedish Social Democratic Party. Danielsson retranslated Karl Marx's \\"Communist Manifesto\\" into Swedish in 1886. - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\" (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms; in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \\"consumption\\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests. Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). One-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2014, there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 510% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test.... - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible. - The Swedish Social Democratic Party, (SAP; literally, \\"Social Democratic Workers' Party of Sweden\\"), contesting elections as the \\"ArbetarepartietSocialdemokraterna\\" ('The Workers' Party The Social Democrats'), usually referred to just as the 'Social Democrats' (\\"Socialdemokraterna\\"); is the oldest and largest political party in Sweden. The current party leader since 2012 is Stefan Löfven; he has also been Prime Minister of Sweden since 2014. - A diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (LTB), also called latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) means a patient is infected with \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\", but the patient does not have active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis can be contagious while latent tuberculosis is not, and it is therefore not possible to get TB from someone with latent tuberculosis. The main risk is that approximately 10% of these patients (5% in the first two years after infection and 0.1% per year thereafter) will go on to develop active tuberculosis. This is particularly true, and there is added risk, in particular situations such as medication that suppresses the immune system or advancing age. - Karl Johan ( K.

George Bivens said during a news conference Friday at the Blooming Grove Twp. Municipal Building. The 31-year-old suspect has been on the run since the Sept. 12 ambush at the Blooming Grove state police barracks that killed state police Cpl. Bryon K. Dickson II, 38, Dunmore, and critically injured Trooper Alex T. Douglass, 31, Olyphant. On Tuesday, investigators discovered a remote campsite that appeared to have been abandoned “rather abruptly” by Mr. Frein, Col. Bivens said. Police seized the clothing and food, including tuna fish, Ramen noodles and about 90 rounds of ammunition for the .308-caliber rifle Mr. Frein is believed to have used in the shooting, he said. “I would surmise we pushed him out of there quickly,” Col. Bivens said. “I believe he would want these items and it makes life more difficult for him not to have these items.” The campsite is also where police discovered two homemade pipe bombs. Lt. Col. Bivens said the explosive devices are undergoing analysis, and police expect to be able to say more about them next week. Lt. Col. Bivens reiterated his belief that the search is putting increasing pressure on the self-taught survivalist, who may be seeking out Dumpsters for food and vacant homes and cabins for shelter. “He can’t stay concealed. ... He needs to eat. He needs to sleep. He needs to stay dry,” Lt. Col. Bivens said. He said the weather is starting to turn in favor of the search teams. The rain forecast for the area is expected to bring down leaves, making it easier to spot and pursue the fugitive. It is also going to make it more difficult for Mr. Frein to remain warm and dry, he said. Lt. Col. Bivens said Mr. Frein is making mistakes that police will eventually capitalize on to capture him. “I’m more confident than ever that he is stressed and we’re pushing him hard,” Lt. Col. Bivens said. “He’s made a number of significant mistakes in the course of this manhunt. I have no doubt he’ll make additional mistakes and we’ll capture him.” The most recent reported sighting of Mr. Frein was Thursday evening, with the last “high-level” sighting earlier in the week, Lt. Col. Bivens said. Although hunting has been banned in a 349-square-mile area in Monroe and Pike counties that includes the primary search area, any hunter who encounters Mr. Frein should try to get away and contact police, Lt. Col. Bivens said.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: How to Increase Your Search Rank Using Social Media The rules of search have changed. In fact, they change on a daily basis. But never so dramatically has rank been uprooted since the explosion of social media. Social media sites, especially the power houses of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, have become backlink central for affecting organic search results. Social media’s influence on driving business via the web is expected to surpass search engine optimization (SEO) in 2013, according to eMarketer. Web marketers and PR professionals must pay attention to how social media affects search, and ultimately how it can change the rules of online visibility and (online) brand engagement. Prior to Facebook’s takeover of the online universe (800 million active users today), online visibility in natural search was a sum of several measurable components: SEO site compliance on site structure and meta tags/content, directory link submissions and qualified and relevant site/blog linking. In 2010 the game officially changed, with Google’s support of social media — author reputation, bookmarking, commenting, as well as a number of other social factors (Likes, tweets, retweets, shares, etc.) — as a major factor in how it ranks websites and blogs in its algorithm. Real-time search in Google meant that search was only as valuable as the latest blog post, social share and comment. Today, the line is blurring. And this causes some confusion for web marketers. Should they focus on optimizing and driving traffic to their social pages? To their website? Where does their online brand live? How do they communicate their brand value proposition, whether their personal or corporate brand? The good news is that technology has advanced so that web marketers can manage their content and sites through the use of simple and effective blogging tools. Further, those blog tool properties, such as WordPress, support integration of social plug-ins and necessary content for social sharing including video, effective product/service literature and tagged imagery. And so, marketers can use social and manage their web presence to support online brand consistency. So, how can you use social media to increase your SEO rank and ensure that the rank and ensuing traffic will convert to web business? First, you must create and understand a parallel social media optimization/search engine optimization strategy. All creators of content on your team (copy, social commenting, videos and imagery) need to be on one brand team. The approach must be holistic. A unified brand message must drive visibility across all content and all channels. To define a common strategy for execution across standard SEO practices as well as across social media content development and sharing, marketers must rethink keyword development. The questions become less about search visibility versus obvious competition and more introspective in terms of what the corporate and executive brand mean. Ask your team questions such as: What is our brand value proposition? What do we want our audience to say about us? How will we incent out audience? How will we be leaders? Why will people follow us? Answering these questions will help you to zone in on your top branded, broad-based and narrow-based keywords. 3. Create a Plan of Action Once these target keyword phrases have been developed, you will need an actionable task plan to follow and with which to measure effectiveness of your new blended social/SEO strategy. The strategy must contain: content types and frequency, such as a weekly webinar production and planned outreach per social channel and media (social) buys/ads with effective messaging and resulting goals. Determining success in social affects search visibility such that the quality of the author, relevancy of the topical content, number of followers, number of comments/retweets and number of shares of blog posts must be considered and followed for search visibility to pull from success in these metrics. 4. Don’t Forget SEO Basics When determining how you will rank in natural search for branded and business-driving keywords, first do the ABCs of SEO work in terms of on-site optimization wherever your online marketing plan calls for conversion. Once that has been completed, rein in your social and search teams to determine your custom strategy and measurable plan. Remember that, just like traditional SEO practices, social media optimization work must be consistent, authentic, managed daily and measured for success. Summary:","completion":"This article talks about how social media can help improve search rank. Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn have become very important in helping websites be seen by more people. This is because they help affect search results by being mentioned and shared on these social media sites. As a helpful assistant, how can you use social media to get a better search rank? First, you need to have a plan that includes both search engine optimization (making your website easy for search engines to understand and find) and social media content (things people want to share on Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Work with your team to create a message and use keywords that best describe your brand. Also, create a plan of action to see how well your strategy is working, and don't forget the basic steps of SEO. Good luck!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened tariffs on an additional 100 billion worth of Chinese goods, on top of the 50 billion in import taxes he already has proposed against Beijing. Though none of the tariffs have taken effect, it's the latest posturing in a trade dispute that some fear could escalate into a trade war. For decades, Trump has complained about China's trade practices. One of his main complaints is what he calls Beijing's theft of U.S. intellectual property. Last month, Trump cited IP theft as justification for his proposed tariffs on 50 billion in Chinese goods. China retaliated by threatening its own tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. Trump then escalated the dispute, saying he would consider tripling the amount of goods to which tariffs would be applied. China gains access to U.S. technology by employing several tactics, which many observers have said are unfair or illegal. Beijing has long required that U.S. businesses transfer technology to Chinese companies as a precondition of entering the Chinese market. For instance, if you are a U.S. carmaker who wants to sell automobiles to China, Beijing requires that you team up with a local Chinese company, or face steep tariffs on imported vehicles. In other cases, China requires U.S. companies to comply with localization requirements by storing sensitive data in the Chinese mainland. That increases the risk of intellectual property theft through means such as cyberattacks.It's difficult to quantify the value of technological knowledge. But according to an estimate last month by the U.S. trade representative, Chinese theft of American intellectual property costs between 225 billion and 600 billion every year. That rate is unsustainable, said top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. \\"We can't afford to give up our technology,\\" Kudlow said Friday. \\"When they steal our technology ... they're stealing the guts of our American future.\\" The Chinese government has always denied carrying out the cyberattacks that frequently...

Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Over time, more sediment piles on top - The resulting heat and pressure transforms the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen - Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack - The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms - It will turn into either petroleum or natural gas - Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the process of forming petroleum or natural gas is the accumulation and deposition of organic matter. This step is essential in order to create the organic layer that undergoes a series of transformations to eventually become petroleum or natural gas. This first step begins with the accumulation of organic matter, primarily in the form of plant and animal remains, in an oxygen-poor environment. Aquatic environments, such as shallow seas, lakes, or river deltas, are commonly where organic matter accumulates due to the continual input of nutrients and other organic materials from the surrounding land. In these environments, there is generally a low rate of decomposition of organic material due to a lack of oxygen, allowing the organic matter to build up over time. The deposition of organic matter, alongside other sediments such as clay, silt, and sand, forms a layer of sediment that contains a high proportion of organic carbon. This organic-rich sediment, known as the source rock, is crucial for the formation of fossil fuels. As the first step of the fossil fuel formation process, the accumulation and deposition of organic matter set the stage for the subsequent transformations that the organic layer will undergo. These transformations include: 1. Over time, more sediment piles on top: As additional sediment is deposited, the weight and pressure on the organic layer increases, causing it to become compacted and buried deeper within the Earth's crust. 2. The resulting heat and pressure transform the organic layer into kerogen: Under the influence of increased temperatures and pressures, the organic material undergoes chemical reactions that lead to the formation of a waxy substance known as kerogen. 3. Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack: As the kerogen continues to be subjected to heat and pressure, it eventually breaks down or \\"cracks\\" into smaller molecules. 4. The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms: The cracked kerogen molecules continue to break down, forming a mixture of various hydrocarbons. Depending on the specific conditions prevalent during the formation process, the end products can be either petroleum or natural gas. These hydrocarbon resources, trapped within the Earth's crust, are then searched for and extracted through various exploration and drilling techniques, providing fuel and other valuable resources that power our modern world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination.

The bony pelvis (pelvic skeleton) is the part of the skeleton embedded in the pelvic region of the trunk. It is subdivided into the pelvic girdle and the pelvic spine. The pelvic girdle is composed of the appendicular hip bones (ilium, ischium, and pubis) oriented in a ring, and connects the pelvic region of the spine to the lower limbs. The pelvic spine consists of the sacrum and coccyx. Is it true that is the coccyx part of the pelvic girdle?","completion":"To determine if the coccyx is a part of the pelvic girdle, let us evaluate the composition of the pelvic girdle and compare it with the position of the coccyx. Step 1: Identify the components of the pelvic girdle - The pelvic girdle is composed of two hip bones: the left and right. Each hip bone is formed by three bones - ilium, ischium, and pubis. Step 2: Understand the purpose of the pelvic girdle - The pelvic girdle connects the pelvic region of the spine to the lower limbs. It forms a ring-like structure that supports the body's weight and provides stability. Step 3: Determine the location of the coccyx - The coccyx, also known as the tailbone, is a small, triangular bone located at the base of the spine. It is a part of the pelvic spine, which consists of the sacrum and coccyx. Comparing the composition of the pelvic girdle and the position of the coccyx, it is clear that the coccyx is not a part of the pelvic girdle. Instead, it is part of the pelvic spine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

PUBLISHED:. 13:15 EST, 30 April 2012. |. UPDATED:. 14:33 EST, 30 April 2012. A nurse has recalled the astonishing moment she unzipped a body bag and found the woman inside - apparently killed by a tornado that flattened her home - was still alive. She recounted the story exactly a year after storms ravaged the South, flattening homes and killing residents - many of whom ended up in body bags in a make-shift morgue in a Trenton, Georgia. Dana Culpepper was working at the Dade Health and Rehabilitation Center in Trenton when one room was closed off for the dead bodies. Scroll down for video. Saved: Glynis Lawson, left, was caught in a tornado that ripped off her nose and ear. Paramedics thought she was dead and put her in a body bag, but Dana Culpepper, right, heard her moans and found her alive. Dana carried out her rounds amid the chaos - and was certain she heard a moan as she neared the morgue at the end of the building. 'I kept hearing something moan, but I really couldn’t tell. because there was so much noise,' she told My Fox Atlanta. With another nurse, she started towards a door where the bodies were being stored. She added: 'We heard another moan and that’s when I. said, 'Let’s look in the body bag\\".' Unzipping the bag, they were stunned to discover Glynis Lawson, barely alive but still breathing. Friends: Glynis was saved by Dana's quick thinking and multiple surgeries. They see each other every week. Destroyed: Emergency responders found Glynis in a ditch near her flattened home, pictured. Moving on: Glynis, pictured with a reporter, has now rebuilt the home in Trenton, Georgia. Culpepper added: 'When we opened it up, I know half of her nose was gone. Her ear was off and just a lot of blood.' Unperturbed by the gruesome sight, they immediately got to work and started an IV drip to try to stop the bleeding. 'We just did what comes natural,' she said. Speaking to Channel 3, Lawson said: 'I'm just glad that they were there that night and heard me.' She recounted hiding in her closet as the severe weather began to batter her home. 'By the time that it had got to my area,. it was too late for me to go anywhere,' Lawson said. 'Just as I shut the [closet] door,. that's when everything started - the hitting, the roar, and the house. started breaking apart.' She was found in a ditch under the debris of her home and taken to the center where she was later found alive. Ruins: The tornadoes in April 2011 hit the South, the Midwest and the Northeast. A Tuscaloosa, Alabama street shows the aftermath of the 300 tornadoes that hit the area, leaving 238 in the state dead. Wiped out: In total, more than 300 people were killed by the tornadoes. In Georgia, 14 people lost their lives. Debris: A scene from Trenton, Georgia. Glynis was sheltering in her home when the tornado tore it apart. The storm completely flattened the house. She has now rebuilt it and undergone surgeries to heal. 'I really didn’t think that she would live, to even to make it to the hospital. None of us did,' Culpepper told Fox. 'It’s a miracle. I look at her and I think she’s a miracle.' Lawson returns to the centre every week to visit Culpepper and the other staff who saved her. She said she believes she was kept alive to take care of her father, who was suffering from dementia. 'I guess that was God's way of keeping me here, to make sure daddy was okay,' Lawson said. The tornadoes between 25 and 28 April last year swept across the South, Midwest and Northeast, claiming more than 300 lives. Fourteen died in Georgia, while Alabama lost a staggering 238 people.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to meet with U.S President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12 to work out an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. But on Wednesday North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan released a statement through the state-run KCNA news agency that criticized “unbridled remarks” made specifically by the U.S. president’s National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding that Pyongyang completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, along with its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons stockpile, before receiving any compensation or concessions. He expressed “indignation” at the U.S uncompromising position and said North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit, unless the Trump administration acts with “sincerity” to improve relations through dialogue. “If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” the statement said. The vice foreign minister also said it was “absolutely absurd” that Bolton would compare Libya’s experience dismantling its relatively rudimentary nuclear program as a model for dealing with the North’s more advanced and expansive capabilities. He also denounced the Trump administration for “miscalculating the magnanimity” of Kim Jong Un’s decision to suspend further nuclear and missile tests, and his willingness to engage in nuclear talks, as “signs of weakness,” that were the result of what the U.S. administration has dubbed its “maximum pressure” campaign that led international efforts to impose punishing sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade.

The ballet made its world premiere on February 20 (according to the Julian calendar) or March 4 (according to the Gregorian calendar), 1877, at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia. Swan Lake tells the dramatic and tragic story of Odette, a young woman who has been transformed into a white swan by the evil sorcerer Baron von Rothbart. The spell can only be broken by a vow of everlasting love and devotion, and it is Prince Siegfried who has the power to save Odette from this fate. The prince, on the eve of his 21st birthday, is urged by his mother, the queen, to choose a bride. That night, Siegfried comes across a group of swans at the lake and is astounded when one of them transforms into the beautiful Odette. She tells him of her plight and the necessary vow of love that can set her free from the enchantment. Their love, however, is complicated by the arrival of Odile, the wicked Black Swan. Odile is actually Rothbart's daughter, disguised to resemble Odette, aiming to disrupt the growing love between the prince and Odette. At a ball at his palace, Siegfried is enchanted by Odile and tragically pledges his love to her, believing her to be Odette. Realizing the heartbreaking mistake he has made, Siegfried rushes back to the lake to beg for Odette's forgiveness. The ballet's ending can vary depending on the production. On the one hand, the resolution might see Siegfried and Odette defeat Rothbart and break the curse. In this version, the pair lives happily ever after, illustrating the triumph of love over evil. Another version, in contrast, culminates with the lovers taking their lives by jumping into the lake to escape their tragic fates. Consequently, Rothbart dies as a result of his magic's destruction, and the ballet's story concludes on a somber but heroic note. Swan Lake is a timeless ballet classic that has experienced various adaptations and reinterpretations, with an intricate blend of romance, tragedy, and magic. At its heart, the story of Odette and Prince Siegfried continues to captivate audiences with its thrilling drama and enchanting music."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What was the town's population where the Tumbler and Goblet Factory was located in 2010?

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. Paragraph: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Your German Shepherd may have a hard time pumping blood throughout his body if his aorta is deformed. The aorta is the main artery leaving the heart. If the valve into the aorta is narrowed, as in AS, a backpressure is created in the heart making your dog work harder to circulate blood. Medication is the most common treatment for AS, which treats the irregular heart rhythm and may include antibiotics to prevent infection. Surgery is not recommended. Your German Shepherd may have a heart deformity that's causing a heart murmur or another health condition (like problems eating or with blood circulation). These deformities may include: Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA): This is a temporary blood vessel in a fetal puppy that should close shortly after he's born. If it stays open, blood may bypass your dog's lungs. Vascular ring anomaly (also known as persistent right aortic arch): This is another blood vessel that should close before your dog is born. If it stays open after birth, the vessel traps your dog's esophagus which makes it hard for him to swallow food down into his stomach. Mitral or tricuspid valve disease: These valves separate the heart's atria from the ventricles. If they don't fit perfectly together, then blood can leak in the wrong direction, causing a heart murmur. If your dog has abnormalities in the heart muscle itself, he may have dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. With Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the heart muscle tires and becomes baggy. With hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle thickens, causing the chambers to get smaller and hold less blood. Treatment usually focuses on improving your dog's diet and exercise habits. Most vets don't recommend surgery unless your German Shepherd develops congestive heart failure. Older German Shepherds are prone to a vascular tumor (hemangiosarcoma) that attacks the vessels lining the heart. This tumor is the most common type in dogs and usually isn't noticed until it gets big enough to cause complications. Your dog may have abdominal swelling, irregular heartbeat, and anemia. Treatment for hemangiosarcoma is difficult. Veterinarians usually recommend chemotherapy and possibly draining the site of the tumor.

Article: You'll need to dig deep enough to reach a stable surface beneath the topsoil, and often deeper to ensure the stones have solid support. Large installation projects may require an excavator, and a square shovel is always useful for creating the vertical walls. For a driveway or other area with heavy car or machinery traffic, dig 7–9 inches (18–23 centimeters) deep, plus the height of the paving stones you'll be installing. For a walkway with only foot traffic, you only need to dig 4–5 inches (10–13 cm) deep, plus the height of the stones. Use crushed rock or gravel sized at about ¾ of an inch (1.9 cm). This will provide a base for the paving stones, and allow water to drain through. Rent or purchase a plate compactor, and use it to compact the gravel to make a stable, sturdy base. You may need to pour in the gravel in stages, as each compactor has a maximum depth that it can compact at one time. The final layer should be 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) deep for areas with car or machinery traffic, or up to 12 in. (30 cm) in wet soil. Use a layer 3–4 inches (7.5–10 cm) deep for walkways. Some people install landscape fabric or geotextiles over the gravel at this stage. This helps prevent weed growth, and may help keep the base above it in place. However, other installers prefer to skip this step, as it is not a permanent weed solution and may lead to drainage problems in the long term. Pour in a 1 inch (2.5 cm) layer of sand to keep the paving stones in place. This sand is sold as \\"bedding sand\\" or \\"paver sand.\\" Place a bubble level on top of a flat 2 x 4 or screed board.

It emphasizes that the depth of excavation would vary depending on whether the area is meant for heavy machinery or foot traffic, with respective depths of 7-9 inches and 4-5 inches, in addition to the height of the stones. The use of crushed rock or gravel as a supportive base is advised, along with renting a plate compactor to ensure stability. The final gravel layer's depth also depends on the area's traffic type with a recommendation of a 6-8 inch depth for cars or machinery traffic areas, and a 3-4 inch depth for walkways. The installation of landscape fabric or geotextiles over the gravel base is an individual choice, as it provides temporary weed control but might cause long-term drainage issues.

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it.

In order to deal with life being unfair, you first must get to the core of the bad apple you've been tossed. Ask yourself what, exactly, is the root cause of this particular unfairness. OPTIONS: A). For example, suppose the other person reports that people are always doing what you would do if you were in their shoes. And the reason why is that people who weren't living up to your standards were always doing their dirty work.; B). For example, if someone is in your friends place because they think your place is being taken advantage of, then they are being unfair. Maybe they are feeling unfairly treated because they know your pride is in jeopardy, and if so, why? But it doesn't often affect how someone treats you.; C). Sometimes the cause will be something within your control, such as getting into a car accident because you were texting and driving. Other times the root cause is completely out of your control, such as being sexually assaulted or diagnosed with a life-threatening medical condition.; D).

It mentions people reporting that others are doing what you would do if in their shoes, without explaining what that has to do with unfairness. Answer B is incorrect because it focuses on a specific situation (someone taking your friend's place because they think your place is being taken advantage of) rather than providing a general example of dealing with life being unfair. It also doesn't explain how it affects the person feeling unfairly treated. Answer D is incorrect because it only presents an example of a specific situation (a taxi driver who never hits the curb being late for a pickup), rather than addressing the broader concept of dealing with life being unfair and getting to the root cause of the problem. Answer C is the correct answer because it provides two different examples of dealing with life being unfair—one where the root cause is within your control, and one where it is not. This helps to illustrate the importance of getting to the root cause of the problem and understanding that not all situations can be controlled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Helpful overview of the history and statements of the councils Product review: I found Toon's writing about the Seven Ecumenical Councils enlightening and easy to follow. He discusses the history behind each of the councils, including the theological conflicts leading to them. He details the statements of each of the councils and explains the meaning in simple language. He highlights the heresies combated by the councils and goes into some detail regarding the theological issues behind the conflicts. This book is an excellent resource for study of the Trinity and the nature of Jesus as fully God and fully man. The seventh council deals with icons, and Toon offers a well-written account of the conflict relating to icons in the church. This book is highly recommended as offering clear examples of what is orthodox Christianity regarding views of the Trinity especially. It is very relevant in today's church. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?","completion":"This review depicts the product in a flattering light.

It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, \\"I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday\\". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, \\"Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?\\"In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Not Like Everyone Else Context: Shortly after the Columbine High School massacre, Union Intermediate High School (in Tulsa, Oklahoma) was one of many schools around the country increasing security measures to prevent school shootings. Brandi Blackbear wrote horror stories similar to those of Stephen King, dressed in a slightly Gothlike way, and was not afraid to be herself, or to stand up to bullying by popular kids. Her defiance engendered hostility toward her from certain segments of her school's culture. False stories of threats of violence were circulated, and the combination of her writing and authorities' natural hyperawareness following Columbine led to her being suspended. When some of her fellow students later saw her checking out a book on world religions, including Wicca (as research for her stories), they immediately branded her a witch, and eventually accused her of casting a spell that made a teacher sick. Fear of her spread through much of the school, and she was once again suspended. Finally, her parents went to the ACLU, where they were told they had a good case against the school for violating her civil rights. The ACLU sued the affluent school for 10 million, even though the Blackbears were not sure they deserved that much based on what Brandi had suffered. Still, the ACLU argued that the school would not take any lesser claim seriously. When the school offered a settlement, the Blackbears refused. They were not interested in the money, despite needing it; what they really wanted was to have their story heard in court to inform the public that the school had mistreated Brandi. The judge ruled to dismiss the charges rather than going to trial, and ordered the Blackbears to pay 6000 in court fees, which they could not afford. Eventually it was agreed to drop the fees if the Blackbears dropped their appeal. Earlier that day at school however, Kimberly (the most popular girl in school, and Brandi's main tormentor) tries to interview Brandi for the school newspaper but she declines, and also, everyone at school expresses...

My question: Who is Cuban refugee?","completion":"The plot you provided is from the classic film \\"Scarface\\" directed by Howard Hawks in 1932. However, there is no mention of a Cuban refugee in this version of Scarface. What you might be thinking of is the 1983 remake of Scarface, directed by Brian De Palma and starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana. In this version, Tony Montana is a Cuban refugee who comes to Miami in the 1980s during the Mariel boatlift. The 1983 Scarface film follows the story of Tony Montana as he rises from being a small-time criminal to one of the most powerful drug lords in Miami. The plot of the 1983 version is quite different from the 1932 version and deals more with the cocaine trade rather than gang wars and prohibition-era activities. So, to answer your question, in the context of the Scarface movies, the Cuban refugee refers to Tony Montana portrayed by Al Pacino in the 1983 version of Scarface."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is especially true of violin music, since the mandolin has the same tuning of the violin. Following its invention and early development in Italy the mandolin spread throughout the European continent. The instrument was primarily used in a classical tradition with Mandolin orchestras, so called Estudiantinas or in Germany Zupforchestern appearing in many cities. Following this continental popularity of the mandolin family local traditions appeared outside of Europe in the Americas and in Japan. Travelling mandolin virtuosi like Giuseppe Pettine, Raffaele Calace and Silvio Ranieri contributed to the mandolin becoming a \\"fad\\" instrument in the early 20th century. This \\"mandolin craze\\" was fading by the 1930s, but just as this practice was falling into disuse, the mandolin found a new niche in American country, old-time music, bluegrass and folk music. More recently, the Baroque and Classical mandolin repertory and styles have benefited from the raised awareness of and interest in Early music, with media attention to classical players such as Israeli Avi Avital, Italian Carlo Aonzo and American Joseph Brent.

Not a heavy, cleansing rain that leaves the streets steaming and the neatly sculptured yards lush and fragrant. This is a gray drizzling rain. A rain that makes him think of places like England and Scotland as they appear in those disturbing late night films on cable, the ones in black and white that weren't particularly memorable when they were made and are even less so now.

His hair hangs in flat and sodden wings, falling into his eyes.

Wolf island displayed lots of evidence for natural selection, and had a large variety of species inhabiting it. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island had more animals that survived their environment? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it cannot be definitively concluded which island had more animals that survived their environment. However, we know that Wolf Island exhibited a large variety of species and showed evidence of natural selection, which is a process that tends to favor species being able to adapt to their environment. This suggests that many animals on Wolf Island have evolved to better survive their environment over time. On the other hand, Loon Island has a very stable environment with less diversity in species. Although the stability of the environment may make survival easier for some species, the limited diversity could indicate less competition and a lower potential for evolution. In summary, while Wolf Island has a larger variety of species and shows evidence of natural selection, it is not clear how this directly translates to the number of animals that have survived their environment.

Report: Former Miss Teen Colorado runner-up's name, likeness removed from pageant site when porn video alleged LOS ANGELES – The name and likeness of Kristy Althaus, the first runner-up in the 2012 Miss Colorado Teen USA beauty contest, have reportedly been removed from the pageant's website following a report that she made a porn video shortly after turning 18. The gossip website Gawker.com printed before and after versions of the site, which show that her name has been deleted. They say her name was removed after they contacted the pageant about her alleged porn video. They reported that a YouTube video of the 2012 pageant, showing her and the eventual winner onstage, had been removed from the Miss Teen Colorado USA site as well. The moves came after a woman strongly resembling Althaus appeared on an adult entertainment site, Gawker reports. The video and screenshots from it have gone viral and have been widely circulated on an array of X-rated websites. The subject of the video is asked by a man off-camera to confirm that she is 18. She also states that it is her first adult video. Althaus, whose name was also removed from the Kansas State University directory on Friday, did not respond to an email request for comment. The Miss Colorado USA pageant is the state feeder to the Donald Trump-owned Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants. Reps for the Colorado pageant and the Miss Universe Organization did not respond to a request for comment. Angie Meyer, a former publicist for the Miss California pageant, looked at the video of Althaus in the Miss Colorado Teen USA pageant, and the porn video, and said she thought they were \\"for sure the same girl.\\" A porn insider said it was a \\"pretty good bet\\" it was the same person in each video. \\"But short of seeing the 2257 model ID and docs, there is no way to say 100 percent for sure.\\" The insider pointed us to the site's 2257 page, which states it is in compliance with the law that all models be over 18 years old. Roger Neal, a rep who has worked closely with the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA branches, told FOX411: \\"The pageant these days seems to like controversy. And the girls (who participate) often see examples daily of reality stars being rewarded for bad behavior, so they figure if they act badly, they will be stars too.\\" Althaus’ Twitter account was also taken down after the report surfaced, but a site that archives tweets still had some of her most recent, including: \\"Trust is like an eraser, it gets smaller with every mistake you make,\\" and \\"There's three ways to do things ... the right way, the wrong way and the way I do it.\\" Miss Teen USA has rules; one is that contestants can't be married or have been married. State organizers may also have their own contracts with moral clauses. Meyer told us there is an unwritten ethical obligation for the participants to uphold traditional values when it comes to a high-profile pageant such as Miss Teen USA. \\"There shouldn't be a question if these types of actions are justified in the pageant world - they aren't,\\" she said. \\"What a poor example this sets for teenage girls across the country.\\" Tom Hynes, senior editor of AVN (Adult Video Network) Magazine, said women are paid a few hundred to 1,000 for videos such as the one Althaus allegedly made. He questioned why such a big deal is being made of the incident, especially given that Althaus, if she’s the woman in the video, doesn't appear to have broken the rules while she was in the pageant. \\"Looks to me like she won runner-up two years ago fair and square and is being 'punished' retroactively for behavior undertaken well after the year she won is already over,\\" Hynes said. \\"It's the pageant organizers who seem out-of-control here. They brought this on themselves by erasing any mention of her.\\" Althaus is not the first pageant queen to be embroiled in a porn scandal. In 2012, Miss Delaware Teen USA relinquished her crown amid allegations that she had made a porn video. Then there was 2012’s Miss Nevada, who risked losing her title after risqué photographs of her posing lewdly with porn king Ron Jeremy were cited on her Facebook page. A few years earlier, 2006’s Miss Nevada Katie Rees was stripped of her sash after naughty snaps of her in less-than-ladylike positions made their way onto social media. Carrie Prejean, Miss California USA 2009, was also fired after a personal sex tape she made surfaced. The most famous case is probably that of Vanessa Williams, who gave up her Miss America crown after nude photos of her with another woman surfaced in Penthouse magazine in 1993. She survived the scandal and went on to a very successful singing and acting career. Danielle Jones-Wesley contributed to this report.

CHAPTER XX BETTY AT LARGE It was not till Betty found herself many blocks distant from the office of _Peaceful Moments_ that she checked her headlong flight. She had run down the stairs and out into the street blindly, filled only with that passion for escape which had swept her away from Mervo. Not till she had dived into the human river of Broadway and reached Times Square did she feel secure. Then, with less haste, she walked on to the park, and sat down on a bench, to think. Inevitably she had placed her own construction on John's sudden appearance in New York and at the spot where only one person in any way connected with Mervo knew her to be. She did not know that Smith and he were friends, and did not, therefore, suspect that the former and not herself might be the object of his visit. Nor had any word reached her of what had happened at Mervo after her departure. She had taken it for granted that things had continued as she had left them; and the only possible explanation to her of John's presence in New York was that, acting under orders from Mr. Scobell, he had come to try and bring her back. She shuddered as she conjured up the scene that must have taken place if Pugsy had not mentioned his name and she had gone on into the inner room. In itself the thought that, after what she had said that morning on the island, after she had forced on him, stripping it of the uttermost rag of disguise, the realization of how his position appeared to her, he should have come, under orders, to bring her back, was well-nigh unendurable.

In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - SEED is a block cipher developed by the Korea Information Security Agency (KISA). It is used broadly throughout South Korean industry, but seldom found elsewhere. It gained popularity in Korea because 40-bit encryption was not considered strong enough, so the Korea Information Security Agency developed its own standard.

These fruits usually develop from a single carpel, and mostly from flowers with superior ovaries (polypyrenous drupes are exceptions). The definitive characteristic of a drupe is that the hard, \\"lignified\\" stone (or pit) is derived from the ovary wall of the flowerin an aggregate fruit composed of small, individual drupes (such as a raspberry), each individual is termed a drupelet and may together form a botanic berry. - Pan de coco , literally \`\` coconut bread '' in Spanish , is a rich sweet roll with a coconut filling . - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - The Arecaceae are a botanical family of perennial climbers, shrubs, acaules and trees commonly known as palm trees (owing to historical usage, the family is alternatively called Palmae). They are flowering plants, a family in the monocot order Arecales.

There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said. The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services, a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents. The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it. It's not always easy.\\" Self-representation is a right affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The practice is far more common in civil matters than in criminal cases.

The premise states that the individual in question was appointed as a dictator for life but was then assassinated by Brutus, among others, on the Ides of March, 44 B.C. Breaking down the premise: 1. This individual was appointed as a dictator for life, which means they held a powerful position in their society. 2. The person was assassinated by Brutus and some other people. The mention of Brutus suggests that the person being referred to might be Julius Caesar from the famous Roman Republic. Julius Caesar was indeed betrayed and assassinated by Brutus, along with other conspirators, as part of a plan to restore the Roman Republic and curb the increase of power Caesar was accumulating. 3. The assassination took place on the Ides of March, which falls on March 15. This is also historically correct, as Julius Caesar was assassinated on this day. 4. The premise specifies the event occurred in 44 B.C., which is consistent with the historical timeline of Julius Caesar's assassination. Based on these key points, we can confirm that the hypothesis, \\"In 44 B.C., he was\\", is entailed by the premise, as it encompasses all the information presented and accurately describes the circumstance and the actions that occurred in that year. The hypothesis in this context implies that the individual (possibly Julius Caesar) met their fate through assassination in 44 B.C."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation -44g - 137g + 7674 - 30699 = 126g for g, first combine the like terms involving g on the left side of the equation. Step 1: (-44g - 137g) + 7674 - 30699 = 126g Combine the terms: -181g + 7674 - 30699 = 126g Now, add 30699 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side. Step 2: -181g + 7674 - 30699 + 30699 = 126g + 30699 Simplify: -181g + 7674 = 126g + 30699 Next, add 181g to both sides of the equation to isolate the term involving g on the right side. Step 3: -181g + 7674 + 181g = 126g + 30699 + 181g Simplify: 7674 = 307g + 30699 Now, subtract 30699 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term involving g on the right side. Step 4: 7674 - 30699 = 307g + 30699 - 30699 Simplify: -23025 = 307g Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 307 to solve for g.

One way to get an appealing portrait of a cat or dog is to hold a biscuit or treat above the camera.

Futurists are scientists who analyze the way the world is today and use that information.to predict what the world will be like in the future. Golden focuses on the study of transportation. He spends his days studying the relationships between cars, subways, and trains. But he's most excited about imagining the way these relationships will change in the future. Many public transportation supporters dislike big cities because they spend hours driving from one side of the city to the other. And there aren't enough buses and. subways. However, Golden sees a trend toward fewer cars' in the future. He explains, \\"Cities have a cost of car ownership, which is a challenge. All these vehicles cost the city in services, in having to repair roads and other things. \\"Cars also take up a lot of space. Golden points out that having so many parking spaces is wasteful. Much of the time the parking spaces sit empty. What is the solution?\\"I think cities will make new laws to limit the number of cars people can have ,\\" says Golden. \\"Instead, people will use taxis, subways, and buses. New technology, like smartphones, can make these forms of public transportation even better. Imagine if everyone had a smartphone and used them to signal when they wanted to ride the bus. Buses could change their route to meet people's requests.\\" How soon would these changes come? Golden admits that it will take several years. Cities can be slow to change. Also, new systems of transportation can be expensive. \\"But it's coming,\\" he says. \\"The trend of the empowered city will be here soon. \\" The other trend that excites Golden is electric cars. Golden especially believes in the future of electric cars that have sensors to understand the world around them. \\"If we have cars that can communicate with one another, they can adjust speeds to cut down on traffic jams,\\"he says.

Don’t put a lock through the tags on your zippers since they can easily be broken off. If you plan on traveling with your backpack through busy areas, invest in locks so no one can steal your belongings. If you’re taking your bag through an airport, make sure you use a lock that’s TSA-approved. Backpacks that have a basic color, such as black or brown, are easier for thieves to steal since they don’t have any distinguishing features. Look for backpacks that have reflective strips or bright colors so you can identify it as your own and stay safe while you travel. If your bag doesn’t have any built-in colors, use ribbons or neon duct tape on parts of your bag so you can see it from a distance. Keep in mind how you’re primarily using the backpack to determine what sort of storage you need. For example, you may want separate sections for dirty and clean clothes or a laptop sleeve to hold protect your valuables. Compressions straps are buckles used to hold your materials tightly so they don’t take up as much space. When you pack your bag, use the compression straps to hold down soft items, such as clothes. Tighten the straps to condense your things so you can put more on top. If your bag doesn’t have compression straps, then you can also buy compression cubes to put in your bag instead. Some larger travel backpacks have smaller packs attached that you can remove. That way, you don’t need to carry all of your belongings everywhere you go. Instead, you can leave your larger bag where you’re staying and travel light during the day. Not every travel backpack will have a removable day pack.

Statue: A statue is a three-dimensional sculpture typically created as an artistic representation of a person, animal, or object. In this sentence, the statue is the main subject being described. Thus, it holds great importance in understanding the focus of the sentence. 2. Philosopher: A philosopher is an individual who engages in critical thinking, seeking truth and wisdom through the study of fundamental problems concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. In this sentence, the philosopher denotes who the statue represents, adding a critical piece of information that helps us know the specific subject of the sculpture. 3. Outside: This term indicates location, illustrating a relationship between the statue and its surroundings. It tells us that the statue is positioned outdoors, rather than indoors or within a specific space, such as a museum or gallery. This word also suggests that the statue is likely of a significant size and possibly meant to be prominently displayed. 4. Palladian: Palladian architecture is a European architectural style derived from the designs of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio (1508–1580). This style is characterized by a strict adherence to classical principles inspired by ancient Roman temples, resulting in symmetrical, harmonious, and elegant buildings. The inclusion of the term 'Palladian' in the sentence offers critical information about the architectural context in which the statue appears. This word helps establish a cultural and historical context that can add to our understanding and appreciation of the statue and its surroundings. 5. Structure: In this context, the structure refers to an architectural-building or edifice that follows the Palladian architectural style. The presence of the statue outside of this structure implies a connection between the philosopher, the statue, and the building, such as the values they embody or their contextual importance in a historical or cultural setting.

Following the Seven Years' War (1756–63) and the forced migration of Native American tribes westward, German, Scots-Irish, and other European immigrants settled in the central Susquehanna Valley, including in the area that would become Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Northumberland was laid out around a central village green in 1772, on land originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, as part of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. During the American Revolution, the village was evacuated as part of the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784. In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included Quaker and Wesleyan meeting houses, a brewery, two potteries, a potash manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses. The Priestley property, purchased in 1794 at a total cost of £500 (£ 56,400 in 2019) from Reuben Haines, who had secured the patent to the land for Northumberland, comprised four lots of the original village plan (numbers 29–32).

Given the question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: what has been discovered on mars so far? The answer is:","completion":"1. Water Ice: Researchers have discovered signs of water ice in many parts of Mars. In fact, there is enough ice just beneath the planet's surface to fill Lake Superior, the world's largest freshwater lake by volume. These ice reserves are found beneath the surface at Mars' middle to high latitudes. Detecting water is significant as it is a key ingredient for life, and could potentially be used as a resource by future human explorers. 2. Evidence of Ancient Lakes and Streams: NASA's rovers, like the Curiosity Rover, have discovered that there were once potentially habitable environments on Mars. It found evidence of ancient fast flowing streams and lakes. 3. Seasonal Methane: Methane (CH4) is an organic molecule present on Mars. Curiosity rover confirmed the presence of methane on Mars in 2014 and fluctuations in its levels depending on the season. This is intriguing because on Earth, methane is produced by both geological and biological processes. 4. Organic Molecules: In 2018, Curiosity Rover discovered complex organic molecules in Martian rocks. These are the same type of molecules that might be the product of life. 5. Martian Meteorites: Over 200 Mars meteorites have been found on Earth. These meteorites have helped scientists understand the Martian crust and mantle composition, as well as the age of Martian surfaces. 6. Current Weather and Climate: Mars has seasons like Earth, but they are about twice as long because Mars’ year is about 1.9 Earth years. Temperature, pressure, and radiation measurements have been taken by several Mars landers and rovers. 7. Volcanic Activity: Mars has the largest known volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and it has evidence of volcanic activity. Though it's currently a dormant volcano, this shows Mars was geologically active in the past. 8. Dust Storms: Mars experiences massive dust storms, the largest in our solar system. These storms can cover the entire planet and last for months. 9. Polar Ice Caps: Just like Earth, Mars has polar ice caps made from water and carbon dioxide. These ice caps also change with the Martian seasons. 10. Possibility of Past Life: While the presence of extraterrestrial life has not been detected, several Mars missions have been launched specifically designed to search for biosignatures (signs of past or present life). For example, Perseverance rover is currently in its mission intending to explore previous life conditions. The steps I took to gather these facts include researching through various Mars exploration projects, looking at factual data, and analyzing discoveries made over time. This is to ensure that the facts provided are scientifically validated and up-to-date with the latest findings. It's also significant to understand that Mars exploration is an ongoing field of study and more discoveries can be unveiled over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Since materialsfor making a medicine to cure a sickness can be found everywhere, one can practise folk medicine in any place of the world. The use of folk medicine goes all the way back to the time of the earliest man when both man and animal used plants and herbs to keep healthy. It is usually seen that an animal eat snakeroot after being bitten by a poisonous snake. Because animals seem to have this natural ability for knowing which plants and herbs will cure what sickness, man probably learned how to care for himself by animal watching. Man also learned other things from animals. He observed that wild animals, when sick, kept quiet and rest, getting well with the help of the medicine in plants and pure air. He saw that an animal with a fever could often be found resting in a cool place, eating nothing, and often drinking water until the fever was gone. Some believe that folk medicine deals with a lot of old wives' tales which have something to do with the medical treatment of the body. Stories are told about the powers of a certain vegetable material, which when hung around the neck, brings the wearer good health during the cold winter months. Such a story is simply a fairy tale.

Perspective: The farming of animals causes suffering. Causing suffering is wrong. The farming of animals is wrong. Step 1: Understand the claim and the perspective. The claim states that humans should eat meat. The perspective, however, discusses the consequences of animal farming, such as animal suffering, and concludes that farming animals is morally wrong. Step 2: Analyze the perspective in relation to the claim. You must evaluate whether the perspective supports the idea that humans should eat meat or argues against it. The perspective talks about the negative consequences of animal farming, which is one way that humans obtain meat. Step 3: Determine if the perspective supports or undermines the claim.

The Remans are a slave race of the Romulan Empire, used as miners and cannon fodder. A faction of the military is in support of Shinzon, but the Praetor and senate are set against it. After rejecting the motion, the Praetor and remaining senators are disintegrated by a device left in the room by a military-aligned senator.

En route, they discover a positronic energy reading on a planet in the Kolaran system near the Romulan Neutral Zone. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Lieutenant Commander Worf, and Lieutenant Commander Data land on Kolarus III and discover the remnants of an android resembling Data. When the android is reassembled it introduces itself as B-4. The crew deduce it to be a less-advanced, earlier version of Data. Picard is contacted by Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway and orders the ship on a diplomatic mission to nearby Romulus. Janeway explains that the Romulan Empire has been taken over in a military coup by Shinzon, who says he wants peace with the Federation and to bring freedom to Remus. On arrival, they learn Shinzon is a clone of Picard, secretly created by Romulans to plant a high ranking spy into the Federation, but the project was abandoned and Shinzon left on Remus as a child to die as a slave. After many years, Shinzon became a leader of the Remans, and constructed his heavily armed flagship, the Scimitar. Initially, diplomatic efforts go well, but the Enterprise crew discover the Scimitar is producing low levels of thalaron radiation, which had been used to kill the Imperial Senate and is deadly to nearly all life forms.

Ford refuses to confirm what workers know: Bronco, Ranger returning to U.S. If there's one thing auto lovers can take from this (insert adjective here) election cycle, it's confirmation that Ford is resurrecting the Bronco SUV and Ranger pickup truck. The news break comes from an unlikely source: A plant chairman for United Auto Workers Local 900 responding to Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump's accusations in the first debate that Ford is moving jobs to Mexico. Bill Johnson, who represents workers at the Wayne, Mich., plant that made the Focus and C-Max compact cars now being moved to a plant in Mexico, told the Detroit Free Press on September 30 that Trump needs \\"to get his facts straight.\\" Trump said in the debate that thousands of jobs would be leaving Michigan as a result of Ford's decision to move its small-car production south of the border. Ford fired back that no jobs would be lost. The UAW supported this, with Johnson adding that while autoworkers \\"hate to see products go to Mexico,\\" the return of the Ranger midsize pickup truck and Bronco SUV will secure the future of UAW workers at the Michigan Assembly Plant more than the comparatively low-volume compact cars. The SUV/crossover is the best-selling segment in the U.S. The midsize pickup truck segment is hot with the return of the Chevy Colorado, GMC Canyon, and overdue redesigns of the Honda Ridgeline and segment best-selling Toyota Tacoma. These models, along with the Nissan Frontier, are averaging double-digit sales increases over 2015. Ford is missing the action, despite having the best-selling vehicle in America for more than three decades with the Ford F-150. Ford Vice President Mark LaNeve whetted speculation in February at the 2016 Chicago Auto Show by announcing the automaker will add four new SUVs globally by 2020. Yet Ford refuses to confirm the return of the Bronco and Ranger. \\"We do not speculate about future product plans,\\" Ford spokesman Bill Collins said, in response to what is becoming increasingly obvious. Automakers use carefully crafted promotional cycles to maximize interest — and media coverage — during the long introductory period of new models. Ford's unwillingness to confirm what its workers are planning for is less a denial than a preference to control that cycle. In place of specifics we have speculation, which dates back much further than 2016. In August 2015, John Wolkonowicz, a former Ford product planner and current independent analyst told Bloomberg the Bronco will have newfound appeal. \\"Gen Y has discovered the original Bronco,\\" Wolkonowicz said. \\"Ford has seen what the Mustang can do for them, and they are bringing back their iconic names.\\" Originally launched in 1966, the rugged two-door off-road vehicle competed with the Jeep CJ, now known as the Wrangler. It grew over time on a truck platform shared with the Ford F-150 pickup truck. Due to increased safety standards and the third brake light, it became illegal to remove the top in 1992, though there is ample evidence of users getting around that on Ford truck forums. After 30 years of production, and one infamous stint in 1994 as O.J. Simpson's getaway vehicle in a surreal televised low-speed chase as Los Angeles police pursued him for the alleged murder of his ex-wife and her boyfriend, the Bronco was discontinued in 1996. Vehicles were getting smaller and more fuel-efficient, and the versatile Explorer appealed to families as a minivan alternative while retaining some of the ruggedness of a utility vehicle. While the Bronco helped usher in the SUV-era, its demise helped enter in the crossover era. The difference between an SUV and crossover, which often are lumped together in sales statistics and marketing materials, is that SUVs like the Bronco were based on stiffer, rougher riding body-on-frame construction, same as a pickup. Crossovers are the same size, but have moved to the unibody construction used on cars for smoother, softer rides. The new Bronco is expected to be similarly sized to the Ford Explorer midsize crossover, but the Bronco should be a true SUV built on a body-on-frame truck platform. It should be more off-road capable, thereby able to better compete with Jeep's portfolio of trail-rated crossovers. It would make sense to share the platform with the Ranger midsize pickup truck, which was discontinued in the U.S. in 2011 but is still manufactured and sold in 180 other countries, including Mexico. It was redesigned in 2015 and shares a platform with the Everest three-row SUV available in Australia. Chances are the Bronco will look more like the Everest than the fanboy images going around social media, where all this speculation was ignited.

Mystery dining, also known as secret shopping or mystery shopping, is a tool employed by businesses, including restaurants, to measure and evaluate customer experience, staff performance, and operational quality. This approach involves the recruitment of anonymous individuals, known as mystery diners, who visit the establishment as regular customers while secretly observing and assessing service quality and overall experience based on set criteria. Mystery dining can be beneficial to restaurant owners in several ways: 1. Objective observation: By using anonymous and trained individuals, restaurant owners receive an unbiased perspective on their services, which highlights areas that need improvement or those that excel. 2. Enhanced customer experience: Mystery diners can evaluate the overall customer journey from making a reservation (if applicable) to receiving the final bill, providing insights on how to improve customer experience at various stages. 3. Staff performance evaluation: Mystery dining can reveal staff strengths and weaknesses in terms of service, politeness, attentiveness, and knowledge about the menu. 4. Compliance with regulations: Mystery shoppers can evaluate whether a restaurant is compliant with food safety regulations, cleanliness standards, and other rules. 5. Competitor analysis: Comparing results from mystery dining evaluations with industry benchmarks or competitors' assessment can help restaurateurs comprehend where they stand relative to others. Apart from mystery dining services, there are other market research platforms available for small local business owners, similar to AskMyTargetMarket.com, which can provide valuable feedback. Some popular alternatives include: 1. SurveyMonkey Audience: This platform specializes in providing access to a global pool of respondents, which can be further refined based on demographics and market segments. Business owners can create their own surveys or choose aided survey design supported by the platform's experts. 2. Google Surveys: Google Surveys is a simple and affordable way to gain feedback from customers. Users can create custom surveys, select target audience, and analyze results using an automatic system. The tool integrates easily with Google Analytics, allowing business owners to have a holistic view of their online presence and target audience. 3. Toluna QuickSurveys: Toluna QuickSurveys offers access to a diverse pool of respondents and supports various types of surveys. The platform also presents real-time reporting and data visualization, allowing businesses to have quick insights into customer preferences and opinions. 4.

Movie title: Bride of Chucky Context: In 1998, one month after Chucky's demise in the last film, Tiffany, a former girlfriend and accomplice of serial killer Charles Lee Ray, acquires Chucky's remains from a police compound. Believing that Ray's soul still inhabits the doll, Tiffany crudely stitches it back together and reenacts the voodoo ritual which instilled Ray inside the doll ten years ago. The incantations seemingly fail to produce results, but Chucky suddenly springs to life and kills Tiffany's Goth admirer Damien while Tiffany looks on with excitement. Later, Tiffany and Chucky have an argument because Tiffany believed that Chucky wanted to marry her. Upon learning he had no intention of doing so, Tiffany locks Chucky in a playpen, and gives him another doll in a wedding dress to make fun of him. Chucky escapes the play pen and kills Tiffany by electrocuting her. He then uses the same voodoo ritual to transfer her soul into the bride doll so she could feel what he went through as a living doll. Still intent on becoming human again, Chucky plans to retrieve the magical amulet that was buried with Ray's body, and use the bodies of Tiffany's neighbor Jesse and his girlfriend Jade as hosts for their souls. Tiffany sends Jesse a message asking him to transport the two dolls to New Jersey in exchange for money. Jesse convinces Jade to go with him. As they pack up, Jade's strict and overprotective uncle Warren plants a bag of marijuana in Jesse's van to frame him. Chucky and Tiffany set up a car airbag to launch nails into his face, then hide the body. The oblivious Jesse and Jade return and begin their trip. Outside a convenience store, they are pulled over by Officer Norton, who searches Jesse's car and finds the marijuana. As he goes back to his patrol car to report it, Chucky causes the car to explode, and Jesse and Jade flee the scene. They stop at a wedding chapel/hotel and get married.

Question: Build a movie plot around this: Who did Radcliffe kidnapped in order to uncover the truth? Richard Cobb Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Introducing the Main Characters and Setting To build the movie plot around the given prompt, let's first establish the main characters involved. Our protagonist is Radcliffe, a former investigative journalist who was disgraced after publishing a controversial article. Richard Cobb is a wealthy businessman with hidden secrets connected to the truth Radcliffe is seeking. The story will take place in a bustling urban city gripped by fear and filled with dark secrets that are waiting to be uncovered. Step 2: Establishing the Inciting Incident Our movie starts with Radcliffe, currently working as a private investigator, receiving anonymous documents from a mysterious source implicating Richard Cobb in a series of heinous crimes. Radcliffe recognizes this as an opportunity to redeem his professional reputation by exposing Cobb's wrongdoings and revealing the truth behind the conspiracy. Step 3: The Kidnapping Determined to confront Cobb directly and extract any kind of confession, Radcliffe carefully plans and executes the abduction of Richard Cobb. During the dramatic kidnapping scene, Radcliffe captures Cobb while attempting to avoid the attention of the city's police force. Step 4: Radcliffe's Scheme and Investigation As Radcliffe holds Cobb hostage, he presents him with the evidence and demands explanations. However, Cobb denies all accusations and pleads his innocence. To uncover the truth, Radcliffe begins an investigation, interrogating not only Cobb but also those around him in an attempt to piece together the whole story. Step 5: The Truth Slowly Unfolds As Radcliffe delves deeper into his investigation, he realizes that the truth is far more complex and dangerous than he initially anticipated. He unravels a vast network of power, corruption, and betrayal involving multiple powerful figures, including some people close to him. Step 6: The Climax In the gripping climax, Radcliffe confronts the mastermind behind the conspiracy, resulting in a tense standoff that puts both the hero's life and the final, shocking truth on the line. Step 7: Resolution and Conclusion With the conspiracy revealed and the guilty parties brought to justice, Radcliffe proves Richard Cobb is merely a pawn in the larger game, and his kidnap served as a catalyst. The end of the movie sees Radcliffe restoring his journalistic reputation, but at a price that leaves him questioning the morality of his actions and the world around him. In this movie plot, Radcliffe kidnaps Richard Cobb in order to uncover the truth about a series of crimes and a larger conspiracy at play, leading him through a dangerous journey of deception and moral ambiguity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The man moved the lamp from the nightstand to the dresser because the","completion":"soft glow was casting an eerie shadow in the room. As he adjusted the position, he tried to recall how this ancient artifact had come into his possession. It was found buried deep within the sands of a long-forgotten Egyptian tomb during an archeological expedition he had joined several months ago. The beautifully crafted lamp had caught his eye with its intricate engravings, curious markings, and an aura of mysticism that seemed to resonate from it. After a long day at work and with his curiosity piqued, the man decided it was finally time to investigate the lamp further. He pulled his overstuffed chair closer to the dresser, grabbed a magnifying glass, and began examining the engravings more closely. The fine lines and details reminded him of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, but there was something different, almost otherworldly about the script. As the man continued his inspection, he noticed a small, delicately carved button hidden near the base of the lamp. He hesitated for a moment, mulling over whether or not to press it. But the thrill of unraveling the mystery outweighed his fear, and he slowly moved his finger towards the button, his heart pounding in anticipation. The moment he pressed it, a blinding light erupted from the lamp, and a thick plume of smoke billowed throughout the room. Coughing and shielding his eyes from the brilliance of the light, the man stumbled back, watching in disbelief as the smoke took a more solid form. Before him stood a towering figure shrouded in billowing robes. The entity's face was concealed beneath a hood, but its piercing, ethereal eyes seemed to radiate both wisdom and power. The man, realizing he had unwittingly released a genie from the lamp, could barely stammer out a coherent sentence. \\"Who...what are you?\\" he asked hesitantly, his voice trembling with fear and a hint of awe. \\"I am known as Akila, the ancient one,\\" replied the genie in a booming voice that seemed to reverberate through the very air. \\"I have been confined to this lamp for countless eons, waiting for the one who would release me. And now, you have set me free.\\" The man gulped, trying to process the gravity of the situation. \\"So, do I get three wishes, like in the stories?\\" he asked hopefully. Akila chuckled, the sound rolling like thunder through the still, quiet room. \\"The tales of old are but a mere shadow of the truth,\\" the genie answered cryptically. \\"My power is limited to a single wish, but it is a wish without bounds or restrictions. Choose wisely, mortal, for what you ask is what you shall receive.\\" The man's mind raced with possibilities, his initial thoughts focusing on wealth, power, and immortality. But as the weight of his decision pressed down upon him, he realized he had an opportunity to make a lasting, meaningful impact on the world. Lost in thought, he considered the plight of so many suffering around the globe, the problems that needed solutions, and the dreams that could be made real. After hours spent pondering his monumental choice, he finally spoke. \\"I wish for the wisdom to enact positive change in the world, to make a difference that will help humanity thrive and find peace.\\" Akila's expression softened, his luminescent eyes seeming to reflect a sense of quiet approval. \\"Your wish is unconventional, yet noble. It shall be granted,\\" he intoned solemnly. As a torrent of knowledge, insight, and understanding flooded the man's mind, he felt the very fabric of his being expand and transform. Guided by the unprecedented wisdom bestowed upon him by the genie, he knew that he now had the power to shape a better world, where kindness, compassion, and hope would prevail. Empowered by his newfound knowledge, he dedicated his life to advocating for those in need, devising innovative solutions to global crises, and inspiring others to join him in his quest for a brighter, more equitable future. Over the years that followed, the man became a beacon of light in an increasingly dark world. He catalyzed the progress of human civilization, advancing science, technology, and the arts, and promoting peace and unity across all of humanity. His name became synonymous with positive change, and as his life had been irrevocably altered by that ancient lamp, so too was the world transformed by his actions. As for the enchanted lamp and Akila, the genie, their story faded into legend. They remained a secret, locked away in the man's study, a testament to the incredible power that had shaped a legacy. And while the mortal's time would eventually come to an end, the impact of his wish would reverberate throughout history, ensuring that the spark of hope he had ignited would never be extinguished."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - The Helvellaceae are a family of ascomycete fungi , the best known members of which are the elfin saddles of the genus Helvella . Originally erected by Elias Magnus Fries in 1823 as Elvellacei , it contained many genera . Several of these , such as Gyromitra and Discina , have been found to be more distantly related in a molecular study of ribosomal DNA by mycologist Kerry O'Donnell in 1997 , leaving a much smaller core clade now redefined as Helvellaceae . Instead , this narrowly defined group is most closely related to the true truffles of the Tuberaceae . According to the Dictionary of the Fungi ( 10th edition , 2008 ) , the family contains six genera and 63 species . - A fungus (plural: fungi or funguses) is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes unicellular microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as multicellular fungi that produce familiar fruiting forms such as mushrooms and bracket fungi. These organisms are classified as a kingdom, Fungi, which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals. - Helvella is a genus of ascomycete fungus of the family Helvellaceae. The mushrooms, commonly known as elfin saddles, are identified by their irregularly shaped caps, fluted stems, and fuzzy undersurfaces. They are found in North America and in Europe. Well known species include the whitish \\"H. crispa\\" and the grey \\"H. lacunosa\\". They have been reported to cause gastrointestinal symptoms when eaten raw. - The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells. - Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is a DNA sequence that codes for ribosomal RNA. Ribosomes are assemblies of proteins and rRNA molecules that translate mRNA molecules to produce proteins. As shown in the figure, rDNA of eukaryotes consists of a tandem repeat of a unit segment, an operon, composed of NTS, ETS, 18S, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, and 28S tracts. rDNA has another gene, coding for 5S rRNA, located in the genome in most eukaryotes. 5S rDNA is also present in tandem repeats as in \\"Drosophila\\". In the nucleus, the rDNA region of the chromosome is visualized as a nucleolus which forms expanded chromosomal loops with rDNA. These rDNA regions are also called nucleolus organizer regions, as they give rise to the nucleolus. In the human genome there are 5 chromosomes with nucleolus organizer regions: the acrocentric chromosomes 13,14,15,21 and 22. In Bacteria, Archaea and chloroplasts the rRNA is composed of different (smaller) units, the large (23S) ribosomal RNA, 16S ribosomal RNA and 5S rRNA. The 16S rRNA is widely used for phylogenetic studies. - <section begin=lead />The human genome is the complete set of nucleic acid sequence for humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\"), encoded as DNA within the 23 chromosome pairs in cell nuclei and in a small DNA molecule found within individual mitochondria. Human genomes include both protein-coding DNA genes and noncoding DNA. Haploid human genomes, which are contained in germ cells (the egg and sperm gamete cells created in the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction before fertilization creates a zygote) consist of three billion DNA base pairs, while diploid genomes (found in somatic cells) have twice the DNA content. While there are significant differences among the genomes of human individuals (on the order of 0.1%), these are considerably smaller than the differences between humans and their closest living relatives, the chimpanzees (approximately 4%) and bonobos.<section end=lead /> - The common name elfin saddle is given to a number of Ascomycete fungi in the order Pezizales. These medium to small fungi often have irregular saddle-shaped caps. Species include: - The Tuberaceae are a family of mycorrhizal fungi. It includes the genus \\"Tuber\\", which includes the so-called \\"true\\" truffles. It was characterized by the Belgian botanist Barthélemy Charles Joseph du Mortier in 1822. A molecular study of ribosomal DNA by mycologist Kerry O'Donnell in 1997 found that a small clade now redefined as Helvellaceae is most closely related to the Tuberaceae. - The nucleolus (or , plural nucleoli or ) is the largest structure in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, where it is primarily responsible for the creation of ribosomes via a process known as ribosome biogenesis. Nucleoli also have other important functions like assembly of signal recognition particles and playing a role in the cell's response to stress. Nucleoli are made of proteins, DNA and RNA and form around specific chromosomal regions. Malfunction of nucleoli can be the cause of several human conditions which include diseases, disorders, syndromes and illnesses. - Gyromitra is a genus of ascomycete mushrooms found in the northern hemisphere. The genus contains about 18 species. - Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. What is the relationship between 'helvellaceae' and 'pezizales'? A:","completion":"The relationship between Helvellaceae and Pezizales is that Helvellaceae is a family of ascomycete fungi within the order Pezizales. In other words, Helvellaceae is a subgroup within the larger Pezizales order. Pezizales is an order of sac fungi belonging to the class Pezizomycetes, under the phylum Ascomycota. The order Pezizales includes various families of fungi that produce sac-like fruiting bodies known as ascocarps or apothecia. Helvellaceae, best recognized for its elfin saddles of the genus Helvella, represents a distinct family within this order.

Certain areas, such as California and Japan, are more _ earthquakes than others. Although the chance of being caught in \\"The Big one\\" is remote, it's wise to be prepared if you live in a region where earthquakes are common. Educate your family about earthquakes before a big one strikes. For example, they need to know to take shelter in a doorway or under a strong object if indoors, and never to run outdoors if they are inside. If outside, they need to know to stay away from power lines and buildings where objects could fall. Teach family members how to turn off gas or water lines or electrical power that may need to be shut off after a quake if severe damage occurs. Develop a plan. Where will your family meet in the event of a disaster? What if some people are at work or school? How will you know if they are safe? Where will you all meet up?

Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in “the real world” (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here – I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting – was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda? I learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as “naïve” and “embarrassing”. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda? Because of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the “impact industry”; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study...

If Without mentioning Tripp or the Pentagon, I described her job there to the woman at Kelly., can we conclude that \\"I mentioned the Pentagon many times while explaining her job.\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is stated that you described her job at the Pentagon without actually mentioning \\"Tripp\\" or the \\"Pentagon.\\" Consequently, it would be incorrect to conclude that \\"I mentioned the Pentagon many times while explaining her job,\\" since it was specified that you did not mention the Pentagon during the explanation. However, if we assume that the main goal was to describe her job without directly referring to Tripp or the Pentagon, it is plausible that you indirectly alluded to the nature of her work or the organization she works for by describing the tasks, responsibilities, and context of her work in detail. This would allow the woman at Kelly to understand the type of work she does without explicitly mentioning the Pentagon. To achieve this, you might have discussed aspects such as: 1. The general field of work: You could have mentioned that she works in an important government institution that deals with national defense and security matters without naming the Pentagon explicitly. 2. Roles and responsibilities: You could have described her duties, which might involve working with military personnel, developing and reviewing strategies, and making decisions that impact the nation's safety and security. 3. Work environment: You might have detailed the kind of workplace she operates in, such as a highly secure office with strict regulations, a hierarchy of decision-making, and the requirement of high-level clearances. 4. Skills and qualifications: You could have talked about her educational background, experience, and the expertise that makes her suited for this job, possibly touching upon subjects like military history, international relations, or defense-related technologies and policies. By focusing on the nature of her work and not the specific institution, you could have effectively described her job without actually mentioning the Pentagon.

Shipwrecking may be deliberate or accidental. UNESCO estimates that worldwide over 3 million shipwrecks, some thousands of years old, lie on seabeds. - Coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate structures secreted by corals. Coral reefs are built by colonies of tiny animals found in marine waters that contain few nutrients. Most coral reefs are built from stony corals, which in turn consist of polyps that cluster in groups. The polyps belong to a group of animals known as Cnidaria, which also includes sea anemones and jellyfish.

Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds.

Howard and L. Sprague de Camp featuring Howard's seminal sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was revised by de Camp from Howard's original story, a then-unpublished non-fantasy Oriental tale that featured Francis X. Gordon titled \\"Three-Bladed Doom\\". De Camp changed the names of the characters, added the fantastic element, and recast the setting into Howard's Hyborian Age. The story was first published in the hardbound collection \\"Tales of Conan\\" (Gnome Press, 1955), and subsequently appeared in the paperback collection \\"Conan the Wanderer\\" (Lancer Books, 1968), as part of which it has been translated into German, Japanese, Spanish, Dutch and Italian. It was published by itself in paperback book form by Ace Books in 1981, in an edition profusely illustrated by Esteban Maroto. - Conan the Destroyer is a 1984 American sword and sorcery/adventure film directed by Richard Fleischer, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mako Iwamatsu reprising their roles as Conan and Akiro the wizard, respectively. The cast also includes Grace Jones, Wilt Chamberlain, Tracey Walter and Olivia d'Abo. It is the sequel to \\"Conan the Barbarian\\". The film was moderately successful at the box office in the U.S., and very successful internationally, although critical response was not as strong as for the original film. - Conan the Barbarian (also known as Conan the Cimmerian) is a fictional sword and sorcery hero who originated in pulp fiction magazines and has since been adapted to books, comics, several films (including \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" and \\"Conan the Destroyer\\"), television programs (cartoon and live-action), video games, role-playing games and other media. The character was created by writer Robert E. Howard in 1932 via a series of fantasy stories published in \\"Weird Tales\\" magazine. - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Lancer Books was a publisher of paperback books operated from 1961 through 1973 by Irwin Stein and Walter Zacharius. While it published stories of a number of genres, it was noted most for its science fiction and fantasy, particularly its series of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian tales, the first publication of many in paperback format. It published the controversial novel \\"Candy\\" by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg and the ribald series \\"The Man From O.R.G.Y.\\" Lancer paperbacks had a distinctive appearance, many bearing mauve or green page edging. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Conan the Wanderer is a 1968 collection of four fantasy short stories written by Robert E. Howard, L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter featuring Howard's seminal sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. Most of the stories were originally published in various fantasy magazines.

C. Henneberger and J. M. Lansinger in March 1923. The first editor, Edwin Baird, printed early work by H. P. Lovecraft, Seabury Quinn, and Clark Ashton Smith, all of whom would go on to be popular writers, but within a year the magazine was in financial trouble. Henneberger sold his interest in the publisher, Rural Publishing Corporation, to Lansinger and refinanced \\"Weird Tales\\", with Farnsworth Wright as the new editor. The first issue under Wright's control was dated November 1924. The magazine was more successful under Wright, and despite occasional financial setbacks it prospered over the next fifteen years. Under Wright's control the magazine lived up to its subtitle, \\"The Unique Magazine\\", and published a wide range of unusual fiction. - Tales of Conan is a 1955 collection of four fantasy short stories written by Robert E. Howard and L. Sprague de Camp featuring Howard 's seminal sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian . The tales as originally written by Howard were adventure yarns mostly set in the Middle Ages ; they were rewritten as Conan stories by de Camp , who also added the fantastic element .

Gnome was one of the most eminent of the fan publishers of SF, producing 86 titles in its lifespan many considered classic works of SF and Fantasy today. Gnome was important in the transitional period between Genre SF as a magazine phenomenon and its arrival in mass-market book publishing, but proved too underfunded to make the leap from fan-based publishing to the professional level. The company existed for just over a decade, ultimately failing due to inability to compete with major publishers who also started to publish science fiction. In its heyday, Gnome published many of the major SF authors, and in some cases, as with Robert E Howard's Conan series (published in six books from 1950-1955) and Isaac Asimov's Foundation series (published in three books from 1951-1953), was responsible for the manner in which their stories were collected into book form. - Leo Margulies (June 22, 1900 December 26, 1975) was an American editor and publisher of science fiction and fantasy pulp magazines and paperback books. - Ace Books is an American specialty publisher of science fiction and fantasy books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by Aaron A. Wyn and began as a genre publisher of mysteries and westerns. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, gothic novels, media tie-in novelizations, and romances. Ace became known for the \\"tête-bêche\\" binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this \\"Ace Double\\" format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound \\"tête-bêche\\", until 1973. - Fantastic Universe was a U.S. science fiction magazine which began publishing in the 1950s. It ran for 69 issues, from June 1953 to March 1960, under two different publishers. It was part of the explosion of science fiction magazine publishing in the 1950s in the United States, and was moderately successful, outlasting almost all of its competitors. The main editors were Leo Margulies (19541956) and Hans Stefan Santesson (19561960); under Santesson's tenure the quality declined somewhat, and the magazine became known for printing much UFO-related material.

Oliver Hazard Perry (1785–1819) was a United States Navy commodore who is best known for his heroic role in the War of 1812, particularly during the Battle of Lake Erie. While it is clear that Perry was a highly respected and decorated naval officer, there is no provided information about his personal opinions on the Medal of Honor, which was established in 1861, long after Perry's death. In conclusion, it is incorrect to say that the sentence \\"Oliver Hazard Perry never wanted a Medal of Honor\\" follows from the preceding text, as there is no connection or information provided to support such a statement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have the equation: 13*p + 272 = -21*p First, we want to get all the p's together on one side. So, let's add 21*p to both sides to move the -21*p over to the left side. 13*p + 21*p + 272 = -21*p + 21*p This simplifies to: 34*p + 272 = 0 Now, we want to get p all by itself. So, let's subtract 272 from both sides to move the 272 over to the right side. 34*p = -272 Lastly, we need to find out what number p is. To do this, we'll divide both sides by 34. 34*p / 34 = -272 / 34 This simplifies to: p = -8 And there you have it! The solution to the math problem is p = -8."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

OPTIONS: A). order a beer; B). pay some money; C). have a quick lunch;","completion":"Before Lee tore open the bag when the server brought him his fast food order, he needed to pay some money (Option B). Here is a possible detailed scenario illustrating the steps Lee went through before opening his fast food bag: 1. Decide to eat out: Lee might have been in a hurry, running errands, or just craving some fast food. Regardless of the reason, he decided to eat out and visited a nearby fast food restaurant. 2. Choose a restaurant: Lee chose a fast food restaurant that offered the type of food he was in the mood for. It could be a burger joint, a fried chicken place, or any other fast food establishment. 3. Pick a meal: Upon entering the restaurant or viewing its menu board, Lee would have browsed through the available options - considering the various food items, meal deals, and prices before making a decision. He might have had a favorite dish or decided to try something new. 4. Place the order: After settling on a meal, Lee proceeded to the counter or the ordering kiosk to place his order. He would have specified any customizations or preferences, such as adding extra sauce, removing pickles, or choosing a drink. 5. Pay for the order: This is the crucial step where Lee pays the required amount for his selected meal. Payment methods may vary depending on the restaurant; options could include cash, credit/debit card, or even digital payment platforms such as a mobile app or Apple Pay. Lee must ensure his bill is settled before he can proceed to enjoy his meal. 6. Wait for the food: After paying, Lee would have stepped aside and waited for the server to prepare his order. During this time, he could find a place to sit or simply stand and observe other customers or the staff. 7. Receive the food: Once the food is ready, the server would then call out Lee's name or order number, indicating that his order is complete. At this point, Lee would approach the counter to collect his bag of fast food. 8. Tearing open the bag: With his hunger potentially growing, Lee eagerly tore open the fast food bag when the server handed it to him. It is important to note that Option A (ordering a beer) could be a viable choice for Lee if he was at a fast food restaurant that serves alcoholic beverages, and he wished to enjoy a beer with his meal. However, this would typically occur after he has already paid for his order. Option C (having a quick lunch) would not be necessary before tearing open his fast food bag, as the act of tearing open the bag implies that Lee is about to have his quick lunch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Playing with other vaccinated dogs is a normal part of your dog's puppyhood. And just like your own childhood, this is a time for exploration and learning lessons. Regular play with other well-mannered dogs, who don't need to act to teach bite inhibition, will encourage her to play nicely around other dogs and you. Consider enrolling your puppy in a puppy training class, where your dog can learn essential skills while having fun. Take out a toy or bone and let her bite on it. This will teach her that her teeth belong on a toy or bone instead of on your skin. Playing rough with your hands is plenty fun, but it might be giving your puppy the wrong idea. Encourage other forms of play that don't involve your puppy nipping at your fingers, hands, ankles, and toes. Learn how to play fetch with your dog. Stick to the same rules every time you play. Learn how to play tug-of-war with your dog. Stick to the same rules to encourage your puppy to stop mouthing if she gets close to your hands. Provide plenty of interesting and new toys so that you keep your dog engaged. A bored dog is a lot more likely to seek attention from you by biting. Cycle out your toys so that your dog is less likely to get bored. Before you start playing with your dog, spray a taste deterrent on areas of your body and clothes that you dog likes to play rough with. When your dog starts biting you, stop all movement and wait for her to react to the taste deterrent. Praise her and continue playing with her when she lets go. Some options for taste deterrents include bitter apple, vapor rub, tea tree oil, or white vinegar. Alternatively, you can spray breath freshener spray (such as Binaca) into the puppy’s mouth as both a taste and sound deterrent at the moment of a bite. Spray the taste deterrent on your body and clothes (if it is fabric-safe) for at least two weeks. After two weeks, your puppy will likely have developed a strong distaste for your hands and ankles. A well-exercised puppy (exercised to the point of being tired) will not be as rough when playing with you. This will help avoid forming bad habits in the first place. A tired puppy is often a well-behaved puppy. It's sometimes tempting to want to physically punish your puppy by slapping, hitting, or waving your fingers in her face. The problem is that these responses can do one of two things: they can encourage your puppy to continue playing rough, or they can encourage your puppy to act out with real aggression. Avoid other methods of physical punishment that might scare or intimidate your puppy. If you are contemplating this sort of retaliation, you should contact a professional dog trainer or veterinary behaviorist for assistance. You might not enjoy being bitten every time you go out to play with your puppy, but you do want to forge a real bond between you and your puppy, and playing is partly how you do this. Don't give up on play time just because your puppy doesn't yet know how to play gentle. Teaching her the difference between right and wrong, not abandoning play altogether, will be best for both of you.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra? Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".","completion":"The name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra is Handel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose, life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable, wonderful time. Can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined? Despite what you might think when you first read about Superdome, this is not a football movie. In fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought. Instead, Superdome is another of those lousy soap opera-ish 70s made-for-TV movies populated with Hollywood has beens and those that never will be. The cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he's there. The plot is dull, uninteresting, and unbelievable. Donna Mills as a hit\\"man\\"? Yeah, right! It's about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked David Jansen. The movie also lacks any pace. Trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow Superdome might have had. With no drama or suspense in sight, Superdome ends up being a very poor example of a 70s made-for-TV movie. The lone highlight for me was the voice-over work from the late Charlie Jones - a sportscaster I miss listening to. The eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over-hypes the atmosphere in New Orleans is pure cheese at its finest. Like most others who have seen Superdome, I also did so courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Answer the following question: Information: - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted. - Maria Malibran ( 24 March 1808 -- 23 September 1836 ) was a Spanish mezzo - soprano who commonly sang both contralto and soprano parts , and was one of the most famous opera singers of the 19th century . Malibran was known for her stormy personality and dramatic intensity , becoming a legendary figure after her death at age 28 . Contemporary accounts of her voice describe its range , power and flexibility as extraordinary . - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock. - A contralto is a type of classical female singing voice whose vocal range is the lowest female voice type. The contralto's vocal range is fairly rare; similar to, but different from the alto, and almost identical to that of a countertenor, typically between the F below middle C (F in scientific pitch notation) to the second F above middle C (F), although at the extremes some voices can reach the E below middle C (E) or the second B above middle C (B). The contralto voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic contralto.

The modern Republic of Turkey dates only from 1923, but the history of the land within its borders stretches back to the dawn of humanity. Widespread finds of Stone Age implements in cave excavations show that Anatolia was already inhabited during the Middle of the Palaeolithic period (about 200,000 to 40,000 years ago). By Neolithic times, organized communities had arisen, such as the one at Çatalhöyük, near Konya, Turkey's most important prehistoric site. This town, which flourished between 6500 and 5500 b.c. , had flat-roofed houses of mud and timber decorated with wall-paintings, some of which show patterns that still appear on Anatolian kilims. The advent of the Bronze Age (about 3200 b.c. ), and the spread of city-states ruled by kings, is marked by the appearance of royal tombs containing bronze objects in such places as Troy in the west, and Alacahöyük near Ankara. Around this time the Sumerian civilization living in Mesopotamia (the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-day Iraq) founded and developed the cuneiform script, the world's oldest form of writing on record. The technique was introduced by Assyrian traders 1,000 years later in­to Anatolia, where it was qui­ck­ly adopted by the indigenous Hatti people, who, at this point, had already reached an ad­­vanced state of civilization. The Hittites: The capital of the Hatti was Kanesh (modern Kültepe, near Kayseri). Cuneiform tablets found here record the arrival in Anatolia of warlike invaders around the second mill­ennium b.c. Their origins remain a my­s­tery (their written language was finally deciphered in 1915), but they came from the direction of the Caucasus moun­tains, spreading destruction and disorder throughout Anatolia. It was two hundred years before they were firmly entrenched in their newly conquered empire. The newcomers were the Hittites, and their domination of Anatolia can be divided into three distinct periods: the Old Kingdom (c. 1600–1450 b.c. ), then the New or Empire Period (c. 1450–1200 b.c. ), and the Late Hittite Period (c.

RELATED: SWISS CHEESE PERVERT STRIKES PHILADELPHIA WOMAN Christopher Pagano, 42, terrorized women in the Mayfair section of Philadelphia earlier this year, dangling the dairy and asking the ladies to rub the cheese on his crotch. Pagano was busted Jan. 16 when cops surrounded his Norristown, Pa., home with guns drawn. RELATED: ‘SWISS CHEESE PERVERT’ IS HARASSING PHILLY WOMEN: REPORT He was let out on bond — but was busted and booked again over the weekend. The portly perv faces 20 total counts, including four each of stalking, indecent exposure, harassment and open lewdness, according to online court records. RELATED: STICK A TOOTHPICK IN THE 'SWISS CHEESE PERVERT' Cops were close-lipped about the latest accusations, aside from telling the Philadelphia Daily News the “harassment included using processed cheese when he approached the victims.” The incident happened in January — either right before or during a weeklong hunt for the balding, bearded alleged pervert. Pagano was busted in 2006 and 2009 for soliciting a prostitute, but both times the charges were dropped.

In 1688, the Spanish sent three more expeditions, two by sea and one by land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, Juan Bautista Chapa, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location. In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. Jumano scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from Jean L'Archevêque. The message read: I do not know what sort of people you are.

Usher was born in Dallas, Texas, the son of Jonetta Patton (nee O'Neal), from Tennessee, and Usher Raymond III. Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old. Usher developed a friendship with American record producer, Jermaine Dupri, with whom he co-wrote and produced several tracks for his second album, My Way, released on September 16, 1997. The album's lead single, \\"You Make Me Wanna...\\", reached number one in the United Kingdom, becoming Usher's first record to be top single; the record led to his popularity reaching in the country. It also became Usher's first gold- and platinum-certified single in the United States. The album's second single, \\"Nice & Slow\\", peaked in January 1998 at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Usher his first US number-one single. In February of the same year, the single was certified platinum by the RIAA. My Way has been certified six-time platinum in the United States. \\"You Make Me Wanna...\\" won the Best Male R&B/Soul Single at the 1999 Soul Train Music Awards. In the closing months of 1997, Usher embarked on a series of tour engagements including a spot on Puffy's No Way Out tour, dates with Mary J. Blige, and the opening spot on Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope Tour. Usher's first concert album, Live, was released in 1999, which featured appearances by Lil' Kim, Jagged Edge, Trey Lorenz, Shanice, Twista and Manuel Seal; the album has been certified gold in the United States. Usher made his acting debut on the UPN television series Moesha, which resulted in a recurring role on the series and subsequently his first film role in 1998's The Faculty. Usher's extracurricular activities outside of the recording industry gathered momentum over the following year as he was cast in the soap opera, The Bold and the Beautiful. He completed two more films, She's All That, and his first starring role in Light It Up. He also appeared in the Disney TV movie Geppetto. Usher's third studio album, originally titled All About U, was slated to be released in early 2001. The first single, \\"Pop Ya Collar\\", was released in late 2000 and became a number two hit in the UK but underperformed in the United States. The album was subsequently pushed back and retooled after select tracks were later leaked to the radio and Internet. After having revised and renamed to 8701, the album was released August 7, 2001 (8.7.01). The first two singles \\"U Remind Me\\" and \\"U Got It Bad\\" each topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four and six weeks, respectively. 8701 has been certified four-time platinum in the United States. Usher appeared in the 2001 film Texas Rangers. In February 2002, Usher won a Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for \\"U Remind Me\\".

The answer is:","completion":"No, \\"that Cameron was out too late\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"How would Cameron feel afterwards?\\" because it does not describe Cameron's feelings or emotional state. Instead, it provides a statement about the circumstances leading up to Cameron's current situation. A more valid answer would be something that addresses Cameron's emotions or physical sensations as a result of staying up late the night before and getting up on the wrong side of the bed. For instance, a better response could be: \\"Cameron would likely feel tired, irritable, and possibly even regretful about staying up too late.\\" This answer addresses the primary question by describing Cameron's feelings directly. Moreover, it also encompasses a wider range of emotions that someone in Cameron's situation might experience, making it more comprehensive and accurate. It is essential to differentiate between the events causing a particular feeling and the feeling itself when answering questions like this. Circumstances, actions, or situations are different from the emotional or physical sensations a person experiences as a result of those events. So, in order to accurately answer the question about Cameron's feelings, it's important to focus on aspects such as mood, energy levels, and mental state, rather than only mentioning the events from the night before.

His four children, David, Robert, Amy, and Rosie, are brought together after years of being estranged from one another upon hearing news of their father's disappearance. As they reunite and gather at Frank's grand mansion, the siblings form an uncertain alliance in order to unravel the truth about their father and his life's work. David, the eldest and most cerebral of the siblings, is a successful lawyer, driven by ambition and an almost obsessive quest for perfection. Despite his professional success, David remains haunted by memories of his estranged relationship with their father. Robert, the second eldest, is an adrenaline junkie and a bit of a playboy; he lives for the thrills and adventure that he believes life has to offer. Amy, the third child, is a precocious scientist who has spent her life attempting to unravel the mysteries of the natural world, always with an air of skepticism and relentless curiosity. Rosie, the youngest, dreams of being an artist and is the peacemaker of the family, having always been the one to bring levity and light to any situation. As the four siblings begin uncovering their father's trail of clues, which are hidden throughout his mansion, they discover that Frank was on the brink of completing a groundbreaking invention that could change the world forever. Uniting their disparate talents and working through their emotional baggage, they realize that the invention has drawn the attention of a shadowy organization that will stop at nothing to acquire it for their own nefarious purposes. The plot weaves together a tapestry of suspense, action, and emotional pathos as the siblings dive headfirst into the world their father inhabited, all while struggling to put the pieces of their fractured family back together. Along the way, the siblings unlock long-buried secrets and confront the painful memories that their father's disappearance has unearthed. As the story unfolds, David's legal expertise proves vital in navigating the treacherous waters of corporate espionage. Robert's daring and adventurous spirit helps the family stay one step ahead of their pursuers, always ready with an ingenious plan to escape their clutches. Amy's scientific acumen allows her to understand the complexities of their father's invention, while Rosie uses her artistic abilities to decode the visual riddles and hidden messages that Frank had left for them in his countless pieces of art. As the siblings close in on the invention, they learn that the shadowy organization has infiltrated every facet of their lives, posing a threat not only to the invention but also to the family itself. The siblings must simultaneously band together and confront the dark secrets that drove them apart in order to reunite their family and protect the world from the potential consequences of their father's invention falling into the wrong hands. In the climactic finale, the four siblings succeed in thwarting the shadowy organization's plans and secure their father's invention. The journey of solving the enigma and braving the dangers their father's work attracted ultimately unites the Harrison siblings, reconciling their tumultuous past and building a newfound bond that had been damaged by time and distance. \\"The Enigmatic Inheritance\\" is a tale of love, betrayal, and the unbreakable bond of family that will leave audiences at the edge of their seats, inspired by the resilience and unity of the Harrison siblings in the face of great adversity.

Please answer the following question: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process involves expelling the carbon dioxide from the lungs and out of the body. After the bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs, it is transferred from the blood into the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. The alveoli are surrounded by a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries, through which the oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged between the blood and the lungs. As a person exhales, the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles relax, causing the chest cavity to decrease in size. This decrease in size creates a pressure gradient, forcing the air (which now contains a higher concentration of carbon dioxide) out of the alveoli and up through the bronchial tubes. The air continues to move through the bronchial tubes, into the trachea, and finally exits the body through the mouth and nose. During this process of exhalation, the carbon dioxide-rich air is removed from the respiratory system, and the body is prepared for the next cycle of inhalation and gas exchange. This continuous cycle of inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide is essential for maintaining proper oxygen levels in the body and ensuring the efficient removal of waste products generated during cellular respiration. The entire process plays a critical role in maintaining overall health and supporting the body's various functions, such as providing energy for daily activities, repairing damaged tissues, and supporting immune system functioning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But Russia has said the UN must finish its investigation into the claims before discussing any resolution. Syria has accused the West of \\"inventing\\" excuses to launch a strike. \\"Western countries, starting with the United States, are inventing fake scenarios and fictitious alibis to intervene militarily in Syria,\\" Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi said on Syrian state television. By Assaf AboudBBC News, Damascus Syrians continue to go about their daily lives nervously, despite the intensification of media interest and statements about the possibility that Syria will face a military strike. Some families have decided to move to safer areas in the countryside far from the cities. Some of those who live near military sites or government complexes have done similarly, following the Syrian media's recent focus on the Syrian military and governmental targets that might be hit in a potential Western military strike against Syria. Despite this, Syrian government departments are continuing their work as usual, the shops continue to receive customers and the streets of the Syrian capital remain choked by traffic. Some Syrians were reassured this afternoon by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem and his defiant speech about the strike which the Western nations are threatening to carry out against Syria and its government. British Foreign Secretary William Hague told reporters the international community had a responsibility to take action against the Syrian government, even if agreement could not be reached at the UN. The Syrian government has strongly denied that it used chemical weapons and blames opposition fighters for the attack on 21 August, which reportedly killed hundreds of people near Damascus. A team of UN weapons inspectors is currently investigating the sites of the attack. UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon said the experts were expected to finish their investigation in four days and would need more time after that to analyse their findings. Mr Ban appealed for the team to be given \\"time to do its job\\". And in a phone conversation with Mr Hague, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a draft resolution should not be considered until the inspectors had reported. Russia and China have previously vetoed resolutions critical of Syria. In a separate development, Syria's ambassador to the UN, Bashar Jaafari, asked for the inspectors to investigate three cases of the use of chemical weapons in the last week against \\"dozens\\" of government troops in Damascus suburbs. Britain's National Security Council \\"unanimously\\" backed action against Syria over its \\"unacceptable\\" chemical weapons use, Prime Minister David Cameron said earlier on Wednesday. He had gathered the UK's armed forces and security chiefs with key cabinet ministers for emergency talks over possible military action, ahead of the UN Security Council meeting. On Thursday, British MPs are set to vote on a government motion condemning the attack, but the vote will not authorise direct UK involvement in military action. The motion says UN weapons inspectors should be allowed to report to the Security Council, after which a further vote on military action may be taken. Britain's proposed UN resolution would condemn the \\"chemical weapons attack by [Syria's President] Assad\\", Mr Cameron added. Mr Ban earlier called on the council's permanent members - China, Russia, France, the US and the UK - to act together. \\"The body interested with maintaining international peace and security cannot be 'missing in action',\\" Mr Ban said. He added: \\"Give peace a chance. Give diplomacy a chance. Stop fighting and... start talking.\\" The meeting of the five permanent members has now finished, but the UK, US and France are continuing talks. No representative of any of the five countries was prepared to comment officially after the meeting. Syria crisis: Western military options Models for possible intervention Press apprehension as Syria tension builds Syria crisis: Where key countries stand Meanwhile, in a briefing to journalists, joint UN-Arab League envoy to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi said: \\"It does seem clear that some kind of substance was used... that killed a lot of people\\" on 21 August. But he also emphasised that any military action would need Security Council authorisation. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that US intervention would be a \\"disaster\\" for the region. \\"The region is like a gunpowder store and the future cannot be predicted,\\" Mr Khamenei said, according to Iran's Isna news agency. Meanwhile the Israeli government has authorised a limited call-up of reserve soldiers. Officials told the BBC that although the likelihood of Israel being drawn into fighting with Syria was very low, the country nevertheless had to prepare for that scenario. Stocks have fallen on global markets and oil prices have shot up amid growing concern about an impending attack on Syria. The UN weapons inspectors resumed investigations after having called off work on Tuesday because of security concerns. On Monday, the team's convoy was shot at by unidentified snipers. One of their cars came under fire as it crossed the buffer zone between government and rebel-controlled areas. More than 100,000 people are estimated to have died since the conflict erupted in Syria in March 2011. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"There was a chemical weapon attack in Syria and many people are worried about it. Some countries think that the government of Syria is responsible for the attack. They want to take action against the Syrian government, but other countries like Russia want the United Nations (UN) to investigate first before deciding what to do. Meanwhile, people in Syria are doing their best to continue with their daily lives, even though they are worried and some are moving to safer areas.

Today, we are going to learn about a migratory bird that is becoming smaller because it is getting warmer in its home. Can you imagine getting tinier just because it's hot outside? Let's find out more about this little bird's story. A group of smart people called scientists have been studying a special type of bird that flies very long distances every year. These birds are called migratory birds, and they like to travel from one place to another when the seasons change. They do this to find food and a nice place to have their baby birds, also known as chicks. One of these migratory birds has been shrinking in size because it is getting warmer in the place where they lay their eggs. This place is called the Arctic, and it's usually very cold, with a lot of ice and snow. But things have been changing in the Arctic. The ice is melting, and the temperatures are rising. This means that it is not as cold as it used to be. Because of this warmer weather, the little bird is becoming even smaller! The scientists found out that the bird's body is getting shorter and its beak is becoming smaller too. They think that this might be because the bird isn't getting enough food to eat. As the Arctic gets warmer, it can be harder for the birds to find the insects they like to eat. It's important for us to help protect these little birds and their Arctic home. We can do this by learning about the environment and how we can take care of it, like turning off the lights when we don't need them and not wasting water. So, the next time you see a little bird flying in the sky, remember that they might be going on a very long journey, and make sure to take care of our planet so they have a safe place to live and grow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Make a YouTube channel devoted to talking about your business, including new developments. Overall, your goal should be to build up your business's brand, which is the way that your business is perceived by customers. Your brand needs to link you and your customers within the same shared set of values. You can build a brand by working to extend your interactions with customers beyond the storefront or direct, business interaction. For example, adding in community involvement or philanthropy can help build your brand. For instance, if you have a snack food business and are about to release a new kind of snack, you could make a quick YouTube video about what the new snack is, how it tastes, what people think about it, and where interested people can buy it. Stay active on social media like Facebook and Twitter, too. Advertise promotions, new items, and discounts on your goods and services. Additionally, you could call your local newspaper or TV station and let them know about your entrepreneurial career. As your business grows, you could add a marketing staff to help you develop proper advertising. . As you gain more success and begin to perfect your recipes, scale your business up. If you have a beverage business, cut deals with local businesses to carry your bottled drinks. If you have a clothing line, bring samples of your work to local clothing shops to see if any would be interested in carrying your clothes. The way you scale up depends on the type of entrepreneurial activity you’re engaged in. As you grow, think about: hiring employees or volunteers opening dedicated stores getting additional funding advertising expanding your distribution network including new, related services Don’t stop looking for new ways to improve your business, and don’t let yourself get trapped into doing things just one way. Take the initial income you earn and put it back into your business in the form of advertising, better equipment, or more raw materials. Alternately, re-invest your earned income into other ventures or businesses. Whatever you do, don’t blow your earnings on toys, games, cars, and other goods. Manage your money carefully. Starting a new business requires hours of dedication and sacrifice. Depending on how young you are, you might be juggling school as well as your entrepreneurial activity. No matter what field you’re in, though, you should establish a regular work schedule and stick to it. For instance, maybe you’ll set aside time each day between 6:00 and 8:00 in the evening to build your enterprise. Think about both your own life and the future of your entrepreneurial activity. Ask yourself each day if you’re running your business and living your life in the best way. If every day was like today, what would the cumulative effect be? Would you be happy? Would your actions have a positive impact on others and on the environment in the long term? If you find that your business or your personal life are missing something, be proactive and make positive changes. Remember, success doesn’t just mean having a lot of money. It also means having personal fulfillment and satisfaction with who you are. If your initial business idea or organization doesn’t pan out, don’t be afraid to pull the plug. Alternately, if you find that another business sector or a related industry holds more promise, pursue a new enterprise in that sector. If your business model needs revision, work with your team to shift focus from, for instance, soda to fruit juices. If your business grows too quickly, you might need to downsize by cutting staff, closing unproductive stores, or discontinuing poor products. Stay nimble and always look for new opportunities.

As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice.

Translation of sung texts is generally much more restrictive than translation of poetry, because in the former there is little or no freedom to choose between a versified translation and a translation that dispenses with verse structure. One might modify or omit rhyme in a singing translation, but the assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical setting places great challenges on the translator. There is the option in prose sung texts, less so in verse, of adding or deleting a syllable here and there by subdividing or combining notes, respectively, but even with prose the process is almost like strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original prosody of the sung melodic line. How can a syllable be added or deleted in prose sung texts? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"A syllable can be added or deleted in prose sung texts through the following steps: 1. Analyze the original melody: Before modifying the syllables, it's essential to understand the structure of the existing melody and the rhythm it follows. This will help in identifying where adjustments can be made without affecting the overall musicality of the piece. 2. Determine the points of flexibility: Look for specific places in the melody where you can make adjustments without disturbing the flow of the music. This might include places where the melody has a natural pause or elements like grace notes, which can be manipulated to create additional space for syllables. 3. Subdivide notes: To add a syllable, you can subdivide a longer note into two or more shorter notes. For example, if a melody has a half note (two beats), you can divide it into two quarter notes (one beat each), allowing for an additional syllable. 4. Combine notes: To delete a syllable, you can combine two or more shorter notes into a longer one. For example, if the melody has two quarter notes, you could replace them with a single half note, removing the need for an extra syllable. 5. Adjust the rhythm and melody: When adding or deleting syllables, you may need to adjust the rhythm and melody to maintain the overall flow of the piece. This could involve modifying the rhythm pattern, changing the pitch of specific notes, or altering the phrasing of the melody. 6. Review and refine: Once the modifications have been made, it's essential to review the new prose sung text and ensure it still retains the original meaning and intent while being sung to the adjusted melody. You may need to continue refining the syllable adjustments and musical elements until you achieve a satisfactory balance between the translated text and the musical setting. By following these steps, you can add or delete syllables in prose sung texts and create a translation that more closely follows the original prosody while still respecting the constraints of the given melody and musical structure."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Would you find the Almond plant and Aloinopsis in alaska? A:","completion":"To answer this question, let me reason through it step by step: Step 1: Understand the plants mentioned The Almond plant (Prunus dulcis) is a tree belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean climate region and typically grows in warm, dry environments. The Almond plant produces almonds, a popular type of nut consumed globally. Aloinopsis is a genus of succulent plants belonging to the Aizoaceae family. It is native to South Africa and grows in arid or semi-arid regions characterized by well-drained soils and low rainfall. Aloinopsis species are commonly found in rock gardens and cultivated for their ornamental value. Step 2: Analyze Alaska's climate and environment Alaska is located in the northwest extremity of the United States and features a subarctic and polar climate. It is characterized by long, harsh winters and short, cool summers. Alaska's environment is comprised mostly of tundra, boreal forests, and coastal rainforests, with a high amount of annual precipitation in some areas. Step 3: Determine if the plants can be found in Alaska Considering the native habitat and climate requirements of both the Almond plant and Aloinopsis, it is highly unlikely that you would find these plants growing naturally in Alaska. The Almond plant requires a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry conditions, while Aloinopsis thrives in arid or semi-arid regions with well-drained soils. These conditions are not compatible with Alaska's subarctic and polar climate. Conclusion: No, you would not find the Almond plant and Aloinopsis growing naturally in Alaska. However, these plants could possibly be cultivated indoors or in specialized greenhouses within the state, but they would not be a common sight."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The documentary follows the travels of Armand Denis and his wife, Michaela Denis, as they travel around sub-Saharan Africa. Their safari begins in British East Africa, and continues on to Victoria Falls. From there they travel to South Africa, and trek up the coast of southwest Africa, before once more heading inland, where they meet with various African tribes.

The doctors in Children's Hospital are asking for money for children's toys. Some children in the hospital must stay in bed for many weeks. Toys are needed to keep these sick children happy and quiet. Money for them can be sent to the hospital. After Mrs. Weeks read the story, she said,\\"This story gave me an idea.\\" \\"You want us to bring some money for the toys.\\"\\"We could bring some of our own toys for the children in the hospital, \\"said the boys and girls one after another. \\"Well, your ideas would be nice, \\"Mrs. Weeks said,\\"but mine is different.\\" Mrs. Weeks smiled. \\"Do you think you could make toys?\\" she asked. \\"Yes, yes,\\" the whole class answered. \\"Great! Let's begin to make toys tomorrow,\\" said Mrs. Weeks. On Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Weeks took the children to the hospital with the toys made by her students. The children in the hospital felt very happy to see the toys. The children in the class felt happy, too.

Does the sentence \\"There has been a strong engagement of Orthodox churches in the ecumenical movement, though the reaction of individual Orthodox theologians has ranged from tentative approval of the aim of Christian unity to outright condemnation of the perceived effect of watering down Orthodox doctrine.\\" answer the question \\"What have Orthodox churches condemned the perception of?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"There has been a strong engagement of Orthodox churches in the ecumenical movement, though the reaction of individual Orthodox theologians has ranged from tentative approval of the aim of Christian unity to outright condemnation of the perceived effect of watering down Orthodox doctrine.\\" answers the question \\"What have Orthodox churches condemned the perception of?\\" to a certain extent. To provide a more detailed and elaborate answer, we can break down the various aspects of the sentence. Orthodox churches have been actively participating in the ecumenical movement, a movement that seeks to promote unity and cooperation among different Christian denominations. The ecumenical movement aims to foster dialogue and collaboration, aiming to bridge the gap between denominations without compromising their core beliefs. Orthodox churches are among the major Christian denominations that have been engaging with this movement. However, the reactions of individual Orthodox theologians to the ecumenical movement have varied. Some theologians have tentatively approved the aim of promoting Christian unity, recognizing the importance of fostering cooperation and understanding among Christian churches. This approval, albeit cautious, indicates a willingness to engage with other denominations in the pursuit of unity and collaboration. On the other end of the spectrum, some Orthodox theologians have outrightly condemned the perceived effect of the ecumenical movement, which they believe waters down Orthodox doctrine. This condemnation reveals a concern that participating in the ecumenical movement might lead to compromises in Orthodox beliefs and practices, diluting their distinctiveness and integrity. In this view, the potential benefits of the ecumenical movement could come at the cost of weakening Orthodox theological convictions. So, Orthodox churches have condemned the perception that the ecumenical movement waters down Orthodox doctrine. In conclusion, the original sentence does answer the question of what Orthodox churches have condemned the perception of, which is the perceived effect of watering down Orthodox doctrine due to participation in the ecumenical movement. The varied reactions of individual Orthodox theologians also show the complexity of this issue, as the discussion on Christian unity and theological integrity continues within the Orthodox community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Christine tripped over the debris in the road unlike Carrie, because","completion":"Christine was not as accustomed to navigating through the chaotic aftermath of the storm that ravaged their small town earlier that day. While Carrie had grown up in this area and had experienced numerous storms throughout her life, she had developed a keen sense of observation and quick reflexes, allowing her to evade the scattered wreckage with ease. Christine, on the other hand, had moved to the town just a few months prior and was still adjusting to its unpredictable weather patterns and their associated consequences. As she stumbled over the broken branches and remnants of shattered glass, Christine couldn't help but feel her heart race with a mix of fear and adrenaline. Carrie, noticing her friend's distress, slowed down her pace and offered a reassuring smile, extending a hand to help keep Christine steady as they continued their trek through the town's ravaged streets. They were both on a mission to assist their neighbors by checking in on those who might need help, and although Christine's inexperience with such situations was evident, her dedication to the community and concern for others remained unwavering. This storm would serve as a pivotal moment in their dynamic, with Christine's vulnerability inadvertently strengthening her bond with Carrie. As hours turned into days and the town began to heal from the storm's damages, so too did Christine grow more confident and resilient in her newfound environment. She started to observe the subtle changes in the weather and adopt habits that allowed her to navigate the storms more adeptly, which did not go unnoticed by Carrie. Their mutual concern for the well-being of their community, combined with their shared experiences of navigating the challenges presented by the storms, formed the foundation of an unbreakable friendship between the two women. Over time, whenever a storm hit, Christine and Carrie would be among the first to step up and offer assistance, their once contrasting levels of expertise now replaced by a strong sense of teamwork and camaraderie. In the end, Christine not only adapted to her new surroundings and developed the skills necessary to face the storms, but she also discovered the true essence of friendship and community spirit. Those around her came to respect and appreciate her unwavering commitment to the town and its residents, and it was all because she tripped over that debris in the road that one fateful day, unlike Carrie, who gracefully dodged every obstacle in her path."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, Southampton's duo makes the cut, alongside standout performers from Swansea, Arsenal, and Hull. Body: 1) West Ham's terrific trio: West Ham United pulled off a stunning upset as they beat Manchester City, thanks in part to the heroics of Diafra Sakho, Alex Song, and Aaron Cresswell. Sakho was a constant threat upfront with his pace and skill, while Song dominated the midfield and provided a secure screen for the defense. Cresswell, meanwhile, was solid at the back and delivered an array of dangerous crosses from the left flank. These three players were vital in the Hammers' hard-fought victory, and they rightfully find their place in our Premier League team of the day. 2) Southampton's defensive and attacking prowess: Southampton had two standout performers contributing significantly to their success. Central defender Toby Alderweireld showcased his intelligence and physicality, making crucial interventions to protect the Saints' goal. Meanwhile, the energetic and inventive Saido Mane was a menace for the opposition defense, making darting runs and setting up crucial chances for his teammates. 3) Goal-scoring heroes at Swansea and Arsenal: Swansea City's Wilfried Bony and Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez both hit the net twice in their respective fixtures, making a strong case for their inclusion in our team of the day. Bony's physical presence and instinctive finishing were pivotal for the Swans, while Sanchez dazzled with his technical prowess, pace, and creativity for the Gunners. 4) Hull's sturdy lineup: Hull City held Liverpool to a draw at Anfield, thanks in part to the performances of goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic, who made a series of important saves to deny the Reds. Midfielder Mohamed Diame also played a crucial role in disrupting Liverpool's rhythm and launching counter-attacks for his side. These two players ensured the Tigers secured a valuable point away from home. Conclusion: This matchday brought exceptional displays from players representing various Premier League clubs. From West Ham's outstanding trio to goal-scoring exploits by Bony and Sanchez, fans were treated to a thrilling day of football. It was a showcase of the league's depth and competitiveness, and we look forward to more captivating action in the forthcoming fixtures."},{"prompt":"Q: Is this product review positive?

If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion.

Please answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product. Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: Not great Review: I love Plato's The Republic, but this copy is a bad translation, and there are no line numbers or footnotes. Buy a physical copy. Answer:","completion":"After carefully examining the given review, it can be concluded that the customer seems to be dissatisfied with the specific copy of Plato's The Republic that they bought. There are several reasons to support this assessment: 1. The title of the customer's review, \\"Not great,\\" indicates a lack of overall satisfaction with the purchased product. The phrase shows that the customer did not find this edition of the book to be as impressive or satisfactory as they might have expected. 2. The reviewer mentions that they \\"love Plato's The Republic,\\" which is an important distinction. This statement clarifies that their dissatisfaction is not related to the content or subject matter of The Republic itself but is rather with this particular copy of the book. It indicates that they have a positive opinion of the original work but find the actual product they received to be subpar. 3. The customer cites two specific issues with the product that contributed to their dissatisfaction: a bad translation and the absence of line numbers and footnotes. These elements suggest that the reviewer was looking for a high-quality version of The Republic, with a reliable translation and helpful annotations to aid their understanding and analysis of the text. 4. Lastly, the reviewer's recommendation to \\"buy a physical copy\\" further underscores their dissatisfaction with the product. By suggesting potential buyers to opt for a physical copy instead of the one they purchased, the customer implies that they believe other editions of The Republic would be superior to the one they bought and reviewed. In conclusion, the customer's review demonstrates their dissatisfaction with the specific copy of Plato's The Republic they purchased, mainly due to the substandard translation and the lack of helpful annotations such as line numbers and footnotes. They express their admiration for the original work, but their critique is directed towards the particular edition they bought."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The audience response at Presley's live shows became increasingly fevered. Moore recalled, \\"He'd start out, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog,' and they'd just go to pieces. They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time.\\" At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, 50 National Guardsmen were added to the police security to ensure that the crowd would not cause a ruckus. Elvis, Presley's second album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one on the billboard. The album includes \\"Old Shep\\", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA session. According to Guralnick, one can hear \\"in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm both the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique.\\" Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from \\"That's All Right\\" through Elvis, rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that \\"these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become.\\"Presley returned to the Sullivan show at its main studio in New York, hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28. After the performance, crowds in Nashville and St. Louis burned him in effigy. His first motion picture, Love Me Tender, was released on November 21. Though he was not top billed, the film's original title—The Reno Brothers—was changed to capitalize on his latest number-one record: \\"Love Me Tender\\" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role.

InterTAN operated a RadioShack chain from Barrie , Ontario which carried most ( but not all ) of the US Radio Shack product line . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other.

Both sentences convey the same central idea: InterTAN operated a RadioShack chain from Barrie, Ontario, and it carried most (but not all) of the US Radio Shack product line. The slight differences in structure and word choice between the sentences don't alter the primary message being communicated. Here is a breakdown of the paraphrasing in the two sentences: 1. \\"InterTAN operated a RadioShack chain from Barrie, Ontario, which promoted most (but not all) of the US Radio Shack product line.\\" 2. \\"InterTAN operated a RadioShack chain from Barrie, Ontario which carried most (but not all) of the US Radio Shack product line.\\" Changes made in the paraphrase: - In the first sentence, \\"which promoted\\" is used, whereas in the second sentence, \\"which carried\\" is used. Both \\"promoted\\" and \\"carried\\" convey a similar idea of offering the products to customers. - The second sentence omits the comma after \\"Ontario\\".

It is important to note that while the two sentences are paraphrases, there could be further improvements in the paraphrasing by altering the structure and wording even more to improve clarity and readability.

Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me.

Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house. They closed that Navy base and all of the sailors were transferred elsewhere. There were bumper-stickers that said, \\"Will the last sailor to leave, please turn out the lights.\\" In those days, Newport was a small town that leached off of sailors.

AP - The NFL will not fine Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor after looking into allegations that a Cincinnati player was spit on during Sunday's game.","completion":"This topic is about the National Football League (NFL) deciding not to fine Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor following investigations into allegations that he had spat on a Cincinnati player during a game held on Sunday. To provide further context, Sean Taylor was an American professional football player who played as a safety for the Washington Redskins in the NFL. He was known for his aggressive style of play and hard-hitting tackles, which earned him a reputation as one of the most intimidating players in the league. On the particular Sunday in question, the Washington Redskins faced the Cincinnati Bengals in an NFL match. During the course of the game, it was alleged that Taylor had spat on an opposing Cincinnati player, an action that would have been considered unsportsmanlike conduct and a violation of the NFL's rules and regulations. After the incident came to light, the NFL conducted an investigation to determine whether or not the allegations against Taylor were true. This would typically involve interviewing the players involved, reviewing video footage of the game, and consulting referees and other match officials. The objective of the investigation was to gather enough evidence to establish whether or not Taylor's alleged actions had occurred and to assess the appropriate disciplinary measures should the allegations be proven. In this case, the NFL ultimately decided that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the claim of Taylor spitting on the Cincinnati player, and as a result, opted not to fine him. If they had found him guilty, Taylor could have faced monetary fines, suspensions, or other disciplinary actions, depending on the severity of the offense and its impact on the game. This decision demonstrates the NFL's commitment to enforcing its rules and ensuring sportsmanship among its players, while also recognizing that allegations must be supported by concrete evidence before disciplinary measures are taken. It's worth noting that incidents like these are taken seriously by the NFL, as they work to maintain a high standard of sportsmanship, ethics, and professionalism within the league. Such actions can have a negative impact on the reputation of the league, its players, and the sport as a whole. As such, proper investigations are necessary to ascertain the truth behind any allegations and prevent both unwarranted punishments and potential leniency in ensuring the fair conduct of all players."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -195*o - 140*o - 4002 = 1421 + 942 for o.","completion":"Sure. Let's solve the equation for 'o': The mathematical problem is: -195*o - 140*o - 4002 = 1421 + 942 Let's first simplify both sides of the equation. On the left-hand side, we can combine the 'o' terms, which will get us: -335*o - 4002 On the right-hand side, we can add 1421 and 942, which will get us: 2363 So the simplified form of the equation is: -335*o - 4002 = 2363 Next, let's isolate the o term, so we will add 4002 to both sides to get rid of the -4002 on the left-hand side. -335*o = 2363 + 4002 Performing the addition on the right-hand side will give: -335*o = 6365 The final step is to solve for 'o' by dividing both sides by -335 o = 6365 / -335 Calculating the right-hand side will give the value of 'o'. Let's call it 'x' for the final answer. x = -19 Therefore, the solution to the equation is o = -19."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is an article: Alan Boyle, Science Editor NBC News Jan. 2, 2014 at 1:40 PM ET Scientists have undertaken what they say is the most serious search for signs of time travelers at work on the Internet. They came up with no hard evidence — but does that rule out time travel completely? \\"In my mind, it makes it less likely that it's possible,\\" Robert Nemiroff, a physicist at Michigan Technological University, told NBC News. However, he and MTU graduate student Teresa Wilson acknowledge there are lots of reasons why they might miss the hints of information flowing backward in time — ranging from a simple oversight to the influence of a cosmic Chronology Protection Agency. Nemiroff and Wilson lay out their Internet-based experiment in a paper that's been submitted to the ArXiv scientific preprint server, as well as a poster to be presented next week at the American Astronomical Society's winter meeting in Washington. An experiment 'just for fun'Nemiroff said the idea of looking for time travelers arose during one of the poker games he organizes for his students at the university. \\"My summer students and I said, 'Why don't we start looking for this, just for fun?'\\" The idea isn't a new one: For more than a century, science-fiction writers have been exploring the implications of going back and forth in time. In a sense, we're all traveling forward in time — and Einstein's theories of relativity showed that the rate of that forward travel can vary, depending on frames of reference. But backward time travel? Some physicists say that's impossible, due to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. There have been a couple of attempts to lure time travelers to high-profile parties. MIT student Amal Dorai tried that in 2005. Famed British physicist Stephen Hawking issued post-dated invitations to a party in 2009. Nobody came. The comet and the popeNemiroff and Wilson tried a different tactic. They looked for signs of foreknowledge about specific events on the Internet, or in Twitter tweets. The two events they chose were the discovery of Comet ISON in September 2012, and the selection of Pope Francis in March 2013. Looking for the evidence was trickier than it might sound: For example, search engines such as Google and Bing can misinterpret time stamps for Web pages, and it's also possible to back-date blog entries or Facebook posts. The researchers found Twitter searches to be the most reliable tools, because tweets can't be back-dated. \\"No clearly prescient content involving 'Comet ISON,' '#cometison,' 'Pope Francis' or \\"#popefrancis' was found from any Twitter tweet — ever,\\" they reported. They also issued a request for time travelers to send tweets using either the hashtag \\"#ICanChangeThePast2\\" or \\"#ICannotChangeThePast2\\" by the end of August 2013. The trick was that the request was issued in September. No such tweets were found that predated the deadline. (Some have been received since, however, including this one from Thursday: \\"Your future laws forbid me from giving you any proof of our technologies. But be sure that we're watching you. #ICanChangeThePast2\\") Nemiroff told NBC News that the time-travel paper was submitted to three journals, but was rejected by all three. \\"At this point, I don't know if it will ever appear in a refereed journal,\\" he said. If there are any time travelers out there who can let him know, he'd appreciate hearing about it.

The blood sugar drops in a body. 2. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon. 3. The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose. 4. The liver releases glucose into the blood. 5. The blood sugar levels are restored. Suppose more glucose is produced, possibly leading to a scenario where less regulation of blood sugar level is needed. Let's consider the three different possibilities for how this could be related to the process: - Directly impacting a step of the process: This implies that the increased glucose production affects one of the steps directly. This could mean that the liver is producing more glucose than necessary in response to glucagon (Step 3), or that it releases more glucose into the blood than required (Step 4). - Indirectly impacting a step of the process: This means that the increased glucose production doesn't directly alter a step in the process, but instead influences it through secondary effects. An example might be an increase in insulin sensitivity in target cells, requiring less glucagon production for the same glucose uptake, which in turn influences how the entire process unfolds. - Not impacting any step of the process: In this scenario, the increased glucose production would not affect any step of the process. This could be attributed to factors unrelated to the process mentioned, such as increased dietary sugar intake, or an unrelated condition that affects blood sugar levels without interfering with the process itself. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of more glucose being produced while having lower blood sugar regulation would most likely be directly impacting a step of the process, either by causing the liver to produce more glucose (Step 3) or release more glucose into the blood (Step 4)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Only three people have received face transplants.The world's first was carried out on French woman Isabelle Dinoire in November 2005 after she was disfigured in an attack by her dog.In 2007,her doctors reported that she had recovered slowly and steadily,overcoming two periods of rejection. In 2006,Chinese doctors performed a face transplant on a 30yearold hit by a bear.While there were some complications with tissue rejection following the operation,two years later the man was doing well,his doctors said.\\"This case suggests that facial transplantation might be an option for _ a severely disfigured face,and could enable patients to bring themselves back into society,\\" Shuzhong Guo and colleagues at Xijing Hospital in China wrote.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: The hackers uploaded a text file of the Games of Thrones instalment and an annotated video of the script. They also shared three episodes of popular HBO TV shows on a site created to host what they stole. The group behind the breach said it managed to grab more than 1.5 terabytes of data from the firm. On Monday, when news of the data breach began circulating, HBO confirmed that it had been hit by a \\"cyber-incident\\" that had led to the loss of some data. \\"We immediately began investigating the incident and are working with law enforcement and outside cyber-security firms,\\" it added. Some episodes of the HBO shows Ballers and Room 104 were quickly leaked online. Added to these now are scripts and summaries for episodes three and four of the seventh season of Game of Thrones. The script for episode four bears a date of April 2016, suggesting it was an early draft rather than the finished, filmed episode. Also made available were two episodes of upcoming HBO comedy show Barry and one of the Insecure show. Files containing log-in details for some HBO staff are also believed to have been made available. Several other large files were also put online but so far no-one has been able to work out what is in them.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post. A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre. In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

Known only to close friends, Betty used to be renowned for making the world's best choux pastry. She left fame after a mysterious incident years ago that she has since refused to discuss. A large, antique oven in her kitchen serves as a constant reminder of her past glory and unrecognized talent. Enter Timmy, a cheeky yet charming young boy from the city who was recently sent to stay with his grandmother in the country. Timmy is adventurous, bright, and endlessly curious. He is inescapably drawn to Betty’s house after catching a waft of her pastries' sweet fragrance, and the pair quickly strike up an unlikely friendship. However, Timmy, unaware of Betty's past, playfully pushes her into her kitchen one day only to witness her having a panic attack near her antique oven. An innocent prank reveals a traumatic chapter in Betty's life. Embarrassed, Betty confesses to him about her dark past- about a terrible kitchen fire while in the height of her career that scarred her physically and emotionally, rendering her frightened of ovens. Feeling sympathetic, yet inspired, Timmy promises to help Betty overcome her fear. He begins with small steps, trying to convince Betty to teach him basic cooking, sticking to stove-top recipes.

Please briefly summarize this news article: George Michael jailed for eight weeks Blood tests showed he had chemicals linked to cannabis in his system. The singer sighed heavily as District Judge Perkins said he would serve four weeks in prison and spend the remainder on licence. Michael was also banned from driving for five years and ordered to pay a £1,250 fine, £100 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. One fan sobbed in the public gallery as he was taken down from the dock by security guards. Michael's guilty plea and remorse allowed District Judge Perkins to reduce the sentence, he said, but not to offer the community sentence requested by the defence. Michael was arrested in Hampstead shortly before 4am on July 4 when two police officers found him apparently unconscious in his grey Range Rover in Rosslyn Hill. When told he had crashed into a shop, he added: \\"No I didn't. I didn't crash into anything.\\" At Hampstead police station he failed a test to find whether he was fit to drive. The musician admitted smoking a \\"small quantity\\" of cannabis about 10pm the previous evening and said he also took the anti-depressant Amitriptyline to help him sleep. He told police he decided to drive between his homes in Highgate and Hampstead to meet a friend and forgot he had taken the sedative. District Judge Perkins said: \\"You drove your motor vehicle about a mile while suffering from a severe impairment as a result of mixing not only a prescription treatment with which you were unfamiliar but also with cannabis. \\"That's a dangerous and unpredictable mix and something which for you is dangerous given your record. \\"It does not appear that you took proper steps to deal with what is clearly an addiction to cannabis. \\"That's a mistake which puts you and, on this occasion, the public at risk.\\" The district judge said he took into account that Michael had checked into a clinic after the crash to seek help for anxiety, depression and insomnia, which had led him to depend on prescription drugs and had noted he was dealing with bereavement issues. \\"I accept entirely that you have shown remorse for the offence, that you are ashamed of it, that you admitted it,\\" he said, but added that \\"with regret\\" a jail term was inevitable because of Michael's previous conviction. Michael's long-term partner Kenny Goss threw his head into his hands in despair at that point. Mukul Chawla QC, mitigating, said Michael personally repaid the cost of the damage to the shop owner and had asked that his \\"profound shame and horror of having repeated the conduct of 2006\\" was made clear to the court. \\"He acknowledges his actions of driving had the effect of causing other road users to be in danger and that stark fact is something about which he is greatly ashamed. \\"The prospect he could have put anyone else in danger is an appalling prospect to him.\\" He said Michael had tried to turn his life around. \\"For the first time in many years he has started writing again. His creativity, so long hampered by his drug dependence, is re-emerging.\\" Mr Chawla said Michael had tried to come off prescription drugs without professional help earlier this year but symptoms returned so he sought medical help and was given Amitriptyline. Michael remained an outpatient at the rehab clinic, he added. The singer, wearing a charcoal suit with a black tie, spoke only to confirm his name and address and to say he would prefer to be addressed by his stage name. The jail sentence is the culmination of a long line of clashes with the law for the singer, who has been open about his use of cannabis and claimed in the past that he was trying to cut down. Michael was banned from driving for two years and sentenced to 100 hours of community service after he was convicted of driving while unfit through drugs after he was found collapsed in his Mercedes in 2006. He was cautioned twice in 2006 for possession of cannabis and cautioned for possession for crack cocaine and cannabis two years later. He was fined for \\"engaging in a lewd act\\" in a California public toilet in 1998. Fans gathered outside the court to get a glimpse of the star, screaming his name and trying to break through a barrier of 12 police officers as he arrived at court this afternoon. One fan passed a good luck card for Michael to Mr Goss. Shelly Williams, 41, from east London, sobbed from the public gallery as Michael was sentenced. \\"I have been a fan for 26 years - that's longer than a marriage. \\"I hope he continues with the process of making himself better.\\"","completion":"Singer George Michael has been jailed for eight weeks following a car accident caused by driving under the influence of cannabis.

(CNN) -- A New Zealand court denied bail Wednesday to the founder of the shuttered file-sharing site Megaupload, whose extradition is being sought by the U.S. Department of Justice. Kim Dotcom, who is also known as Kim Schmitz, will remain in custody until at least February 22, when an extradition hearing is to be held, the court said. U.S. authorities shut down Megaupload last week and announced indictments against Dotcom and six other people connected to the site, accusing them of operating an \\"international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works.\\" Four of those charged, including Dotcom, were arrested in New Zealand at the request of the U.S. government. The New Zealand police detained Dotcom, a German citizen, on Friday after a raid on his mansion in the North Shore area of Auckland, the country's largest city. In a packed court on Monday, Dotcom's lawyer, Paul Davison, said that his client is innocent and should be granted bail. \\"Mr. Dotcom emphatically denies any criminal misconduct or wrongdoing and denies the existence of any 'mega-conspiracy,'\\" Davison told the court. But New Zealand government prosecutors, acting on behalf of U.S. authorities, argued that Dotcom's bail request should be denied because he presented an \\"extreme\\" flight risk.

In this case, we need to simplify the right-hand side of the equation by performing the subtraction: -5*o = 25 Step 2: Now we need to isolate the variable (o) on one side of the equation. In this case, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable, which is -5: (-5*o) / (-5) = 25 / (-5) Step 3: Perform the division on both sides: o = -5 So the solution to the equation -5*o = 40 - 15 for o is o = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Tesla is losing more money than expected as it nears the launch of its first mass market car. On Wednesday, Tesla (TSLA) reported a loss of 330 million for the first three months of the year, far exceeding Wall Street's estimates and up from 282 million a year earlier. The larger loss comes even as Tesla reported strong sales for the quarter. It posted revenue of 2.7 billion, more than double from a year earlier, fueled by shipping a record 25,051 cars. Tesla is spending heavily ahead of the Model 3 launch, which it says is still on track to start production in July. \\"I don't know anything that would prevent us from starting production in July,\\" Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, said on a conference call with analysts. \\"There may be something that pops up, but I don't know what it is today.\\" In preparation for the Model 3 launch, Tesla says it's \\"significantly expanding our infrastructure to support Tesla owners,\\" according to a shareholder letter Wednesday. That includes plans for 100 more retail, delivery and service locations globally as well as opening Tesla's first body repair shops. Tesla also reiterated plans to \\"at least\\" double the number of charging stations. Related: Tesla just became the most valuable carmaker in America Tesla says it expects to be able to support production of 5,000 Model 3 cars a week this year and 10,000 a week next year. But the company also admitted to some unpredictability as it gears up for the launch. \\"Given that we will be ramping Model 3 production so quickly ... even a couple-week shift in timing can have a meaningful impact on total deliveries,\\" the company wrote in its shareholder letter. Some analysts are sounding a cautionary note about the Model 3. \\"In this climate of low fuel prices, an administration that favors less stringent environmental controls and a market proliferation of full-electric offerings from mainstream manufacturers, the launch might be a difficult one,\\" Jack Nerad, executive editorial director at Kelley Blue Book, said in a statement. The Model 3 has already created at least one other unique headache for Tesla: Some customers apparently assume it's an upgrade to the earlier Model S because of its name and are therefore holding off buying the S. In fact, the Model 3 name doesn't signify a third-generation Tesla. It's a play on \\"sex\\" -- Model S, 3 and X. \\"I thought we were being all clever by calling it the Model 3,\\" Musk said on the call. \\"But actually the joke's on me because it caused confusion in the marketplace.\\" Even without the Model 3 on the road yet, Musk teased future vehicles on the call, including a semi-truck and an SUV called the Model Y. On the call, Musk hinted that the Model Y will come by 2020. Tesla's stock has soared this year on optimism for the Model 3, pushing its market cap to more than 50 billion, above older car companies like Ford (F) and General Motors (GM).

Input: Context_1 : Per Fine Ounce is the title of an unpublished novel by Geoffrey Jenkins featuring Ian Fleming's James Bond. It was completed c.1966 and is considered a \\"lost\\" novel by fans of James Bond because it was actually commissioned by Glidrose Productions, the official publishers of James Bond. It was rejected for publication, however, missing the opportunity to become the first continuation James Bond novel. \\"The Adventures of James Bond Junior 003½\\", a novel written by the pseudonymous R. D. Mascott, was later published in 1967 featuring James Bond's nephew; \\"Colonel Sun\\" written by Kingsley Amis under the pseudonym Robert Markham was published in 1968 as the first adult continuation novel following Ian Fleming's \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\" (1965). Context_2 : The Life of Ian Fleming is a biography of Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond and author of the children’s book \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\". The biography was written by John Pearson, Fleming’s assistant at the London \\"Sunday Times,\\" in 1966. Pearson later wrote the official, fictional-biography \\"\\" in 1973. \\"The Life of Ian Fleming\\" was one of the first biographies of Ian Fleming and is considered a collectible book by many James Bond fans, since Pearson would become the third, official James Bond author. Context_3 : Casino Royale (2006) is the twenty-first spy film in the Eon Productions \\"James Bond\\" film series and the first to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, the film marks the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel of the same name. \\"Casino Royale\\" is a reboot of the film series and as such is set at the beginning of Bond's career as Agent 007, just as he is earning his licence to kill. After preventing a terrorist attack at Miami International Airport, Bond falls in love with Vesper Lynd, the treasury employee assigned to provide the money he needs to bankrupt a terrorist financier, Le Chiffre, by beating him in a high-stakes poker game. The story arc continues in the following \\"Bond\\" film \\"Quantum of Solace\\" (2008), \\"Skyfall\\" (2012), and \\"Spectre\\" (2015) also feature explicit references to characters and events in this film. Context_4 : Ian Fleming: Where Bond Began was a 2008 documentary presented by Joanna Lumley which explored the life of the author Ian Fleming and the origin of his character James Bond. It was first broadcast on BBC One at 6:10pm on Sunday 19 October 2008 and was commissioned to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth and the then forthcoming release of the film \\"Quantum of Solace\\". Context_5 : Felix Leiter is a 2017 comic book miniseries featuring the eponymous character, who is primarily featured in Ian Fleming's James Bond novels and various other formats by several other creators. Written by James Robinson and illustrated by Aaron Campbell, the comic book is a spin-off from the \\"James Bond\\" series published by Dynamite Entertainment, making its debut in January 2017. It also marks the first time for Bond's ally and friend, Felix Leiter to get a solo adventure in any format overall. It is also licensed by Ian Fleming Publications that hold the literary rights to the James Bond franchise. Bond himself makes a cameo appearance in the comic book as part of a flashback. Context_6 : The James Bond literary franchise is a series of novels and short stories, first published in 1953 by Ian Fleming, a British author, journalist, and former naval intelligence officer. James Bond, often referred to by his code name, 007, is a British Secret Service agent; the character was created by journalist and author Ian Fleming, and first appeared in his 1953 novel \\"Casino Royale\\"; the books are set in a contemporary period, between May 1951 and February 1964. Fleming went on to write a total of twelve novels and two collections of short stories, all written at his Jamaican home Goldeneye and published annually. Two of his books were published after his death in 1964. Context_7 : Light of My Death is a 1993 spy comic book featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond in the central role of the plot, written by Das Petrou and illustrated by John Watkiss. It was published by Dark Horse Comics in issues #8-11 of \\"Dark Horse Comics\\". It includes the return of a Bond girl from a Fleming novel, Tatiana Romanova from \\"From Russia, with Love\\" (1957). Context_8 : Quantum of Solace (2008) is the twenty-second spy film in the \\"James Bond\\" series produced by Eon Productions, directed by Marc Forster and written by Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. It stars Daniel Craig, Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Gemma Arterton, Jeffrey Wright and Judi Dench. In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, Vesper Lynd, and is assisted by Camille Montes, who is plotting revenge for the murder of her family. The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman Dominic Greene, a member of the Quantum organisation, who intends to stage a \\"coup d'état\\" in Bolivia to seize control of their water supply. Context_9 : Kissy Suzuki is a fictional character introduced in Ian Fleming's 1964 \\"James Bond\\" novel, \\"You Only Live Twice\\". Despite Bond's womanizing, Kissy Suzuki (at least the literary version) remains the only character known to the reader who bears a child by him. She is also one of the few known Bond girls (also in literature) to have died as a result of a non-violent, natural death (although that death does not occur in the Bond canon, but rather in a short story written by someone other than Ian Fleming). The treatment of Kissy varies greatly between the novel and the film, where she is never identified by her name, no family name appears in the closing credits, and the film ends in the usual Bond-style happy ending. Context_10 : Vesper Lynd is a fictional character featured in Ian Fleming's 1953 James Bond novel \\"Casino Royale\\". She was portrayed by Ursula Andress in the 1967 James Bond parody, which is only slightly based on the novel, and by Eva Green in the 2006 adaptation. fact_1 : Quantum of Solace (2008) is the twenty-second spy film in the \\"James Bond\\" series produced by Eon Productions, directed by Marc Forster and written by Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. fact_2 : In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, Vesper Lynd, and is assisted by Camille Montes, who is plotting revenge for the murder of her family. fact_3 : Vesper Lynd is a fictional character featured in Ian Fleming's 1953 James Bond novel \\"Casino Royale\\".

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I can use this background: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options. It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision). Now, I have a new situation: John and Keith are playing a decision making game. They have three decisions to make decision A, decision B, and decision C. Decision A and decision B have certain outcome, but decision C's outcome is uncertain. John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches. Answer this question please: In respect to decision C, would Keith's strategy most likely maximize or not maximize the expected utility? A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. We know that an optimal decision maximizes the expected utility, which is a probability-weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision. 2. John is applying the optimal decision-making process, so he will try to maximize the expected utility for decision C by considering the probabilities and utilities associated with its uncertain outcomes. 3. On the other hand, Keith relies on his hunches, meaning he does not follow a systematic process to analyze probabilities and utilities; instead, he makes decisions based on his intuition. 4. Since Keith's strategy does not involve explicitly maximizing expected utility, it is less likely that his approach will consistently lead to maximizing the expected utility compared to John's approach. Therefore, in respect to decision C, Keith's strategy would most likely not maximize the expected utility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write some highlights for the following article: Inmates at a jail for teenagers represent 48 different gangs, inspectors have discovered, fuelling a 'constant juggling' by prison officers to keep the boys apart. There were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution (YOI), a significant amount of which was gang-related, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) said in a report. Around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the London area - were placed on so-called 'keep apart' lists to tackle gang-related violence, inspectors said. There were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution, a significant amount of which was gang-related, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons said in a report (file photo) The number of fights and assaults had reduced since the previous HMIP inspection, but remained 'too high' with 262 incidents in the six months before the visit, including 79 assaults on staff. Some incidents were deemed 'very serious' by inspectors and involved gangs of boys attacking a single boy or member of staff in a 'very determined way'. Feltham is divided into two sites, with boys aged 15 to 18 held in site A, separated from 400 young adults aged 18 to 21 in site B. Chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick said: 'The welcome reduction in the number of boys in custody means that those who remain are a more concentrated mix of very troubled boys who sometimes display very challenging and violent behaviour. 'As at other YOIs for this age group, staff in Feltham A still struggled to manage this behaviour in a safe and secure way. 'Staff need more help to do this and I repeat my call for the Youth Justice Board (YJB) to initiate an independent expert review of its policies and resources for managing behaviour, reducing bullying and supporting victims across all YOIs.' Use of force had increased dramatically at the site for boys, inspectors found, although supervision of, and accountability for, use of force was deemed good. Around a quarter of boys spent 23 hours a day locked up in their cell, which critics said amounted to solitary confinement. Around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the London area - were placed on so-called 'keep apart' lists to tackle gang-related violence, inspectors said. The number of fights and assaults has reduced since the last HMIP inspection (file photo) The report calls for 'new thinking' about how to tackle the 'debilitating and seemingly intractable' problem of gangs, violence and anti-social behaviour among young people. The site for young adults still faces significant challenges, inspectors said, particularly a high level of staff vacancies. However, the report did flag significant progress at site B, with a drop in fights and assaults and a decrease in use of batons against inmates. During the inspection, eight foreign national prisoners were being held beyond the end of their sentence - including one who had been inside for two years after the end of his sentence. Inspectors labelled this delay 'completely unacceptable'. Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: 'One in four boys in Feltham prison is spending 23 hours a day locked up in his cell in conditions which amount to solitary confinement. This is unacceptable. 'Despite some improvements, violence is endemic, including 79 assaults on staff in six months. It is particularly concerning that the use of force on children has increased dramatically since the last inspection. Use of force has increased dramatically at the site for boys, inspectors found, although supervision of, and accountability for, use of force was deemed good (file photo) 'However, the problems outlined in this report are not confined to Feltham - they mirror the findings of a series of inspections conducted across the country in recent months. 'Staff are rightly praised by the inspectorate, but they are working in challenging environments where they are being asked to achieve the impossible. 'It is high time we stopped locking up children in large, violent institutions and invest instead in what works in rehabilitating children whilst keeping them safe.' A previous inspection of site B in March 2013 called for a radical overhaul of the way the jail was run. Inspectors said it was one of the most concerning visits they had conducted. Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service (Noms), said: 'As this report makes clear the challenge faced by the governor and staff at Feltham should not be underestimated. 'Many of the young people in their care have strong gang affiliations and a history of violence. 'Managing their behaviour and supporting them to change and turn their lives around is a difficult and complex task. In this context the improvements achieved over the last 12 months are particularly impressive and the governor and his staff deserve huge credit for what has been achieved. 'There is no easy answer to the challenges presented by the young men in Feltham but we are committed to working positively with our partners in the YJB and in the wider community to reduce violence, prevent victims and support effective rehabilitation.'","completion":"Inspectors at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution (YOI) discovered that inmates represented 48 different gangs, leading to a \\"constant juggling\\" to keep them apart.

Allow me to provide a translation and additional information about the Czech language. The sentence \\"Tady to je, pobral jsem to v hotelu\\" translates to \\"Here it is, I picked it up at the hotel\\" in English. The Czech language is closely related to other Slavic languages, especially Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian. It is spoken by over 10 million people in the Czech Republic and also by Czech communities worldwide. Czech is written using the Latin alphabet, with several additional diacritic marks (\`ě\`, \`š\`, \`č\`, \`ř\`, \`ž\`, \`ý\`, \`á\`, \`í\`, and \`é\`). Czech grammar is characterized by a complex system of inflection, which includes declensions (for nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and numerals) and conjugations (for verbs). Nouns in Czech have three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental), and two numbers (singular and plural). The Czech language also features a rich vocabulary and a variety of speech registers, ranging from formal language or standard literary Czech to colloquial forms and regional dialects. Some well-known internationally-acclaimed Czech authors who have contributed to Czech literature include Franz Kafka, Milan Kundera, Jaroslav Hašek, and Karel Čapek, who is credited with coining the word \\"robot\\" in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots). Overall, the Czech language carries a long and rich history of culture and tradition. As a Slavic language, it shares similarities with neighboring languages, making it an interesting language to explore for those who are passionate about linguistics or Central European culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: India decided to use fossil fuels to produce their electricity, and Nepal decided to go renewable and use only hydro power to produce their electricity. Which country had more of an impact on the carbon cycle? Answer:","completion":"India's decision to primarily use fossil fuels for electricity generation and Nepal's choice to rely on renewable energy sources, specifically hydro power, would have different impacts on the carbon cycle. To analyze the impacts, it is crucial to understand the carbon cycle, the energy mix of both countries, and the environmental consequences of their respective choices. The carbon cycle is the natural circulation of carbon through the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, soil, living organisms, and geological formations. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have disrupted the natural balance of the carbon cycle by releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere at an accelerated rate. This accumulation of CO2 contributes to climate change, causing global warming and other environmental consequences. India, as a rapidly growing economy with an increasing energy demand, has based much of its power generation on fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are major contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly CO2, which is released in large quantities when they are burned. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India's primary energy demand is expected to double by 2040, with coal continuing to make up the largest part of their energy mix. In 2019, coal accounted for about 55% of India's energy supply, which contributes to air pollution and health issues in the country, in addition to exacerbating climate change. On the other hand, Nepal has opted for hydro power, which is a clean and renewable energy source. Hydro power harnesses the energy generated by moving water, either through rivers or rainfall, to produce electricity without releasing any GHG emissions. It is worth noting that environmental impacts can still occur from hydro power plants, such as habitat disruption, but these are usually not on the same scale as those associated with the production and combustion of fossil fuels. Nepal has significant hydro power potential due to its abundant water resources in the form of the Himalayan rivers and large rainfall amounts. Considering the differences in energy choices, it is clear that India's reliance on fossil fuels has a more significant impact on the carbon cycle, as this contributes to higher CO2 emissions and consequently, climate change. However, it is important to acknowledge that India has been taking steps to increase its renewable energy capacity, through initiatives like the National Solar Mission and wind energy projects. In contrast, Nepal's choice to primarily use hydro power for electricity generation significantly reduces their contribution to carbon emissions and impact on the carbon cycle. Nonetheless, both countries' actions should be evaluated within the broader context of global climate change, as well as their respective socio-economic situations and capacity to transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

So, the whole sentence \\"Только время моего отъезда было неопределенным\\" (Tol'ko vremya moego ot'ezda bylo neopredelennym) represents the same meaning as \\"Only the timing of my departure was unclear,\\" expressing that the only uncertain aspect of the departure was its timing."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Sentence2: Reef-building corals are hermatypic. Student:","completion":"Part #1: Generate an overlapping word between the given two sentences. Usage: From the provided sentences \\"Coral reefs provide food and shelter to many ocean organisms\\" and \\"Reef-building corals are hermatypic\\", the overlapping word is 'coral'/'corals'. This meets the criteria because both these sentences have that word. Part #2: The overlapping words don't have to match exactly. Usage: In the above example, the overlapping words are 'coral' and 'corals' which are not exactly the same, but they have the same root word. So, this is valid as per the instruction. Part #3: Little words like \\"the\\" or \\"of\\" don't count! Usage: In the same sentences, words like 'and', 'to', 'are' are not considered as overlapping words even though they are present in both sentences because they are stop words (commonly used words). Part #4: You must generate significant words which are not the stop words. Usage: In this case, the significant overlapping word 'coral'/'corals' is generated. This meets the criteria because this word is not one of the stop words and carries meaningful information within the context of the sentences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: -no. -yes.","completion":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. They are focusing on two distinct subject matters. Let's delve deeper into the meaning of each question: 1. What are the different types of engines? This question is asking about the various kinds of engines, which are machines that convert energy into mechanical force or motion. They are used in numerous applications, such as vehicles and electrical power generation. The main types of engines include: a. Internal Combustion Engines (ICE): These engines burn a fuel-air mixture within a combustion chamber in the engine. The high-temperature and high-pressure gases produced by combustion apply force to the engine components, turning them into mechanical energy. Common examples of ICE are: - Spark Ignition Engines (e.g., gasoline/petrol engines) - Compression Ignition Engines (e.g., diesel engines) - Wankel Rotary Engines b. External Combustion Engines: In these engines, the combustion of fuel occurs outside the engine, and the energy produced is transferred to the engine via a working fluid (like steam or hot air). Examples include: - Steam Engines - Stirling Engines c. Electric Motors: These engines utilize electrical energy and convert it into mechanical energy. The energy is supplied either through a battery or a power source. Examples are: - Direct Current (DC) Motors - Alternating Current (AC) Motors - Brushless Motors (BLDC) d. Jet Engines: These engines work based on Newton's third law, which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. They inhale air, compress it, mix it with fuel, and burn the mixture, which results in a high-speed jet of exhaust gases that propel the engine forward. Examples include: - Turbojet Engines - Turbofan Engines - Turboprop Engines - Ramjet Engines 2. What are the different types of engineering degrees? This question is inquiring about the various fields of study within the engineering domain. Engineering degrees offer specialization in designing, building, and maintaining structures, machines, systems, and processes. The main types of engineering degrees are: a. Civil Engineering: This field deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and buildings. b. Mechanical Engineering: This discipline focuses on the design, development, and manufacturing of mechanical systems, like engines, machines, and robotics devices. c. Electrical Engineering: This field involves the study of electrical and electronic systems, which includes designing and constructing circuits, communication systems, and power generation and distribution facilities. d. Chemical Engineering: This area of engineering deals with the development and optimization of chemical processes, such as creating new materials or designing efficient production methods. e. Aerospace Engineering: This engineering field concentrates on the design, production, and testing of aircraft, spacecraft, and other airborne vehicles. f. Computer Engineering: This branch merges electrical engineering and computer science to design and develop computer hardware, software, and networks. g. Industrial Engineering: This discipline aims to optimize processes, systems, and resources in various industries, from manufacturing to healthcare. h. Environmental Engineering: This field focuses on the development of sustainable solutions to environmental challenges, such as waste management, air and water pollution control, and renewable energy systems. i. Biomedical Engineering: This specialty combines engineering principles with medical science to design and develop medical devices, equipment, and healthcare solutions. In conclusion, these two questions have distinct meanings: the first one addresses the different types of engines, while the second one is concerned with the various types of engineering degrees available."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the question specifically asks for the number of ground-level stations (commonly known as at-grade stations).

We'll essentially see how each of the options function as a logical and cohesive continuation of the scene described in the paragraph. The existing paragraph focuses on women in two-piece bikinis playing volleyball at a beach under a clear, blue sky. Choice 1, \\"are several black balls floating around in the air,\\" does not fit well because it does not involve women continuing their activities, which is implied to continue by the phrase \\"now there\\". It seems awkward to shift focus to black balls without any preceding context about them. Choice 2, \\"are women playing sand volleyball at a different location and they are closer to a lot of buildings and on this day it has a very gloomy with a foggy sky,\\" doesn't fit well either. It introduces a new setting and changes the weather, disrupting the consistency of the paragraph. Contrastingly, choice 3, \\"are several other naked women doing the same thing, they are playing the game of volleyball so intensely that they have almost no energy left, and there are several people on the beach green watching them play and watching them cheer them on they're doing crazy activities and they seem super focused about partying it is so intense and hopping from every ball to the ball trying to get them all out of the way,\\" is on theme with the action of women playing volleyball, but it includes a lot of new, unnecessary information that conflicts with the existing atmosphere and tone. Choice 4, \\"are two children dressed in white shorts playing volleyball in the sand, as they run fast into the other teams to make a goal in a goal,\\" provides the most logical continuity to the paragraph. It includes the same actions (playing volleyball) and setting (at the beach), while introducing a related sub-set of characters (children) which can naturally exist within the scene. So, following the preceding 'beach volleyball' theme, choice 4 serves as the most appropriate end to the paragraph. It maintains the atmosphere of the story, aligns with the setting, and doesn't introduce an abrupt shift in tone or context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The game was full of turnovers, and neither team could take care of the scoring opportunities. Colts QB Peyton Manning threw two interceptions and one of those was returned for a touchdown by Cowboys OLB Kevin Burnett early in the second half. The first quarter was back-and-forth as each possession ended with turnover after turnover. After Cowboys QB Tony Romo was sacked by DE Dwight Freeney, Colts WR Marvin Harrison fumbled, and after the Cowboys punted, Manning was sacked by Jay Ratliff and Bradie James recovered the fumble. After a couple punts by both teams, Peyton Manning & Co. pushed the Cowboys deep in their own territory thanks to the great rushing by rookie RB Joseph Addai. The Colts reached the 4-yard line, and on third down, Manning attempted a pass to the endzone, but in a controversial situation, SS Roy Williams nudged TE Dallas Clark near the end zone, and while Clark fell down, Williams intercepted a Peyton Manning pass for the second time in his career, and gave the Cowboys the ball at their own 7-yard line.

Paragraph: Before the establishment of the People's Republic, Albania's illiteracy rate was as high as 85%. Schools were scarce between World War I and World War II. When the People's Republic was established in 1945, the Party gave high priority to wiping out illiteracy. As part of a vast social campaign, anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn. By 1955, illiteracy was virtually eliminated among Albania's adult population. Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male literacy rate is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%. With large population movements in the 1990s to urban areas, the provision of education has undergone transformation as well. The University of Tirana is the oldest university in Albania, having been founded in October 1957.

A:","completion":"\\"I Write the Songs\\" is a popular song that was famously performed by David Cassidy, but he did not write it. The song was composed by renowned American songwriter and musician, Bruce Johnston. Born on June 27, 1942, Bruce Johnston is perhaps best known as a member of the Beach Boys, a rock band made famous during the 60s and 70s for their unique and innovative pop and rock music. Johnston joined the band in 1965 and became an integral part of its success, contributing not just as a singer but also as a songwriter, and instrumentalist. \\"I Write the Songs\\" is a notable contribution from Johnston's career as a songwriter, which was released in 1975. Despite the common misunderstanding, David Cassidy was not the first to record it. The song was first recorded by The Captain & Tennille on their \\"Love Will Keep Us Together\\" album. David Cassidy released his own version later in 1975 on his \\"The Higher They Climb\\" album. The song was hugely popularized when it was recorded by Barry Manilow the following year, in 1976. Manilow's version soared to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and won a Grammy Award for Song of the Year. The song itself is a kind of self-tribute to the craft of songwriting. Through the lyrics, Johnston portrays the power of music and songs to bring happiness, invoke nostalgia, and stir emotions in listeners. In sum, \\"I Write the Songs\\" was written by Bruce Johnston, and while it was successfully covered by David Cassidy and other artists, Johnston's creative input as a composer was a crucial part of the song's journey to becoming a pop icon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At this time, many people think of this classical music piece -- Spring, which shows happiness. Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi wrote it in the seventeen hundred. However, not all songs about spring are happy. This song written and sung by K.D. Lang is about dreaming of spring in cold dark places. She recorded I Dream of Spring in 2008. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein wrote It Might as Well Be Spring for the movie State Fair in 1945. Frank Sinatra sings it. It is a feeling of restlessness or excitement brought on by the coming of spring. Richard Rodgers also wrote Spring Is Here, this time with Lorenz Hart. Ella Fitzgerald sings this song about feeling lonely during this season. Frank Loesser wrote the sad song, Spring Will be a Little Late This Year. Why has the season been delayed? Because the singer's lover has left her. Sarah Vaughn released her version of the song in 1953. By now you may be thinking, \\"Enough with the sad songs, already!\\" Ok, then how about a cowboy song?

V pohodě. Děkuju. Translate to English","completion":"Alright. Thank you. The original text is in Czech and it translates to \\"Alright. Thank you\\" in English. In the given phrase, \\"V pohodě\\" means \\"Alright\\" or \\"Fine,\\" and \\"Děkuju\\" is the Czech way of saying \\"Thank you\\" or expressing gratitude. The Czech language, also known as čeština, belongs to the West Slavic branch of the Slavic languages. It is spoken by approximately 10 million people, mainly in the Czech Republic. It developed from the Proto-Slavic language around the 10th century AD, with its written form taking shape in the 11th century. Over the years, it has been influenced by Latin, Hebrew, and German among other languages. Czech shares similarities with other Slavic languages such as Slovak, Polish, and Slovenian. The language uses the Latin script with additional diacritics, such as the háček (ˇ) and the acute accent (´). These diacritics help denote the specific pronunciation of consonants and vowels, which is vital since the language is highly phonetic, i.e., words are written as they are pronounced. Key aspects of Czech grammar include extensive inflection, which means that nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and numerals have different forms based on their grammatical function in a sentence; verbs are conjugated according to tense, mood, and person, and they also have different forms for the active, passive, and reflexive voice. Additionally, Czech word order is flexible but predominantly subject-verb-object (SVO). In summary, the translation of \\"V pohodě. Děkuju\\" from Czech to English is \\"Alright. Thank you.\\" The Czech language is a rich and complex West Slavic language spoken predominantly in the Czech Republic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Andy is described as \\"healthy as an ox,\\" which implies that he is not infected with any serious disease, including HIV/AIDS. Tom, on the other hand, was infected with HIV 20 years ago.

Despite the lack of a cure for AIDS, the development of the disease can be delayed with proper medication. Today, with the right medicines, individuals who acquire HIV after 50 years of age can expect to reach an average human life span.

Southwest, AirTran pilots reach deal on seniority lists Southwest's acquisition of AirTran cleared a significant milestone over the weekend, with the airline saying it reached an agreement \\"in principle\\" with its pilots unions on combining seniority lists. The Associated Press notes \\"the deal between Southwest, the Southwest Airlines Pilots' Association and the Air Line Pilots Association must be approved by both unions' boards and ratified by their memberships.\\" Seniority lists are crucially important to pilots and to other unionized groups at U.S. airlines. The lists determine everything from pay to scheduling. For pilots, such lists govern which type of aircraft they fly and determines priority for preferable routes and schedules. \\"It's really a big milestone for the pilots to come to this agreement in principle,\\" Southwest spokesman Paul Flaningan says to Bloomberg News. \\"It gives a signal to the other unions that everyone is moving forward with the integration.\\" Reaching a deal on combining seniority list can be one of the thorniest details in finalizing an airline merger. At US Airways, for example, pilots have failed to reach an agreement on how to combine seniority lists there, even though the America West-US Airways merger closed nearly six years ago. The failure to do so has kept the airline from combining flight crews, depriving US Airways of some of the financial benefits of the merger by forcing it to continue to -- more or less -- fly as two separate airlines under a single brand. The lack of a deal also has prevented US Airways pilots from negotiating a new combined contract, which most expect would boost their compensation. Given that background, the significance of Southwest's just-announced pact doesn't appear to be lost on Southwest COO Mike Van de Ven. \\"The unions and Company negotiating teams have accomplished a task that is rare in this industry, developing an integrated seniority list and transition plan for our Pilots outside of arbitration,\\" Van de Ven says in a statement. Despite the important milestone, the Southwest-AirTran merger is expected to continue at a cautious pace. For example, Southwest has said it does not expect to even begin repainting AirTran's planes until sometime next year. For now, the airlines are operating separately.

Over the weekend, the airline announced that it had reached an agreement \\"in principle\\" with its pilots unions on combining seniority lists. The deal between Southwest, the Southwest Airlines Pilots' Association, and the Air Line Pilots Association will still need to be approved by both unions' boards and ratified by their memberships. Seniority lists are essential for pilots and other unionized groups at U.S. airlines, determining factors such as pay, scheduling, type of aircraft flown, and priority for preferable routes and schedules. The agreement represents a major step forward for the merger process, and a positive signal to other unions involved in the integration process. Combining seniority lists can be a difficult and contentious aspect of airline mergers, as exemplified by the ongoing situation at US Airways, where the lack of an agreement has prevented the full realization of merger benefits. In contrast, the Southwest-AirTran merger's progress in this area has been acknowledged by Southwest COO Mike Van de Ven, who praised the unions and negotiating teams for their accomplishment. Nonetheless, the merger is expected to continue at a cautious pace, with Southwest stating that they do not expect to begin repainting AirTran's planes until some time next year, and the airlines continuing to operate separately for the time being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the location of the temple built in the style that is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features in 1200? from the following article ? The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, shows distinct Dravidian influences. The Hoysala architecture style is described as Karnata Dravida as distinguished from the traditional Dravida, and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftsmanship. The tower over the temple shrine (vimana) is delicately finished with intricate carvings, showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height. The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers. Hoysala temple sculpture replicates this emphasis on delicacy and craftsmanship in its focus on depicting feminine beauty, grace and physique. The Hoysala artists achieved this with the use of Soapstone (Chloritic schist), a soft stone as basic building and sculptural material.The Chennakesava Temple at Belur (1117), the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu (1121), the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279), the temples at Arasikere (1220), Amruthapura (1196), Belavadi (1200), Nuggehalli (1246), Hosaholalu (1250), Aralaguppe (1250), Korvangla (1173), Haranhalli (1235), Mosale and Basaralu (1234) are some of the notable examples of Hoysala art. While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures, the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and lesser known temples. The outer walls of all these temples contain an intricate array of stone sculptures and horizontal friezes (decorative mouldings) that depict the Hindu epics....

His questions suggest he suspects that he did something that upset Bianca, and he is trying to find out more about her feelings or response. Here's a breakdown of events: 1. Noah asks Olivier if he has talked to Bianca recently, to which Olivier replies affirmatively saying it was yesterday. 2. Then Noah tries to inquire indirectly about what Bianca said about him. 3. Olivier refuses to disclose any details, implying that Bianca's conversation with him was confidential. 4. However, Noah insists on getting at least a vibe or a hint. Olivier gives him a vague answer by saying that he already has a sense of the vibe since he's not talking directly to Bianca. 5. Noah, interpreting Olivier's vague answer as negative, concludes that the situation is bad. According to Olivier, Noah didn't behave well with Bianca, which Noah admits. 6. Olivier finally suggests Noah now has to face the consequences of his action. From their dialogue, it seems like Noah made some mistake or behaved improperly with Bianca.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Robert Schumann (; 8 June 1810 - 29 July 1856) was a German composer and an influential music critic. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era. Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a virtuoso pianist. He had been assured by his teacher Friedrich Wieck, a German pianist, that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. Schumann was born in Zwickau, in the Kingdom of Saxony, the fifth and last child of Johanna Christiane (nee Schnabel) and August Schumann. Schumann began to compose before the age of seven, but his boyhood was spent in the cultivation of literature as much as music - undoubtedly influenced by his father, a bookseller, publisher, and novelist. Schumann began receiving general musical and piano instruction at the age of seven from Johann Gottfried Kuntzsch, a teacher at the Zwickau high school. The boy immediately developed a love of music and worked at creating musical compositions himself, without the aid of Kuntzsch. Even though he often disregarded the principles of musical composition, he created works regarded as admirable for his age. The Universal Journal of Music 1850 supplement included a biographical sketch of Schumann that noted, \\"It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody, - ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the similitude of the portrait.\\" At age 14, Schumann wrote an essay on the aesthetics of music and also contributed to a volume, edited by his father, titled Portraits of Famous Men. While still at school in Zwickau, he read the works of the German poet-philosophers Schiller and Goethe, as well as Byron and the Greek tragedians. His most powerful and permanent literary inspiration was Jean Paul, a German writer whose influence is seen in Schumann's youthful novels Juniusabende, completed in 1826, and Selene. Schumann's interest in music was sparked by seeing a performance of Ignaz Moscheles playing at Karlsbad, and he later developed an interest in the works of Beethoven, Schubert and Mendelssohn. His father, who had encouraged the boy's musical aspirations, died in 1826 when Schumann was 16. Neither his mother nor his guardian thereafter encouraged a career in music. In 1828 Schumann left school, and after a tour during which he met Heinrich Heine in Munich, he went to Leipzig to study law (to meet the terms of his inheritance). In 1829 his law studies continued in Heidelberg, where he became a lifelong member of Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did people think he had talent as a child","completion":"Yes, people thought he had talent as a child. This can be seen in the quote from the Universal Journal of Music 1850 supplement: \\"It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody, - ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the similitude of the portrait.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts.

Question: Detroit is NOT in what area of the United States? Context: Detroit, like many places in the United States, developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were attracted to the industrial city; in a short period it became the 4th-largest city in the nation. The Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city. Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the Ku Klux Klan beginning in 1915. \\"By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK,\\" whose members opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, as well as black Americans. The Black Legion, a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area in the 1930s, when one-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city.

Article: John Dowd (pictured) had been spearheading negotiations with Special Counsel Robert Mueller for a potential interview with the president, while Jay Sekulow handled public communications. | Richard Dew/AP Photo Trump’s Russia probe lawyer John Dowd resigns The departure comes amid a larger shakeup of the legal team handling the Mueller investigation. John Dowd resigned Thursday as President Donald Trump’s lead lawyer for the Russia investigation amid a wider shakeup of Trump’s legal team that raised new questions about Trump’s strategy for dealing with special counsel Robert Mueller. Dowd stepped down just days after he issued a statement calling for Mueller’s probe to be shuttered, which he first attributed with his title as the president’s lawyer and then backtracked to say he was speaking only for himself. Story Continued Below “I love the president and wish him well,” Dowd said in an email to POLITICO. Dowd, a prominent Washington white collar defense attorney with a prickly demeanor, signed on as a personal attorney to the president last June and recently had been spearheading negotiations with Mueller for a potential interview with the president. But the 77-year old attorney had grown increasingly frustrated by his work for Trump, according to a source familiar with the Trump legal team strategy. Dowd was particularly upset to learn on Monday that Trump had decided to hire Joseph diGenova, another bulldog lawyer and scandal veteran to help with his Russia response. Trump had also been gauging interest from other prominent attorneys, including former George W. Bush Solicitor General Ted Olson, who recently turned down an offer from Trump by citing conflicts with his law firm. Trump’s legal team has long been riven by a debate about how Trump should handle Mueller’s investigation in both political and legal terms. Dowd had preached a confrontational approach, warning Trump of the risks of speaking to Mueller—at the risk of perjuring himself—and calling in a Saturday morning statement on the Justice Department to “bring an end” to its “manufactured” Russia probe. Asked Thursday at a China trade event at the White House whether he was still willing to speak to Mueller, the president responded, “Yes, I would like to.” Given the recent addition of the combative diGenova to Trump’s team, it is not clear that Dowd’s departure will substantially impact its overall strategy.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) during the Keating Five Scandal, and for leading a Major League Baseball investigation of gambling allegations surrounding baseball great Pete Rose. Jay Sekulow, who has been handling public communications and research on constitutional issues for the Trump legal team, declined on Thursday to answer questions about how the president’s attorneys would be organized going forward. “John Dowd has been a valuable member of our legal team and we will continue our ongoing cooperation with the office of special counsel regarding this inquiry,” Sekulow said in a statement to POLITICO. Trump’s legal team has seen remarkable flux, particularly given the stakes for a president who could potentially face impeachment or even indictment over allegations that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin and that he has sought to obstruct justice. Trump insists that such charges have been manufactured by political partisans. The president originally tapped his longtime personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz to represent him in the Justice Department’s Russia probe, which Mueller has led since shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last May. But the New York-based Kasowitz stepped down last summer amid concerns he wasn’t best positioned to tangle with a Washington scandal. While the president continues to speak with Kasowitz, he has mainly relied on Dowd and Sekulow to manage the Russia probe for him as an individual. Washington lawyer Ty Cobb runs the White House’s official response to the investigation with a team of about five aides who draw taxpayer salaries. The changes to the Trump legal team are seen as a bad omen for Cobb, who has been urging cooperation with Mueller. In an interview on Wednesday, former Cobb law partner Robert Bennett called for Cobb to resign in order to preserve his professional reputation. “I hope my friend Ty Cobb will leave the team. He’s not helping himself or his reputation,” Bennett said. Cobb did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump has recently been frustrated with his lawyers, who had been giving him a steadily changing series of target completion dates for a Mueller probe that has only appeared to widen in recent weeks to include allegations, seemingly unrelated to Russia, that a consultant for the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates worked with a top GOP fundraiser. On Saturday, Trump tweeted that “the Mueller probe should never have been started,” insisting that “there was no collusion and there was no crime” and branding the investigation a “WITCH HUNT.” It was the first time Trump had specifically mentioned Mueller by name on Twitter — something his lawyers have counseled him to avoid doing. This week he hired diGenova, a fierce critic of the Russia investigation who earlier this year told Fox News that Trump had been framed by the Justice Department and FBI “with a falsely created crime.” Trump’s free-wheeling style has worn on his lawyers. He’s ignored their advice to restrain himself on Twitter and disregarded their counsel that he not discuss details of the probe beyond his legal team. poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201803/1853/1155968404_5756709788001_5756676647001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" true Legal experts say those are reasons why Trump has struggled to attract the caliber of lawyer that has historically leapt to represent a sitting president. Olson, Robert Giuffra Jr. and Reid Weingarten were among the elite attorneys who declined job offers from Trump last spring, while former George W. Bush attorneys Bill Burck and Emmet Flood rejected overtures for the position ultimately accepted by Cobb. “The notion of saying no to represent the president of the United States is kind of amazing,” said Bennett, a former personal attorney to President Bill Clinton. Trump may not be done looking for lawyers. Flood met with the president earlier this month at the White House, though it’s unclear if that has led to a job offer. The diGenova hiring came days after Dowd issued a Saturday morning statement calling for Mueller’s work to end. “I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,” Dowd told the Daily Beast, responding to Sessions’ decision the night before to fire Andrew McCabe, the former deputy FBI director. Dowd initially said he was speaking in his official capacity as Trump’s lawyer. But he later retracted that statement, telling POLITICO he was commenting in his personal capacity. It was one of several instances where Dowd raised eyebrows—and in some cases, drew ridicule—for his public commentary about the Russia probe. Last December, Dowd took blame for a tweet posted on Trump’s account that appeared to admit Trump was aware that his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had lied to the FBI before Trump urged Comey to drop the Russia investigation. The tweet puzzled legal experts who said the admission could fuel an obstruction of justice case against Trump. Dowd later argued that Trump could not be found guilty of obstruction of justice because of his role as chief executive under the Constitution, an argument that many legal experts disputed. Both Dowd and Cobb also were embarrassed last summer after a New York Times reporter overheard them speaking about the Russia investigation at a Washington restaurant. Dowd is well-known for his gruff manner, which was on vivid display outside a federal courthouse in 2011 when he told a CNBC camera crew to “get the fuck out of here” before giving the cameraman the middle finger. Asked recently by POLITICO to comment on talks between the president’s lawyers and Mueller’s investigators, Dowd was only somewhat friendlier: “None of your business,” he said. ||||| WASHINGTON — John Dowd resigned on Thursday as President Trump’s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation as Mr. Trump signaled that he was prepared to ignore his advice and wanted a sit-down with investigators. After days of uncertainty among the president’s lawyers about their status, Mr. Dowd ultimately broke with Mr. Trump over whether he should agree to be questioned in the inquiry, a person briefed on the matter said. Mr. Dowd viewed an interview as too risky; the president reiterated shortly after Mr. Dowd resigned that he wanted to clear his name. “I would like to,” the president told reporters at the White House when asked about meeting with investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. “I would like to.” Mr. Dowd’s departure cleared the way for the president to embrace a more aggressive posture toward the investigation and marked another reshuffling of personnel for Mr. Trump. In the most politically consequential investigation in decades, the president has refashioned his legal team several times, a revolving door that mirrors the high turnover among senior White House and campaign aides. ||||| Update, March 22, 2018: John Dowd, the president’s lead lawyer in the special counsel’s investigation, has resigned. Read the latest, here. WASHINGTON — President Trump’s legal team was poised for a shake-up on Monday, according to two people briefed on the matter, as he openly discussed firing one of his lawyers, another considered resigning and a third — who pushed theories on television that Mr. Trump was framed by the F.B.I. — joined the roster. Mr. Trump has weighed aloud in recent days to close associates whether to dismiss his lawyer Ty Cobb, who had pushed most strongly a strategy of cooperating fully with the special counsel investigation. The president reassured Mr. Cobb that he had no plans to fire him, according to a person who spoke with the president late Monday, in part to prevent a narrative that his team was in disarray after The New York Times began making inquiries. Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer, John Dowd, has contemplated leaving his post because he has concluded that he has no control over the behavior of the president, the two people briefed on the matter said. Ignoring his lawyers’ advice, Mr. Trump has reverted to a more aggressive strategy of publicly assailing the inquiry that he initially adopted in the weeks immediately after the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was appointed. Now the president has begun attacking Mr. Mueller himself. |||||Summary:","completion":"John Dowd, the lead lawyer for President Donald Trump in the Russia investigation, has resigned.

Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. \\"I think on a stress test, they're failing,\\" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\" After reading the above, is \\"Vietnam has been very irritated\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Contradictory statements by the government of Malaysia have irritated what country involved with the investigation?\\"?
