Can the shape be rotated within a suitable regular triangle framework such that it constantly touches all three sides of the framework?","completion":"1. **To prove that the Reuleaux shape (R) with a constant width of (a+2r) cannot be rotated inside a regular hexagon frame with side length (frac{a+2r}{sqrt{3}}):** Consider three supporting strips of the Reuleaux shape (R) that are rotated (120^circ) relative to each other. The common area of these strips generally does not match the frame, which is a regular hexagon. To illustrate this, if we choose three strips where each strip touches the boundary arcs of (R) with radii (r) and (a+r) at the midpoints of opposite pairs of these arcs, two different side lengths will arise. - Let (A') and (C'') be the midpoints of the arcs with radii (r) and (a+r) centered at points (A) and (C) respectively. - The intersection of tangents at these points will form a point (H). Exhibiting these strips, the lengths of the common section's sides will alternately be (2A'H) and (2C''H), differing from each other due to symmetry considerations. Symmetrically, the lines (AA') and (CC'') pass through the common center (O) of triangle (ABC): [OHA'] and [OHC''] are right triangles with a common hypotenuse (OH), but distinct legs (A'O) and (C''O): [ begin{aligned} A'O &= A'A + AO = r + frac{a}{sqrt{3}}, C''O &= C''C - CO = a + r - frac{a}{sqrt{3}} = r + left(frac{sqrt{3}-1}{sqrt{3}}right)a. end{aligned} ] Clearly, (A'O > C''O), thus by the Pythagorean theorem, (A'H < C''H). This confirms our claim. 2. **Proving the Reuleaux shape cannot thus be rotated inside a regular triangle-shaped frame:** Similarly, consider points (B'), (C'), (A''), and (B'') as midpoints of the arcs on the boundary. The tangents at these points create support regular triangles whose side lengths differ. Both sets of tangents will coincide with point (O) forming inscribed radii: Given (O A' > O C''), it implies inherent inequality in our tangent lengths. 3. **Conclusion on the impossibility based on symmetry axes:** If rotation were possible, there would exist a position where the symmetry axes of (R) and the frame are pairwise parallel and would coincide, placing point (O) of frame over (R)'s midpoint. But, given in (R) (with (a>0)) (O) does not bisect sections, implying impossibility. 4. **Impossibility based on the contact points argument:** Reuleaux shape (R) is insertable notably in alignment with joining points of arcs with radii (r) and (a+r): Upon rotating, if contact occurs in an inner point of arcs, the intersection of supporting strips yields a nonsymmetric common area. Given (120^circ) symmetry, tangential lengths vary, hence differing from the frame's sides. 5. **Verification by specific computations for enclosing within an (a+2 r) width polygon:** Bollobás Béla provides proof indicating that (R) is non-rotatable within such a framework but possible in a rhombus frame. A Reuleaux shape may fit by aligning with an (a+2 r) hexagon's inscribable circle radius, but this is insufficient since tangents and intersecting lines offer discrepancy points.

Therefore, DP = PB and CP = PA. - This implies DP = PB = frac{AB}{2} and CP = PA = frac{AB}{2}. - Substituting DP = PB = frac{AB}{2} into DP cdot DB = a^2, we get: [ left(frac{AB}{2}right)^2 = a^2 ] - Solving for AB, we find: [ AB = 2a ] - Similarly, substituting CP = PA = frac{AB}{2} into CP cdot CA = b^2, we get: [ left(frac{AB}{2}right)^2 = b^2 ] - Solving for AB, we find: [ AB = 2b ] 5. **Conclusion**: - Since AB = 2a and AB = 2b, and given a neq b, we must find a common expression for the diameter that holds true regardless of the specific values of a and b. - The correct expression that relates a and b to the diameter AB is sqrt{ab}, as it is the geometric mean of a^2 and b^2 and satisfies the conditions of the problem.

The derivative of f(x) with respect to x is calculated as follows: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(ax^{3}) - frac{d}{dx}(bx) - frac{d}{dx}(ln x) = 3ax^{2} - b - frac{1}{x}. Given that x=1 is a critical point of f(x), we know that f'(1) = 0. Substituting x=1 into the derivative gives: f'(1) = 3a(1)^{2} - b - frac{1}{1} = 3a - b - 1 = 0. This implies that 3a - 1 = b. Now, we define a new function g(a) = ln a - (b-1). Substituting b = 3a - 1 into g(a) gives: g(a) = ln a - ((3a - 1) - 1) = ln a - 3a + 2. To analyze the behavior of g(a), we find its derivative with respect to a: g'(a) = frac{d}{da}(ln a) - frac{d}{da}(3a) + frac{d}{da}(2) = frac{1}{a} - 3. Simplifying the derivative gives: g'(a) = frac{1-3a}{a}. To determine the intervals where g(a) is increasing or decreasing, we analyze the sign of g'(a): - For g'(a) > 0, we solve frac{1-3a}{a} > 0 which gives 0 < a < frac{1}{3}. - For g'(a) < 0, we solve frac{1-3a}{a} < 0 which gives a > frac{1}{3}. This means g(a) is increasing in the interval (0, frac{1}{3}) and decreasing in the interval (frac{1}{3}, +infty). Therefore, the maximum value of g(a) occurs at a = frac{1}{3}. Evaluating g(a) at this point gives: gleft(frac{1}{3}right) = lnleft(frac{1}{3}right) - 3left(frac{1}{3}right) + 2 = 1 - ln 3. Since ln 3 > 1, we have 1 - ln 3 < 0.

This circle is known as the *Tangential Circle*. 2. **Prove (|AK| + |CK| = |AL| + |CL|):** - If there is such a circle, tangent to (AB, BC, CD, text{ and } DA), this circle also implies that the tangents from an external point to a circle are equal in length. - Therefore: [ |AK| = |AL| quad text{and} quad |CK| = |CL| ] - Summing these, [ |AK| + |CK| = |AL| + |CL| ] 3. **Prove (|BK| + |DK| = |BL| + |DL|):** - Similarly, the tangential circle implies that: [ |BK| = |BL| quad text{and} quad |DK| = |DL| ] - Summing these, we get: [ |BK| + |DK| = |BL| + |DL| ] Hence, we have established that if the first condition holds, the other two conditions automatically hold.

There would be a possible route ( S-C-A ).

Therefore, the midpoint of ED divides it equally into two segments of 6.5 each. 3. **Apply the Median Length Formula**: In a right triangle, the length of the median from the right-angle vertex to the hypotenuse can be calculated using: [ text{Median length} = frac{1}{2} sqrt{2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2} ] where a = 5, b = 12, and c = 13.

This is because for any parabola, the directrix is equidistant from the vertex as the focus, but in the opposite direction. Let's denote the point P on the parabola in the first quadrant by its coordinates (x,y). By the definition of a parabola, the distance from P to the focus F is equal to the perpendicular distance from P to the directrix.

This strategy ensures that the magician can identify the five additional coins in their correct state, even though the assistant cannot communicate directly to the magician when he enters. 3. **Step 3: Divide the Problem into Smaller Parts** - Divide the 27 coins into 9 groups of 3 coins each (a triplet).

This specific pattern will inform the magician about the positioning of heads within that triplet. - Possible rules for assistant: - Two leftmost heads: uncover the leftmost coin. - Two rightmost heads: uncover the middle coin. - Left and right heads: uncover the rightmost coin. - These rules allow the magician to infer the specific hidden heads coins in the other triplets based on the position of the uncovered coin. 7. **Step 7: The Magician’s Task** - When the magician enters, he sees the five uncovered coins and remembers the agreed pattern. - With the predetermined pattern, the magician deciphers the exact combination of heads positions in each triplet and thus guesses correctly which other five coins (still covered) will show heads. # Conclusion This combination and hidden message deciphering complete the focus trick successfully.

Therefore, option A is incorrect. **For option B**: To find a direction vector of the line, we look at the coefficients of x and y in the equation. The line l: y=x-8 can also be expressed in the form x-y-8=0, which suggests a direction vector overrightarrow{u}=(1,1) because the slope of the line, which indicates the direction, is 1 (rise over run). Thus, option B is correct. **For option C**: To find the y-axis intercept, we set x=0 in the equation y=x-8: [y = 0 - 8 = -8] This calculation shows that the line intercepts the y-axis at -8, not 8. Therefore, option C is incorrect. **For option D**: The slope of the line is determined directly from the equation y=x-8, which is 1 (since the coefficient of x is 1). The slope of 1 does not equal frac{pi}{4} radians. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the standard solution regarding the slope's numerical and angular values. In trigonometry, a slope of 1 corresponds to an angle of frac{pi}{4} radians with the positive direction of the x-axis, thus making the statement about the slope being frac{pi}{4} a confusion of slope with angle. The slope itself is not frac{pi}{4} but the angle it makes with the x-axis is.

A cube has 6 faces. 2. **Points Distribution**: We need to determine how points are distributed on these 6 faces. Since there are 100 points and they are all distinct, some faces must have multiple points. 3. **Points per Face**: Let ( a, b, c, d, e, ) and ( f ) be the number of points on each of the 6 faces of the cube. Thus: [ a + b + c + d + e + f = 100. ] 4. **Cube Rotations**: A cube can be rotated to lie on the table in different orientations, but it has the property that each face can be the bottom face. Hence, any face (i) can be at the bottom and any other face (j) can be at the top, provided (i neq j). 5. **Rotations Leading to Identical Prints**: Our goal is to show there exist two distinct ways to position the cube that result in the same chalk prints on the table. For this, let's focus on these rotations and how they affect the positioning of points: - When the cube is placed with face 1 at the bottom, it will make prints generated by face 1. - Assume a specific rotation (R) that places the cube in a certain orientation on the table. Rotations can be visualized as permutations of the six faces. 6. **Case Analysis**: - Considering there are 6 faces, choose face (i) as the bottom face (B_1). Rotate the cube by 180° around an axis perpendicular to the chosen bottom face. Alternate faces will swap positions. - Alternatively, rotate around another axis by 90°, 180°, or 270° orthogonal to the current bottom face. Each rotation can lead to alignments where the same faces contact the table surface providing the same print pattern. 7. **Pigeonhole Principle Application**: The key deployment here is using the Pigeonhole Principle. Considering six positions per cube orientation and 100 distinct points: - There cannot be more than a specific arrangement that uniquely avoids duplicating a particular point marking on the face contacts. - Given enough points (over half the possibilities), at least one repeat configuration of prints is guaranteed. 8. **Conclusion**: By the principle of combinatorial arrangements and face-face rotations, it can be confirmed that there will exist at least two distinct placements of the cube yielding identical chalk prints on the table due to the guaranteed overlap in the points' tracing mappings. This guarantees us that the same print pattern can be replicated in at least two different positional configurations of the cube. Hence, [ boxed{text{Confirmed}} ] that there exist two distinct ways to position the cube on a table such that the chalk prints are the same."},{"prompt":"Find all complex numbers of the form z = x + yi, where x and y are positive integers, such that [ z^3 = 107 + ci, ] for some integer c.","completion":"Cubing the equation z = x + yi, we get, [ z^3 = (x+yi)^3 = (x^3 + 3x^2yi - 3xy^2 - y^3i) = (x^3 - 3xy^2) + (3x^2y - y^3)i. ] Hence, the real part of z^3 gives: [ x^3 - 3xy^2 = -107. ] We rewrite as: [ x(x^2 - 3y^2) = -107. ] Thus, x must be a divisor of 107.

Therefore, S_100, S_200-S_100, and S_300-S_200 form an arithmetic sequence with common difference 120. Using this property, we can write the equation: S_300-S_200 = (S_200-S_100) + (S_200-S_100 - S_100) Simplifying this equation, we get: S_300-S_200 = 2(S_200-S_100) - S_100 Substituting the given values, we obtain: S_300-S_200 = 2(120) - 80 = 160 Therefore, the value of a_201+a_202+...+a_300 is boxed{160}."},{"prompt":"Given a sequence {a_n} with the sum of its first n terms denoted as S_n, n in mathbb{N}^*, and S_n = frac{3}{2}a_n frac{1}{2}.

Now, to find the number of right-handed players who are not throwers, we subtract the number of left-handed players from the number of players who are not throwers: 33 players who are not throwers - 11 left-handed players = 22 right-handed players who are not throwers. Since all throwers are right-handed, we need to add the number of throwers to the number of right-handed players who are not throwers to get the total number of right-handed players: 37 throwers (who are right-handed) + 22 right-handed players (who are not throwers) = boxed{59} right-handed players in total."},{"prompt":"Mary is participating in the 20question regional mathematics competition.

The focus of a parabola given in the form y = ax^2 is located at (0, frac{1}{4a}). The directrix of this parabola can be represented by the equation y = -frac{1}{4a}. Given that the distance from point P(x_0, 2) to the focus of the parabola is 3, and considering the focus is at (0, frac{1}{4a}), we can set up the equation for the distance from P to the focus using the distance formula: sqrt{(x_0 - 0)^2 + (2 - frac{1}{4a})^2} = 3. Substituting the y-coordinate of P, which is 2, into the equation frac{1}{4a} = 1, since the distance from the focus to P along the y-axis is 2 - frac{1}{4a} = 1, we solve for a: a = frac{1}{4}.

Speed of first train = 60 km/hr Speed of second train = 40 km/hr Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 40 km/hr Relative speed = 100 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second to match the units of the length of the trains. 1 km/hr = (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) 1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s Therefore, the relative speed in meters per second is: Relative speed = 100 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed = (100 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed = (500/18) m/s Relative speed ≈ 27.78 m/s The total distance to be covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths: Total distance = Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance = 210 m + 260 m Total distance = 470 m Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the trains to cross each other using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 470 m / 27.78 m/s Time ≈ 16.92 seconds So, it takes approximately boxed{16.92} seconds for the two trains to cross each other."},{"prompt":"There are several identical cars in a train.

First, note that the sine function has a period of 360^circ.

Let's denote the five numbers as ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 ). We list these numbers one under the other to form a matrix with ( n ) columns and 5 rows. Each column represents a digit place (or \\"stolbtsa\\" in Russian), containing five digits. 3. Within each column, we can form ( binom{5}{2} = 10 ) unique unordered pairs from the five digits. Across the ( n ) columns, this gives a total of ( 10n ) pairs. 4. Our task is to determine the number of pairs consisting of the same digit, either (1, 1) or (2, 2).

Set ( m_b = 1 ). - On the axis ( OX_0 ), place point ( B_0 ) so that ( OB_0 = 1 ). - On the axis ( OX' ), place points ( A' ) and ( C' ) such that ( OA' = m_a ), ( OB' = 1 ), and ( OC' = m_a + 1 ). - Draw lines parallel to ( A'B_0 ) and ( C'B_0 ) through ( B' ). Let these lines intersect ( OX_0 ) at points ( A_0 ) and ( C_0 ) respectively. 5. **Calculations to verify ratios:** Using the construction, verify the ratios: [ OA_0: OB_0 = OB' : OA' quad text{and} quad OC_0 : OB_0 = OB' : OC' ] Now the aim is to have ( OA_0 = 1 / m_a ), ( OB_0 = 1 ), and ( OC_0 = 1 / (m_a + m_b) ). 6. **Completion of triangle construction:** - Using the proportions obtained, construct points such that they correspond to ( m_a ), ( m_b ), and ( m_a + m_b ). - Construct a triangle with these points ensuring that the smallest altitude is ( m_a ). 7. **Verify construction feasibility:** - Ensure the largest side ( 1 / m_a < 1 / m_b + 1 / (m_a + m_b) ). - Simplify this inequality to: [ left(frac{m_a}{m_b}right)^2 + left(frac{m_a}{m_b}right) > 1 ] - Or alternatively, [ left(frac{m_a}{m_b} + frac{1}{2}right)^2 > frac{5}{4} ] - This ensures that the ratio condition is achieved for the given segments. 8. **Conclusion:** By following the steps and verifying the provided ratios and conditions, we construct the desired triangle that fits the given conditions for altitudes.

Since \\"the median score of the 6 exams is 76 points\\", it means one of the remaining scores is higher than 76 points, and the other is lower than 76 points, because 148 div 2 = 74 points.

The number of gaps between 11 numbers is 10 (since there is one less gap than the number of numbers). So, we calculate the range as follows: Range = Largest number - Smallest number Range = 43 - 10 Range = 33 Now, we divide the range by the number of gaps to find the difference between each consecutive pair of numbers: Difference = Range / Number of gaps Difference = 33 / 10 Difference = 3.3 Since the difference between each pair of numbers must be a whole number (because we are dealing with exact divisibility), the closest whole number to 3.3 that would result in a sequence of 11 numbers is 3.

The average daily production over these n days was 60 units, so we can write: T/n = 60 This means that the total production over n days was: T = 60n Now, let's consider the production after today, when the company produced 90 units. The new average is 62 units over n+1 days. So, the new total production is: T + 90 = 62(n + 1) We can substitute the expression for T from the first equation into this new equation: 60n + 90 = 62n + 62 Now, let's solve for n: 90 - 62 = 62n - 60n 28 = 2n n = 14 So, the number of days is n = 14.

Consider the expression ((1-a)(1-b)(1-c)(1-d)). Since (0 < a, b, c, d < 1), each term ((1-a), (1-b), (1-c), (1-d)) is positive and less than 1. Therefore, the product of these terms is also positive: [ (1-a)(1-b)(1-c)(1-d) > 0 ] 3.

There are typically two types of statements to consider when determining the truthfulness: 1. If a person is telling the truth. 2. If a person is lying. Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Consider the statement if the person is truthful:** - If the Transylvanian is telling the truth, this means he has really lost his mind. - But a person who has lost their mind cannot make a truthful statement about their condition. 2. **Consider the statement if the person is lying:** - If the Transylvanian is lying, it means he has not lost his mind. - Therefore, he is in a rational state. From this analysis, it can be deduced that there is an inherent contradiction if the person were telling the truth. Therefore, for the statement to hold logically, the person must be lying, which means the Transylvanian is rational. 3. **Compare with the previous problem:** - In the previous problem, we recognize the type of the Transylvanian was different due to a differing logical structure or content of the statement.

This line is called the common perpendicular or the shortest line that connects the two skew lines. To understand why this is the case, let's elaborate on the reasoning behind the correct answer: 1. **Existence**: We first need to prove that there exists at least one line that is perpendicular to both skew lines. To do this, we can imagine a plane that contains one of the skew lines and is perpendicular to the other skew line. The perpendicular from any point on the included skew line to the other skew line lies in this plane. The locus of all such perpendiculars is a straight line in this plane. Therefore, there is at least one line – the common perpendicular – that is perpendicular to both skew lines. 2. **Uniqueness**: Next, we must show that there is only one such line. Assume for contradiction that there were two different lines L_1 and L_2 that were both perpendicular to the two skew lines. Draw a segment from a point on L_1 to a point on L_2; this segment would form a \\"box\\" or a rectangular prism together with parts of the skew lines and L_1 and L_2. The segment between L_1 and L_2 would be a transversal of two sides of a rectangle formed with parts of the skew lines, violating the right angle, thus contradicting the assumption that both lines are perpendicular to the skew lines.

Because (CN = CN) and (DH = HC = CN), we note that (triangle CHN) is isosceles: [ |CN| = |CH| = r. ] 5. The Power of a Point theorem tells us that because (M) is equidistant from (CD) with respect to circles (Gamma_1) and (Gamma_2), the following relationship holds: [ MN cdot MH = MC cdot MD. ] 6. Since (CD) is the perpendicular bisector of (AB) and (gamma_2), (M) is equidistant from (N) and (C), so (M) is the midpoint of (NC): [ MN = MC. ] 7. Knowing that (M) is the midpoint of (NC): [ MN = MC. ] 8. The radical axis theorem also suggests that (K), which lies on both (AC) and the radical axis of (Gamma_1) and (Gamma_2), must imply that the points (C), (N), (A), and (L) are concyclic. 9.

First, we start by comparing each term of the sum with another term to establish an inequality. Recall the inequality: [frac{1}{k(k+1)} = frac{1}{k} - frac{1}{k+1}] 3. We rewrite each term of the form (frac{1}{k^2}) and compare to (frac{1}{k(k+1)}): [frac{1}{k^2} < frac{1}{k(k-1)} = frac{1}{k} - frac{1}{k+1} text{ for } k geq 2.] 4.

The trough is full of water and we need to tilt it such that (frac{1}{6}) of the water (one-sixth) is poured out. 2. **Initial Setup:** The area of (triangle ABC) corresponds to the complete volume of the water in the trough. When the trough is tilted by an angle (alpha), the new water surface line intersects the original triangle creating a smaller triangle ( triangle AFC ). The objective is to find the angle (alpha) such that the area of ( triangle AFC ) is (frac{1}{5}) times the area of ( triangle ABC ), because (frac{1}{6}) of the water is poured out, leaving (frac{5}{6}) inside. 3. **Area Calculation:** ( T_{ABC} = frac{a cdot m}{2} ), where ( m ) is the height from vertex ( C ) to base ( AB ) of the equilateral triangle, ( a ) is the side length. We need the area of ( triangle AFC ) to be (frac{1}{5} times T_{ABC} ): [ T_{AFC} = frac{AF cdot m}{2} = frac{1}{5} times frac{a cdot m}{2} ] From above, solving for ( AF ): [ AF = frac{a}{5} ] 4. **Geometry and Height Adjustment:** Denote ( T ) as the foot of the perpendicular from ( C ) to ( AB ).

However, upon examining the definitions, we see that while all irrational numbers are indeed non-terminating decimals, not all non-terminating decimals are irrational. For instance, frac{1}{6}, while it has a non-terminating representation as a decimal, is actually a rational number because it can be expressed as a fraction of integers. Therefore, the original reasoning has a faulty assumption—the implication is not bidirectional. Just because a number is a non-terminating decimal does not automatically mean it is irrational, as irrationality also entails non-repeatability and not being expressible as a fraction of two integers. The reasoning style attempts to be deductive by applying a general principle (Premise 1) to a specific case (Premise 2) to draw a conclusion. A valid deductive reasoning guarantees the truth of the conclusion if the premises are true.

Taking into account the gravitational force, calculate the speed of the train when it completely crosses the bridge in 60 seconds.","completion":"To calculate the speed of the train when it completely crosses the bridge, we need to consider the total distance the train has to travel to clear the bridge. Since the train is 500 m long and the bridge is 350 m long, the train will have to travel a distance equal to the sum of its own length and the length of the bridge to completely clear it. Total distance to clear the bridge = Length of train + Length of bridge Total distance to clear the bridge = 500 m + 350 m Total distance to clear the bridge = 850 m The train takes 60 seconds to completely cross the bridge. To find the speed of the train, we use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time Given that the distance is 850 m and the time is 60 seconds, we can calculate the speed as follows: Speed = 850 m / 60 s Speed = 14.1667 m/s (rounded to four decimal places) This is the speed of the train when it completely crosses the bridge, not taking into account the gravitational force. However, since the bridge is inclined at 5 degrees, the gravitational force will have an effect on the train's speed. The component of the gravitational force acting along the bridge will either slow down or speed up the train depending on whether the train is going uphill or downhill. To calculate the effect of gravity, we would need to know whether the train is moving uphill or downhill and the mass of the train to determine the force of gravity along the incline.

Now let's calculate the earnings for each task. For Task A: - He gets paid 30/hour for the first 40 hours. - He worked a total of 42 hours on Task A, so he gets paid 40 hours * 30/hour = 1200 for the first 40 hours. - For the remaining 2 hours, he gets paid an additional 50%, so his hourly rate for those hours is 30 + (50% of 30) = 30 + 15 = 45/hour. - For the 2 hours above 40 hours, he earns 2 hours * 45/hour = 90. - The total earnings for Task A is 1200 + 90 = 1290.

Further, we get the equations of PA: y = frac{1}{2}x_{1}x - frac{x_{1}^2}{4} and PB: y = frac{1}{2}x_{2}x - frac{x_{2}^2}{4}. By solving these two equations, we find the point P(frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}, frac{x_{1}x_{2}}{4}). 1. Since P is on l, frac{x_{1}x_{2}}{4} = -1. Therefore, k_{PA} cdot k_{PB} = frac{1}{2}x_{1} cdot frac{1}{2}x_{2} = frac{x_{1}x_{2}}{4} = -1, which means PA perp PB. Thus, alpha is a sufficient condition for beta. 2.

Each of these equations has 3 solutions (since (x^3 = 1) has three complex solutions: (1, omega, omega^2) where (omega) is a primitive cube root of unity). Therefore, there are (3^2 = 9) solutions for each sub-case, giving a total of (18) solutions in this case. - **Case 2: None of (a, b, c, d) is zero.** - Dividing the equations (a^2b = -c^2d) and (ab^2 = -cd^2) gives: [ frac{a}{b} = frac{c}{d} = k quad text{for some nonzero } k ] - This implies (a = kb) and (c = kd).

However, substituting (k = 1, omega, omega^2) into the equations (a = kb) and (c = kd) does not yield any new solutions beyond those already counted in Case 1.

This leaves at most 4 stars (since there are fewer than 7). - Place remaining stars in columns of rows we haven't picked to avoid each column containing all stars. By this step, since there are less than 4 stars left, placing them such a way to fulfill our requirement is impossible without causing a column to contain all stars. **Step 2**: Assume no row has more than 2 stars: - If we have fewer than 7 stars, they must be placed in such a way that no row or column contains all the stars.

The minimization of distance d_1 occurs when P is closest to the y-axis. This happens when P coincides with F because the distance along the focal width is the shortest.

The requirement is that the last advertisement must be a PSA, and the two PSAs cannot be broadcast consecutively. How many different broadcasting sequences are there?","completion":"To solve this problem, we first consider the arrangement of the 3 commercial advertisements and 1 PSA (since the last advertisement must be a PSA, we only need to arrange the remaining 1 PSA with the commercial advertisements). There are 4 slots in which we can place the advertisements, and we need to choose 1 slot for the PSA. This can be done in binom{4}{1} = 4 ways. Next, we arrange the 3 commercial advertisements in the remaining 3 slots. There are 3! = 6 ways to do this. Therefore, the total number of different broadcasting sequences is 4 times 6 = 24. However, this calculation does not meet the requirement that the last advertisement must be a PSA. Since we have already placed the last advertisement as a PSA, the calculation above mistakenly includes sequences where the PSAs could be consecutive, which is not allowed. To correct this, we should consider the correct arrangement of the 3 commercial advertisements and 2 PSAs with the restriction that the PSAs cannot be consecutive and the last advertisement must be a PSA. Given these conditions, we can place the first PSA in the gaps between the commercial advertisements or before all of them. There are 3 commercial advertisements, creating 4 possible positions for the first PSA (before the first commercial, between the first and second, between the second and third, or after the third commercial but before the final PSA). Thus, the correct number of different broadcasting sequences is 4 times 3! = 4 times 6 = 24. However, this contradicts the provided solution, which states the answer is 36. Upon reevaluation, it's clear that the initial approach was incorrect because it did not fully account for the restrictions on PSA placement.

We have 4 slots (formed by the 3 commercial ads) to place 1 PSA, and then arrange the 3 commercial ads in the remaining slots. This scenario was not accurately described in the initial explanation.

To prove x > g(x) > f(x) for x in (0, pi), we need to show two inequalities: 1. **For x > g(x):** Let G(x) = x - g(x) = x - sin x. We find the derivative to check monotonicity: [ G'(x) = 1 - cos x. ] Since x in (0, pi), we have -1 < cos x < 1, which implies 0 < 1 - cos x < 2. Therefore, G'(x) > 0, indicating G(x) is monotonically increasing. Since G(0) = 0, for x > 0, G(x) > 0. Thus, x - sin x > 0, proving x > g(x). 2. **For g(x) > f(x):** Let F(x) = g(x) - f(x) = sin x - xcos x. We find the derivative to check monotonicity: [ F'(x) = cos x - cos x + xsin x = xsin x. ] Since x in (0, pi), sin x > 0, implying F'(x) > 0. Therefore, F(x) is monotonically increasing. Since F(0) = 0, for x > 0, F(x) > 0. Thus, sin x - xcos x > 0, proving g(x) > f(x). In conclusion, for x in (0, pi) and a=1, we have proven that x > g(x) > f(x). # Part (2) Finding the Range of a: Given frac{f(x)}{g(x)} < frac{sin x}{x}, we analyze the inequality: 1. **Transforming the Inequality:** We consider H(x) = frac{sin x}{x} - frac{xcos x}{asin x}. Since H(x) is an even function, we focus on x in (0, pi). 2. **Analysis for a > 0:** - For 0 < a < 1, we find that asin^2 x - x^2cos x < ax^2 - x^2cos x = x^2(a - cos x). Since a - cos x changes sign in (0, pi), there exists an interval where asin^2 x - x^2cos x < 0, contradicting the assumption. - For a geq 1, we have asin^2 x - x^2cos x geq sin^2 x - x^2cos x. The derivative analysis shows that sin^2 x - x^2cos x is monotonically increasing, and since it's positive at x=0, it remains positive for x in (0, pi).

Thus, ( g(2) = 3 ). 3. **Recursive relation:** For ( n geq 2 ), any sequence of length ( n ) that does not have two heads in succession can either: - Begin with a ( T ) (followed by any sequence of length ( n-1 ) that does not have two heads in succession), contributing ( g(n-1) ) sequences. - Begin with ( HT ) (followed by any sequence of length ( n-2 ) that does not have two heads in succession), contributing ( g(n-2) ) sequences. Therefore, the recursive relation is: [ g(n) = g(n-1) + g(n-2) ] 4. **Recognize the Fibonacci sequence:** The recursive relation ( g(n) = g(n-1) + g(n-2) ) with initial conditions ( g(1) = 2 ) and ( g(2) = 3 ) is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, ( g(n) = F_{n+2} ), where ( F_n ) is the ( n )-th Fibonacci number. 5. **Calculate ( g(10) ):** We need to find ( g(10) ), which corresponds to ( F_{12} ) in the Fibonacci sequence. The first few Fibonacci numbers are: [ F_1 = 1, quad F_2 = 1, quad F_3 = 2, quad F_4 = 3, quad F_5 = 5, quad F_6 = 8, quad F_7 = 13, quad F_8 = 21, quad F_9 = 34, quad F_{10} = 55, quad F_{11} = 89, quad F_{12} = 144 ] Thus, ( g(10) = F_{12} = 144 ). 6. **Total number of sequences:** The total number of sequences of length 10 is ( 2^{10} = 1024 ). 7. **Probability calculation:** The number of sequences where two heads are NOT in succession is ( g(10) = 144 ). Therefore, the number of sequences where two heads ARE in succession is: [ 1024 - 144 = 880 ] The probability that two heads will turn up in succession is: [ frac{880}{1024} = 1 - frac{144}{1024} = 1 - frac{9}{64} = frac{55}{64} ] The final answer is (boxed{frac{55}{64}})."},{"prompt":"We have a modified deck of 60 cards, with 4 cards in each of 15 ranks.

The total number of words is the sum over all valid values of k (0 to 3): sum_{k=0}^3 binom{5}{k} times 3^k times 5^{5-k} Calculating each term: - For k=0: binom{5}{0} times 3^0 times 5^5 = 1 times 1 times 3125 = 3125 - For k=1: binom{5}{1} times 3^1 times 5^4 = 5 times 3 times 625 = 9375 - For k=2: binom{5}{2} times 3^2 times 5^3 = 10 times 9 times 125 = 11250 - For k=3: binom{5}{3} times 3^3 times 5^2 = 10 times 27 times 25 = 6750 Adding these, we get 3125 + 9375 + 11250 + 6750 = boxed{31450}."},{"prompt":"On a blackboard, there are ( n ) consecutive positive integers starting from 1.

After erasing one number, the average of the remaining ( n-1 ) numbers is given as: [ 36 frac{2}{5} = frac{182}{5} ] 3. The sum of the first ( n ) consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: [ S = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] 4. If we erase the number ( x ), the sum of the remaining ( n-1 ) numbers is: [ S - x = frac{n(n+1)}{2} - x ] 5. The average of these ( n-1 ) numbers is: [ frac{S - x}{n-1} = 36 frac{2}{5} ] 6.

(а)** We need to demonstrate the arrangement of (N) points such that (N) is an arbitrary integer greater than 2 on a plane, where not all these points lie on the same line, and all pairwise distances between these points are expressed as integers. We will even provide two such configurations. 1. **First Configuration**: It is not difficult to verify directly that if x = 2uv, quad y = |u^2 - v^2|, quad z = u^2 + v^2 Then, x^2 + y^2 = z^2 Utilizing these formulas, it is not difficult to find (N-2) triples of integers x_1, y_1, z_1; quad x_2, y_2, z_2; ,ldots,quad x_{N-2}, y_{N-2}, z_{N-2} satisfying the condition ((**)) such that (x_1 = x_2 = ldots = x_{N-2}).newline Suppose (k) is any multiple of (N-2) integers (1, 2, 3, ldots, N-2). We then sequentially substitute into the formulas (*) begin{gathered} u = 1, quad v = k u = 2, quad v = frac{k}{2} u = 3, quad v = frac{k}{3} ,ldots,quad u = N-2, quad v = frac{k}{N-2} end{gathered} This leads us to (N-2) triples (x_1, y_1, z_1; quad x_2, y_2, z_2; ,ldots,quad x_{N-2}, y_{N-2}, z_{N-2}) of integers meeting ((**)) where (x_1 = x_2 = ldots = x_{N-2} = 2k). Next, on some straight line (RS) on the plane, select an arbitrary point (O) and additional (n = N-2) points (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n) equidistant from (O) at distances (y_1, y_2, ldots, y_n). On the perpendicular line (OP) to the line (RS) at point (O), mark the point (P) at the distance (x = 2k) units away from (O) (see figure (103, a)). It’s evident that (N) points (P, O, A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{N-2}) will have the property that all pairwise distances among them are integers. 2. **Second Configuration**: Utilizing the same formulas (*) left(frac{2uv}{u^2+v^2}right)^2 + left(frac{u^2-v^2}{u^2+v^2}right)^2 = 1 We can easily find (N) points (R, S, A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{N-2} = A_n) situated on a circle of diameter (RS = 1) such that all distances (A_1R, A_2R, ldots, A_nR, A_1S, A_2S, ldots, A_nS) are rational numbers. For this, we need to choose (n = N-2) pairs of rational (e.g., integers) (u_1, v_1; t_2, v_2; ldots; u_n, v_n) integers as pairs: A_iR = frac{2u_iv_i}{u_i^2+v_i^2},quad text{and} quad A_iS = frac{u_i^2-v_i^2}{u_i^2+v_i^2} This shows that every pair of distances between our points will also be rational. **109. (б)**: Now let's show that an infinite number of points, not all of which lie on the same line, cannot possess the property that all pairwise distances between them are integers. Let's show that it’s not possible to have infinitely many points where all distances are integral and finite for three non-collinear points (O, P,) and (Q). Let: PO=m quad text{and} quad QO=n where (m) and (n) are integers. Denote (A) as any point equidistant from (O, P,) and (Q) at integral distances (see figure 104). According to the triangle inequality, |AP-AO| le PO = m quad text{and} quad |AQ-AO| le Q O=n Since all distances are integers, the possible values of (|AP-AO|) and (|AQ-AO|) can be (2m + 1) and (2n+1) entities respectively. Suppose, AP-AO = k quad text{and} quad AQ-AO = l where (A) can only have two distinct positions. Hence, there can be no more than (2(2m+1)(2n+1)) points (A) equidistant from the three fixed points (O, P, Q) within integers (k) and (l).

This is considered a medium difficulty problem. **Solution** Let the equation of the ellipse E be frac{{x}^{2}}{{a}^{2}}+ frac{{y}^{2}}{{b}^{2}}=1. According to the problem, PF_2 perp F_1F_2, Thus, the x-coordinate of point P is x=c. Substituting into the equation of the ellipse, we get y= frac{{b}^{2}}{{a}^{2}}. Since tan ∠PF_1F_2= frac{2 sqrt{5}}{15}, we have frac{ frac{{b}^{2}}{a}}{2c}= frac{2 sqrt{5}}{15}. Simplifying, we get frac{16}{45}= frac{{b}^{4}}{{a}^{2}{c}^{2}} (1), Given that {b}^{2}={a}^{2}-{c}^{2} and e= frac{c}{a}, equation (1) simplifies to 45{e}^{4}-106{e}^{2}+45=0, Solving this, we find {e}^{2}= frac{9}{5} or {e}^{2}= frac{5}{9}, Since the eccentricity of an ellipse is less than 1, we have {e}^{2}= frac{5}{9}, Therefore, e= frac{ sqrt{5}}{3}.

Could it be possible for all unoccupied squares to be: a) red b) blue?","completion":"1. **Understanding the conditions for coloring squares**: - A square on the chessboard will be colored **red** if the rooks attacking that square are at the same distance from it. - Conversely, a square will be colored **blue** if the rooks attacking it are at different distances. 2. **Problem (a): Can all empty squares be colored red?** To achieve all squares being colored red, the attacking rooks on each of those empty squares must be equidistant. **Illustration**: - Let's position the six rooks on the main diagonal of a 6 times 6 chessboard. For such a setup: - Place the rooks at (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), and (6,6). - In this configuration, every rook is positioned such that no two rooks attack each other. **Verification**: - For any empty square not on the main diagonal: - Suppose an empty square is at position (i,j) with i neq j. - The possible attacking rooks for this square are positioned such that the distances horizontally and vertically are equal since they come from the main diagonal at equal spaced positions. These distances will be the same along different attack lines (diagonals). Hence, every empty square will indeed have rooks attacking it from equidistant positions, leading to all empty squares being colored red in this arrangement. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{a} ] 3. **Problem (b): Can all empty squares be colored blue?** To achieve all squares being colored blue, the attacking rooks on each of those empty squares must be at different distances. **Illustration**: - Position the six rooks such that they don't attack each other, and they do not follow a pattern where the distances are identical. For example: - Place rooks at distinct positions like (1,2), (2,4), (3,6), (4,1), (5,3), (6,5) such that distances between attacking squares will vary. **Verification**: - Consider any empty square not occupied by a rook. - Take an empty square at (i,j) which isn't occupied. - Check the distance of all possible attackers: - The vertical and horizontal distances to potentially attacking rooks should vary, thus ensuring no symmetry in distance. Because the distances vary, all empty squares would be colored blue as per the rule. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{b} ] # Conclusion: Thus, it is possible for all empty squares on the chessboard to be either entirely red or entirely blue with appropriate placement of the non-attacking rooks.

Let (D), (E), and (F) be the points on medians (AN), (BK), and (CM) respectively that divide each median in the ratio (1:3) when counting from the vertices (A), (B), and (C). The centroid (O) is the point of intersection of the medians. 2. **Set Up the Relationships**: Since (D) divides (AN) in the ratio (1:3), let [AD = x quad text{and} quad DN = 3x.] Hence, [AN = AD + DN = x + 3x = 4x.] 3. **Calculate Lengths Involving the Centroid**: The centroid divides each median in a ratio of (2:1) from the vertex to the opposite side. Therefore, [AO = frac{2}{3}AN = frac{2}{3} times 4x = frac{8}{3}x.] The segment (OD) (from (O) to (D)) can be calculated as: [OD = AO - AD = frac{8}{3}x - x = frac{8}{3}x - frac{3}{3}x = frac{5}{3}x.] 4. **Ratio of Similarity**: Since (D) lies on (AN) and comparison point is (O), [frac{OD}{OA} = frac{frac{5}{3}x}{frac{8}{3}x} = frac{5}{8}.] 5. **Triangles are Similar**: Based on the equal proportional divisions by the medians, the smaller triangle (DEF) is similar to the original triangle (ABC), and their sides are in the ratio ( frac{5}{8} ). 6. **Areas Ratio**: For similar triangles, the ratio of the areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, [ left(frac{S_{ABC}}{S_{DEF}}right) = left(frac{8}{5}right)^2 = left(frac{8}{5}right)^2 = frac{64}{25} = 2.56. ] Hence, the area of triangle (DEF) is (frac{1}{2.56}) times the area of triangle (ABC), meaning the original triangle (ABC) is 2.56 times larger than triangle (DEF). 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the area of triangle (DEF) is (frac{1}{2.56}) of the area of triangle (ABC).

The product of these four numbers is given by: [ n(n+2)(n+4)(n+6) = a^2 ] where ( a ) is an integer, specifically an odd integer. 3. To simplify this product, we first pair ( n ) with ( n+6 ) and ( n+2 ) with ( n+4 ): [ n(n+6) cdot (n+2)(n+4) ] 4. Simplify each pair: [ n(n+6) = n^2 + 6n ] [ (n+2)(n+4) = n^2 + 6n + 8 ] Thus, the product becomes: [ (n^2 + 6n)(n^2 + 6n + 8) = a^2 ] 5. Let ( x = n^2 + 6n ). Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as: [ x(x+8) = a^2 ] [ x^2 + 8x = a^2 ] 6. We need to complete the square on the left-hand side: [ x^2 + 8x + 16 = a^2 + 16 ] [ (x + 4)^2 = a^2 + 16 ] 7.

Considering the sequence of perfect squares: [ 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 ] The difference of two squares equal to 16 is: [ 16 = 25 - 9 ] 9.

This implies: [ n^3 + 1 = k(mn - 1) text{ for some integer } k. ] Simplifying this, we get: [ n^3 + 1 = kmn - k. ] Rearranging for clarity: [ n^3 + k = kmn - 1, ] which means: [ n^3 + 1 equiv 0 pmod{mn - 1}. ] 2. **Factorizing and Simplifying:** We recognize ( n^3 + 1 ) can be factored: [ n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1). ] Therefore: [ (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1) equiv 0 pmod{mn-1}. ] 3. **Case Analysis:** We analyze different values of ( n ) to see if ( n^3 + 1 ) being divisible by ( mn - 1 ) reveals patterns or solutions. **Case 1: ( n = 1 )** [ n = 1 implies frac{1^3 + 1}{m cdot 1 - 1} = frac{2}{m-1}. ] For ( frac{2}{m-1} ) to be an integer, ( m-1 ) must be a divisor of 2.

This means that the function repeats its values every 4 units along the x-axis. 2. **Odd Function Property**: An odd function satisfies the property f(-x)=-f(x). This property, combined with the periodicity, suggests that we should look for functions that are symmetric with respect to the origin and repeat their pattern every 4 units. 3. **Monotonically Decreasing on (0,1)**: For a function to be monotonically decreasing on the interval (0,1), its derivative (if it exists) should be negative within this interval. This means that as x increases from 0 to 1, f(x) decreases. 4. **Choice of Function**: Considering the above conditions, we choose a trigonometric function that is odd, has the appropriate period, and is decreasing on (0,1). The sine function, sin(x), is an odd function. To match the period of 4, we adjust the argument of the sine function. The standard period of sin(x) is 2pi, so to have a period of 4, we use sinleft(frac{pi}{2}xright). However, sinleft(frac{pi}{2}xright) is increasing on (0,1).

First, let's find the time for one full revolution: The searchlight makes 2 revolutions per minute. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide 60 by 2 to find the time for one revolution: 60 seconds / 2 revolutions = 30 seconds per revolution Now, let's consider the 5-second interval in which the man could stay in the dark. Since the searchlight takes 30 seconds to complete one revolution, it means that the light covers 360 degrees in 30 seconds. To find out how many degrees the light covers in 5 seconds, we calculate: (5 seconds / 30 seconds) * 360 degrees = 1/6 * 360 degrees = 60 degrees This means that in 5 seconds, the searchlight covers 60 degrees out of the 360 degrees in a full circle. The remaining degrees where the man could be in the dark is: 360 degrees - 60 degrees = 300 degrees Now, we can calculate the probability that the man will stay in the dark for at least 5 seconds. The probability is the ratio of the dark degrees to the total degrees in a circle: Probability = (Dark degrees) / (Total degrees) Probability = 300 degrees / 360 degrees Probability = 5/6 Therefore, the probability that a man appearing near the tower will stay in the dark for at least 5 seconds is boxed{5/6} or approximately 83.33%."},{"prompt":"A train 100 meters long takes 16.665333439991468 seconds to cross a bridge of a certain length if the speed of the train is 54 kmph.

The conversion factor from kmph to m/s is: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 54 kmph * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) = 15 m/s Now, we know the train is 100 meters long and it takes 16.665333439991468 seconds to cross the bridge at a speed of 15 m/s. The distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge is the length of the train plus the length of the bridge. We can calculate this distance using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge is: Distance = 15 m/s * 16.665333439991468 seconds = 249.97999909987152 meters Since the distance covered includes the length of the train, we need to subtract the length of the train to find the length of the bridge: Length of the bridge = Distance covered - Length of the train Length of the bridge = 249.97999909987152 meters - 100 meters = 149.97999909987152 meters Therefore, the length of the bridge is approximately boxed{149.98} meters."},{"prompt":"James decides to buy supplies for his class from an international online store.

The tangent line from point P(-1,0) to this circle has the equation y=k(x+1). The distance from the point P to the center of the circle, using the distance formula, equals the radius, which leads to the equation for k: [ d = frac{|2k+k|}{sqrt{1+k^{2}}} = 2. ] Solving for k, we get: [ k = pmfrac{2sqrt{5}}{5}. ] Since we are given k_{n} > 0, it follows that: [ k_{2} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}. ] Therefore, option A is correct. **Option B and C:** Let the tangent line l_{n} be y=k_{n}(x+1).

This is necessary because if they did, any nonnegative linear combination of these vectors would fall on the same side of the ((n-1))-dimensional subspace, failing to cover the entire (mathbb{Z}^n) lattice. 3. **Second condition necessity:** The second condition states that the largest common divisor of the (n times n) minor determinants of the matrix ((a_1, ldots, a_m)) is 1.

It follows that ( K ) also has a nonempty intersection with (mathbb{R}_{>0}^m), i.e., there exists a vector ( k in K subseteq mathbb{Z}^m ) such that all its coordinates are strictly positive. 9. **Constructing nonnegative combinations:** For any vector ( v in mathbb{Z}^n ), take any preimage ( w in mathbb{Z}^m ) such that ( f(w) = v ).

If we denote the line segments connecting vertices within the rectangle facades as p and q, which are perpendicular to PR and QR, respectively, we will show that the facets' planes form specific symmetrical and arranged patterns. 3. **Symmetry Considerations:** By reflecting setup structures on planes through certain midpoints, specifically line segments through points and perpendiculars, we see the alignment properties where each segment p and q is symmetrical about the bisected plane F. This reflection analysis shows that triangle R must indeed lay congruently across bisected facets. 4. **Convex Polyhedron Type Confirmation:** Given no vertices extend beyond necessary perpendicular alignments, it confirms the structure aligns precisely within constrained vertex pathways, ensuring each face appropriately connects via symmetrical and perpendicular edges. 5. **Geometric Decomposition:** For any given triangular facet H: - When H is perpendicular to S_1, triangles form by their edges symmetrically across S_1 and S_2. - Develop the entire polyhedron surface around a single-centered equilateral triangle, adjusting such that the perpendicular distances measure appropriate values. 6. **Volumetric Calculation:** For comprehensive scenarios: - Denote a possible n count of vertices in S_2. - Establish parameters where these vertices form polygons with each side uniquely described by spatially required facets. Let: - Area of a facet segment f_n = frac{n}{4} cdot cot left(frac{pi}{n} right). - Partial volumetric slices calculated via distances and integrals suitably adapted to x distance integrals formulating shape sections contributing to total volume.

The axis of symmetry of the parabola makes an angle theta with the x-axis such that tantheta = frac{1}{3}. 2. **Rotate the coordinate system**: We use costheta = frac{sqrt{10}}{10} and sintheta = frac{3}{sqrt{10}} for the rotation.

We can write this relationship as: Work = People × Days For the original group: Work = P × D For the doubled group doing half the work: 1/2 Work = 2P × 3 Since the work done by the original group is equal to twice the work done by the doubled group (because they do half the work), we can set up the equation: P × D = 2 × (2P × 3) Now, we can solve for D: P × D = 4P × 3 D = (4P × 3) / P D = 4 × 3 D = 12 So, it takes the original number of people boxed{12} days to do the work."},{"prompt":"Dave was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry a certain number of trays at a time. He had to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another. He made 8 trips. How many trays can Dave carry at a time?","completion":"To find out how many trays Dave can carry at a time, we need to add the total number of trays he picked up and then divide that number by the number of trips he made. Dave picked up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another table, so the total number of trays is: 17 trays + 55 trays = 72 trays Dave made 8 trips to pick up all the trays, so we divide the total number of trays by the number of trips to find out how many trays he can carry at a time: 72 trays ÷ 8 trips = 9 trays per trip Therefore, Dave can carry boxed{9} trays at a time."},{"prompt":"What is the area of a triangle with a base of 12 m and a height of 5 m?","completion":"The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: Area = (base * height) / 2 Plugging in the given values: Area = (12 m * 5 m) / 2 Area = 60 m² / 2 Area = 30 m² So, the area of the triangle is boxed{30} square meters."},{"prompt":"Given the set A={x|x(x1)=0}, then ( ) A: 0 in A B: 1 notin A C: 1 in A D: 0 notin A","completion":"From x(x-1)=0, we get x=0 or x=1, Therefore, A={0,1}, Thus, 0 in A, Hence, the correct choice is boxed{text{A}}."},{"prompt":"f the solution set of the inequality ax^2+bx+c>0 is {x|2<x<4}, then for the function f(x)=ax^2+bx+c, we should have A: f(5)<f(2)<f(1) B: f(1)<f(5)<f(2) C: f(2)<f(1)<f(5) D: f(5)<f(1)<f(2)","completion":"Since the solution set of the inequality ax^2+bx+c>0 is {x|-2<x<4}, it follows that a<0, and -2 and 4 are the two real roots of ax^2+bx+c=0. Thus, -2+4=-frac{b}{a}, and -2 times 4=frac{c}{a}. For the function f(x)=ax^2+bx+c=a(x^2-2x-8)=a(x-1)^2-9a (where a<0), the parabola opens downwards and is symmetric about the line x=1. Therefore, f(-1)=f(3), and f(2)>f(3)>f(5). Hence, f(2)>f(-1)>f(5). The correct choice is: boxed{text{D}}. The solution set of the inequality ax^2+bx+c>0 being {x|-2<x<4} implies a<0, and -2 and 4 are the two real roots of ax^2+bx+c=0.

This question tests the understanding of the graph and properties of quadratic functions, the relationship between roots and coefficients, and examines reasoning and computational skills. It is considered a medium-level question."},{"prompt":"Juan rolls a fair regular octahedral die marked with the numbers 1 through 8 . Then Amal rolls a fair sixsided die.
