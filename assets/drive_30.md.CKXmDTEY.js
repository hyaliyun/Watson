To find the minimum size of a vertex cover, we can use the fact that the size of a maximum matching is a lower bound for the size of a minimum vertex cover. This is due to König\'s theorem for bipartite graphs, and it also holds for general graphs. In this case, we have a graph G with 7 vertices and 11 edges. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 7 vertices is given by the formula: max_edges = n(n-1)/2 = 7(7-1)/2 = 21 Since the graph has 11 edges, it is not a complete graph, and we cannot guarantee that there is a perfect matching. However, we can try to find an upper bound for the size of a maximum matching. Let M be the size of a maximum matching in G. Since each edge in the matching is incident to two distinct vertices, there can be at most 7/2 = 3.5 edges in the matching. Since M must be an integer, we have M ≤ 3. Now, by the aforementioned relationship between the size of a maximum matching and the size of a minimum vertex cover, we know that the minimum size of a vertex cover is at least equal to the size of a maximum matching.

The brute force algorithm involves checking all possible subsets of vertices, starting with the smallest subsets (i.e., subsets with only one vertex) and moving up to larger subsets until a vertex cover is found. For a graph with 8 vertices, there are 2^8 = 256 possible subsets of vertices. We will start by checking the subsets with only one vertex, then move on to subsets with two vertices, and so on, until we find a vertex cover. 1. Subsets with 1 vertex: There are 8 possible subsets with only one vertex, but none of these can be a vertex cover since the graph has 12 edges, and a single vertex can cover at most its degree number of edges. 2. Subsets with 2 vertices: There are C(8,2) = 28 possible subsets with two vertices. However, since the graph has 12 edges, it is impossible for a vertex cover to have only two vertices, as each vertex can cover at most its degree number of edges, and the sum of degrees in the graph is 2 * 12 = 24.

In other words, if we select all the vertices in the vertex cover, we can be sure that all the edges are \\"covered\\" by at least one of their endpoints. To find the minimum number of vertices needed for a vertex cover, we can use the fact that the size of a minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of a maximum matching. A matching is a set of edges in which no two edges share a common vertex. A maximum matching is a matching with the largest possible number of edges. In this case, we have a graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges. To find the size of a maximum matching, we can use the following approach: 1. Start with an empty set of edges as the current matching. 2. Find an augmenting path, which is a path that starts and ends with an unmatched vertex and alternates between matched and unmatched edges. 3. If an augmenting path is found, add the unmatched edges to the matching and remove the matched edges from the matching. This increases the size of the matching by 1. 4. Repeat steps 2-3 until no more augmenting paths can be found. Without knowing the specific structure of the graph, we cannot determine the exact size of the maximum matching. However, we can provide a lower bound and an upper bound for the size of the maximum matching. Lower bound: If the graph has a perfect matching (a matching that covers all vertices), then the size of the maximum matching is 8/2 = 4. In this case, the minimum vertex cover would also have 4 vertices. Upper bound: If the graph has no perfect matching, then the size of the maximum matching is at most (8-1)/2 = 3.5, which we round up to 4. In this case, the minimum vertex cover would have at least 4 vertices. Therefore, the minimum number of vertices needed for a vertex cover in this graph is between 4 and 8, inclusive.

The goal is to find the smallest possible vertex cover for the given graph G with 7 vertices and 12 edges. First, let\'s find the maximum degree of the graph. By the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges: Σ(deg(v)) = 2 * 12 = 24 Since there are 7 vertices, the maximum possible degree for a vertex is 6 (if it is connected to every other vertex). However, this would result in a total degree sum of 6 * 7 = 42, which is greater than 24. Therefore, the maximum degree of a vertex in G must be less than 6. Now, let\'s consider a vertex with degree 5. If we include this vertex in the vertex cover, we can cover 5 edges. To cover the remaining 7 edges, we need at least 3 more vertices (since each vertex can cover at most 2 of the remaining edges). So, a vertex cover with a vertex of degree 5 requires at least 4 vertices. If the graph has no vertex with degree 5 or higher, then the maximum degree is 4.

A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. Let\'s use the following properties to determine the number of cut vertices and bridges: 1.

In this case, n = 10, so the graph must have at least 10 - 1 = 9 edges. However, we are given that the graph has 14 edges. So, let\'s analyze the effect of removing a cut vertex on the number of edges. When we remove a cut vertex, we are essentially disconnecting the graph into two or more components. The minimum number of components that can be formed after removing a cut vertex is 2. Let\'s assume that after removing the cut vertex, the two components have x and y vertices, where x + y = 9 (since we removed one vertex from the original 10). The minimum number of edges required to connect the vertices in each component is x-1 and y-1, respectively. The total number of edges in the original graph is the sum of the edges in each component plus the edges connected to the cut vertex. Since the cut vertex connects the two components, it must have at least one edge connected to each component. Therefore, the total number of edges in the original graph is (x-1) + (y-1) + 2 = x + y.

In this case, we have: ∑(degree of vertices) = 2 * 9 = 18 Since there are 2 cut vertices, let\'s assume they are A and B. The bridge must be connecting two components of the graph, so let\'s assume it connects A and B. The degree of A and B must be at least 2, as they are cut vertices. Now, let\'s distribute the remaining degrees among the other vertices. We have: degree(A) + degree(B) + degree(C) + degree(D) + degree(E) + degree(F) + degree(G) = 18 degree(C) + degree(D) + degree(E) + degree(F) + degree(G) = 18 - degree(A) - degree(B) Since A and B are cut vertices and have at least degree 2, we can say: degree(C) + degree(D) + degree(E) + degree(F) + degree(G) = 18 - 2 - 2 = 14 Now, let\'s consider the minimum degree for the remaining vertices. Since the graph is connected, the minimum degree for each vertex is 1. However, this would only give a sum of 5, which is less than 14. Therefore, at least one of the remaining vertices must have a degree greater than 1. Let\'s assume vertex C has a degree of 2.

To find the chromatic polynomial of G, we can use the deletion-contraction formula: P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k), where G - e is the graph obtained by deleting an edge e from G, and G / e is the graph obtained by contracting an edge e in G. Let\'s choose edge e1 for the deletion-contraction formula. When we delete e1, we get a path with 5 vertices, which we\'ll call G1. When we contract e1, we get a cycle with 4 vertices, which we\'ll call G2. The chromatic polynomial of a path with n vertices is given by: P(path_n, k) = k(k - 1)^(n - 1). So, for G1 (a path with 5 vertices), we have: P(G1, k) = k(k - 1)^4. The chromatic polynomial of a cycle with n vertices is given by: P(cycle_n, k) = (k - 1)^n + (-1)^n(k - 1). So, for G2 (a cycle with 4 vertices), we have: P(G2, k) = (k - 1)^4 + (-1)^4(k - 1) = (k - 1)^4 + (k - 1).

The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper k-colorings of the graph G. Step 1: Analyze the possible structures of G Since G has 5 vertices and 6 edges, it must contain a cycle. There are two possible structures for G: a 5-cycle with an additional edge (C5 + e) or a complete graph with 5 vertices (K5). Step 2: Deletion-contraction algorithm We will use the deletion-contraction algorithm to find the chromatic polynomial for each possible structure of G. Case 1: C5 + e Let e be the additional edge in the 5-cycle. We will delete e and contract e separately. Deletion: P(C5 + e - e, k) = P(C5, k) The chromatic polynomial of a cycle with an odd number of vertices is given by P(C_n, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1). In this case, n = 5, so P(C5, k) = (k-1)^5 + (-1)^5(k-1). Contraction: P(C5 + e/e, k) = P(C4, k) When we contract e, we obtain a 4-cycle.

The chromatic polynomial of a bipartite graph is k(k-1)^{n-1}, where n is the number of vertices in the larger set. In this case, n = 4, so P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)^3. For G/e, we can see that it is a 5-cycle with an additional vertex connected to two vertices of the cycle. Let\'s call this additional vertex 6. We can compute the chromatic polynomial of G/e by considering the cases when vertex 6 has the same color as vertex 1 and when it has a different color. - If vertex 6 has the same color as vertex 1, then vertex 5 must have a different color, and we have a 4-cycle with vertices {1,3,4,5}.

Since there are 6 edges, the graph must be connected. There are two possible structures for a connected graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges: a tree with one additional edge or a cycle with one additional edge. Case 1: Tree with one additional edge A tree with 5 vertices has 4 edges. Adding one more edge creates a cycle. This graph is essentially a 5-cycle (C5) with one additional edge. The chromatic polynomial of a cycle with an odd number of vertices is P_C(k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1), where n is the number of vertices and k is the number of colors. In this case, n = 5, so the chromatic polynomial of the 5-cycle is P_C5(k) = (k-1)^5 + (k-1). Now, we need to account for the additional edge. Let\'s call the vertices of the 5-cycle A, B, C, D, and E, and the additional edge connects vertices A and C. Since A and C are already connected by an edge in the 5-cycle, adding this edge does not change the chromatic polynomial. Therefore, the chromatic polynomial of the graph G in this case is P_G(k) = P_C5(k) = (k-1)^5 + (k-1).

In a connected graph, each vertex must have a degree of at least 1, as it must be connected to at least one other vertex. Therefore, the minimum sum of degrees for a connected graph with 10 vertices is 10. Since the sum of degrees in our graph is 30, which is greater than the minimum sum of degrees required for a connected graph (10), it is possible that the graph is connected. However, this does not guarantee that the graph is connected, as the degrees could be distributed in a way that still results in a disconnected graph. To further investigate, let\'s consider the maximum number of vertices that could be disconnected in the graph. If a vertex is disconnected, its degree is 0. If we have k disconnected vertices, the sum of degrees for the remaining connected vertices must be at least 2 * (10 - k), as each connected vertex must have a degree of at least 2 to form a connected component with the other connected vertices. For k = 1 (one disconnected vertex), the sum of degrees for the remaining connected vertices must be at least 2 * (10 - 1) = 18. Since the sum of degrees in our graph is 30, this is possible.

Now, let\'s find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. A graph is disconnected if it has at least two components. To create a disconnected graph, we can try to split the vertices into two groups such that there are no edges between the groups. One way to do this is to create two components, one with k vertices and the other with (10-k) vertices. The maximum number of edges within each component can be calculated using the formula for the maximum number of edges in a complete graph: m = (n*(n-1))/2, where n is the number of vertices.

The sum of these two values is the maximum number of edges that can exist without connecting the two components. To minimize the number of edges to remove, we want to maximize the sum of edges within the two components. We can do this by trying different values of k and finding the maximum sum.

To find the number of connected components, we can use the fact that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 2 * 10 = 20. Let\'s consider the possible connected components: 1. A single connected component with 7 vertices: In this case, the sum of the degrees would be at least 2 * (7-1) = 12, which is less than 20. Therefore, G cannot have a single connected component with 7 vertices. 2. Two connected components: In this case, one component could have 4 vertices and the other could have 3 vertices. The sum of the degrees for the 4-vertex component would be at least 2 * (4-1) = 6, and the sum of the degrees for the 3-vertex component would be at least 2 * (3-1) = 4. The total sum of the degrees would be 6 + 4 = 10, which is less than 20. Therefore, G cannot have two connected components with 4 and 3 vertices. 3. Three connected components: In this case, one component could have 3 vertices, and the other two components could have 2 vertices each. The sum of the degrees for the 3-vertex component would be at least 2 * (3-1) = 4, and the sum of the degrees for each 2-vertex component would be 2.

Thus, T_(G-e)(x, y) = x^4, and T_G(x, y) = x^4. Case 3: G has a 3-cycle and two pendant edges In this case, G has a 3-cycle with two additional edges connected to one of the vertices of the cycle. Since there are no bridges in a 3-cycle, we can remove any edge e from the cycle without disconnecting the graph. Therefore, T_G(x, y) = T_(G-e)(x, y), where G-e is a tree with five vertices and four edges. As before, the Tutte polynomial of a tree T with n vertices is given by T_T(x, y) = x^(n-1). Thus, T_(G-e)(x, y) = x^4, and T_G(x, y) = x^4. Since these are all the possible cases for a simple undirected graph G with five vertices and five edges, we can conclude that the Tutte polynomial of G is either T_G(x, y) = x^3 * y (for a 5-cycle) or T_G(x, y) = x^4 (for a 4-cycle with a pendant edge or a 3-cycle with two pendant edges)."},{"prompt":"Consider a graph G with 6 vertices (A,B,C,D,E,F) and 7 edges (AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, CD, DE).

The graph is a simple, connected, planar graph with 4 vertices and 5 edges. It is also known as the diamond graph or the kite graph. The Tutte polynomial T(G; x, y) of a graph G can be computed recursively using the following rules: 1. If G has no edges, then T(G; x, y) = x^(number of connected components of G). 2. If e is a loop in G, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y), where G - e is the graph obtained by removing the loop e from G. 3. If e is a bridge in G (i.e., removing e disconnects G), then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y), where G / e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e in G. 4. If e is neither a loop nor a bridge in G, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y). In our case, the graph has no loops, and all edges are bridges. Therefore, we can apply rule 3 to compute the Tutte polynomial. Let\'s label the edges as follows: ``` 1 /a / 2--b--3 / c/ 4 ``` We can remove and contract each edge one by one and apply rule 3: 1. Remove edge a: The graph becomes two isolated edges (2-4 and 3-1). The Tutte polynomial of this graph is x^2. 2. Contract edge a: The graph becomes a triangle (2-3-4). The Tutte polynomial of this graph is x + y. So, T(G; x, y) = x^2 + (x + y) for edge a. Now, let\'s consider edge b: 1. Remove edge b: The graph becomes a path (1-2-4-3).

This implies that the graph has 3 cycles. A simple connected graph with 5 vertices and 3 cycles is K5, the complete graph on 5 vertices. K5 has 10 edges, but our graph has only 7 edges. Therefore, we need to remove 3 edges from K5 to obtain our graph. Removing 3 edges from K5 will result in a graph with 5 vertices, 7 edges, and 2 cycles.

Substituting these values back into the previous equations, we get: T_{G/AC-AB}(x, y) = 2(x-1)^3, T_{G/AC/AB}(x, y) = 2(x-1)^3. Finally, substituting these values into the equation for T_{G/AC}(x, y), we obtain: T_{G/AC}(x, y) = 4(x-1)^3. Now, we can compute the Tutte polynomial of the original graph G: T_G(x, y) = T_{G-AC}(x, y) + T_{G/AC}(x, y) = 4(x-1)^3 + 4(x-1)^3 = 8(x-1)^3. Next, we need to substitute the variable y for the edge BD. Since the edge BD is not present in the graph, we can simply replace the variable y with 1: T_G(x, 1) = 8(x-1)^3.

In other words, a perfect matching is a way to pair up the vertices so that each vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex in the pair. For a graph to have a perfect matching, it must have an even number of vertices, which is true for our graph G with 6 vertices. However, having an even number of vertices is not a sufficient condition for the existence of a perfect matching. To determine whether there exists a perfect matching in G, we can use Hall\'s Marriage Theorem. The theorem states that a bipartite graph has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset S of one part of the bipartition, the number of vertices in the neighborhood of S (i.e., the set of vertices adjacent to at least one vertex in S) is at least as large as the number of vertices in S. Since G has 6 vertices and 9 edges, it is possible to have a bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each part. Let\'s assume G is bipartite and partition its vertices into two sets A and B, each with 3 vertices. Now, we need to check if Hall\'s condition is satisfied. Since there are 9 edges, each vertex in A must be connected to at least 3 vertices in B, and vice versa. Therefore, for any subset S of A or B with 1 vertex, there will be at least 3 vertices in the neighborhood of S, which is greater than the number of vertices in S. For any subset S of A or B with 2 vertices, there will be at least 4 vertices in the neighborhood of S, which is also greater than the number of vertices in S. Finally, for the subset S of A or B with all 3 vertices, there will be exactly 3 vertices in the neighborhood of S, which is equal to the number of vertices in S. Since Hall\'s condition is satisfied for all subsets of A and B, there exists a perfect matching in G. One such perfect matching can be obtained by pairing each vertex in A with a distinct vertex in B, as each vertex in A is connected to all vertices in B, and vice versa.

The Tutte-Berge formula states that the size of a maximum matching in a graph G is equal to: min( |V(G)| - o(G - S) + |S| ) / 2 where V(G) is the set of vertices in G, o(G - S) is the number of odd components in the subgraph G - S (i.e., the number of connected components with an odd number of vertices), and the minimum is taken over all subsets S of V(G).

In order to have a perfect matching, there must be an even number of vertices, which is the case here with 6 vertices. Now, let\'s apply the Tutte\'s theorem to determine if a perfect matching exists in this graph. Tutte\'s theorem states that a graph G has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset U of vertices in G, the number of odd components (components with an odd number of vertices) in G - U is less than or equal to |U|. Let\'s consider the worst-case scenario, where the graph is a complete graph (every vertex is connected to every other vertex). In this case, the number of edges in the graph would be C(6, 2) = 15, where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. However, our graph has only 9 edges, which means it is not a complete graph. Now, let\'s consider the case where we remove a vertex from the graph. In this case, we have 5 vertices left. The maximum number of edges in a complete graph with 5 vertices is C(5, 2) = 10. However, since our graph has only 9 edges, removing a vertex will result in a graph with fewer than 9 edges. This means that there will always be at least one vertex with a degree less than the maximum possible degree for a graph with 5 vertices, which is 4. Now, let\'s consider the case where we remove two vertices from the graph. In this case, we have 4 vertices left. The maximum number of edges in a complete graph with 4 vertices is C(4, 2) = 6. Since our graph has 9 edges, removing two vertices will result in a graph with at least 3 edges. This means that there will always be at least one component with an even number of vertices. Based on these observations, we can conclude that for every subset U of vertices in the graph, the number of odd components in the graph minus U is less than or equal to |U|.

The degree of each vertex in G is 3, meaning that each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices. First, let\'s check if a perfect matching is possible in this graph. According to Hall\'s Marriage Theorem, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a perfect matching in a bipartite graph is that for any subset S of vertices on one side of the graph, the number of vertices in the neighborhood of S (denoted as N(S)) is at least as large as the number of vertices in S. In this case, since each vertex has a degree of 3, any subset S of vertices on the left side will have at least 3|S| edges connecting to the right side. However, since there are only 12 vertices on the right side, the maximum number of vertices that can be connected to a subset S is 12. Therefore, a perfect matching is only possible if the size of the subset S is less than or equal to 4. Now, let\'s try to find a perfect matching in this graph. Since there are 10 vertices on the left side and 12 vertices on the right side, a perfect matching would require that each vertex on the left side is connected to a unique vertex on the right side. However, since each vertex on the left side has a degree of 3, there will be at least two vertices on the left side that share a common neighbor on the right side.

A graph is a tree if it is connected and has n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. In this case, a tree with 8 vertices would have 7 edges. Since our graph has 10 edges, it is not a tree. A graph is a forest if it is a disjoint union of trees. In this case, the maximum number of edges in a forest with 8 vertices would be 7 (e.g., a tree with 7 vertices and 6 edges, and an isolated vertex). Since our graph has 10 edges, it is not a forest. Step 3: Since the graph is not a tree or a forest, we proceed to step 4. Step 4: Use the upper bound for treewidth based on the number of vertices and edges. The treewidth of a graph is at most the square root of twice the number of edges, minus 1. In this case, the upper bound for treewidth is: Treewidth ≤ sqrt(2 * 10) - 1 Treewidth ≤ sqrt(20) - 1 Treewidth ≤ 4.47 - 1 Treewidth ≤ 3.47 Since treewidth must be an integer, we can round down to get the maximum possible treewidth for this graph: Treewidth ≤ 3 Therefore, the treewidth of the given graph with 8 vertices and 10 edges is at most 3. Note that this is an upper bound, and the actual treewidth could be lower depending on the specific structure of the graph."},{"prompt":"What is the treewidth of the following graph?

In either case, we have shown that a graph with 9 vertices must contain either a red triangle or a blue K₄, so R(3,4) ≤ 9. Next, we will show that R(3,4) > 8: Consider the following graph G with 8 vertices: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Color the edges as follows: - Red edges: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD - Blue edges: AE, AF, AG, BE, BF, BG, CE, CF, CH, DE, DF, DH, EF, EG, EH, FG, FH, GH In this graph, there are no red triangles and no blue K₄. To see this, note that the red edges form two disjoint red paths of length 3 (A-B-C-D and A-C-B-D). There are no red triangles since adding a red edge between any two vertices in the same path would create a red cycle of length 4, which is not allowed. Similarly, there are no blue K₄ in this graph. To see this, note that each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices by blue edges. If there were a blue K₄, then one of the vertices in the K₄ would have to be connected to all 3 other vertices by blue edges, which is not possible since each vertex is connected to only 3 other vertices by blue edges. Since there is a graph with 8 vertices that does not contain a red triangle or a blue K₄, we have R(3,4) > 8.

A complete graph with 5 vertices can be colored without creating a red or blue triangle. 2. In a complete graph with 6 vertices, there must be either a red triangle or a blue triangle. Proof for 1: Consider a complete graph with 5 vertices (K5). Color the edges of the graph such that each vertex is connected to two vertices with red edges and two vertices with blue edges. This can be done by arranging the vertices in a circle and coloring the edges as follows: color the two edges adjacent to each vertex red and the two edges opposite each vertex blue. In this configuration, there are no red or blue triangles. Proof for 2: Now consider a complete graph with 6 vertices (K6). Pick a vertex, say A. There are 5 edges connected to A, and by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least 3 of these edges must have the same color, say red. Let the vertices connected to A by red edges be B, C, and D. If any of the edges between B, C, and D are red, then we have a red triangle (ABx, where x is one of B, C, or D). If all the edges between B, C, and D are blue, then we have a blue triangle (BCD).

Since G has a clique number of 3, there are no complete subgraphs with more than 3 vertices. We are asked to find the value of C. To form a 3-vertex clique, we need to choose 3 vertices from the 10 vertices in G such that all 3 vertices are connected to each other. The number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 10 vertices is given by the combination formula: C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10 - 3)!) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = 120 However, this value represents the total number of 3-vertex subsets without considering whether they form a complete subgraph (clique) or not. Since we know that the clique number of G is 3, there must be at least one 3-vertex clique in G. Let\'s assume there are C such cliques. Now, let\'s consider the complementary graph G\', which is a graph with the same vertices as G but with the edges reversed (i.e., two vertices are connected in G\' if and only if they are not connected in G). In G\', a 3-vertex subset that forms an independent set (i.e., no two vertices are connected) corresponds to a 3-vertex clique in G. The problem now becomes finding the number of 3-vertex independent sets in G\'. Since G has a clique number of 3, G\' has an independence number of 3 (i.e., the size of the largest independent set in G\' is 3). This means that there are no independent sets with more than 3 vertices in G\'. Let\'s denote the number of 3-vertex independent sets in G\' as I. We know that the sum of the number of cliques and independent sets in a graph and its complementary graph is equal to the total number of 3-vertex subsets: C + I = 120 Since we are interested in finding the value of C, we need to find the value of I. To do this, we can use the fact that the independence number of G\' is 3. This means that there are at least 1 and at most 120 - 1 = 119 independent sets of size 3 in G\'. However, without more information about the structure of G or G\', we cannot determine the exact value of I and, consequently, the exact value of C.

Both confess: The probability of both players confessing is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. The payoff for each player in this case is 2 years. So, the expected payoff for each player is 0.25 * 2 = 0.5 years. 2. Both stay silent: The probability of both players staying silent is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. The payoff for each player in this case is 1 year.

For Alice: - If Bob cooperates, Alice\'s best strategy is to cooperate as well (1 < 10). - If Bob remains silent, Alice\'s best strategy is to cooperate (0 < 5). Since Alice\'s best strategy is to cooperate regardless of Bob\'s choice, cooperating is Alice\'s dominant strategy.

Since Bob\'s best strategy is to cooperate regardless of Alice\'s choice, cooperating is Bob\'s dominant strategy.
