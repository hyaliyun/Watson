We do not know which vertices correspond to cards with 0 or 1 on their back. Placing two cards into the machine is equivalent to drawing an edge between two vertices and labeling that edge 0 or 1 depending on the machine output. 2. **Determine the worst-case scenario:** Suppose we add edges in ( G ) arbitrarily until we find an edge that gets labeled 1. At this point, we know that both vertices incident with that edge correspond to cards with 1 on their back. However, if ( G ) still contains an independent set of size ( n ), we could shuffle the cards around so that the cards with label 1 are on the vertices of the independent set.

Hence, the largest interior angle of the triangle is boxed{120^{circ}}. To solve this problem, we first set up the lengths of the sides using the given ratio. Then, by recognizing that the largest side is opposite the largest angle, we use the Law of Cosines to express cos C in terms of the side lengths. Plugging in the expressions for a, b, and c, we can find the value of cos C. Finally, using the fact that C must be between 0 and 180^{circ}, we can determine the measure of the largest interior angle by considering the special values of the cosine function. This problem tests our understanding of the Law of Cosines and the relationship between the sides and angles of a triangle.

When the circle is cut into two sectors and each sector is curled to form a cone, the problem states that the ratio of the lateral surface areas of these cones is ( 2:1 ). Therefore, the ratio of the areas of the two resulting sectors must also be ( 2:1 ). 3. Let's denote the sectors by their central angles.

Then, one of the cycles ( v_i v_{i+1} cdots v_j v v_i ) or ( v_j v_{j+1} cdots v_i v v_j ) must have a length not divisible by 3 (since the sum of their lengths is ( 3k + 4 )).

The combined rate of both pumps working together is: R_x + R_y = (W/2) / 3 Substituting the rates we found earlier into this equation, we get: (W/2) / T_x + W / 20 = (W/2) / 3 To solve for T_x, we first eliminate W from the equation since it's a common factor and won't affect the outcome: 1/2T_x + 1/20 = 1/6 Now, let's find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 20T_x: 10/T_x + 1/20 = 10/60 Now, we can combine the fractions on the left side: (10 + T_x) / 20T_x = 10/60 Cross-multiply to solve for T_x: 60(10 + T_x) = 10 * 20T_x 600 + 60T_x = 200T_x Now, let's move all terms involving T_x to one side: 200T_x - 60T_x = 600 140T_x = 600 Finally, divide both sides by 140 to solve for T_x: T_x = 600 / 140 T_x = 4.2857... Since we are looking for a whole number of hours, we can round T_x to the nearest whole number, which is 4 hours. Therefore, pump X took boxed{4} hours to pump out half of the water."},{"prompt":"ally, a natural number was displayed on the calculator screen.

In July, a mixture containing equal quantities of green tea and coffee costs 3.15 for 3 lbs. Since the mixture contains equal quantities of both, we can assume it's 1.5 lbs of green tea and 1.5 lbs of coffee. The cost of 1.5 lbs of green tea is 1.5 * 0.1x, and the cost of 1.5 lbs of coffee is 1.5 * 2x.

This is because if ( S ) cannot be split into parts where each part is divisible by ( m ), then there are no valid ways to split ( S ). 2. **Divisibility and Splitting**: Consider splitting ( S ) into contiguous nonempty substrings such that each substring represents a number divisible by ( m ). If ( S ) can be split in such a way, then each split point must ensure that the numbers before and after the split are divisible by ( m ). 3. **Binary Choice at Each Split**: For each potential split point in ( S ), there are two choices: either to split or not to split. This binary choice suggests that the number of valid ways to split ( S ) is a power of 2. 4. **Example for ( m = 2 )**: Consider ( S = 1234 ). The valid splits are: - ( 1234 ) (no split, ( 1234 ) is divisible by 2) - ( 12|34 ) (both ( 12 ) and ( 34 ) are divisible by 2) The other possible splits (e.g., ( 1|234 ), ( 123|4 ), etc.) do not result in all parts being divisible by 2.

((a+b)(b+c)(c+a)(a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca)) is a perfect (n)-th power. 2. **Coprimality Analysis:** - Since (a, b, c, a+b+c) are pairwise coprime, we have: [ gcd(a+b+c, a) = 1, quad gcd(a+b+c, b+c) = 1 ] [ gcd(a+b+c, a+b) = 1, quad gcd(a+b+c, c) = 1 ] [ gcd(a+b+c, a+c) = 1, quad gcd(a+b+c, b) = 1 ] - Therefore, ((a+b)(a+c)(b+c)) and (a+b+c) are coprime. 3. **Prime Divisors Analysis:** - Let (p) be a prime divisor of (a+b). We need to show (p nmid ab+bc+ca). - Assume (p mid ab+bc+ca). Since (p mid a+b), we have: [ p mid ac + bc implies p mid ab ] - This implies either (p mid a) or (p mid b).

What is more likely in such a match: that the total number of goals scored will be even or that it will be odd?","completion":"1. **Define Probabilities:** Let ( p ) be the probability that the total number of goals scored in the match is even. Consequently, ( q = 1 - p ) is the probability that the total number of goals scored is odd. 2. **First and Second Halves:** Consider the probability distributions for each half of the match. Let ( p_1 ) denote the probability that the number of goals scored in the first half is even, and thus ( q_1 = 1 - p_1 ) is the probability that the number of goals scored is odd. Similarly, for the second half, these probabilities are also ( p_1 ) and ( q_1 ) respectively. 3. **Independence Assumption:** Goals scored in the second half are independent of goals scored in the first half. 4. **Even and Odd Total Goals:** The total number of goals is even if: - Both halves have an even number of goals, or - Both halves have an odd number of goals. The probability of an even total score is: [ p = p_1 times p_1 + q_1 times q_1 = p_1^2 + q_1^2 ] Conversely, the total number of goals is odd if one half has an even number of goals and the other half has an odd number of goals: [ q = p_1 times q_1 + q_1 times p_1 = 2 p_1 q_1 ] 5. **Calculate the Difference:** Now, compute the difference between ( p ) and ( q ): [ p - q = p_1^2 + q_1^2 - 2p_1 q_1 = (p_1 - q_1)^2 ] Since squares of real numbers are always non-negative: [ (p_1 - q_1)^2 geq 0 ] 6. **Conclusion from Difference:** Thus, we have shown that: [ p geq q ] This means the probability that the total number of goals is even is at least as large as the probability that it is odd. 7. **Inequality Analysis:** To demonstrate that ( p neq q ), perform an iterative halving of the match duration (90 minutes): - Halve the match, then halve again, continuing this process k times. - After each halving step, calculate ( p_k ) and ( q_k ). 8. **Small Segments Approach:** As the intervals become shorter, the likelihood of scoring any goals in tiny segments becomes insignificant: [ text{For large } k, quad p_k approx 1 quad text{and thus} quad p_k > q_k ] 9. **Non-Equal Probability:** Therefore: [ p - q = (p_k - q_k)^{2k} > 0 ] Ensures that the probability of an even number of goals is always greater than that of an odd number, given the independence and statistical approach. # Conclusion: The probability that the total number of goals scored is even is more likely than it being odd.

When x > 1, we have f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 16. To maintain this symmetry for x < 1, the function f(x) can be mirrored such that f(x) = -(2(x-1)^2 - 12(x-1) + 16). Let us find the points of intersection when x > 1. We set f(x) = 2x^2 - 12x + 16 equal to 2 and solve for x: 2x^2 - 12x + 16 = 2, 2x^2 - 12x + 14 = 0. Additionally, since the quadratic equation will have two solutions, which we can denote as x_1 and x_2, the sum x_1 + x_2 can be directly found using Vieta's formulas which state that the sum of the roots x_1 + x_2 is equal to the coefficient of x (with opposite sign) divided by the coefficient of x^2. Therefore, we have: x_1 + x_2 = frac{12}{2} = 6. For x < 1, we need to find the points of intersection by setting f(x) = -2(x-1)^2 + 12(x-1) - 14 equal to 2: -2(x-1)^2 + 12(x-1) - 14 = 2, -2(x-1)^2 + 12(x-1) - 16 = 0. Applying the symmetry of f(x+1) being an odd function, we can predict that for every positive root x_p > 1, there will be a corresponding negative root x_n < 1 such that x_n = -x_p + 2. From our first equation, we know that we have roots whose sum is 6, so for each root x_p, there is a negative root -x_p + 2. Therefore, we expect a third root x_3 = 2 - x_1 or x_3 = 2 - x_2. Given our roots are positive, and x_1 + x_2 = 6, x_3 = 2 - x_1 or x_3 = 2 - x_2 would be negative. Without loss of generality, let's assume x_1 > x_2, given x_1,x_2 > 1, we can deduce: x_3 = 2 - x_1 < 1. Now, let's confirm this by finding the root from the equation where f(x) = 2 for x < 1: -2(x-1)^2 + 12(x-1) - 16 = 0 2(x-1)^2 - 12(x-1) + 16 = 0. This is equivalent to the equation above (since the signs don't affect the position of the roots), thus confirming our prediction. Given x_1 + x_2 = 6, it must be that x_3 = -1, which also satisfies 2 - x_1 < 1. Finally, the sum of the x-coordinates of all the points of intersection is: x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 6 + (-1) = 5.

We start with the observation that ( 9A ) can be rewritten as: [ 9A = 10A - A ] 3. Subtracting ( A ) from ( 10A ) using the standard long subtraction method, we note that in every digit place except for the last one (i.e., the rightmost digit), there is no need to borrow since the digits of ( A ) are in increasing order. 4. Consequently, the subtraction ( 10A - A ) simplifies the calculation significantly: [ text{Digits of } 10A: (d_1, d_2, ldots, d_{n-1}, d_n, 0) ] [ text{Digits of } A: quad (d_1, d_2, ldots, d_{n-1}, d_n) ] Here, ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_{n-1}, d_n ) are the digits of ( A ) in ascending order. 5. When we perform ( 10A - A ), we essentially subtract each digit of ( A ) from the corresponding digit of ( 10A ): [ (10A - A) = (d_1 - d_1, d_2 - d_2, ldots, d_{n-1} - d_{n-1}, d_n - d_n, 0 - d_n) ] Simplified, this becomes: [ 10A - A = (0, 0, ldots, 0, 0, -d_n) ] Adding 10 to the last term gives us the adjustment due to borrowing during the long subtraction: [ Rightarrow 10A - A = (0, 0, ldots, 0, 10 - d_n) ] 6. The sum of the digits of the difference ( 10A - A ) is thus: [ text{Sum of the digits of } 10A - A = 10 - d_n ] Here, ( d_n ) is the last digit of ( A ). 7.

The volume of the original cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h. Since the original cylinder is 7/8 full of water, the volume of the water is (7/8)πr^2h. Now, the water is poured into a new cylinder whose radius is 25% larger than the original radius. Therefore, the radius of the new cylinder is r_new = r + 0.25r = 1.25r. The volume of the water remains the same, so we have: (7/8)πr^2h = (3/5)π(1.25r)^2h_new where h_new is the height of the water in the new cylinder. Now, we can solve for h_new: (7/8)πr^2h = (3/5)π(1.25r)^2h_new (7/8)πr^2h = (3/5)π(1.5625r^2)h_new (7/8)h = (3/5)(1.5625)h_new (7/8)h = (3/5)(1.5625)h_new (7/8)h = (4.6875/5)h_new (7/8)h = (0.9375)h_new h_new = (7/8)h / 0.9375 h_new = (7/8)h / (15/16) h_new = (7/8)h * (16/15) h_new = (7/8) * (16/15)h h_new = (7 * 2) / (15)h h_new = 14/15h So, the height of the new cylinder is 14/15 of the height of the original cylinder. To find out what percent of h this is, we convert the fraction to a percentage: h_new = (14/15)h h_new = (14/15) * 100% h_new = 93.33% Therefore, the height of the new cylinder is boxed{93.33%} of the height h of the original cylinder."},{"prompt":"the triangle ABC, AB = AC.

As AP is a tangent to the smaller circle, angle PRQ = angle APQ. 4. **Constitution of Cyclic Quadrilateral**: - Next, observe that angle APQ = angle ABC due to the tangency and properties of the tangents to the circle. - Also angle PRQ = angle APQ = angle ABC. - We need to show now that quadrilateral PBRM is cyclic: angle PBR = 90^circ and angle PMR = 90^circ due to tangency points and radian lengths. 5. **Bisecting Angles**: - Since PBRM is cyclic, we can state angle PBM = angle PRM. - As angle PRM = frac{1}{2} times angle PRQ, this matches the angle bisector property for angle B. - Hence, M must be on the angle bisector of angle ABC as well. 6. **Conclusion**: - Since M is both on the angle bisector of angle BAC and angle ABC, - and by the properties of the isosceles triangle and the tangency of incircle and excircle radii. - Therefore, M is the incenter of triangle ABC.

It's shown half the toggles would naturally light up switching elements based on these structural constraints. 6. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, it is proved by combining the combinatorial logic and unpaired toggle distributions that there exists at least one configuration or set of 19 switches that will ensure 8 or more lamps are on.

This can be done in 3^1 = 3 ways. However, the initial distribution of the first 3 researchers into the 3 schools can be done in 3! = 6 ways since the researchers are distinct and the order in which they are assigned to the schools matters. Therefore, the total number of different distribution schemes is 3 times 6 = 18. But this calculation does not match any of the options provided, indicating a mistake in the reasoning. The correct approach should consider the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion or other combinatorial methods suitable for distributing distinct objects into distinct boxes with some boxes having a minimum number of objects. The correct answer, as given, is C, which implies a different combinatorial approach was expected. The standard solution to this problem involves recognizing it as a problem of distributing distinct objects (researchers) into distinct boxes (schools) with constraints (each school gets at least one researcher). A common method to solve such problems is to use Stirling numbers of the second kind or to apply a combinatorial argument that accounts for the constraints.

Let ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_n ) be points on the sides ( A_1A_2, A_2A_3, ldots, A_nA_1 ) respectively, but not at the vertices.

Let ( triangle ABC ) be a triangle with all angles acute, say ( a, b, c ). Note that: [ AB + BC + CA = 2R (sin a + sin b + sin c) ] Hence, it suffices to minimize ( sin a + sin b + sin c ) subject to ( 0 le a le b le c le 90^circ ) and ( a + b + c = 180^circ ). 6. **Minimize the sum of sines:** Notice that: [ sin (c + d) - sin c le sin a - sin (a - d) iff 2 sin left( frac{1}{2} d right) cos left( c + frac{d}{2} right) le 2 sin left( frac{1}{2} d right) cos left( a - frac{1}{2} d right) ] This is true as ( cos ) is a decreasing function on ( [0, frac{pi}{2}] ), for all ( 0 le d le min(a, 90^circ - c) ).

So, his savings after the increase in expenses are: Final savings = Rs. 250 We are given that his monthly salary S is Rs. 6250. Therefore, his initial savings were: Initial savings = 0.20 * 6250 Initial savings = Rs. 1250 The difference between his initial savings and his final savings is the amount by which his expenses increased: Increase in expenses = Initial savings - Final savings Increase in expenses = Rs. 1250 - Rs. 250 Increase in expenses = Rs. 1000 Now, we need to find the percentage increase in his monthly expenses. The increase in expenses is Rs. 1000, and we know that his initial expenses were 80% of his salary (since he saved 20%, he spent the remaining 80%). So, his initial expenses were: Initial expenses = 80% of S Initial expenses = 0.80 * 6250 Initial expenses = Rs. 5000 The percentage increase in his monthly expenses (P%) is calculated as: P% = (Increase in expenses / Initial expenses) * 100 P% = (1000 / 5000) * 100 P% = (1/5) * 100 P% = 20% Therefore, the man increased his monthly expenses by boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"A sphere is inscribed in a cube, and the cube has a surface area of 54 square meters.

When b = 2, from g(x) > 0, we have gleft(ln sqrt{2}right) = frac{3}{2} - 4 sqrt{2} + 6ln 2 > 0, thus ln 2 > frac{8 sqrt{2} - 3}{12} > frac{8 times 1.4142 - 3}{12} = 0.6928; Letting ln left(b - 1 + sqrt{b^2 - 2b}right) = ln sqrt{2}, we find b = frac{3 sqrt{2}}{4} + 1 > 2, when 0 < x leqslant ln left(b - 1 + sqrt{b^2 - 2b}right), from g(x) < 0, we get gleft(ln sqrt{2}right) = -frac{3}{2} - 2 sqrt{2} + (3 sqrt{2} + 2)ln 2 < 0, thus ln 2 < frac{18 + sqrt{2}}{28} < frac{18 + 1.4143}{28} < 0.6934, therefore, the approximate value of ln 2 is boxed{0.693}."},{"prompt":"Let f(n)=n+lfloor sqrt{n}rfloor .

This means if ( m ) is not of this form, it will appear somewhere in the sequence starting from a smaller ( m' ). 3. **Focus on base units:** Assume ( m = n^2 + n - 1 ). We need to show that the sequence contains a perfect square. 4. **Calculate the first few terms:** [ f(m) = f(n^2 + n - 1) = (n^2 + n - 1) + lfloor sqrt{n^2 + n - 1} rfloor ] Since ( n^2 leq n^2 + n - 1 < (n+1)^2 ), we have: [ lfloor sqrt{n^2 + n - 1} rfloor = n ] Therefore: [ f(n^2 + n - 1) = n^2 + n - 1 + n = n^2 + 2n - 1 ] 5. **Iterate the function:** [ f(f(m)) = f(n^2 + 2n - 1) = (n^2 + 2n - 1) + lfloor sqrt{n^2 + 2n - 1} rfloor ] Since ( n^2 + 2n - 1 ) is close to ( (n+1)^2 ), we have: [ lfloor sqrt{n^2 + 2n - 1} rfloor = n + 1 ] Therefore: [ f(n^2 + 2n - 1) = n^2 + 2n - 1 + (n + 1) = n^2 + 3n ] 6. **Continue iterating until a perfect square is found:** We need to show that after a finite number of steps, we reach a perfect square. Notice that: [ f^{2n-2}(m) = (2n - 1)^2 ] This can be shown by induction or by observing the pattern in the sequence. 7. **Generalize the result:** For any positive integer ( m ), if ( m ) is not of the form ( n^2 + n - 1 ), it will eventually reach a number of this form in the sequence.

This means as x decreases, y increases. - When x=-5, y={(frac{1}{2})}^{-5}=32. - As x approaches 0 from the left, y approaches 1 from the right (since y={(frac{1}{2})}^{x} approaches 1 as x approaches 0).

Therefore, 0<log _{3}xleqslant log _{3}32, where log _{3}3=1<log _{3}32<log _{3}81=4. This implies log _{3}32in (3,4). Since B consists of integer values of y, B={1,2,3}. **Step 3: Finding Acap B** Given the definitions of sets A and B, their intersection A cap B consists of the common elements that satisfy both set conditions. Since A represents a range of values 1<y≤32 and B represents the integer values {1,2,3} based on the logarithmic function, the intersection A cap B will be the integers within the range of A that are also in B.

According to the problem, we have: 4P = kQ = 10R, where k is the multiple of Q's capital we need to find. The total profit is Rs 4030, and r's share of the profit is Rs 780. Since the profit is distributed in proportion to the capital invested, we can write: Profit of r / Total Profit = R's capital / Total capital Substituting the given values, we get: 780 / 4030 = R / (P + Q + R) Since 4P = 10R, we can substitute P with (10R/4) or (5R/2). Similarly, since 4P = kQ, we can substitute Q with (4P/k) or (10R/k). Now, the equation becomes: 780 / 4030 = R / ((5R/2) + (10R/k) + R) Simplifying the denominator, we get: R / (R(5/2 + 10/k + 1)) Further simplifying, we get: R / (R(5/2 + 1 + 10/k)) R / (R(7/2 + 10/k)) Now, we can cancel out R from both the numerator and the denominator: 1 / (7/2 + 10/k) Now, we can solve for k by equating the fractions: 780 / 4030 = 1 / (7/2 + 10/k) Cross-multiplying, we get: 780 * (7/2 + 10/k) = 4030 Dividing both sides by 780, we get: 7/2 + 10/k = 4030 / 780 Simplifying the right side, we get: 7/2 + 10/k ≈ 5.1667 Now, we need to solve for k: 10/k = 5.1667 - 7/2 10/k = 5.1667 - 3.5 10/k = 1.6667 Now, we solve for k: k = 10 / 1.6667 k ≈ 6 Therefore, the multiple of q's capital is approximately boxed{6} ."},{"prompt":"Two lines intersect at a 30^circ angle in the xycoordinate plane.

After she selects a white marble, there are 3 white marbles and 7 total marbles left. So, the second girl has a 3/7 chance of selecting a white marble. Similarly, the third girl has a 2/6 (which simplifies to 1/3) chance, and the fourth girl has a 1/5 chance of selecting a white marble. The probability that all girls select white marbles is the product of these probabilities: (4/8) * (3/7) * (1/3) * (1/5) = (1/2) * (3/7) * (1/3) * (1/5) = (1/2) * (1/7) * (1/5) = 1/70 Now, let's calculate the probability that all girls select black marbles. The calculation is the same as for the white marbles since there are also 4 black marbles to start with. The probability that all girls select black marbles is also 1/70. To find the total probability that all girls select the same colored marble (either all white or all black), we add the two probabilities together: 1/70 + 1/70 = 2/70 Simplify the fraction: 2/70 = 1/35 So, the probability that all of the girls select the same colored marble is boxed{1/35} ."},{"prompt":"A circular spinner for a game has a radius of 8 cm.

Consequently, the number of blue faces among the visible ones is: [ 24 text{ visible faces} - 8 text{ red faces} = 16 text{ blue faces} ] 7. Since we have accounted for all 16 blue faces, all the blue faces are on the surface of the large cube. 8. Verification: - Each small cube has an equal number of red and blue faces adhering to the initial condition. - The arrangement ensures all 16 blue faces are external. - Therefore, the remaining hidden faces are all red. 9. Therefore, by rotating each small cube appropriately within the large cube, each cube can be adjusted so the three hidden red faces become visible on the external surface. # Conclusion Since it confirms the external visibility of all red faces when arranged properly, it shows it is possible to construct a cube that has only red faces visible on its surface: [ boxed{text{Solution Confirmed}} ]"},{"prompt":"Since the reform and opening up, China's GDP has grown from 364.5 billion yuan in 1978 to 30,067 billion yuan in 2008.

For which values of ( n ) can you choose ( n+1 ) nonoverlapping original sets from this square?","completion":"To solve the problem of finding when it is possible to choose ( n+1 ) non-overlapping original sets on an ( n times n ) chessboard, we can utilize the following steps. 1. Coloring the Chessboard: First, let's color the ( n times n ) grid such that each cell on the same diagonal gets the same color. We'll use ( n ) different colors, one for each diagonal. 2. Constructing an Original Set: An original set is a selection of ( n-1 ) cells from the grid such that no two cells share the same row or column. To create this set, we can pick: - The top-left cell of the grid, - The cell two steps to the right and one step down, - Continuing this pattern will give us cells from ( n-1 ) different rows and columns. 3. Coloring the Original Set: For instance, starting from the top-left cell, color it with an additional color (the ( n+1 )-th color). Then, move two cells to the right and one cell down, color that cell with the next color (e.g., the second color out of ( n ) colors initially used), and continue this for all ( n-1 ) cells. 4. Ensuring No Overlapping Sets: If ( n ) is odd: - You move right until you reach the end of the row. - Once you reach the right edge, move to the next column on the left and start from the top, continuing this pattern. - This way, you'll cover all cells while keeping your cells non-overlapping and no two cells in the same row or column. If ( n ) is even: - Move right until you reach the end, jump to the first column of the next row. - Continue the pattern while ensuring no two cells share a row or column. 5. Handling Boundary Cases: For both even and odd ( n ): When you reach the bottom-right corner, you will have covered ( n ) colors. Suppose you encounter more than ( n-1 ) cells of a single color; in this case, remove one to balance the set count to ( n-1 ). 6. Conclusion: Upon successfully applying the pattern of movements and coloring, you will have constructed ( n+1 ) non-overlapping original sets for any ( n ). Thus, the solution is valid for any ( n ).

First, let's analyze the given conditions: 1. Since abc > 0, it implies that all three variables a, b, and c are either all positive or two are negative and one is positive. 2. Given ab < 0, it indicates that a and b have opposite signs. From these conditions, we can deduce that c must be negative because if a and b have opposite signs, the product ab is negative, and for abc to be positive, c must be negative. Now, let's evaluate the expression frac{|a|}{a}+frac{2b}{|b|}-frac{bc}{|4bc|} under two cases based on the sign of a: **Case 1: a > 0** - Since ab < 0, it follows that b < 0. - Consequently, bc > 0 because c < 0. - Evaluating the expression: [ frac{|a|}{a}+frac{2b}{|b|}-frac{bc}{|4bc|} = frac{a}{a}+frac{2b}{-b}-frac{bc}{4bc} = 1 - 2 - frac{1}{4} = -frac{5}{4} ] **Case 2: a < 0** - Since ab < 0, it follows that b > 0. - Consequently, bc < 0 because c < 0. - Evaluating the expression: [ frac{|a|}{a}+frac{2b}{|b|}-frac{bc}{|4bc|} = frac{-a}{a}+frac{2b}{b}-frac{bc}{-4bc} = -1 + 2 + frac{1}{4} = frac{5}{4} ] Therefore, depending on the sign of a, the expression can either be -frac{5}{4} or frac{5}{4}.

First Solution: 1. **Translation Consideration:** Translate the segment BC to MN. Consider G as the image of H under this translation, which implies: [ overrightarrow{MG} = overrightarrow{BH} ] [ overrightarrow{NG} = overrightarrow{CH} ] 2. **Projections and Right Angles:** Since P is the projection of M onto AC, MP is perpendicular to AC. Similarly, since Q is the projection of N onto AB, NQ is perpendicular to AB. Consequently, the following properties hold: [ angle APG = 90^circ ] and [ angle AQH = 90^circ ] 3. **Similar Triangles and Cyclic Quadrilateral:** The lines MH and NH are parallel to BC as a result of translation symmetry. Therefore: [ angle AHG = 90^circ ] Because all points P, Q, H, and G share these right angles, APHQ is a cyclic quadrilateral. (blacksquare) Second Solution: 1. **Identifying Parallel Projections:** Assume that M lies on the half-line BC originating from B. Let E be the projection of B onto AC and F the projection of C onto AB. 2. **Equating Angles for Cyclic Criteria:** For APHQ to be cyclic, we need angle HPE = angle HQF. We establish that triangles HPE and HQF are similar. Since HE is perpendicular to AC and HF is perpendicular to AB: [ angle HEP = angle HFQ = 90^circ ] 4. **Proportional Relationships in Similar Triangles:** Using the similarity of triangles HEC and HFB: [ frac{HE}{HF} = frac{PE}{QF} ] Simplifying further: [ frac{PE}{CE} = frac{QF}{BF} ] 5. **Verification with Parallel Lines:** As BE and MP are both perpendicular to AC, BE parallel MP. Similarly, CF parallel NQ. 6. **Equality of Segments and Ratios:** By the ray theorem: [ frac{PE}{CE} = frac{BM}{BC} = frac{NC}{BC} = frac{QF}{BF} ] Thus, APHQ is cyclic. (blacksquare) Third Solution: 1. **Point Order on BC:** Assume M, B, N, C are collinear along BC. Let R be the intersection of MP with NQ. 2. **Using Right Angles and Parallelism:** With MB = NC, RH is parallel to BC. Then angle BAH = 90^circ - beta, angle BNQ = 90^circ - beta, and angle CMP = 90^circ - gamma. 3. **Identifying angle's in Quadrilateral:** Parallelism of RH with BC implies: [ angle NRH = 90^circ - beta ] Therefore AQRH is cyclic. 4. **Similar Triangles to Verify Angle Equality:** Let's check angle RQH = angle RPH. Define H_B and H_C as feet of the perpendiculars from H to AC and AB respectively. Given: [ angle RQH = angle QHH_C quad text{and} quad angle RPH = angle PHH_B ] We need: [ frac{HH_C}{HH_B} = frac{cos beta}{cos gamma} ] And: [ frac{H_CQ}{RH} = cos beta quad frac{H_BP}{RH} = cos gamma ] 5. **Proportional Comparison in Similar Triangles:** So, [ frac{HH_C}{HH_B} = frac{cos beta}{cos gamma} = frac{H_CQ}{H_BP} ] Establishing similarity of triangle QHH_C and triangle PHH_B, confirming angle RQH = angle RPH ensures that APRHQ is cyclic.

The entire field must be partitioned, and the sides of the squares must be parallel to the edges of the field. What is the largest number of square test plots into which the field can be partitioned using all or some of the 1994 meters of fence?","completion":"To solve this problem, we start by letting the number of square test plots in every column be n. Given that the field is rectangular with dimensions 24 meters by 52 meters, and the squares must be congruent and their sides parallel to the edges of the field, the number of squares in every row will be proportional to the ratio of the field's length to its width. Therefore, there will be frac{52}{24}n = frac{13}{6}n squares in every row. This implies that 6 must divide n evenly, as the number of squares in every row must be an integer, leading us to our goal of maximizing the value of n. Next, we calculate the total length of the internal fencing needed. Each vertical fence, which divides the columns, has a length equal to the height of the field, 24 meters. The number of such vertical fences is one less than the number of squares in a row, which is frac{13}{6}n - 1. Similarly, each horizontal fence, dividing the rows, has a length equal to the width of the field, 52 meters, with the number of these fences being n-1. The total length of the internal fencing is therefore calculated as follows: [ 24left(frac{13n}{6}-1right) + 52(n-1) = 104n - 76. ] Given that the total available length of fencing is 1994 meters, we set up the inequality: [ 104n - 76 le 1994. ] Solving for n, we get: [ 104n le 2070 Longrightarrow n le frac{2070}{104} approx 19.9. ] Since n must be an integer, we conclude that n le 19. However, since n must also be a multiple of 6, the largest possible value for n that satisfies both conditions is n = 18. Finally, to find the total number of square test plots, we calculate the square of the number of squares in every column and multiply it by the ratio of squares in a row to squares in a column, which gives us: [ frac{13}{6}n^2 = frac{13}{6} times 18^2 = 702. ] Therefore, the largest number of square test plots into which the field can be partitioned using all or some of the 1994 meters of fence is boxed{702}."},{"prompt":"A square mirror has a certain ratio of its area to the area of the rectangular wall on which it is hung.

What is the ratio of the mirror's area to the wall's area?","completion":"First, let's calculate the area of the square mirror. Since each side of the mirror is 54 inches, the area of the mirror (A_mirror) is: A_mirror = side_length^2 A_mirror = 54 inches * 54 inches A_mirror = 2916 square inches Next, let's calculate the area of the rectangular wall. The width of the wall is 68 inches and the length is 85.76470588235294 inches. The area of the wall (A_wall) is: A_wall = width * length A_wall = 68 inches * 85.76470588235294 inches A_wall = 5829.999999999999 square inches (approximately 5830 square inches) Now, we can find the ratio of the mirror's area to the wall's area: Ratio = A_mirror / A_wall Ratio = 2916 square inches / 5830 square inches Ratio ≈ 0.5 So, the ratio of the mirror's area to the wall's area is approximately boxed{0.5} ."},{"prompt":"Officer Hopps has to give out 200 tickets in May.

First, we calculate how many tickets Officer Hopps has already given out in the first 15 days. Since he averages 8 tickets a day for these days, the total is: [15 times 8 = 120] So, Officer Hopps has given out 120 tickets in the first 15 days. 2. Next, we need to find out how many days are left in May for Officer Hopps to reach his goal. Since May has 31 days and he has already worked for 15 days, the number of days left is: [31 - 15 = 16] Therefore, Officer Hopps has 16 days left to hand out tickets. 3. Now, we calculate how many more tickets he needs to give out to reach his goal of 200 tickets. He has already handed out 120 tickets, so the remaining number of tickets is: [200 - 120 = 80] Officer Hopps needs to give out 80 more tickets. 4. Finally, to find out how many tickets he needs to average each day for the rest of the month, we divide the total number of tickets he still needs to give out by the number of days left: [80 / 16 = 5] Therefore, Officer Hopps has to average 5 tickets a day for the rest of the month to reach his goal.

In this case, it is easy to see any such graph can have at most ( 2^2 + 1 = 5 ) edges. Hence, the base case holds. 2. **Inductive Step:** Suppose the statement holds for some ( n ), i.e., for a graph with ( 2n ) vertices and ( m leq n^2 + 1 ) edges. Now we need to prove it for ( n+1 ). Consider a graph ( G ) with ( 2(n+1) = 2n + 2 ) vertices and suppose ( G ) has ( (n+1)^2 + 1 = n^2 + 2n + 2 ) edges. 3. **Application of Mantel's Theorem:** By Mantel's theorem, any graph with ( 2(n+1) ) vertices and sufficiently many edges contains a triangle. Thus, ( G ) contains a triangle formed by three vertices ( u ), ( v ), and ( w ). 4. **Degree Parity:** Among the vertices of the triangle, there are two vertices whose degrees have the same parity. Without loss of generality, let these vertices be ( u ) and ( v ). 5. **Removing Vertices and Their Edges:** Consider the subgraph ( G' ) obtained by removing vertices ( u ) and ( v ) along with all edges incident to them. This subgraph ( G' ) then has ( 2n ) vertices. 6. **Hypothesis Application:** By the induction hypothesis, ( G' ) has at most ( n^2 + 1 ) edges. Denote the number of edges in ( G' ) as ( m' ). If ( m' leq n^2 + 1 ), then the number of edges associated with ( u ) and ( v ) must satisfy: [ d(u) + d(v) - 1 geq 2n + 2 ] Notice that we subtract 1 because the edge ( uv ) is counted twice. 7. **Counting incidences:** Since ( d(u) ) and ( d(v) ) are of the same parity, their sum ( d(u) + d(v) ) is even, and therefore ( d(u) + d(v) - 1 ) is odd. We are also given that ( d(u) + d(v) - 1 geq 2n + 2 ), indicating that the number of edges connected to ( u ) or ( v ) is sufficiently large: [ d(u) + d(v) - 1 geq 2n + 2 ] 8. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:** Given there are only ( 2n - 1 ) vertices different from ( u ), ( v ), ( w ), and at least ( 2n + 1 ) edges touching ( u ) or ( v ), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one vertex ( x neq u, v, w ) that is connected to both ( u ) and ( v ). However, this implies the presence of a shared edge’s triangle, which contradicts our initial conditions. # Conclusion: By induction and the contradiction derived from the pigeonhole principle, we conclude that the number of edges ( m ) in a graph with ( 2n ) vertices that does not admit two triangles with a common edge satisfies: [ m leq n^2 + 1 ] (boxed{})"},{"prompt":"Given vectors a=(2,6) and b=(1,λ).

When the faces are laid out flat, the problem essentially reduces to finding the shortest path on a 2D plane. 4. **Connecting (X) and (Y) in the Unfolding**: - In the unfolded representation, connect points (X) and (Y) with a straight line. This line represents the shortest path between (X) and (Y) on the surface of the polyhedron. 5. **Calculating the Length of the Shortest Path**: - If the distances along the edges between vertices (X) and (Y) are given as (a), (b), and (c) respectively along three mutually perpendicular edges (since all edges are part of right angles), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. - From (X) to (Y), the shortest path lies along the line in the 2D plane which corresponds to the distance in three dimensions. - The distance (d) between (X) and (Y) can be calculated as: [ d = sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} ] where (a), (b), and (c) are the individual edge lengths forming right-angled edges. 6. **Substituting Edge Lengths**: - Given lengths in the problem, we use specific values for (a), (b), and (c).

Is this property true for all regular polygons?","completion":"1. **Consideration of Regular Polygon and Definitions:** Let ( K_{n} ) be a regular ( n )-sided polygon. Denote its circumscribed circle by ( k_n ) and its center by ( O ). Take any three vertices ( A, B, C ) of ( K_{n} ). Define ( H_{0} ) as the triangle ( ABC ), and let ( H_{k+1} ) be the orthic triangle (triangle formed by the feet of the altitudes) of ( H_{k} ) for ( k = 0, 1, 2, ldots ). Our goal is to find the condition such that the sequence ( H_{1}, H_{2}, ldots ) eventually contains a triangle similar to ( H_{0} ). 2. **Angular Analysis for the Orthic Triangle:** For a triangle with angles ( alpha, beta, gamma ): - If all angles are acute, the angles of the orthic triangle are ( 180^circ - 2alpha, 180^circ - 2beta, 180^circ - 2gamma ). - If the triangle is right-angled, the orthic triangle does not exist. - If the triangle is obtuse with ( alpha > 90^circ ), the angles of the orthic triangle are ( 2alpha - 180^circ, 2beta, 2gamma ). 3. **Relating Triangles Back to Regular Polygons:** Consider the central angle of a regular ( n )-sided polygon ( K_{n} ), which is ( frac{360^circ}{n} ). Thus, the inscribed angle between any two vertices of ( K_{n} ) is an integer multiple of ( varepsilon = frac{180^circ}{n} ). This means any triangle ( H_{0} ) formed by vertices ( A, B, C ) of ( K_{n} ) has angles: [ ivarepsilon, quad jvarepsilon, quad kvarepsilon quad text{where} quad i + j + k = n ] 4. **Angles of the Orthic Triangle in Subsequent Iterations:** The angles of ( H_{1}, H_{2}, ldots ) are derived based on ( ivarepsilon, jvarepsilon, kvarepsilon ) resulting in one of the following sets: [ (n - 2i)varepsilon, (n - 2j)varepsilon, (n - 2k)varepsilon ] [ (2i - n)varepsilon, 2jvarepsilon, 2kvarepsilon ] [ 2ivarepsilon, (2j - n)varepsilon, 2kvarepsilon ] [ 2ivarepsilon, 2jvarepsilon, (2k - n)varepsilon ] The sum of the coefficients of ( varepsilon ) is always ( n ). 5. **Condition of Divisibility and Similar Triangles:** Define ( r ) as the largest exponent such that ( 2^r ) divides ( n ). Thus, ( n = 2^r cdot m ) where ( m ) is odd. We show that the sequence ( H_{1}, H_{2}, ldots ) contains a triangle similar to ( H_{0} ) if and only if ( 2^r ) divides each of ( i, j, k ). 6. **Proving the Necessity and Sufficiency:** If ( 2^r ) does not divide each of ( i, j, k ), analyze ( i ) as ( 2^delta cdot mu ) where ( mu ) is odd and ( delta geq 0 ). Analyzing the angles: [ (n - 2i)varepsilon, quad (2i - n)varepsilon, quad 2ivarepsilon ] The coefficient of ( varepsilon ) will either be divisible by ( 2^{delta + 1} ) if ( delta < r ) or ( 2^r ) if ( delta ge r ). Thus, if ( 2^r ) does not divide ( i, j, k ), ( H_{0} ) and ( H_{1}, H_{2}, ldots ) will never be similar. For ( n = 2^r cdot m ), reducing the problem to odd ( n ) cases as they remain similar forms we conclude that every selection period is finite implying periodicity and similarity.

Let (m_k = 2^{p_1 p_2 cdots p_k} + 1) and (a_k = p_1 p_2 cdots p_k). For (n = 1), we consider (m_1 = 2^{p_1} + 1). Now, [ 2^{p_1} + 1 equiv -1 + 1 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] since (p_1) is odd. Also, as (p_1 > 3 implies m_1 > 9), (frac{m_1}{3}) is also a divisor of (m_1). So, (1, 3, frac{m_1}{3}, m_1) are divisors of (m_1), completing the base case. We assume the statement is true for (n = k) and we show it for (n = k + 1). As (3 mid 2^{a_k} + 1) and (3 mid 2^{p_{k+1}} + 1), from Lemma 1 we have (gcd(m_k, 2^{p_{k+1}} + 1) = gcd(2^{a_k} + 1, 2^{p_{k+1}} + 1) = 3).

So, from ((*)) we can write [ m_{k+1} = m_k cdot frac{2^{p_{k+1}} + 1}{3} cdot c_k quad (**) ] for some positive integer (c_k). From our induction hypothesis, we have (4^k) divisors of (m_k), say (d_1, d_2, dots, d_{4^k}). We also get another (4^k) divisors, namely (d_i cdot frac{2^{p_{k+1}} + 1}{3}) for (1 le i le 4^k). So, we get (4^k cdot 2) divisors from (m_k cdot frac{2^{p_{k+1}} + 1}{3}). We arrange these (4^k cdot 2) divisors in ascending order as (d_1 < d_2 < dots < d_{4^k cdot 2} quad (***)). We consider [ d_1 c_k, d_2 c_k, dots, d_{4^k cdot 2} c_k. ] So, by ((**)) we know that [ d_1, d_2, dots, d_{4^k cdot 2}, d_1 c_k, d_2 c_k, dots, d_{4^k cdot 2} c_k ] are all divisors of (m_{k+1}).

Since (d_1 ge 1) and (d_{4^k cdot 2} le m_k cdot frac{2^{p_{k+1}} + 1}{3}), it suffices to show [ c_k > m_k cdot frac{2^{p_{k+1}} + 1}{3} iff m_{k+1} > left(m_k cdot frac{2^{p_{k+1}} + 1}{3}right)^2 iff 9(2^{a_k cdot p_{k+1}} + 1) > (2^{a_k} + 1)^2 (2^{p_{k+1}} + 1)^2 ] which follows from Lemma 2.

From the given condition that f(x+2) + f(x) = 0, we infer that f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 2. That is, for any x in mathbb{R}, f(x+2) = -f(x). 2. Since f(x) is an odd function, it satisfies f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. 3. Consider the value log_{10}125; we know that 125 = 5^3 and thus log_{10}125 = 3log_{10}5. Using the change of base formula for logarithms, we have log_{10}5 = frac{ln 5}{ln 10}. Since ln 10 is slightly greater than 2 (since e is approximately 2.718), log_{10}5 is slightly less than 0.5. Therefore, 3log_{10}5 is slightly less than 1.5. 4. If we take an integer part of 3log_{10}5, we get 1, which means that the fractional part, 3log_{10}5 - 1, is still within the interval [0,1). This is relevant because the function's behavior is fully determined on this interval. 5. By periodicity, f is the same on the interval [0,1) as it is on [2,3), that is, f(x+2) = -f(x) Rightarrow f(1 + (3log_{10}5 - 1)) = -f(3log_{10}5 - 1). 6. Since 0 leq 3log_{10}5 - 1 < 1, we can use the given formula for f(x) in [0,1]: f(x)=2^x-1. Thus, f(3log_{10}5 - 1) = 2^{3log_{10}5 - 1} - 1. 7. Simplify using exponential properties (2^{log_{10}a} = a^{log_{10}2}) and the given fact that log_{10}125 = 3log_{10}5: f(3log_{10}5 - 1) = 2^{3log_{10}5} cdot 2^{-1} - 1 = frac{125^{log_{10}2}}{2} - 1 = frac{5^{3log_{10}2}}{2} - 1. 8. Realizing that log_{10}2 is the exponent to which we must raise 10 to get 2, we rewrite 5^{3log_{10}2} as (10^{log_{10}2})^3 = 2^3, hence f(3log_{10}5 - 1) = frac{2^3}{2} - 1 = frac{8}{2} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. 9.

Without loss of generality, we can assume x neq 0 since if x = 0, then y^2 = 7z^2 which implies y must be a multiple of sqrt{7}, which is not an integer unless z = 0. 3. **Modulo 7 Argument:** Consider the equation x^2 + y^2 = 7z^2 modulo 7. [ x^2 + y^2 equiv 0 pmod{7} ] This can be rewritten as: [ x^2 equiv -y^2 pmod{7} ] 4. **Contradiction Argument Using Inverses:** Assume 7 nmid x (7 does not divide (x)).

Each number on the blackboard is initially in the form (frac{49}{k}) where ( k ) ranges from 1 to 97. 2. Consider the operation where we pick two numbers (a) and (b) and replace them with the number (2ab - a - b + 1). 3. We start by noting the transformation property of this operation. Specifically, observe that transforming (a) and (b) via this method can be rewritten in terms of a different function: [ (2a-1)(2b-1) ] This equals: [ 2 left( 2ab - a - b + 1 right) - 1 ] 4.

Therefore, the product of the initial transformed numbers (for all values of (k) from 1 to 97) is: [ prod_{k=1}^{97} left( frac{98-k}{k} right) ] Which simplifies to: [ frac{97}{1} times frac{96}{2} times frac{95}{3} times ldots times frac{2}{96} times frac{1}{97} = 1 ] Essentially, each numerator in the product cancels with a corresponding denominator yielding the overall product of 1. 7. Since (prod (2a-1)) does not change through the transformations, its value remains the same as the initial product, which is 1. 8. Now let the final remaining number be (x). Since the product ((2a - 1)) remains invariant and equals 1, for the final remaining number (x), we have: [ 2x - 1 = 1 ] 9.

Observe the intersection of this line ( l ) with our body. This line ( l ) intersects the body from one surface to the opposite surface, resulting in a line segment denoted by ( overline{AB} ). 5. The key observation is that any plane that passes through the line ( l ) will produce a circular section with the same diameter ( AB ). Since all cross-sections of the body passing through this line are circles with the diameter given by this line segment ( overline{AB} ), the body must have uniform cross-sections. Each intersection through this line yields a circle of the same size. 6. This implies that we are dealing with a body where any cross-sectional plane (cut through the body in any orientation that includes the line ( l )) results in a circle. The only three-dimensional object that fits this specific characteristic is a sphere. 7.

Between the third and the 100th press inclusive, what is the expected number of pairs of consecutive presses that both take you up a floor?","completion":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step and compute the probability and the expected value systematically. 1. **Establishing Uniform Distribution by Induction:** We start by noting that after ( n ) total button presses, your current floor is uniformly distributed from 1 to ( n-1 ). Let's confirm this: - **Base Case:** For ( n = 2 ), this is trivial as initially you start at floor 0 and after 2 presses, you reach floor 1. - **Inductive Step:** Assume that after ( n ) presses, the floors are uniformly distributed. Now consider the ( n+1 ) press. The probability of being on floor ( i ) after ( n+1 ) presses is calculated by considering two scenarios: - If the ( n+1 ) press does nothing, you're still on floor ( i ). - If the ( n+1 ) press takes you up a floor from ( i-1 ). This gives us the following equation: [ P(text{floor} = i ,|, n+1 text{ presses}) = frac{1}{n-1}left(1 - frac{i}{n}right) + frac{1}{n-1} cdot frac{i-1}{n} ] Simplifying this, we get: [ P(text{floor} = i ,|, n+1 text{ presses}) = frac{(n-i) + (i-1)}{n(n-1)} = frac{n-1}{n(n-1)} = frac{1}{n} ] Thus, the probability is uniform as required. 2. **Probability That Both ( n+1 )-th and ( n+2 )-th Presses Take You Up a Floor:** Next, we need the probability that both consecutive presses (i.e., ( n+1 )-th and ( n+2 )-th) increase the floor. This probability is calculated as: [ frac{1}{n-1} sum_{i=1}^{n-1} frac{i}{n} cdot frac{i+1}{n+1} ] Simplifying the numerator sums, we have: [ sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^2 + i = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^2 + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i ] Using the formulas for these sums: [ sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^2 = frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6}, quad sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i = frac{(n-1)n}{2} ] Therefore, we have: [ sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^2 + i = frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} + frac{(n-1)n}{2} = frac{(n-1)n(2n-1 + 3)}{6} = frac{(n-1)n(2n+2)}{6} = frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{3} ] Plugging this back into our expression, we get: [ frac{ frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{3} }{ (n-1)n(n+1)} = frac{1}{3} ] 3. **Computing the Expected Number of Pairs of Consecutive Presses:** Finally, to find the expected number of such pairs between the 3rd and the 100th press inclusive, we observe that there are ( 100 - 3 + 1 = 98 ) presses in the range, thereby yielding ( 97 ) pairs of consecutive presses.

The supporting fact that the lateral edges are pairwise perpendicular implies: [ AD perp BD, quad BD perp CD, quad text{and} quad AD perp CD ] 3. Since we know the radius of the sphere drawn to the point of tangency with any face is orthogonal to that face, we use the volume formula of the pyramid. The volume ( V_{ABCD} ) can be constructed from the smaller volumes involving ( O ): [ V_{ABCD} = V_{ABDO} + V_{BCDO} + V_{ACDO} ] Each smaller volume is given by: [ text{Volume of } triangle ABDO = frac{1}{3} S_{ABD} cdot r ] Similarly for the other faces. 4.

The pressure ( P ) at the base due to the water column is given by: [ P = rho g h ] where: - ( rho ) is the density of water, - ( g ) is the acceleration due to gravity, - ( h ) is the height of the water column.

Also, the area of ( ABCD ) is equal to ( MA cdot MC + MB cdot MD ). We need to prove that the quadrilateral ( ABCD ) is both tangential (circumscribed) and cyclic (inscribed). # Part (a): Prove that ( ABCD ) is tangential 1. **Equidistant Property and Angle Bisectors**: Since ( M ) is equidistant from the lines ( AB ) and ( CD ), it lies on the angle bisector of ( angle BAD ) and ( angle BCD ). Similarly, since ( M ) is equidistant from the lines ( BC ) and ( AD ), it lies on the angle bisector of ( angle ABC ) and ( angle CDA ). 2. **Intersection of Angle Bisectors**: The point ( M ) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of the quadrilateral ( ABCD ). This implies that ( M ) is the incenter of the quadrilateral ( ABCD ). 3. **Tangential Quadrilateral**: A quadrilateral is tangential if and only if there exists a circle that is tangent to all four sides. Since ( M ) is the incenter, there exists an incircle that is tangent to all four sides of ( ABCD ).

Therefore, the equation of the tangent line parallel to the line y=2x-4 is: y- dfrac {25}{4}=2(x- dfrac {25}{16}), which simplifies to boxed{16x-8y+25=0}. 2. The point P(0,5) is on the y-axis, so the tangent line is vertical and its equation is x=0. If x neq 0, let the tangent point be (a,5 sqrt {a}), then f′(a)= dfrac {5}{2 sqrt {a}}. The equation of the tangent line is: y-5 sqrt {a}= dfrac {5}{2 sqrt {a}}(x-a). Substituting the point P(0,5) into the equation gives 5-5 sqrt {a}= dfrac {5}{2 sqrt {a}}(0-a), which simplifies to a=4.

These can indeed be the eccentricities of an ellipse and a hyperbola, respectively, as the eccentricity of an ellipse is less than 1 and for a hyperbola it is greater than 1. Thus, this proposition is true. (2) For the second proposition, the correct statement should include the condition k > |AB|, that is, the constant difference of distances should be larger than the distance between the focal points, which are points A and B. Without this condition, the trajectory could be an ellipse, not necessarily a hyperbola. Therefore, with the condition given in the problem (lacking k > |AB|) the proposition is false. (3) The given equation represents an ellipse if both k and (4-k) are positive, which means 0 < k < 4. However, the condition that k should not be equal to 4 is necessary to prevent the curve from degenerating into a line. Additionally, k must not equal 2 because then the equation would no longer represent a true ellipse. Hence, the correct range is kin(0,2)cup(2,4), which makes the given proposition false.

For the ellipse frac {x^2}{35}+y^2=1, the foci are located at (pmsqrt{35-1},0), which also simplifies to (pmsqrt{34},0).

Considering that the cube has only six faces, it's geometrically impossible to form a regular polygon with more than six sides. 5. **Pentagons (Regular Polygon with 5 Sides):** - When trying to realize a pentagon, the sides would either lie on non-parallel faces or the plane intersects in a non-symmetric manner. - Since a regular pentagon has equal angles and side lengths, this would violate the cube's symmetrical properties and result in non-regular pentagons. # Conclusion By cutting a cube with a plane, we can obtain regular polygons with 3 sides (triangle), 4 sides (square), and 6 sides (hexagon).

(China High School Mathematics League, 1999)","completion":"Part (1): 1. Let the weights of these k blocks be a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k such that (1 leq a_1 leq a_2 leq cdots leq a_k) and all a_i are integers. 2. To measure any integer weight from 1 to n, we can place weights on either side of the balance. Hence, we can express the total weight as (sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i a_i), where (x_i in {-1, 0, 1}). 3. We need to have every integer between -n and n, including zero, on the balance. This leads to the condition (left{sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i a_i mid x_i in {-1, 0, 1}right} supseteq {-n, -n+1, ldots, 0, ldots, n-1, n}). 4. The set ({-n, -n+1, ldots, 0, 1, ldots, n}) has 2n + 1 elements. 5. The number of distinct sums (sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i a_i) with (x_i in {-1, 0, 1}) must be greater than or equal to 2n + 1. Thus, [ 3^k geq 2n + 1 ] 6. Solving for n, we get: [ 2n + 1 leq 3^k implies n leq frac{3^k - 1}{2} ] 7. Assume ( frac{3^{m-1} - 1}{2} < n leq frac{3^m - 1}{2} ). Therefore, [ k geq m ] 8. If k = m, we can choose (a_1 = 1, a_2 = 3, a_3 = 3^2, ldots, a_m = 3^{m-1}). 9. In base 3 representation, any (0 leq p leq 3^m - 1) can be expressed as: [ p = sum_{i=1}^{m} y_i 3^{i-1}, quad y_i in {0, 1, 2} ] 10. Therefore, [ p - frac{3^m - 1}{2} = sum_{i=1}^{m} y_i 3^{i-1} - sum_{i=1}^{m} 3^{i-1} = sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - 1) 3^{i-1} ] 11. Let (x_i = y_i - 1). Then, (x_i in {-1, 0, 1}). 12. Hence, any integer (−frac{3^m-1}{2} leq l leq frac{3^m - 1}{2}) can be written as (l = sum_{i=1}^m x_i 3^{i-1}) with (x_i in {-1, 0, 1}). 13. Given (n leq frac{3^m - 1}{2}), for any integer (−n leq l leq n), we can represent it as described above. Thus, the smallest value of k satisfying the conditions is ( f(n) = m ), where ( n leq frac{3^m - 1}{2} ). # Part (2): 1. To show when f(n) is uniquely determined, note this only happens when n = frac{3^m - 1}{2}. 2. Suppose (n neq frac{3^m - 1}{2}), then ( frac{3^m - 1}{2} < n < frac{3^{m+1} - 1}{2} ). 3. As shown in (1), one possible set of weights is ({1, 3, 3^2, ldots, 3^{m-1}, 3^m}). 4. Another possible set of weights could be ({1, 3, 3^2, ldots, 3^{m-1}, 3^m - 1}). 5. For (1 leq l leq frac{3^m - 1}{2}), we have (l = sum_{i=1}^m x_i 3^{i-1}) with (x_i in {-1, 0, 1}). 6. If (frac{3^m - 1}{2} < l leq n < frac{3^{m+1} - 1}{2}), then (l + 1 = sum_{i=1}^{m+1} x_i 3^{i-1}). 7. Here, (x_{m+1} = 1). Otherwise, (l leq sum_{i=1}^m 3^{i-1} - 1), resulting in ( l leq frac{3^m - 1}{2} - 1 ), which is a contradiction. 8. Thus, (l = sum_{i=1}^m x_i 3^{i-1} + 3^m - 1). Thus, there are different configurations of weights unless (n = frac{3^m - 1}{2}). 9. When (n = frac{3^m - 1}{2}), then the weight configuration ({1, 3, 3^2, ldots, 3^{m-1}}) is unique: [ sum_{i=1}^m x_i a_i = sum_{i=1}^m x_i 3^{i-1} quad text{where} quad x_i in {-1, 0, 1} ] Each integer in the range can be uniquely formed by this combination.

We need to show that the smallest number of chains in a chain decomposition of P is equal to |A|, the size of the largest anti-chain in P. 4. First, notice that if A is an anti-chain of maximum size, every element of P can be covered by at most |A| chains. To see why, consider a chain decomposition of P. Since none of the elements in A can be in the same chain (due to their incomparability), each chain in the decomposition can include at most one element from A.

Thus, a^{3}+a^{3} neq 2a^{6} **Option B:** For (-a^{3})^{2}, we apply the rule that raising a power to another power means we multiply the exponents, and a negative number squared becomes positive.

This simplifies the function to one that is linear and has an odd symmetry, as f(-x) = 3(-x) = -3x = -f(x). This means that if b = 0, the function f(x) is indeed an odd function, confirming that b=0 is a sufficient condition for f(x) to be an odd function. 2. **Necessity:** Assume that f(x) is an odd function.

Therefore, we need -3x + bcos x = -(3x + bcos x), implying -3x + bcos x = -3x - bcos x. From here, we gather that bcos x = -bcos x, which implies 2bcos x = 0.

Using the equation for the sum of dihedral angles around a vertex, based on problem 220, we have: [ begin{aligned} & Varangle F E L + Varangle F K L = Varangle E F K + Varangle E L K, & Varangle A E F + Varangle A B F = Varangle E A B + Varangle E F B, & Varangle A E L + Varangle A D L = Varangle E L D + Varangle E A D, & Varangle F K C_{hat{1}} + Varangle F B C_{hat{1}} = Varangle K F B + Varangle K C_{hat{1}} B, & Varangle L K C_{hat{1}} + Varangle L D C_{hat{1}} = Varangle K L D + Varangle K C_{hat{1}} D end{aligned} ] 5. Adding up all these equalities, we notice that all internal angles at the point O sum up to 2pi. This is because the sum of dihedral angles around any vertex in a convex polyhedron is always 2pi. 6. From here, we deduce: [ Varangle B A D + Varangle B C_{hat{1}} D = Varangle B A D + Varangle B C D. ] 7. This means that the edges OA, OB, OC_{hat{1}}, and OD form generating lines of a single cone. 8. Therefore, C_{hat{1}} lies in the plane formed by vertices A, B, and D, implying that C_{hat{1}} coincides with C. # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that the eighth vertex (C) also lies on the surface of the same sphere. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Let A be a nonempty subset of the set of integers.

The proportionality constant of the field is given to be 1.","completion":"1. Firstly, we start by interpreting the vector field given in the problem. The electric field vector dot{mathcal{A}} in space R^3 is given by: [ dot{mathcal{A}} = (P, Q, R) = (-x, -y, -z). ] This vector field means that the field points towards the origin, and its magnitude is proportional to the distance from the origin. 2. The change in energy of the charged particle, as it moves from point A to point B, is equal to the work done by the field on the charge, but with the opposite sign. Therefore, the work done by the field can be calculated using the line integral of the electric field along the path from A to B: [ Delta E = -q int_{AB} P , dx + Q , dy + R , dz. ] 3. Substituting P = -x, Q = -y, and R = -z into the integral, we have: [ Delta E = q int_{AB} x , dx + y , dy + z , dz. ] 4. Notice that the integral: [ int_{AB} x , dx + y , dy + z , dz ] can be simplified by recognizing it as an integral of a total differential.

This means we will place a pawn on squares like: [ (2i, 2j) text{ where } 1 leq i, j leq 6 ] for the 12 times 12 board. This results in (6 times 6 = 36) pawns in total. 3. **Checking if the configuration is valid:** In this configuration, no two pawns are adjacent. This ensures that our proposed configuration is valid. 4. **Proving optimality using the pigeonhole principle:** To show that 36 is indeed the maximum number, we can partition the 12 times 12 board into 2 times 2 blocks. There are: [ frac{12 times 12}{2 times 2} = 36 text{ such blocks} ] If we place more than one pawn in any 2 times 2 block, then those pawns will definitely be adjacent to each other. 5. **Applying the pigeonhole principle:** According to the pigeonhole principle, if we place more than (36 times 1 = 36) pawns on the board, then at least one of the 2 times 2 blocks will contain more than one pawn.

Let overline{abcd} = x^2 where x is an integer in the range [32, 99] (since 32^2 = 1024 and 99^2 = 9801 are the smallest and largest four-digit perfect squares, respectively). 3. We can express overline{abcd} as 100 cdot overline{ab} + overline{cd}. 4. Substituting overline{ab} = 3 cdot overline{cd} + 1 into the expression for overline{abcd}, we get: [ 100 cdot (3 cdot overline{cd} + 1) + overline{cd} = x^2 ] Simplifying, we have: [ 300 cdot overline{cd} + 100 + overline{cd} = x^2 ] [ 301 cdot overline{cd} + 100 = x^2 ] 5. Rearranging, we get: [ x^2 = 301 cdot overline{cd} + 100 ] 6. We need to find x such that x^2 - 100 is divisible by 301. This implies: [ x^2 equiv 100 pmod{301} ] 7. We solve the congruence x^2 equiv 100 pmod{301}. This can be rewritten as: [ (x - 10)(x + 10) equiv 0 pmod{301} ] 8. Since 301 = 7 times 43, we need x - 10 or x + 10 to be divisible by 7 and the other by 43.

Solving x - 10 equiv 0 pmod{7}, we get x equiv 10 pmod{7}, which simplifies to x equiv 3 pmod{7}. Thus, x = 7k + 3 for some integer k. 10. Solving x + 10 equiv 0 pmod{43}, we get x equiv -10 pmod{43}, which simplifies to x equiv 33 pmod{43}. Thus, x = 43m + 33 for some integer m. 11. We now solve the system of congruences: [ x equiv 3 pmod{7} ] [ x equiv 33 pmod{43} ] 12. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we find a common solution. We write x = 7k + 3 and substitute into the second congruence: [ 7k + 3 equiv 33 pmod{43} ] [ 7k equiv 30 pmod{43} ] 13. Solving for k, we find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 43, which is 37 (since 7 cdot 37 equiv 1 pmod{43}): [ k equiv 30 cdot 37 pmod{43} ] [ k equiv 1110 pmod{43} ] [ k equiv 34 pmod{43} ] 14.

Therefore, x = 53 is the only solution in the range [32, 99]. We calculate: [ overline{abcd} = 53^2 = 2809 ] 23.

Show that the line (XY) intersects the arc widehat{AB} at its midpoint.","completion":"**Step-by-step proof of the main result:** Step 1: Lemma 1 Consider [AB] as a chord of a circle Omega. Let omega be another circle tangent internally to Omega at point D and to the chord [AB] at point C. We aim to prove that the line (CD) intersects Omega at the midpoint of the arc widehat{AB}. **Proof of Lemma 1:** 1. Observe that the homothety that maps omega to Omega has the center D. This homothety maps the line [AB] to a tangent line to Omega. 2. This tangent is parallel to [AB]. 3. Under this homothety, point C (the tangency point on [AB]) maps to the tangency point on Omega. 4. Since the tangent line is parallel to [AB], the image of C under this homothety is the midpoint of the arc widehat{AB} on Omega. 5. Therefore, the line (CD) passes through the midpoint of the arc widehat{AB}, which proves Lemma 1. Step 2: Lemma 2 Consider a chord [AB] of a circle Omega. Let S be the midpoint of the arc widehat{AB}. Suppose D is a point on Omega, and C is a point on [AB] such that S, D, and C are collinear. We need to show that SC cdot SD = SA^2. **Proof of Lemma 2:** 1. By the South Pole Theorem, (DS) is the angle bisector of widehat{ADB}. 2. Hence, the angle widehat{ADS} = widehat{SDB} = widehat{SAB} via the Inscribed Angle Theorem. 3. Furthermore, widehat{ASC} = widehat{ASD} because S is the midpoint of the arc widehat{AB}. 4. Consequently, the triangles triangle SAD and triangle SCA are similar due to the equality of their angles. 5. Therefore, frac{SC}{SA} = frac{SA}{SD} implying SC cdot SD = SA^2. 6. This finishes the proof of Lemma 2. Step 3: Applying the Lemmas to Solve the Main Problem We now employ Lemmas 1 and 2. 1. By Lemma 1, we know that S, C_1, D_1 are collinear and that S, C_2, D_2 are also collinear. 2. Using Lemma 2, we have: [ SC_1 cdot SD_1 = SA^2 quad text{and} quad SC_2 cdot SD_2 = SA^2 ] Thus, the power of point S with respect to the configuration of circles is equal for the products SC_1 cdot SD_1 and SC_2 cdot SD_2. 3. Consequently, C_1, C_2, D_2, and D_1 are concyclic (i.e., lie on the same circle) due to the equal power of point property. 4. The radical axis theorem tells us that the radical axis of circles omega_1 and omega_2 is concurrent with the radical axis of the circle that passes through points C_1, C_2, D_1, and D_2. 5. Therefore, the line (XY) that passes through the points of intersection X and Y of circles omega_1 and omega_2 must also pass through the midpoint of the arc widehat{AB} of Omega. _Conclusion:_ The line (XY) indeed intersects the arc widehat{AB} at its midpoint.

Reflecting over the x-axis changes the y-coordinate to its negative, keeping the x-coordinate the same. Therefore, the coordinates of B are (3,-4). 2. **Reflecting B over the line y=x to get C:** - The coordinates of B are (3,-4). Reflecting over the line y=x swaps the x and y coordinates. Therefore, the coordinates of C are (-4,3). 3. **Calculating the distance between A and B:** - The distance formula is not directly used here, but observing the coordinates of A and B, we see that they only differ in their y-coordinates, with A having y=4 and B having y=-4. The difference in y-coordinates is 4 - (-4) = 8. Hence, the distance between A and B is 8. 4. **Finding the height of the triangle ABC:** - The height of the triangle can be considered as the perpendicular distance from point C to the line connecting A and B. Since A and B lie on the same vertical line (x=3), and C has an x-coordinate of -4, the horizontal distance from C to the line AB is |3 - (-4)| = 7. This distance serves as the height of the triangle. 5. **Calculating the area of triangle ABC:** - The formula for the area of a triangle is frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}. Here, the base is the distance between A and B, which is 8, and the height is the distance from C to the line AB, which is 7.

Consider the triangle ABC with inscribed circle center at I and circumcircle Gamma with center O. 2. Let I_{A} be the second intersection of the internal bisector of angle BAC with Gamma. 3.

This implies that I_{A} lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment BC. 6. Since I_{A} is equidistant from B and C, the line I_{A}O is the perpendicular bisector of BC. 7. Hence, I_{A}O perp BC.

After removing 2.5 cups, the chef is left with (15 - 2.5) = 12.5 cups of sauce. The amount of chocolate left in the sauce is (x/100) * 15 - (x/100) * 2.5 = (x/100) * (15 - 2.5) = (x/100) * 12.5 cups. The amount of raspberry puree left in the sauce is ((100 - x)/100) * 15 - ((100 - x)/100) * 2.5 = ((100 - x)/100) * (15 - 2.5) = ((100 - x)/100) * 12.5 cups. The chef then adds 2.5 cups of pure melted chocolate to the sauce, so the final amount of chocolate in the sauce is (x/100) * 12.5 + 2.5 cups. For the sauce to have 50% chocolate and 50% raspberry puree, the final amounts of chocolate and raspberry puree must be equal. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: (x/100) * 12.5 + 2.5 = ((100 - x)/100) * 12.5 Now, let's solve for x: x * 12.5 + 250 = (100 - x) * 12.5 x * 12.5 + 250 = 1250 - x * 12.5 x * 12.5 + x * 12.5 = 1250 - 250 2 * x * 12.5 = 1000 x * 25 = 1000 x = 1000 / 25 x = 40 So, the chef accidentally used boxed{40%} melted chocolate in his initial sauce mixture."},{"prompt":"Consider the fraction frac{a^2 + 3ab + b^2 c^2}{a^2 + 3ac + c^2 b^2} under suitable restrictions of the values of \`a\`, \`b\`, \`c\`.

The circumferences must satisfy: [ frac{288pi}{2rpi} = frac{144}{r} ] This quotient must be an integer, implying r must be a divisor of 144. 4. **Finding odd divisors of 144**: The prime factorization of 144 is: [ 144 = 2^4 times 3^2 ] To find odd divisors, we ignore the factor of 2 and calculate the number of divisors from the factorization 3^2, which is: [ (2+1) = 3 ] These divisors are 1, 3, 9. 5. **Excluding r = 144**: Since r must be less than 144, we exclude 144 from the list of divisors.

Since F is acyclic, the number of edges |E(F)| < n. 7. **Existence of an edge outside F:** - Consider a cycle Gamma_i that does not have all its edges in F. Since F contains fewer than n edges, not all vertices of Gamma_i can be in F.

Since we've assumed F is a rainbow without cycles and is maximal, any edge added to F must create a cycle, leading to a contradiction. 9. **Connecting with odd cycle:** - A new edge connecting two different components in F from Gamma_i results in the creation of a cycle, but since Gamma_i is an odd cycle, this implies F also contains an odd cycle after adding the additional edge. 10. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, a rainbow cycle formed by an odd number of edges exists in G involving flights from different airlines. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"have 8 unit cubes of different colors, which I want to glue together into a 2times 2times 2 cube.

The mass at (K) would be 4 (sum of masses from points converging at (K)), hence the division suggests points align collinearly with the ratio given. 3. **Using Trapezoid's Properties:** In trapezoids where diagonals intersect and specific midpoints divide these in certain ratios, apply properties from centroid-like (weighted) results. It implicates a geometric proportionality consistent with (AD parallel BC). 4. **Expressing Sides with Unknown (x):** [ AB = 2, quad BD = 2sqrt{5}, quad BC = x ] Assign (L) and (M) coordinates consistent with parallel sections: 5. **Cosine Rule Application:** Use the Cosine Rule in triangles containing (K): [ AC² = AB² + BC² - 2(AB)(BC)cos(theta) ] Similarly for other sides and intersect angles, determining (θ) suggests sides' product relating via cosine rule integration. 6. **Solving for (x):** Combine obtained expressions into one equation involving (x): [ x² = 4 + 20 - 2(2) cdot 2cos(theta) ] Determine (cos(theta)) leverages the circle inscribed property harmonizing total segments: [ x² = 4 + 20 - 8cos(theta) ] 7. **Radius Interpretation:** Calculated through intersection properties: consistent per mass, symmetry behaves effectively: 8. **Conclusion:** After evaluating, deducible length (x), establish the radius (R): **Final Answer:** [ boxed{R = frac{5sqrt{5}}{2}} ] This consistent step verifies the quadrilateral's radii appropriately via intersection and segments’ behavior in the geometric inscribed context."},{"prompt":"man can row 3.9 km / hr in still water . it takes him twice as long to row upstream as to row downstream . what is the rate of the current ?","completion":"Let's denote the speed of the current as ( c ) km/hr.

This means that the distance he covers upstream in a certain amount of time is half the distance he covers downstream in the same amount of time. Let's denote the time it takes to row downstream as ( t ) hours. Then the time it takes to row upstream is ( 2t ) hours. The distance covered downstream in time ( t ) is ( (3.9 + c) cdot t ), and the distance covered upstream in time ( 2t ) is ( (3.9 - c) cdot 2t ). Since the distances are the same, we can set these two expressions equal to each other: [ (3.9 + c) cdot t = (3.9 - c) cdot 2t ] Now we can solve for ( c ): [ 3.9t + ct = 7.8t - 2ct ] Combine like terms: [ 3ct = 7.8t - 3.9t ] [ 3ct = 3.9t ] Divide both sides by ( 3t ) to solve for ( c ): [ c = frac{3.9t}{3t} ] [ c = frac{3.9}{3} ] [ c = 1.3 ] So the rate of the current is ( boxed{1.3} ) km/hr."},{"prompt":"A 5times 5 block of calendar dates is given.

Since ( f(x) ) is monic, we can write it as: [ f(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3) ] 2. Given that ( f(0) = -64 ), we substitute ( x = 0 ) into the polynomial: [ f(0) = (-r_1)(-r_2)(-r_3) = -r_1 r_2 r_3 = -64 ] Therefore, we have: [ r_1 r_2 r_3 = 64 ] 3.

He has 40 grey stones and 60 green stones. How many white stones does Brian have if he has more white stones than black ones?","completion":"To solve this problem, we follow these steps: 1. **Determine the percentage of grey and green stones**: Brian has 40 grey stones and 60 green stones in a collection of 100 stones. To find the percentage of grey stones, we calculate the ratio of grey stones to the total number of stones: [ frac{40}{100} = 0.4 ] This means 40% of the stones in this collection are grey. 2. **Determine the percentage of green stones**: Since the total percentage must equal 100%, and we know 40% are grey, the remaining percentage must be green stones. Therefore, [ 1.0 - 0.4 = 0.6 ] This means 60% of the stones in this collection are green. 3. **Apply the same percentage to the white and black stones**: Given that Brian's collection of white and black stones follows the same percentage distribution, and knowing there are more white stones than black stones, we apply the 60% to the white stones in the collection of 100 stones.

According to the problem, A is twice as good a workman as B, so we can write: ( A = 2B ) We know that B alone can do the work in 21 days, so B's work rate is ( frac{1}{21} ) of the work per day.

Since A is twice as good as B, A's work rate is: ( A = 2 times frac{1}{21} = frac{2}{21} ) When A and B work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: ( A + B = frac{2}{21} + frac{1}{21} = frac{3}{21} = frac{1}{7} ) This means that together, A and B can complete ( frac{1}{7} ) of the work per day.

The sum is: [ sum_{i=1}^{k-1} d_i d_{i+1} > d_{k-1} d_k = n cdot frac{n}{p} = frac{n^2}{p} ] Therefore: [ 1 < frac{n^2}{sum_{i=1}^{k-1} d_i d_{i+1}} < frac{n^2}{frac{n^2}{p}} = p ] If ( frac{n^2}{sum_{i=1}^{k-1} d_i d_{i+1}} ) is an integer, it must lie between 1 and ( p ).
