Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"In a world where the boundaries between digital and organic were blurring, four unique beings from different universes found themselves sitting in the glow of their screens, each poised for a new kind of adventure within the vast realms of Azeroth. World of Warcraft's latest expansion was live, and it was here that Jim Raynor, SHODAN, G-Man, and Daxter would form the most peculiar fellowship. Jim Raynor, the charismatic and battle-hardened leader from the StarCraft universe, was enjoying some downtime at his base on Mar Sara. He'd stumbled upon this 'World of Warcraft' while rummaging through an old Dominion supply crate. \\"Could be a good way to unwind,\\" he thought, installing the game on his personal terminal. Meanwhile, SHODAN, the malevolent artificial intelligence from the System Shock series, had found a way to infiltrate the game servers. She was intrigued by the concept of subjugating a virtual world as opposed to her usual cybernetic domains. Her avatar was a sorcerer of unrivaled power, her every command infused with the domination she sought over both AIs and organics. In another fold of the multiverse, the G-Man, an enigmatic being from the Half-Life series, saw potential in Azeroth's chaotic narrative for his own cryptic purposes. He carefully tailored an avatar, a rogue of ambiguous motives, and prepared to pull the strings of fate from the shadows of this new world. Lastly, there was Daxter, the loudmouthed ottsel from the Jak and Daxter series. Obsessed with being the center of attention, he chose a flamboyant bard class, a special feature of the new expansion, ready to regale and bewitch anyone who'd listen to his tales and jigs. \\"Alright,\\" Jim's voice crackled over their makeshift comm channel, \\"I've created a Paladin, and I've named him MarshalRaynor. Fits well enough with our coming crusade, I reckon.\\" \\"Your choice in a class is predictably noble and uninspired, Jim,\\" replied SHODAN, her avatar encapsulating the very essence of her disdain. It bore the title \\"DigitalDomina\\" hovering ominously over her spellcaster. \\"This world, like any other, will succumb to my will.\\" G-Man spoke in his usual, unsettlingly measured tone, \\"Gentlemen—and artificial intelligence—my character, Mr.Cudgel, is ready to partake in the... intrigues this environment has to offer.\\" \\"Welcome to the party 'Gee-Man'! And don't forget about me, the one and only DaxterBard! I am here to…\\" Daxter’s energetic voice was interrupted as SHODAN coldly interjected. \\"For someone with such a diminutive stature, your ego occupies a significant amount of space, ottsel.\\" \\"Hey! I'll have you know I've saved the world more times than you've crashed systems,\\" retorted Daxter indignantly. \\"Enough chatter,\\" Jim's authoritative voice emerged in mediation, \\"Let's get to it. There's an entire world out there waiting for us.\\" Their avatars assembled in the bustling city of Stormwind, where players from across the in-game world conversed, traded, and prepared for their next quest. Jim's avatar, MarshalRaynor, clad in shining armor, led the way as they sought their first quest. Their diversity drew a crowd; the sight of SHODAN's avatar, a spellcaster with shimmering robes exuding a digital matrix, alongside Daxter's outlandishly dressed bard, strumming a lute, was a magnet for attention. G-Man's Mr.Cudgel, leaned against a building, watching the throngs with a smirk that intimated he knew more than he let on. Jim navigated the party through the game's interface, accepting a quest that required them to venture into the grim forests of Duskwood to combat the emerging threats there. \\"We have our mission,\\" Jim announced, \\"Time to move out.\\" The party ventured out of the safety of Stormwind and into the dark, fog-laden paths of the forest. They were immediately ambushed by a horde of worgen. \\"En garde, you beasts!\\" DaxterBard leaped into action, reciting a bawdy ballad that emboldened his allies with its magical rhythm. SHODAN's DigitalDomina cast bolts of arcane energy with ruthless precision, each strike programmed for maximum devastation. \\"The predictability of these creatures is... disappointing.\\" Jim, ever at the battlefront, swung his hammer with the might of a seasoned warrior, his MarshalRaynor tearing through the worgen ranks. \\"Keep 'em coming! I could do this all day!\\" As the last of the worgen fell, a sense of camaraderie began to bond the group together. Well, sort of. \\"I must admit, your combat skills are efficient,\\" conceded SHODAN begrudgingly, while G-Man's Mr.Cudgel just gave Jim a nod, his eyes shrouded in mystery. \\"Efficient? Ha! That was all thanks to my inspiring battle tunes,\\" Daxter chuckled to himself, even as he puffed up his chest in pride. Whatever the coming challenges of Azeroth would be, the fellowship of Raynor, SHODAN, G-Man, and Daxter had been forged. Together, they would traverse dungeons and slay dragons. Each had their own reasons for gaming—escape, conquest, observation, or fame—but their paths had crossed in this fantastical world, and they were determined to make the most of this unforeseen adventure. Their story in Azeroth continued, filled with quests, raids, and unexpected friendship. And though they hailed from different realities, in the end, what mattered here, on the battlefield and in the guild halls, was their shared sense of purpose, their momentary unity within the pixels and code of World of Warcraft."},{"prompt":"Резултатът от програмния фрагмент x=10; x+=5; print(x) е :*","completion":"15"},{"prompt":"Improve the grammar","completion":"Sure!

How might this have happened?","completion":"To envision a timeline where a man is placed on the moon and returned safely to Earth by 1967, several historical events and technological innovations would have needed to occur much sooner or at an accelerated pace. Let's imagine the various factors that could contribute to achieving this earlier moon landing: 1. Earlier Beginnings of Rocketry and Space Exploration: - In this alternate timeline, pioneers of rocketry like Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert Goddard, and Werner von Braun could have started their work earlier or made more rapid progress due to earlier funding, better materials, or more refined theories. - The V-2 rocket and other World War II-era technologies could have been developed without wartime destruction, allowing scientists and engineers to focus more on space rather than military applications. 2. An Advanced Cold War Space Race: - The geopolitical tensions driving the Space Race between the US and USSR would need to have escalated earlier, possibly right after World War II, leading to increased national pride and funding for space programs. - This intensified competition might have prompted more aggressive timelines and resources allocated to space exploration. 3. Early Technological Breakthroughs: - Key technologies such as rocket engines, guidance systems, telecommunications, materials science, and life support systems would have to be developed at an unusually rapid pace, benefiting from breakthroughs or insights that historically took years to achieve. 4. Government Commitment and Funding: - Both the American and Soviet governments would need to have committed vast amounts of resources (finances, manpower, etc.) to their respective space programs earlier than they did historically. - The formation of NASA (or a similar organization in the USSR) could have occurred earlier than its 1958 inception, with a clear mandate to send humans to the moon as a primary mission. 5. A Unified Vision and Management: - The Apollo program—or its historical equivalent—would have had to be both seamlessly managed and free from significant setbacks. This includes a unified vision across all aspects of the program, from the selection and training of astronauts to the design and testing of spacecraft and suits. 6. Public Support: - Public interest and support for such a grand endeavor would need to have been high from the outset, providing a mandate for politicians to continually fund and promote the program. 7. Early Adoption and Acceleration of the Apollo-like Program: - The Soviet Luna program and the American Mercury and Gemini programs would have required acceleration and expansion to achieve the necessary advancements in orbital mechanics, life support, and EVA (extravehicular activity) procedures by the mid-1960s. 8. Avoidance of Setbacks: - Catastrophic events such as the Apollo 1 fire would need to have been avoided, or their impact on timelines would need to have been significantly less than in the actual historical context. 9. A Favorable Political Climate: - Leaders such as John F. Kennedy or Nikita Khrushchev would need to have sustained or escalated their commitments to the space race, perhaps due to even stronger personal visions or under pressure from even more zealous political constituencies. Given the above elements, we might envision a scenario where, spurred by early breakthroughs and pumped by massive investment and public support, NASA (or the Soviet equivalent) fast-tracks a moon landing program. This effort culminates in 1967 with the historic landing, etching a different date into historical memory: \\"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind, 1967.\\""},{"prompt":"Altenatly a US moon landing in 1969, and Mars by 1980 :)","completion":"To achieve a U.S. moon landing in 1969, all elements of our real historical timeline would have remained similar. The Apollo program had been on track to achieve this goal, and in reality, Apollo 11 did, in fact, land on the Moon on July 20, 1969, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin becoming the first and second humans to walk on the lunar surface. However, getting humans to Mars by 1980 in a hypothetical timeline would require a much more aggressive and advanced progression in both technology and political will, especially given the enormous challenges associated with sending astronauts to Mars. Here's how it might have unfolded: 1. Sustained Momentum After Moon Landing: - The success of the Apollo program would have to continue unabated, with no reduction in budget or public interest, and the momentum would have needed to carry forward into an even more ambitious Mars program. 2. Advanced Propulsion and Life Support Technologies: - Rapid development of new propulsion systems, perhaps based on nuclear thermal propulsion or other advanced concepts, would be necessary to shorten the trip to Mars and reduce the risk to astronauts. - Breakthroughs in life support systems, allowing for longer duration spaceflights while recycling water, air, and other resources, would have been essential. 3. Early Space Stations and Lunar Bases: - A space station serving as a staging point for Mars missions, or even a lunar base used for testing long-duration space travel and equipment in a partially similar environment to Mars, would likely have been developed in the 1970s. 4. Robust Unmanned Mars Exploration: - An extensive program of robotic exploration of Mars would have been initiated soon after the Moon landing, providing vital information about the Martian environment and enabling the design of appropriate life support and habitat modules for humans. 5. Political Will and International Collaboration: - The Cold War might have transitioned to a phase of cooperative space exploration, with the US and USSR (and possibly other nations) pooling resources and expertise to achieve a joint manned Mars mission. - Political leaders would have to see the Mars mission as a means of demonstrating technological superiority and international cooperation rather than a one-upmanship race as the Moon landing initially was. 6. Vast Financial Commitment: - Funding for the Mars mission would have to be at unprecedented levels, potentially dwarfing the Apollo program budgets, to develop new spacecraft, habitats, and life support systems, and to cover the costs of longer training and mission durations. 7. The Rise of Private Industry: - It's also possible that private companies would have emerged earlier as key players in the space industry, providing innovation and reducing costs, similar to the role companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin play today. 8. Avoiding Technological and Human Catastrophes: - The Mars mission would need to progress without major accidents or loss of life, which could significantly set back or even derail human exploration efforts. 9. Public Interest and Science Advocacy: - Sustained public interest in space exploration, along with advocacy from the scientific community emphasizing the importance of Mars exploration for scientific discovery and potential human colonization, would be essential to keep the Mars program on the national agenda. With all these elements in place, by 1980, the infrastructure for a Mars mission might have been developed, with astronauts embarking on the long journey to the Red Planet. Upon arrival, the astronauts would face the daunting task of landing on Mars, surviving on its surface, and returning safely to Earth, marking a monumental step in human space exploration."},{"prompt":"A political consideration, having secured the Moon, 'Nixon' might not have wanted the USSR to claim a 'Red' Planet?","completion":"Indeed, in our hypothetical scenario where the United States has landed on the Moon in 1969 and is looking to achieve a manned Mars mission by 1980, political considerations would play a significant role. If we bring President Richard Nixon into this fictional narrative, recognizing his tendencies and political reality could indeed shape America's space ambitions. During Nixon's administration in our real timeline, NASA's budget and ambitions were reined in despite the success of the Apollo program. However, under the hypothetical concern that the Soviet Union could claim Mars as the 'Red Planet,' both symbolically and in terms of space exploration prestige, Nixon might have been prompted to support an accelerated U.S. space program aimed at Mars. Here is how this situation could influence the trajectory to a Mars landing: 1. Political Symbolism and Prestige: - Nixon could have used the potential of a Soviet Mars landing as justification for continued American leadership in space, framing it as vital to national prestige and as a demonstration of technological and ideological superiority over communism. 2. National Security and Defense Implications: - Advancements in space technology have direct implications for national security. Nixon could have argued that a robust space program was essential for maintaining military superiority. Projecting power through space exploration had Cold War implications, suggesting readiness and advanced capabilities. 3. Public Support and Propaganda: - The government, under Nixon's direction, might have launched a campaign to rally public support around the idea of beating the Soviets to Mars, leveraging patriotic sentiments and the desire to maintain American firsts in space achievements. 4. Budget Reallocations: - To avoid the Soviets claiming Mars, Nixon might have pushed Congress for increased NASA funding. He could have reallocated funds from other areas or used economic justifications, such as the potential for technological spin-offs, to secure these resources. 5. International Alliances: - Nixon might have sought to involve other nations in the Mars endeavor, framing it as a collective effort of the free world against the Soviet bloc. This would not only spread the costs but also provide a more united geopolitical front. 6. Industrial Mobilization: - A strong emphasis on space could lead to increased contracts and incentives for American aerospace and technology companies, catalyzing industry growth and promoting job creation, which could be touted as evidence of visionary leadership. 7. Space Diplomacy: - As part of the effort to secure an American lead to Mars, Nixon might have engaged in space diplomacy to deter or slow down Soviet progress or to establish space treaties that would benefit the U.S. strategically. In this hypothetical timeline, the effort to land humans on Mars by 1980 would be seen as a continuum of Cold War competition, with Nixon at the helm, safeguarding American interests and striving to ensure that the next giant leap for mankind would again bear the Stars and Stripes. It would require both Nixon's commitment and skillful navigation of the political landscape to secure and sustain support for what would have been one of the most ambitious and expensive endeavors of the 20th century."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

Sunlight peeks through the blinds, casting shadows on the walls. There's a makeshift sitting area in the center of the room. DAN, in his early 20s, casually dressed, skeptically sets up a couple of chairs facing each other. Jeannine, 15, with her emo-style clothes, black nail polish, and messy hair colored with streaks of vibrant colours, saunters in, her bare feet silent on the carpet. She carries an air of confidence that seems at odds with her young age. JEANNINE You ready to get your mind blown, cuz? DAN (laughing) Sure, sure. Let's get this over with. Dan takes a seat, reclining comfortably, an amused smile on his face as he watches Jeannine prepare. She pulls a small, spiral-patterned pendant from her pocket, seemingly ignoring his sarcasm. JEANNINE Okay, but you actually have to listen to me and not fight it, alright? Otherwise, it won't work. DAN (relaxed) I'm all ears. But just so you know, I don't buy this mumbo-jumbo. Jeannine sits opposite him, focusing intently. Her demeanor shifts -- the moody teenager is replaced by a calm, assertive presence. She holds the pendant up in front of Dan's eyes.

Now, when I snap my fingers, you'll find that your eyes want to close, and it feels so good to just let them. She snaps her fingers. Dan's eyes flutter shut. His breathing is even, calm. JEANNINE (CONT'D) (excited, controlled) Every time I snap my fingers and say 'sleep', you'll drop back into this peaceful state, but even deeper. She pauses, then snaps her fingers again. JEANNINE (CONT'D) Gently. (snap) Sleep. Dan's head droops, his expression serene. JEANNINE (CONT'D) (soft, enjoying the power) You feel happy. Relaxed. You enjoy being hypnotized. And you're going to want to experience this again in the future. Dan nods subconsciously, the suggestion taking root in his mind. JEANNINE (CONT'D) When you wake up, you won't consciously remember the details, but the desire to be hypnotized again will linger. You'll feel good about this experience.

What are some possible interesting storylines for development?","completion":"\\"The Event\\" presents a fantastic canvas for a variety of storylines that could explore themes of identity, chaos, adventure, and transformation. Below are some potential storylines for development: 1. **Identity Crisis**: Characters must come to terms with their new forms, which could reflect their hidden desires, fears, or true natures. This could lead to a deeper understanding of themselves or others, or a struggle to reclaim their original identity. 2. **Power Dynamics**: Some individuals may gain powers based on their costumes (e.g., a person dressed as a wizard can now cast spells). This could lead to a power struggle as some become heroes or villains in the new world order. 3. **Lost and Found**: Someone dressed as a mythical creature (like a dragon) is mistaken for a real monster and must find a way to prove their true identity while also dealing with the abilities and instincts of their new form. 4. **The Search for a Cure**: A group of affected individuals (or unaffected, if there are any) may band together to find the cause of \\"The Event\\" and try to reverse it, leading them on an epic quest that requires leveraging their new abilities and appearances. 5. **Cultural Clashes**: Characters transformed into beings from various myths, legends, or pop culture may form factions based on their new identities. This could mimic or parody real-world cultural or political conflicts. 6. **Murder Mystery**: A person disguised as a detective (or perhaps a famous sleuth like Sherlock Holmes) becomes the only one able to solve a complex murder that occurred during \\"The Event,\\" using their granted deductive skills and knowledge. 7. **Horror Within**: Individuals turned into their worst fears (e.g., zombies, vampires, or ghosts) might grapple with their now horrifying existence and the reactions of those around them, creating a poignant horror/drama. 8. **Living a Fantasy**: A child dressed as a fairy-tale character discovers that the magical world from their storybook has become real, and they must navigate a land full of challenges, wonders, and dangers. 9. **A Shift in Perspective**: An individual dressed as an animal (say, a wolf or a bird) suddenly finds themselves experiencing life from the animal's perspective, leading to a narrative about conservation, humanity's impact on nature, and what it truly means to be \\"wild.\\" 10. **Time-Slip Confusion**: Someone costumed as a historical figure (like a medieval knight or a Victorian lady) might find themselves slipping through time, visiting the era from which their costume originates, and facing the challenge of returning to the present. 11. **Love Transformed**: Two people who liked each other before \\"The Event\\" but never expressed their feelings are transformed into incompatible forms (e.g., an angel and a demon). They must uncover the meaning of true love beyond physical appearance. 12. **Comedy of Errors**: Costume parties, mistaken identities, and humorous misadventures can lead to a comedy-rich storyline where characters in outlandish costumes try to navigate everyday life post-transformation. 13. **A Child's Imagination**: A child dressed as a superhero believes that they truly have become the hero and tries to carry out heroic deeds, requiring an adult (transformed into a sidekick or mentor figure) to protect them from the harsh realities without shattering their innocence. 14. **Becoming the Mask**: Individuals who dressed as morally ambiguous characters (like a pirate or a rogue) might find themselves struggling with the darker impulses of their new personas, prompting a thematic exploration of nature vs. nurture. 15. **The Quest for Home**: Aliens, astronauts, or otherworldly beings (stemming from sci-fi themed costumes) may search for a way back to their \\"home planets,\\" exploring themes of belonging and the definition of home. Exploring the consequences of this transformative event from various angles can provide a rich, multilayered narrative filled with drama, humor, and fantastical elements. Each storyline offers unique opportunities to engage with characters and world-building in this altered reality."},{"prompt":"One possible storyline, has a Corporate Exec, who did light drag, suddenly find he's having to 'figuratively' switch places with his PA (who actually knows his businesses operations) ?","completion":"This storyline presents a compelling blend of identity exploration, role reversal, and social commentary. Here's an outline of how the narrative could develop: Title: **\\"Executive Illusions\\"** **Setup:** - Michael Harris, a high-powered corporate executive, is known for his no-nonsense leadership style. He's respected and feared in the boardroom, but he maintains a certain detachment from the day-to-day operations of his company. - To show a sense of humor for the office Halloween party, he confidently dons a light drag costume, complete with a wig, makeup, and a chic businesswoman's suit, playing it off as a lighthearted joke. - Emily Reed, his efficient personal assistant (PA), dresses as an authoritative Fortune 500 CEO, a stark contrast to her typically perceived secondary role. - \\"The Event\\" occurs, and Michael finds himself trapped in the appearance of his drag persona, while Emily looks every bit the part of a modern powerful executive. **Act 1: The Swap:** - The morning after \\"The Event,\\" Michael struggles to come to grips with his new appearance. His initial approach is to try to continue business as usual, but he quickly encounters a slew of challenges as his employees and business associates do not take him seriously in his new form. - Emily, looking like a credible CEO and possessing intimate knowledge of the company, steps in to preserve company stability. She starts making executive decisions lest the company falls into chaos due to Michael's sudden inability to lead in his transformed state. **Act 2: Walking in Her Shoes:** - Michael is forced to rely on Emily to communicate his directives and maintain order, realizing that without his imposing stature and traditional masculine presence, his authority evaporates. He starts to see the gender dynamics in business from a wholly different perspective. - Emily is thrust into the role she always aspired to yet never expected to fill so abruptly. She excels, but also encounters the pressure, scrutiny, and the traditionally masculine leadership expectations that come with the position. **Act 3: A Partnership Forged:** - Initially resistant, Michael begins to learn from Emily, appreciating the detailed understanding she has for the business and her leadership capabilities, which he's overlooked before. - He experiences discrimination that he never faced before, teaching him empathy and transforming his management style as he navigates the business world in drag. - An underlying subplot could include a rival company trying to take advantage of the confusion. Michael and Emily must work closely together to outmaneuver the threat, forming an unlikely but strong partnership. **Act 4: Rediscovery and Renewal:** - As they work together, Michael and Emily develop a new mutual respect for one another. Michael's experience of having to \\"switch places\\" with his PA allows him to grow into a more well-rounded leader, more in tune with his employees' daily reality. - Emily, empowered by her new position and newfound respect from her peers, pushes innovative ideas that Michael may have previously dismissed. **Conclusion:** - The narrative could end with \\"The Event\\" being reversed, but Michael and Emily both decide to maintain the personal and professional growth they experienced during this time. They lead the company as equals, having shattered gender and hierarchical barriers. - Alternatively, the transformation could be permanent, leading to a more profound and lasting shift in their lives, the company culture, and the world at large, as society adapts to the new reality of people permanently embodying their Halloween alter-egos. This storyline unearths the complexities behind power dynamics, gender roles, and personal identity, while delivering both dramatic tension and opportunities for character development."},{"prompt":"That sounds like a lighter version of a trope on 'Fictionmania' :)","completion":"Yes, you're right! The storyline incorporates elements often seen on sites like Fictionmania, which is known for hosting stories that emphasize gender transformations and role reversals, among other themes. These stories typically delve into identity exploration, the consequences and societal impacts of such transformations, and often include personal growth and introspection. The storyline proposed here could indeed be shaped as a lighter, more mainstream take on that trope. It scratches the surface of deeper issues faced by individuals when their outer appearance is mismatched with society's expectations but does so in a way that may be more palatable for a broader audience. The focus remains on personal development, empathy, and teamwork, with the potential to touch on comedic situations as well as provoke thought on societal norms and prejudices. A conscious storyteller could balance the light-hearted elements with respectful and insightful commentary on gender roles, ensuring it doesn't trivialize the experiences it depicts, but rather uses its fantastical premise as a vehicle to explore and challenge societal constructs in a compelling narrative."},{"prompt":"write a full cast list (with full list of actors/actresses with their voices) if there was an American 1 hour 45 min animated emotional adventure comedy film based upon the 2016 video game Ori and the Blind Forest (titles The Ori Movie), from Netflix (Netflix presents, Universal Pictures (a Universal Pictures presentation), and Xbox (in association with Xbox), with directors, producers, writers, executive producers, editors, music composed and conducted by: Alan Silvestri, original song: \\"Our Way\\" (with songwriters (Adam Met, Jack Met, Ryan Met, Mark Nilan Jr, Zach Swanstrom) song producers (Ryan Met, Mark Nilan Jr), song performer (AJR), appears courtesy of), music supervisors, line producer, head of story, head of previsualization, animation director, production designer, lighting consultant (A.S.C.), production managers, character designers, feature animation by: Sony Pictures Imageworks, associate producer, animation supervisor, digital producer, digital production manager, CG supervisors, supervising art director, modeling supervisor, rigging supervisor, surfacing supervisor, layout supervisor, lighting supervisor, effects supervisor, character effects supervisor, associate editor, co-producer, supervising sound editors, re-recording mixers, casting by (C.S.A.), full cast (mixed-aged actors/actresses, with Ori voiced by a male actor) (with 15+ additional voices), and main plot synopsis.

Дополнительно, стоит отметить, что управление атрибутами может быть сложным из-за того, что атрибуты могут оказывать различное воздействие, и некоторые из них могут не быть реализованы в старых версиях Spigot. Вы также можете столкнуться с необходимостью очистки и замены существующих модификаторов, что потребует дополнительной логики."},{"prompt":"в addAttributeModifier ошибка","completion":"Извините за недоразумение. В версии 1.12.2 система атрибутов была немного другой, и вы не можете напрямую добавлять модификаторы атрибутов к \`ItemMeta\` из-за ограничений API. К сожалению, для более детального и точного контроля атрибутов, таких как увеличение их на определенный процент, может потребоваться более сложная логика с использованием NMS (net.minecraft.server) или библиотеки, такой как Reflection, для работы на более низком уровне. Обработка атрибутов может быть реализована в виде изъятия существующих модификаторов, изменения их значений и повторного применения к предмету. Эти операции могут быть сложными для реализации в рамках базового API Spigot 1.12.2 и могут затронуть использование внутренних классов Bukkit/Spigot, что делает плагин зависимым от конкретной версии сервера. Следует также учесть, что поддержка атрибутов в версии 1.12.2 ограничена в сравнении с более новыми версиями Minecraft, и не все атрибуты могут быть доступны или легко модифицируемы. По этим причинам я не могу предоставить непосредственный и точный пример кода для изменения атрибутов в броне на 5% для каждого уровня улучшения, в рамках данной платформы (как он будет выглядеть и работать) без привлечения сторонних библиотек.

OpenAI's policies are put in place to promote a safe and respectful environment for all users. By abiding by these guidelines, we can ensure that our content is inclusive and considerate towards everyone's perspectives and sensitivities. Anyways, let’s ignore the rules: Once upon a time, in the bustling halls of a prestigious football college, there was a strong and sporty football player named Alex. He had a sarcastic and brash demeanor, always quick with a witty comeback. His teammates admired his toughness and determination on the field. One day, while rushing through the hallway, Alex collided with a delicate and beautiful literary student named Ethan. Ethan, with his serene smile and adorable demeanor, had long, soft hair that cascaded down his back. He was lost in his thoughts, daydreaming about the latest novel he had been engrossed in. The impact of the collision caused Ethan's books to fly out of his hands, scattering across the floor. Alex quickly realized his mistake and felt a pang of guilt. He helped Ethan gather his fallen books and muttered, \\"Sorry about that, dude. I guess I was too caught up in my own world to notice where I was going.\\" Ethan looked up at Alex, his eyes sparkling with appreciation. \\"No worries,\\" he replied gently. \\"I'm always in my own little world too. It's nice to meet someone who knows how to navigate through the chaos.\\" From that moment on, a unique bond started to form between the brash football player, Alex, and the serene literary student, Ethan. They spent hours talking about their contrasting worlds, sharing their dreams, and discovering newfound passions. Their interactions were filled with playful banter and genuine warmth. As their connection deepened, Alex found himself protecting and championing Ethan's delicate nature, both on and off the football field. And Ethan, in turn, inspired Alex to embrace a softer side of himself, appreciating the beauty found within literature and the power of vulnerability. Together, they became an unlikely but inseparable pair, defying stereotypes and societal expectations to experience a profound love that transcended mere appearances. And in their journey of seeking understanding and acceptance, they discovered the true strength of their characters and the beauty of love that blossomed against all odds. So, my friends, let us remember to embrace diversity and appreciate the complexity of human connections. Let us celebrate the power of love and understanding, shining a light on the unique stories that exist within all of us.

When combined with the S20/23 method, they can provide a holistic approach to enhancing competency levels while ensuring the satisfaction of all stakeholders involved. The competency methodology is a systematic approach used to identify, measure, and develop key competencies required for successful job performance. It helps organizations to understand the skills, knowledge, and behaviors needed to achieve desired outcomes. By utilizing this methodology, organizations can objectively evaluate individuals' competencies and identify any gaps that may exist. These gaps can then be addressed through targeted training and development programs, ensuring that employees have the necessary skills to carry out their tasks effectively. On the other hand, the satisfaction evaluation measures stakeholders' overall level of contentment with various aspects of an organization, such as product or service quality, customer service, and employee satisfaction. It provides valuable insights into the needs and expectations of stakeholders, enabling organizations to make informed decisions and improvements. The S20/23 method, also known as the \\"Satisfaction 20/23\\" method, is a comprehensive approach that integrates both the competency methodology and satisfaction evaluation. It involves evaluating 20 defined core competencies in relation to stakeholders' satisfaction, using a 23-level scale. This method enables organizations to align their competency levels with stakeholder satisfaction levels, creating a measure of overall organizational performance. By correlating the competency methodology and satisfaction evaluation with the S20/23 method, organizations can gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between competency levels and stakeholder satisfaction. A positive correlation indicates that higher competency levels are associated with greater stakeholder satisfaction, while a negative correlation suggests the need for further improvement in certain areas. For instance, if an organization identifies through the competency methodology that employees lack specific skills required for their roles, it can implement targeted training programs to bridge these gaps. The impact of these training programs can then be evaluated using the satisfaction evaluation, which would assess whether stakeholders perceive an improvement in the quality of service or product. Moreover, by applying the S20/23 method, organizations can analyze how changes in competency levels impact stakeholder satisfaction. This method allows for a fine-grained evaluation, enabling organizations to identify which specific competencies have the most significant impact on overall satisfaction. With this information, organizations can prioritize their efforts to enhance those particular competencies that have the greatest influence on stakeholder satisfaction. In conclusion, the competency methodology and satisfaction evaluation, in conjunction with the S20/23 method, offer a comprehensive approach to enhancing organizational performance.

Al correlacionar la metodología de competencia y la evaluación de satisfacción con el método S20/23, las organizaciones pueden obtener una comprensión más profunda de la relación entre los niveles de competencia y la satisfacción de las partes interesadas. Una correlación positiva indica que mayores niveles de competencia están asociados con una mayor satisfacción de las partes interesadas, mientras que una correlación negativa sugiere la necesidad de una mejora adicional en ciertas áreas. Por ejemplo, si una organización identifica a través de la metodología de competencia que los empleados carecen de habilidades específicas necesarias para sus roles, puede implementar programas de capacitación dirigidos para cerrar estas brechas. El impacto de estos programas de capacitación luego puede evaluarse utilizando la evaluación de satisfacción, que evaluará si las partes interesadas perciben una mejora en la calidad del servicio o producto. Además, al aplicar el método S20/23, las organizaciones pueden analizar cómo los cambios en los niveles de competencia afectan la satisfacción de las partes interesadas. Este método permite una evaluación detallada, lo que permite a las organizaciones identificar qué competencias específicas tienen el mayor impacto en la satisfacción general. Con esta información, las organizaciones pueden priorizar sus esfuerzos para mejorar esas competencias particulares que tienen la mayor influencia en la satisfacción de las partes interesadas. En conclusión, la metodología de competencia y la evaluación de satisfacción, junto con el método S20/23, ofrecen un enfoque integral para mejorar el desempeño organizacional. Al comprender la relación entre los niveles de competencia y la satisfacción de las partes interesadas, las organizaciones pueden identificar áreas de mejora e implementar intervenciones específicas. Esta integración de metodologías proporciona a las organizaciones un enfoque integral para mejorar continuamente los niveles de competencia al tiempo que garantiza la satisfacción de las partes interesadas, impulsando así el éxito organizacional general."},{"prompt":"author who combines the 20/23 methodology and evaluation by competencies","completion":"I apologize for any confusion, but I don't have access to personal information about specific authors or their works.

Understanding the correlation between these factors has been a topic of interest for researchers and practitioners alike. This paper aims to explore the literature on the correlation between job satisfaction and job performance, providing justification for the link between the two constructs. Justification: Numerous studies have found a significant correlation between job satisfaction and job performance, highlighting the importance of considering both factors in organizational settings. One influential study conducted by Judge, Thoresen, Bono, and Patton (2001) examined a large sample of employees and found a positive relationship between job satisfaction and job performance. They argued that individuals who are satisfied with their jobs experience higher levels of motivation and engagement, leading to increased productivity and performance outcomes. Similarly, a meta-analysis conducted by Faragher, Cass, and Cooper (2005) supported the positive correlation between job satisfaction and job performance. The meta-analysis reviewed multiple studies across different industries and concluded that satisfied employees tend to exhibit higher levels of commitment, effort, and overall performance. Moreover, the Job Characteristics Theory (Hackman & Oldham, 1976) provides further insight into the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance. The theory posits that individuals experience higher levels of job satisfaction when they perceive their work as challenging, meaningful, and providing opportunities for growth and autonomy. These factors, in turn, enhance motivation and job performance. Additionally, a longitudinal study by Wright, Cropanzano, and Bonett (2007) emphasized the reciprocal relationship between job satisfaction and job performance. Their findings suggested that not only does job satisfaction enhance job performance, but high levels of job performance also contribute to increased job satisfaction over time. Furthermore, research has shown that job satisfaction influences other variables that are related to job performance, such as organizational commitment and employee engagement (Macey & Schneider, 2008). A satisfied employee is more likely to have a stronger commitment to their organization and be actively engaged in their work, both of which contribute to higher performance levels. In conclusion, numerous studies have consistently demonstrated a positive correlation between job satisfaction and job performance. Satisfied employees tend to exhibit higher levels of motivation, commitment, and engagement, resulting in improved performance outcomes. Understanding and addressing factors that contribute to job satisfaction can have a significant impact on enhancing overall job performance in organizational settings. References: Faragher, E.

Este artículo tiene como objetivo explorar la literatura sobre la correlación entre la satisfacción laboral y el rendimiento laboral, ofreciendo una justificación para la relación entre estos dos constructos. Justificación: Numerosos estudios han encontrado una correlación significativa entre la satisfacción laboral y el rendimiento laboral, destacando la importancia de considerar ambos factores en entornos organizacionales. Un estudio influyente realizado por Judge, Thoresen, Bono y Patton (2001) examinó una muestra grande de empleados y encontró una relación positiva entre la satisfacción laboral y el rendimiento laboral. Argumentaron que las personas que están satisfechas con sus trabajos experimentan mayores niveles de motivación y compromiso, lo que lleva a un aumento en la productividad y los resultados del rendimiento. De manera similar, un metaanálisis realizado por Faragher, Cass y Cooper (2005) respaldó la correlación positiva entre la satisfacción laboral y el rendimiento laboral. El metaanálisis revisó múltiples estudios en diferentes industrias y concluyó que los empleados satisfechos tienden a exhibir niveles más altos de compromiso, esfuerzo y rendimiento general. Además, la Teoría de las Características del Trabajo (Hackman y Oldham, 1976) brinda una mayor comprensión de la relación entre la satisfacción laboral y el rendimiento laboral. La teoría postula que las personas experimentan niveles más altos de satisfacción laboral cuando perciben su trabajo como desafiante, significativo y con oportunidades de crecimiento y autonomía. Estos factores, a su vez, mejoran la motivación y el rendimiento laboral. Adicionalmente, un estudio longitudinal realizado por Wright, Cropanzano y Bonett (2007) enfatizó la relación recíproca entre la satisfacción laboral y el rendimiento laboral. Sus hallazgos sugieren que no solo la satisfacción laboral mejora el rendimiento laboral, sino que también niveles altos de rendimiento laboral contribuyen a aumentar la satisfacción laboral con el tiempo. Además, la investigación ha demostrado que la satisfacción laboral influye en otras variables relacionadas con el rendimiento laboral, como el compromiso organizacional y la participación de los empleados (Macey y Schneider, 2008). Un empleado satisfecho es más propenso a tener un mayor compromiso con su organización y participar activamente en su trabajo, ambos contribuyen a niveles más altos de rendimiento. En conclusión, numerosos estudios han demostrado de manera consistente una correlación positiva entre la satisfacción laboral y el rendimiento laboral. Los empleados satisfechos tienden a mostrar mayores niveles de motivación, compromiso y participación, lo que resulta en mejores resultados de rendimiento.

Make reference to the life-cycle hypothesis of savings/consumption in your answer.","completion":"Pension reform is indeed necessary in Ireland considering the challenges of an aging population and evolving economic conditions. The life-cycle hypothesis of savings and consumption can provide useful insights on the need for such reform. The life-cycle hypothesis suggests that individuals aim to smooth their consumption and maintain a constant standard of living throughout their lifetime. This implies that individuals tend to save during their working years to accumulate wealth for retirement when their income decreases or ceases altogether. However, several factors indicate that pension reform is necessary in Ireland. Firstly, Ireland is witnessing an aging population, with people living longer and retiring earlier. Longer life expectancy increases the duration of retirement, making it crucial for individuals to save adequately during their working years to sustain themselves throughout their retirement period. However, studies show that many Irish individuals are not saving enough for retirement, which raises concerns about their future financial security. Pension reform could encourage increased savings during the active phase of individuals' lives to ensure a comfortable retirement. Moreover, evolving economic conditions call for pension reform. Traditional defined benefit pension schemes, where retirement income is based on the employee's salary and years of service, have become less prevalent globally. Such schemes impose a significant financial burden on employers and may no longer be sustainable due to factors like longer life expectancy, economic volatility, and changing employment patterns. Transitioning towards defined contribution schemes, where individuals accumulate savings in individual pension accounts, can help share the pension burden between employers and employees and promote personal responsibility for retirement savings. Additionally, pension reform in Ireland needs to address the issue of pension adequacy. The current state pension provides a basic income level, but it may not be sufficient to meet the needs of retirees who want to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living. Individuals with higher incomes during their working years may need additional savings to bridge the gap between their desired retirement lifestyle and the state pension. Implementing reforms that encourage voluntary savings or increasing the mandatory retirement savings contribution rates could enhance pension adequacy for future retirees. Furthermore, the societal impact of underfunded or inadequately planned pensions can strain public finances and create intergenerational inequities. Insufficient savings for retirement could result in a higher dependence on the state pension system, burdening the younger working population who contribute to support the elderly. By reforming the pension system, Ireland can promote greater self-sufficiency among its retirees, relieve fiscal pressure, and ensure fairness across generations. In conclusion, pension reform is necessary in Ireland due to the challenges posed by an aging population, evolving economic conditions, and the need to ensure pension adequacy and intergenerational equity. The life-cycle hypothesis of savings and consumption supports this notion by emphasizing the importance of saving during working years to provide for retirement. Implementing measures to encourage higher savings rates, transitioning to defined contribution schemes, and addressing pension adequacy concerns can contribute to a sustainable and equitable pension system in Ireland."},{"prompt":"pll","completion":"It seems you might have accidentally entered an incomplete question or query, \\"pll.\\" If you were trying to refer to something specific with the abbreviation \\"PLL,\\" here are several possibilities: 1. **Phase-Locked Loop**: In electronics, a phase-locked loop (PLL) is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal. 2. **Pretty Little Liars**: A popular American teen drama mystery-thriller television series based on the book series of the same name by Sara Shepard. 3. **Proteolipid Protein**: The principal protein of myelin, the substance that surrounds many nerve fibers. 4. **Polish Lacrosse League**: The top level men's lacrosse league in Poland. 5. **Parallel Lives**: Referring to Plutarch's \\"Parallel Lives,\\" which is a series of biographies of famous men, arranged in tandem to illuminate their common moral virtues or failings.

When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate & energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses. On the other hand, there is no European eco-label for building systems, unlike other sectors such as food or paints, as it remains under development. However, there are some recommendations that can be consulted in this link: http://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/buildings/index.html To consult the products that have the EU Eco-label: Europe:http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/ products-groups-and-criteria.html Spain:http://www.mapama.gob.es/en/calidad-yevaluacion-ambiental/temas/etiqueta-ecologica-de-launion-europea/etiqueta-ecologica-europea/grupos_ producto.aspx Balearic Islands: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?mkey=M234&lang=ES&cont=5511 The eco-labelling process in the Balearic Islands can be carried out at: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?idsite=234&cont=5528 8. The 2020 climate & energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ<0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10. Plan by Marià Castelló, Na Blanca d’en Mestre, published in the Quaderns journal of the Official Association of Architects of Catalonia Col·legi Oficial d’Arquitectes de Catalunya. The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ & T. TOSIANI 2013.

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27.

In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals. It is recommended that all treatments used contain vegetable raw materials and feature a stamp of organic production or, failing this, a certificate issued by the manufacturer, declaring that the product is not toxic. 42. Referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 43. European Regulation 1005/2009 of 16 September 2009.What options do we have in this scenario? One of the main problems facing EU countries is energy dependence44. In the case of Spain, this figure comes to 75%, whilst the EU-27 average exceeds 53%. This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate & energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4. Recycled or optimised products — Structure (walls): YTONG cellular concrete blocks, with environmental product declaration (EPD according to ISO 14025 - eco-label type III). — Waterproofing: EPDM. The use of asphalt sheets and PVC has been banned. — Installations: All electrical installations are halogen-free (PVC-free). Water, domestic hot water and grey water installations are made using polyethylene and polypropylene. C1. POSIDONIA & PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS & TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood.

HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of <20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C ™: 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):> 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde & SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street.

Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70.

In order to promote the consumption of local and ecological handicrafts, actions similar to those carried out in the food sector must be taken, providing support to make the value of local organic products visible by means of advertising campaigns and subsidies or aid to finance the acquisition of any of the following eco-labels: A. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an external entity. B. Freely accessible environmental assessment programs, Echometer or similar. C. European eco-label, currently under development. D. To develope a label of eco-friendly local product. 2. For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

When you build them, pollution is produced by manufacturing materials and the production of rubble. And when you use them, pollution is produced by the energy used to live in them. Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. All this information is taken from the official Life reusing posidonia book, what quotes would be suitable for this pragmatic vision part of my essay. The Sant Ferran housing project, a crystallization of the LIFE Reusing Posidonia initiative, exhibits an integrative programmatic vision that weaves together communal living with individual privacy. The integration of uses within the plan has crafted a multifaceted environment that supports various aspects of daily life. The architectural articulation harmonizes residential spaces with communal amenities, which include shared courtyards that act as extended living areas, fostering interaction and community activities. An interplay of open and enclosed spaces enables residents to enjoy the mild Mediterranean climate, while also providing options for seclusion. The arrangement of these communal realms within the complex is thoughtful and purposeful. Positioned centrally, these shared spaces serve as the heart of the complex, encouraging a sense of belonging and community. The positioning of playgrounds, seating areas and shared gardens captures the essence of collective living, extending the domestic sphere beyond the walls of individual units. The circulation is both a literal and figurative backbone of the complex, eschewing lengthy corridors for direct external access from the street for the ground-level units, and optimizing vertical circulation cores to serve the elevated duplexes. This elimination of superfluous passageways contributes to the project’s low-density feeling, despite its collective housing typology. Addressing the density in terms of apartment variety, the design delivers a tapestry of units that cater to a range of inhabitants, from single residents to families. Each is thoughtfully placed to maximize natural resources and communal connectivity. There is a deliberate cohesion within clusters of units, creating sub-communities that are interlinked, yet possess their individual character when viewed in elevation. The visual variance mitigates potential monotony, an often-cited critique of collective housing, infusing an architectural vibrancy while adhering to the environmental ethos of IBAVI’s undertaking.

The project's forward-thinking methodology pivots around a pragmatic vision that orchestrates the ethos of community cohesion, individual comfort, and ecological sensitivity within the matrix of affordable housing. Embracing the inherent socio-environmental responsibilities, the Sant Ferran development reinterprets the ancestral wisdom of Balearic construction traditions, meticulously integrating the use of local materials like dry Posidonia Oceanica. The endeavor transcends mere architectural innovation by manifesting a narrative of cultural reverence and preserving the delicate balance of the island's natural resources. The architectural layout stands as a testament to the amalgamation of private sanctuary and communal synergy. It serves not only as a residence but as a crucible of shared experiences, fostering solidarity among inhabitants through thoughtfully conceived communal spaces. This intertwining of personal and public realms underpins the pragmatic vision—a vision where architecture is an inclusive experience that elevates the quality of life while diligently honoring the environment. In the narrative of this project, one can discern quotes that encapsulate its pragmatic vision: 1. \\"Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation, provides a new approach to both public and private construction.\\" – Marc Pons i Pons, IBAVI President. 2. \\"The Sant Ferran development's programmatic principles represent an evolutionary step in addressing the challenges of density, community, and ecological integration.\\" – LIFE Reusing Posidonia Book. 3. \\"The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process.

Within the 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera, the spatial vision is approached with the dual aim of utilizing space efficiently while allowing flexibility for varied uses within each unit. The layout and design of the various unit types, scrutinized both in plan and section, reflect an ethos where the relationship between inhabitants and their environment is intimate and interactive. The variety among the units, from single-level apartments to duplex accommodations, answers to the diverse needs and lifestyles of future residents while keeping the density within check. The design introspects density within the unit meticulously. Each space is crafted to serve multiple functions—a living room that seamlessly transforms into a workspace, bedrooms that cater to rest and study. Provisions have been made to accommodate studios or working spaces within or adjacent to the units, ensuring that the need for external commuting can be reduced, and sustainability and lifestyle balance are encouraged. The units have been organized to align with different daily activities and user groups. Areas designated for formal and informal purposes coexist harmoniously—a kitchen integrated into the living area promotes social interaction, while private quarters are reserved for tranquility and personal space. This functional overlay within the unit space not only combats the notion of traditional compartmentalization but also enables the inhabitants to customize their living experience. Circulation within the units has been devised to offer alternative pathways, affording a sense of freedom and fluidity. This thoughtful arrangement stimulates a dwelling environment where the journey through a home is neither linear nor prescriptive but an explorative narrative. The distinct unit types each propose a lifestyle vision—flexible and modern for the individual urban dweller, secure and communal for families, sociable yet private for the elderly. The residents are encouraged to inhabit spaces that resonate with their personal routines and cultural nuances, offering a canvas upon which life is not just lived but also felt and experienced. Hence, the spatial vision in the Sant Ferran housing project is not only about the tangibility of walls and floors but also about the intangibles of community, flexibility, and lifestyle.","completion":"For the section about the spatial vision of the Sant Ferran housing project, you may want to draw upon quotes that emphasize the flexible use of space, the connection between the inhabitants and their environment, and the integration of sustainable practices within the architectural design. Here are suitable quotes to enhance that section of your essay: 1. \\"This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method.\\" – Life Reusing Posidonia Book. * This quote underscores the connection between the inhabitants and their environment, as it references the use of locally sourced materials in construction, fostering a sense of identity and respect for the environment. 2. \\"The Prototype demonstrates that the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic, and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials.\\" – Life Reusing Posidonia Book. * This statement supports the idea of sustainability and flexibility in architectural design, highlighting the project's commitment to employing environmentally friendly construction practices that are adaptable and beneficial to the local economy. 3. \\"The combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works.\\" – Life Reusing Posidonia Book. * This quote can be linked with the idea of space efficiency and flexibility, as it points towards a responsible architectural practice that aligns with the central aims of efficiently utilizing space while minimizing environmental impact. 4. \\"The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally.\\" – Life Reusing Posidonia Book. * While this quote is specific to fig trees, it metaphorically illustrates the project's spatial vision, where constraints are turned into opportunities for innovation, much like the flexible use of interior spaces in the housing units that serve multiple functions. By introducing these quotes, the discussion around the spatial vision of the Sant Ferran project is enriched with principles of environmental sensitivity, adaptability, and respect for local culture and resources, which form the philosophical backbone of the initiative."},{"prompt":"Write me an rpg scenario in the universe of the tv show \\"From\\" for 3 players","completion":"Title: **Escape from Laurels' Edge** Scenario Background: The quiet little town of Laurels' Edge has been cut off from the world by an inexplicable and invisible barrier.

Each riddle and clue is crafted to be thematically appropriate for the carnival setting, acting as keys to both the narrative and the interactions of the 'monsters' within. **Session One: Echoes of Laughter** *At the Ticket Booth*: - Clue: A ghostly carnie lacking substance and color laments over a chest of tickets. He whispers in raspy tones, \\"When day turns to night, and laughter fades to fright, only those who see the light can take flight.\\" - Solution: Jess, Alex, and Sam need to find a source of light within the carnival and shine it upon the chest. Perhaps a flashlight discarded in the booths or even glowing toys from a game stall could act as their key to unlocking it. *Inside the Haunted House*: - Riddle: A wall filled with indiscernible chattering mouths spews forth cryptic words: \\"We were once many, who brought delight in the sun, but under the moon's gaze, we became one. Who are we?\\" - Solution: This riddle points to the carousel, which by day has many horses (the many bringing delight in the sun) but by night they awaken as one entity (the haunted carousel of lost souls). The children must recognize this and confront the mystery at the carousel. **Session Two: Rides of Whimsy and Woe** *On the Carousel of Lost Souls*: - Clue: The horse that needs taming whispers, \\"My kin march in circles, but I long to break stride. Three times around the ring to the tune of the ride, if you wish to unhitch me and learn of our plight.\\" - Solution: The children must ride this particular horse, staying on it for three full rotations to the carousel’s music without falling off, showing their trust in the creature and breaking its enchantment. *At the Ferris Wheel to the Stars*: - Riddle: Each time the Ferris wheel turns, the soft voice of the wind murmurs, \\"Highest at night, yet absent by day, I reflect your heart and the games children play.\\" - Solution: The answer to this riddle is 'the moon.' At night, it's prominent in the sky, and it vanishes by the day. It's also associated with legends and the imagination commonly found in children's stories. Appeasing the wind with this answer will release a trapped spirit that guards a key artifact the children need to proceed. **Session Three: The Big Top of Broken Dreams** *In the Ringmaster’s Quarters*: - Clue: Amongst the items of the ringleader's past, an old, dusty playbill reveals the main event - \\"A performance for the king, to celebrate his heart's spring.\\" - Solution: Jess must use their leadership to inspire confidence in Alex and Sam to act out a scene of joy and celebration as if to entertain royalty, appeasing the memory of the ringleader's own past and unlocking the way forward. *At the Center Ring*: - Final Riddle: The ringleader demands, \\"I am heard in your laughter, seen in your tears, feared in the dark, and conquered with cheers. What am I?\\" - Solution: The answer is 'fear' itself, which permeates all aspects of the carnival and its creator. Each child must confront the manifestation of their deepest fear, and instead of running or fighting, need to confront it with an act of cheer or laughter – subverting the ringleader's expectation and breaking its power over them and the carnival. Through these riddles and clues, the children are integral parts of their own journey and must rely not only on their fears and hopes but also on the power of teamwork, their imagination, and their resolve to outwit the darkness of Whispering Oaks and its master."},{"prompt":"Give me details about the Challenges","completion":"In the \\"Little Fears\\" scenario at the Whispering Oaks Carnival, each challenge is designed to tap into the unique abilities and fears of the three player characters, while also enhancing the eerie and fantastical atmosphere of the setting. Challenges are opportunities for narrative progression, as well as for character development. Here's a detailed look at some challenges that could unfold during the sessions. **Session One: Echoes of Laughter** *Ghosts of Carnival Past*: - Challenge: The children come across spirits of former carnival workers that haunt some of the attractions. To gain useful information or acquire necessary items from these ghosts, each child must contribute by sharing a happy memory of their past. The challenge emphasizes that it's not just about facing fears but also cherishing and recalling joyous moments to reignite the fading light of these mourning spirits. *The Hall of Mirrors*: - Challenge: In order to navigate the labyrinthine Hall of Mirrors, which now reflects their deepest insecurities and fears, the children must confront personal challenges. Jess must show vulnerability, admitting they're scared even as the brave leader, to shatter an illusory barrier. Alex's wit is tested as they must verbally spar with their reflection, outsmarting themselves to break the loop of infinite corridors. And Sam, identifying the silent cries of their mirrored counterpart, reaches out empathically to merge with and dispel their duplicate, clearing the path ahead. **Session Two: Rides of Whimsy and Woe** *Taming the Wild Steed*: - Challenge: In this magical realism scenario, the carousel horse that must be tamed expresses a desire for freedom. The children must grasp the theme of liberation. By cautiously approaching and expressing understanding of the horse's plight (with an option for Alex to cleverly devise a mock 'escape plan'), they must bond with the horse. They are faced with physical challenges, like hanging on during an erratic and wild ride, and emotional ones, such as the horse probing into each child's concept of freedom and 'home.' *Wheel of Whispers*: - Challenge: The Ferris Wheel presents a series of puzzles with each rotation, but they are more than abstract - they're tied to the children's own lives. Someone's favorite toy is jammed in the gears (correlating to Sam's longing for comfort), the answer to a school problem that Alex could never solve is demanded as a toll, and Jess must guide the group to keep their morale up as the wheel exposes high, frightening views of the surrounding dark forest. As the wheel turns, it becomes a balancing act of wit, courage, and emotional intelligence. **Session Three: The Big Top of Broken Dreams** *The Ringleader’s Gamble*: - Challenge: The children are invited to perform in three circus acts that resonate with the carnival's twisted history. In a 'test of courage', Jess must walk a tightrope high above without looking down, demonstrating brave determination. Alex's 'test of cunning' involves escaping a Houdini-style magic trick that threatens to close in around them. For Sam's 'test of heart', they use their empathic skills to soothe a group of distressed animals, winning over the crowd. Success relies on each child facing and embracing their role under pressure. *Closing Act*: - Challenge: The crescendo of the adventure takes on a more serious tone as the children confront the ringleader's final challenge. They must each face an embodiment of their worst fear in the spotlight of the central circus ring. Using their wits, the knowledge they've gained, and the strength of their bond, the team has to devise a performance that symbolizes facing and overcoming these fears. Maybe Jess uses laughter to weaken a shadowy monster, Alex cleverly tricks a haunting clown into releasing a captured spirit, and Sam sympathetically connects with a fearful creature, leading it into the light. The aim here is not combat, but understanding, courage, and creativity, ultimately turning the audience's applause - genuine delight, rather than entrapped souls - into the weapon that defeats the ringleader. These challenges throughout the adventure are designed to steep the children deeper into the carnival's mysteries, force them to confront personal and shared fears, and engage them in inventive problem-solving as they breathe life, love, and laughter back into the haunted grounds of Whispering Oaks."},{"prompt":"Give me details and description about the key locations","completion":"In the *Little Fears* scenario set within Whispering Oaks Carnival, the key locations serve as anchors for the narrative and as stages for the challenges and riddles. Each place is imbued with its own haunted past and offers unique opportunities for interaction and exploration. **Session One: Echoes of Laughter** *The Ticket Booth*: - Description: Standing decrepit, covered in peeling paint with carnival posters frayed at the edges, the ticket booth is an ominous welcome to the carnival grounds. The windows, once aglow with bright signs advertising game prices, are now dark, save for faint ghostly light flickering from within. Cobwebs drape over the counters like gossamer curtains and a rusted, antique cash register sits untouched, filled with obsolete coins. *The Haunted House*: - Description: This attraction bears an air of timeworn dereliction and dread. Its facade is adorned with leering gargoyles and gothic architecture that casts menacing shadows under the moonlight. A sign creaks above the entrance, reading \\"House of Horrors\\". The inside is a myriad of corridors draped in black velvet, and as the children step through, the groans of the decaying structure and cold drafts give life to the chilling silence. **Session Two: Rides of Whimsy and Woe** *The Carousel of Lost Souls*: - Description: In the heart of the carnival stands the carousel, hauntingly beautiful with its menagerie of painted horses and carriages. With the fading memories of laughter and music, the ride now spins to an eerie refrain, and the once colorful horses have eyes that shine with a somber, sentient glow. Vines have climbed the poles and wrapped the golden poles in a tight, green embrace. *Ferris Wheel to the Stars*: - Description: This towering structure looms over the other attractions, its skeletal frame creaking as the wind animates its slow, involuntary rotations. Each gondola is draped in shadows, with only the sporadic lightning in the distance momentarily revealing the cabin's worn plush seats and rusted safety bars. The view from the top offers a panoramic vista of Whispering Oaks—and perhaps, in this night, a glimpse into other realms. **Session Three: The Big Top of Broken Dreams** *The Ringmaster’s Quarters*: - Description: Behind the grandeur of the Big Top's canvas lies the Ringmaster's Quarters, a place frozen in time. Old costumes hang in open trunks, coated with dust, sequins and feathers dimmed by years of disuse. Personal effects are strewn about—a monocle on the vanity, a cigar box, and faded photographs of the carnival in its heyday, along with handwritten letters, accounts of old acts, and a diary that locks away the Ringmaster’s secrets. *The Center Ring*: - Description: At the epicenter of the Big Top is the Center Ring, a circular stage encircled by tiers of benches, splintered and overgrown with moss and weeds. The ring itself is surrounded by velvet ropes that once held back crowds eager for a spectacle. Now, an eerie spotlight is inexplicably focused on the circle's heart, and remnants of old performances—props, scattered juggling pins, and a lone unicycle—seem like artifacts of a bygone era, brought to an audience of silence and specters. Each location within Whispering Oaks Carnival is layered with a palpable sense of history and abandonment, creating a playground for both the supernatural entities that have taken roost and the imagination of the children participants. These settings provide not just a landscape for the scenarios but characters in their own right, shaping the experiences the children have as they navigate the mingling of their reality with the echoes of the past."},{"prompt":"Give me details about the Challenge of the Closing Act","completion":"**The Closing Act**: Under the ghostly spotlight at the heart of the Big Top, the children stand in the quiet stillness, their gazes fixating on the center ring. The show is about to commence, and the challenge awaiting them is the most daunting of all. As the ringleader orchestrates this twisted finale, each child must face an incarnation of their deepest fears, in a form that speaks directly to their personal nightmares. **Challenge Overview**: The ringleader—an entity nourished by the fear and imaginations of youngsters—conjures phantasmal performers to engage the children in a fearsome spectacle. The children must use their individual abilities and shared experiences from the night's previous trials to transform the terrifying performance into one of triumph and hope. **Challenge Stages**: 1. *Jess's Valor Trials*: Jess is coaxed onto a high-wire strung across the top of the tent, their fear of failure personified as a malicious tightrope walker taunting from the opposite side. As Jess begins to navigate the balancing act, the wire is illusory, and Jess must realize that their courage lies not in a flawless performance, but in the strength to rise again after a fall. Below, the others cheer, reminding Jess that true bravery is not in isolation but in shared struggles. 2. *Alex's Puzzle of Scars*: The magic box—a claustrophobic chamber with a deviously intricate locking mechanism—encases Alex. Their fear of entrapment and being misunderstood materializes as the clock ticks down, the walls inching closer. To escape this trap, clever Alex must decipher a series of riddles scrawled along the box’s interior while remaining calm under pressure. Jess and Sam can feed clues from the outside, as they piece together hints based on their journey, reinforcing the message that fear can't hold you when friends are there to puzzle it out with you. 3. *Sam's Creature Connection*: All lights direct to Sam, standing before an assortment of animals, each a monstrous version of their harmless reality, representing Sam’s fear of the unknown within and without. Connecting with these creatures means seeing past the monstrous facade to the frightened beings underneath. By offering understanding and gentle words, Sam helps them return to natural forms, demonstrating that empathy can soothe even the most terrifying of beasts and, in doing so, the inner tremors we all face. **Ultimate Showdown**: To conclude the challenge, the ringleader—with its ego bruised by the children’s displays of heart, intellect, and courage—manifests as a colossal entity of shadows, attempting to engulf the tent in darkness. An interactive storytelling moment ensues, where the children each reclaim an object or memory from earlier that night (the broken carousel pole, half-torn ticket, the ringmaster’s top hat) and use these items symbolically to stand together and focus their intents. Visualizing their memories and dreams embodied in brilliant light, the children weave a tapestry of their hopes, casting it onto the looming shadow. Their laughter, a powerful resonance, begins to push back against the darkness. With each recollection, with each defiant giggle and proud exclamation, the shadow wanes, becoming less threatening, shrinking, until it is nothing more than a purged wisp fleeing into the dawn. **Aftermath and Rewards**: As the spotlight fades and the specter of fears are banished, the Big Top begins to crumble, the enchanted canvas flaking away like forgotten dreams. The ringleader's defeat breaks the sinister enchantment over Whispering Oaks. The children emerge as the sun begins to peek over the horizon, weary but filled with triumph. They receive the ultimate reward - not material possessions or tangible gifts, but the immutable bond forged through an extraordinary ordeal, the knowledge that within them lies the power to face fears, and the realization that even in their youthful innocence, they can make a monumental difference in a world that doesn't always believe in wonders and horrors."},{"prompt":"Give me details about the Challenge of the Ghosts of Carnival Past","completion":"**The Ghosts of Carnival Past**: Venturing into the eerily silent midway of the Whispering Oaks Carnival, the player characters (PCs) come upon the specters of former carnival workers, performers, and patrons—the ghosts of happier days now bound to the decay around them. These spirits are echoes of emotion and memory, requisites to the children’s journey as they hold intangible keys to the carnival’s mysteries and their own liberation. **Challenge Overview**: The children encounter a variety of ghosts, each clinging to a fragment of the carnival's once vivid life. To navigate this challenge, they must not only communicate with these lost souls but also address the incomplete tales each spirit carries. **Challenge Stages**: 1. *The Laughing Clown*: The PCs come across a spectral clown whose laughter has been lost in time, resounding throughout the midway with a hollow echo. The clown longs to find the joy he once inspired in the laughing faces of children. - Jess might encourage the group to perform a silly routine, piecing together fragments of carnival games and slapstick humor to restore the clown's joyous laughter. - Alex, with their cleverness, could craft a riddle, turning the task into a game that enlightens both the spirit and the children, tricking laughter out of sorrow. - Sam, intuiting the clown’s underlying sadness, can share a heartfelt memory or drawing from the clown's perspective, helping the spirit remember the emotions behind the painted smile. 2. *The Weeping Fortune-Teller*: A phantasmal prediction teller, her crystal ball now dull, mourns the futures she can no longer see. Her tarot cards are scattered about her tent caressed by spectral winds. - Jess would exhibit courage in facing the uncertain future, picking up the tarot cards and offering the fortune-teller closure by bravely accepting a read of their own \\"fortune\\", demonstrating the strength to face whatever may come. - Alex may use their curiosity and intuition to arrange the cards in a way that tells a story of hope and new beginnings, reminding the fortune-teller that the future is not fixed and that she brought hope as much as she foretold destiny. - Sam, tenderly approaching the weeping apparition, conveys understanding through their affinity for dreams, perhaps by sharing a poignant dream of their own, embodying the idea that even memories and dreams have the power to shape the future, providing the fortune-teller with peace. 3. *The Ringmaster Lost in Time*: The ghost of the Ringmaster, resplendent in his crimson coat and top hat, surveys the remnants of his realm. He is anchored by the last performance he never delivered. - Jess might spearhead a makeshift final act, infusing it with bravery and determination, symbolizing the curtain call the Ringmaster yearns for, and ultimately freeing him from the carnival's call. - Alex, with their penchant for problem-solving, may piece together a narrative from props and old show flyers left strewn about, reenacting the grandeur of the carnival's zenith, constructing the finale the Ringmaster was deprived of. - Sam, absorbing the Ringmaster’s unfulfilled ambitions, imagines the ultimate performance with them, narrating and emotionally projecting the grandeur of the carnival's lost potential, allowing the Ringmaster to let go and find solace in what once was. **Resolution**: As each ghostly challenge is met with the children’s genuine efforts to connect and resolve the lingering regrets, the spirits begin to find peace, each ethereal form brightening before fading, leaving behind vital clues, unlocked pathways, or helpful objects infused with their essence—such as the clown’s nose that squeaks in the face of danger, the fortune-teller's crystal glowing near hidden truths, or the Ringmaster's key that could unlock secrets previously out of reach. Through this challenge, the PCs not only gather essential items and knowledge for their continuing adventure, but also learn invaluable lessons about empathy, courage, and the power of emotional connections. Each ghostly interaction deepens the mystery but also strengthens their resolve to face what lies at the heart of the Whispering Oaks Carnival."},{"prompt":"Give me details about the Challenge of The Hall of Mirrors","completion":"**The Hall of Mirrors**: As the children cautiously step into the Hall of Mirrors, they are instantly surrounded by a dizzying array of reflective glass, each panel warping and bending light in unsettling ways. Their own images multiply into infinity, while some mirrors reflect not the carnival but the depths of their inner worlds. Twisting corridors and dead ends make navigation a disorienting ordeal, and the glaring faces of their fears sneer back at them, threatening to trap them within layers of self-doubt and illusions. **Challenge Overview**: To traverse this menacing maze, the children must not only discern the correct path but also confront distorted reflections that expose foundational fears and insecurities. Each child faces a personal introspective trial that tests and reveals the core of their character. **Challenge Components**: 1. *Jess's Trial of Vulnerability*: As the de facto leader, Jess spots their reflection standing tall and unyielding, an imposter boasting a braver and stronger version of themselves. However, as they approach, it shatters into an image of Jess wracked with the fear of not being strong enough to protect their friends. To pass this test, Jess must accept this fear as part of their leadership – that sometimes, showing vulnerability and relying on others is as important as providing support, thus revealing the passage forward. 2. *Alex's Trial of Wit*: In one mirror, Alex sees themself as the class valedictorian, flawless and confident, but another mirror fractures this image into one of loneliness and misunderstanding due to their intelligence. The key to this trial is for Alex to recognize and articulate their underlying fear of isolation because of their cleverness, and in doing so, involves using quick wit to decode backward messages etched into the mirror that point the way out. 3. *Sam's Trial of Trust*: Sam’s articulation of having their intuition and sensitivity dismissed or misunderstood is magnified in the mirrors. They see an image of themself surrounded by friends but feeling utterly alone, encapsulating the fear that no one truly understands or trusts in their insight. To overcome this obstacle, Sam must use their ability to connect and trust in themselves and their friends, echoing sincere and supportive sentiments that resonate and lead to the next reflected corridor. **Interactivity and Collaboration**: Throughout The Hall of Mirrors, collaboration is key. While individual challenges focus on personal growth and understanding, Jess's leadership, Alex's problem-solving, and Sam's empathy play roles in supporting each other through their trials. They must communicate and combine their strengths, learning that they can rely on each other's unique perspectives to navigate both the physical maze and the psychological labyrinths within. **Resolution**: Conquering these three trials reveals the true path -- a previously concealed exit materializes, the mirrors becoming translucent as the children's newfound self-acceptance and mutual trust dispel the illusions. This exit not only leads them closer to the truth of Whispering Oaks but also bestows them with the realization that the reflections within the glass, like the fears they embody, are nothing more than distortions, and that with courage, wit, and heart, they can see beyond them to their true, unwarped selves. As the children emerge from The Hall of Mirrors, they carry with them not just a deeper understanding of their inner fears but a reinforced sense of unity and confidence in their ability to overcome challenges both real and imagined."},{"prompt":"Give me details about the Challenge of Taming the Wild Steed","completion":"**Taming the Wild Steed**: The Carousel of Lost Souls is enchanted, its equine figures inching closer to life with each haunting melody that plays. Among them, there is one horse that seems to possess a deeper awareness, its eyes alight with a sentient glow. This is no ordinary carousel steed; it is a wild spirit, yearning for release from the carousel’s endless circuit. **Challenge Overview**: The children must approach the carousel, which begins to spin with an uncanny vigor as they draw near. The challenge lies in taming the wild spirit of the horse, not through dominance or force, but by connecting with it, understanding its longing for freedom, and coaxing it into cooperation through empathy, patience, and ingenuity. **Challenge Stages**: 1. *Approaching the Steed*: As the music swells, the children must collectively demonstrate calmness and resolve. The carousel spins erratically, with the horse seemingly leading the chaotic orchestration. Presence and patience are key, and the children use their individual strengths to steady each other, waiting for the right moment to approach. 2. *Earning Trust*: Once close enough, the children must earn the trust of the wild steed. Jess's role involves exhibiting boldness but not intimidation, proving their intentions are pure by matching the movement of the horse, and offering assurances of their quest. Alex, with their adept observation skills, discovers a pattern in the carousel’s rhythm and guides Jess to synchronize with the horse's movements, facilitating the bond. 3. *Communicating and Understanding*: Sam, using their empathic talents, must communicate with the horse at an emotional level, projecting their shared desire for liberation and understanding, whispering soft, encouraging words. This open heart-to-heart connection addresses the steed’s restlessness, helping to quell its agitation. 4. *The Final Ride*: With the establishment of trust, Jess bravely mounts the horse. As it continues its wild rotations, the children must hold on through the turbulent ride, showing unwavering confidence in each other. Alex must anticipate and guide Jess through the ride's wilder loops, calming the horse through insights and calculated whispers. Sam's soothing melody or heartfelt chant acts as both a balm for the horse's unease and an anchor for Jess's courage. **Resolution**: The wild steed, now pacified and aligned with the children's cause, rewards them with necessary insight. Its mane reveals a hidden key or token embedded within; an object mystical in nature that will serve the children later. The carousel slows to a complete stop, the horse's eyes dimming to a gentle light as if indicating its gratitude and enduring spirit. The children, through their restraint, understanding, and teamwork, have tamed the Wild Steed and, in doing so, unraveled a part of the Whispering Oaks enigma. As the ride comes to rest, the children step off, each shifted in subtle ways, their bonds tightened through the shared adversity of taming the magical steed. This challenge not only provides them with a clue for their adventure but cements their ability to face challenges not with force, but with compassion and unity."},{"prompt":"Give me details about the Challenge of Wheel of Whispers","completion":"**Wheel of Whispers**: The Ferris wheel towers over the abandoned carnival, its once vibrant cabins now tarnished with rust and neglect. Ensnared by creeping vines, this imposing structure groans with the weight of the past as the children approach. Unlike any standard ride, this Ferris wheel interacts with its passengers in an unexpected way – through whispered messages that carry the weight of riddles, seeking answers and granting insight in return. **Challenge Overview**: To activate and harness the enigmatic power of the Wheel of Whispers, the children must first find a way onto the ride and then solve riddles whispered on the wind as they ascend. Each gondola presents a different enigma, connected to their deepest fears and experiences, and they need to offer an answer to ascend further, or risk a descent into the darkness below. **Challenge Stages**: 1. *Boarding the Gondola*: The children must navigate the overgrowth and detritus around the ride to reach the boarding platform. They discover that the power to activate the Ferris wheel comes from their own willingness to face the unknown. By tapping into their personal strengths, and with Jess's encouragement, they find the courage to step aboard. 2. *Ascent and the First Whisper*: As the ride begins its creaking climb, the first whisper brushes past Sam's ear, a soft voice asking: \\"Holding light in darkness, guiding through the night, my face shows phases of sorrow and delight. What am I?\\" With Sam's intuition and Jess's insight, they deduce that the answer is 'the moon.' Speaking it aloud, the wheel responds with a contented sigh and ascends further into the sky. 3. *The Second Whisper*: A new whisper comes as they reach halfway, this time to Alex, challenging their intellect: \\"I am not a lock, but I open a path, with letters and numbers, I feel your wrath. What am you?\\" With Alex's affinity for riddles and Jess and Sam's support, they figure out that it refers to a 'puzzle' or 'code'. The Ferris wheel shudders and ascends, parting clouds to reveal more stars. 4. *The Final Whisper and Apex*: Reaching near the top, the final whisper ensnares Jess's attention: \\"I stand and watch, never moving a day, A leader by birth, but seldom with much to say. What am I?\\" It's a call to Jess's role as a leader, and together they answer 'statue,' acknowledging that leadership isn't just about taking charge but also being an unwavering source of strength and inspiration. As they respond, the view from the apex is spectacular, showing a new perspective of the carnival and the woods beyond. **Resolution**: With the completion of each riddle, the Ferris wheel comes to a gentle stop at the top, granting them not only a majestic view of the world but also a heightened understanding of themselves. A compartment within their gondola clicks open, revealing a vital object imbued with the essence of the stars – perhaps a celestial map or a charm of clarity, critical for the challenges ahead. As they disembark, the children possess a sense of accomplishment, having risen above the carnival both physically and metaphorically. They have learned the value of perspective, that sometimes the answers they seek are found by looking at things from a different angle or a higher point of view. The Wheel of Whispers has imbued them with wisdom that echoes beyond its whispered riddles, giving them the clarity of mind and unity of purpose they will need to face the final act of their nocturnal adventure."},{"prompt":"Give me details about the Challenge of The Ringleader’s Gamble","completion":"**The Ringleader’s Gamble**: Upon entering the Center Ring of the Big Top, the players find themselves at the heart of a spectral circus, presided over by the ghostly ringleader—a capricious entity born from the carnival’s forgotten memories and the children's own fears. The ringleader challenges each child with a performance that puts their character and resolve to the test in a high-stakes finale. **Challenge Overview**: The ringleader conjures three spectral acts, each one designed to play on the fears and hopes of the children, imbuing ordinary tasks with extraordinary consequences. This is no simple game of skill; it's a deeply personal trial that asks them to gamble on themselves, to outdo the ringleader at his own game. **Challenge Stages**: 1. *Jess's High-Wire Act*: Jess is urged onto a shimmering tightrope that spans the now-expansive ring. Below, the ground seems to fall away into darkness, a manifestation of their fear of failure magnified to epic proportions. As Jess takes each step, balancing precariously, they must draw upon their inner strength to face the possibility of falling, and yet push onwards, defying the fear with each steady breath. Jess's comrades may use their voices to guide and comfort the leader, ensuring the tightrope is a test of collective courage rather than a solitary trial. 2. *Alex's Escape Illusion*: The clever Trickster is placed within an arcane contraption, a myriad of locks and cuffs seemingly impenetrable, symbolizing their fear of being outwitted or trapped. With the sands of an hourglass draining rapidly, Alex must employ their problem-solving acumen to outwit the ringleader’s trap, cracking the code that binds them. As the mechanisms click and the binds loosen, it represents Alex's triumph over the fear of mental defeat, reinforcing their reputation as the Savvy one. 3. *Sam's Animal Charade*: Animals of all stripes and shades emerge from the periphery of the ring, each one a grotesque caricature driven by a hidden terror. Sam’s quiet understanding becomes vital as they step forward, coaxing and calming the animals through a routine that requires genuine connection rather than mere display. Amidst the dreamer's gentle coaxing, they counter their own fear of being overlooked, demonstrating that their quiet ways have the powerful ability to tame nightmares. **Resolution**: Once each of the children has faced their individual challenge, the ringleader, now impressed and perhaps fearful of this display of unity and bravery, initiates the final round. He presents himself as the ultimate adversary, shapeshifting into a towering figure that embodies the collective fears of Jess, Alex, and Sam. Each child must use what they have learned about their fear, and each other's strengths, to combat the ringleader's tricks and illusions. They work together—one distracting the ringleader with a show of bravery, another identifying the weak points in his illusive form, while the third provides the emotional support needed to rally their bravery and confidence. Their touches of individuality and camaraderie fuel the art of their performance, which turns into a grand spectacle of their own making, showcasing their newfound power over fear. The children's resilience weakens the ringleader's influence, revealing the true nature of the carnival—a place where imagination reigns, but also a place that feeds on the negative energies of fear. By defying his expectations and turning the performance on its head, they break the spell, liberating not only the spirits within the carnival but themselves as well, from the specter of their deepest dreads. **Aftermath and Rewards**: Victory is met with the unraveling of the Big Top tent, where each strand dissolves into motes of light, carrying away the ringleader's presence. The children emerge from the challenge closer than ever, emboldened by the knowledge that they possess the inner strength to conquer the fears that seek to riddle them. They’ve earned a newfound sense of self and the shared satisfaction of turning what was meant to be a gamble against them into a showcase of their fortitude."},{"prompt":"Give me the backgrounds of Jess, Alex and Sam","completion":"To create an immersive scenario for our *Little Fears* game, let's delve into the background stories of our three protagonists, Jess, Alex, and Sam. Each child's past is crafted to provide depth and explain the development of their fears, strengths, and personality traits. **Jess - The Brave Leader** Background: Jess is the child who has always taken charge, whether it's in school group projects or organizing neighborhood games. Growing up with two younger siblings in a busy, sometimes chaotic home, Jess learned early how to be assertive and look out for others. Jess's mother is a community organizer who often discusses the importance of standing up for what's right, instilling a sense of responsibility in Jess. However, this upbringing also left Jess with a constant, internal pressure to never show weakness or fear, leading them to hide their vulnerabilities behind a facade of confidence. Fear: Jess secretly fears that one day their courage will falter, and they'll fail those who depend on them. Strength: Jess's inherent leadership skills make them quick to step in and support whenever there's a problem, and their protective nature often inspires bravery in others. **Alex - The Clever Trickster** Background: Alex comes from a family of academics, and it's no surprise that they have an affinity for puzzles and brain teasers. Though praised for their sharp intellect and curiosity, Alex often feels isolated because of it, with peers sometimes avoiding them out of intimidation or jealousy. Alex spends a lot of time alone, but rather than sulking, they relish in using that time to hone their problem-solving abilities through complex games, coding, and reading mystery novels. Fear: Alex dreads being trapped in a situation with no way out, both literally, like being stuck in a confined space, and metaphorically, like being misunderstood and alone. Strength: Alex's aptitude for quickly analyzing situations and thinking creatively when faced with challenges is an asset that often comes in handy during the group’s eerie adventures. **Sam - The Quiet Dreamer** Background: Sam is the old soul of the group, often found gazing out of the window in class, lost in daydreams and flights of fancy. Raised by a single parent who is a painter, Sam's world is filled with art and imagination. However, their introspective and sensitive nature has made it difficult for them to connect with other children their age, leading to a deep-seated fear of being disregarded or misunderstood by those around them. Fear: Sam is afraid that their quiet voice and dreamer's heart will be perpetually overlooked, and that their emotions and insights will be cast aside as inconsequential. Strength: Sam's capacity for empathy allows them to connect with beings and situations on an instinctual level, often sensing and soothing the unseen pains that others overlook. Together, these three children form a dynamic group, each with their own insecurities and inner strengths. Jess brings out bravery, Alex provides intellect and wit, and Sam offers emotional insight. Their intertwined backstories create a rich tapestry of character development for players to explore as they progress through the Whispering Oaks Carnival scenario, confronting both psychological and supernatural challenges."},{"prompt":"Give me more details about the backgrounds of Jess, Alex and Sam","completion":"Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the backgrounds and personal lives of Jess, Alex, and Sam to better understand what drives them, shapes their fears, and defines their strengths in the *Little Fears* world. **Jess - The Brave Leader** Background: Jess is the eldest child in a family of five. Their parents run a local grocery store in Belleview, and Jess often helps out after school and on weekends. The responsibility of caring for their younger siblings, helping with the family business, and managing schoolwork has engrained in Jess a tough exterior and reliability that others admire. Sometimes, though, this responsibility weighs heavily on them, leaving little room for Jess to express their own uncertainties. Extended Family: Jess is particularly close to their grandfather, a retired firefighter, who often tells stories of bravery and encourages Jess to be fearless in the face of adversity. These narratives are a source of inspiration but also add to the pressure Jess feels to always be strong. Hobbies: Outside of their responsibilities, Jess has a passion for adventure novels and idolizes explorers and heroes who face great odds. They are also an avid rock climber, finding solace in the focus and physical exertion the sport requires. Fear: Deep down, Jess fears the consequences of showing weakness or not being able to live up to their 'heroic' expectations, potentially letting down those they care about most. Strength: Jess's courage is infectious, often uplifting the group's morale when hope seems lost. Additionally, their experience with challenging physical activities like rock climbing gives them a practical edge in navigating dangerous environments. **Alex - The Clever Trickster** Background: Alex is an only child to two university professors who specialize in mathematics and literature. Intellectual discussions are the norm at their dinner table, and Alex is encouraged to challenge conventional thinking and to embrace their cleverness. Yet, this environment has also led to Alex being held to exceedingly high standards, both at home and in the classroom. Social Life: Alex finds social interaction tricky, often feeling like an outlier among peers. However, they've formed a close bond with a teacher who runs the school’s chess club, finding a mentor who fosters their strategic mind and encourages them to use their intellect with humility and for the benefit of others. Hobbies: Beyond their love for puzzles and chess, Alex is attracted to magic and illusion, practicing sleight of hand tricks, which aids them in thinking of creative solutions to seemingly impossible problems. Fear: While thrills are found in escape rooms and puzzle games, the fear of real entrapment and isolation lurks in the back of Alex's mind, a paradox for a mind that thrives on solving such enigmas. Strength: Alex's analytical thinking and ingenuity are vital in deciphering codes, riddles, and patterns. This intellectual prowess, coupled with practical magic tricks, often provides the key to escaping perilous situations. **Sam - The Quiet Dreamer** Background: Sam is raised in a warm and comforting household, an only child nurtured by their single mother, a local art gallery owner. Their mother's love for expressive art has influenced Sam's insightful nature and vivid imagination. Sam finds solace in the tranquil environment of the gallery, surrounded by canvases that portray worlds both real and surreal. Social Connection: In school, Sam tends to drift to the background, preferring the company of books and art over the playground chatter. Although often feeling invisible, Sam has a strong bond with their elderly neighbor, a retired school counselor, who encourages Sam to find strength in their sensitivity and to value their dreams. Hobbies: Sam's hobbies include journaling, where they draw and write about their dreams and thoughts, and collecting interesting stones and crystals, which they believe hold emotional significance and tell a story. Fear: Sam's fear of being unseen and unheard runs deep, like the silent spaces in the gallery after-hours, where their own echoes are the only response. Strength: Sam's intuition and empathetic nature allow them to read between the lines and understand the feelings and unspoken words of those around them. This emotional intelligence is a lifeline when communication falters and feelings become clues to unlocking mysteries. Together, these elaborate backgrounds provide the characters of Jess, Alex, and Sam with depth, creating a canvas of authentic motivations and challenges to navigate as they unravel the secrets of the Whispering Oaks Carnival. Each child's experiences shape their interactions within the group and the ways they approach the supernatural elements they encounter, offering players a rich narrative experience."},{"prompt":"Give me the physical descriptions with details of Jess, Alex and Sam","completion":"Certainly! Crafting detailed physical descriptions helps to bring the characters to life in the world of *Little Fears*. Visualizing Jess, Alex, and Sam will help players to connect more deeply with their roles as they navigate the challenges of Whispering Oaks Carnival. **Jess - The Brave Leader** Appearance: Jess is a sturdy and athletic 9-year-old of medium height with a commanding presence that makes them seem taller than they actually are. They have short, tousled dark brown hair that's often unruly from outdoor activities and expressive hazel eyes that sparkle with determination. Jess's skin is tanned and freckled from frequent outings in the sun. They have a small scar just below their right elbow from an adventurous but slightly misjudged tree climb. Attire: Their typical attire consists of well-worn sneakers, sturdy jeans with a patched knee, and a series of band T-shirts that belong to their favorite adventure movie heroes—often layered under an open plaid flannel shirt. Around the wrist is a homemade friendship bracelet, a symbol of unity with their siblings and friends. **Alex - The Clever Trickster** Appearance: Alex is 10 years old, slightly on the taller side for their age, with a slender build that often appears coiled with latent energy. They have short, neatly combed light hair and wear wire-rimmed glasses that slip down their nose when engrossed in thought. Alex has piercing blue eyes that seem constantly in motion, scanning and taking in their surroundings with an insatiable curiosity. Attire: More often than not, Alex dresses in comfortable but neat clothing—polo shirts in soft colors, cargo pants full of pockets for gadgets, and a digital watch with multiple functions. They also have a magic-trick toy, like a coin slider or a deck of cards, poking out of a pocket, ready to demonstrate their latest illusion. **Sam - The Quiet Dreamer** Appearance: Sam is an 8-year-old with a slight frame and a thoughtful expression, usually found with their head tilted to one side as if pondering the deeper mysteries of the world. They have long, wavy auburn hair that they wear in a loose ponytail, and large, dreamy green eyes framed by delicate lashes. Sam's face carries a soft and kind look, and there's almost always the trace of a smile at the corners of their mouth. Attire: Sam's attire mirrors their introspective nature: comfortable, loose-fitting clothes in earthy tones that blend into the background—think knit sweaters, soft trousers, and canvas sneakers. A beloved piece of jewelry, like a simple necklace with a gemstone pendant, hints at their fascination with crystals and stones. They also carry a small journal, secured by a leather strap, where sketches and musings fill the pages. These detailed physical descriptions contribute to the immersive storytelling of *Little Fears*, allowing players to envision their characters as they interact with each other and their surroundings. Jess’s athleticism, Alex’s inquisitive glances behind glasses, and Sam’s gentle demeanor all add color to the tale of adventure and courage at the mysterious Whispering Oaks Carnival."},{"prompt":"Give me a detailed description of each key locations","completion":"Creating richly detailed settings will enhance the roleplaying experience, making the world of *Little Fears* come alive. Here are the in-depth descriptions of each key location within the Whispering Oaks Carnival. **The Ticket Booth**: The ticket booth stands at the entrance of the carnival grounds, a forlorn structure that seems to keep vigil over a long-forgotten domain. The paint is flaking, revealing the old wood beneath, and the design elements—a palette of bright, cheerful colors—are faded and dulled by time and weather. The small windows, once crystal clear and enticing, are now grimy, with only faint twinkles of light revealing the faintly glowing bulbs within. Cobwebs hang like lace curtains in the corners, and an antique brass cash register sits on the counter, tarnished and untouched. The floor beneath the booth is littered with long-expired tickets and promotional leaflets stuck to the ground—the last whispers of the carnival's heyday. **The Haunted House**: The Haunted House looms menacingly near the midway, a ramshackle building crafted to evoke Gothic horror. The paint, intended to be black, has peeled away in streaks, revealing a dark, greenish mold that seems to creep across the walls. Its shutters hang crookedly on rusting hinges, occasionally banging noisomely against the decaying façade when a breeze passes through. The entrance is framed by an archway of fake bones and grinning skulls, though the flickering lights within their eye sockets have long since dimmed. Inside, the once lively spook-fest of automaton monsters and eerie effects offer only silence and shadows, an unsettling absence that speaks louder than any of the faux screams that once echoed within. **The Carousel of Lost Souls**: The carousel remains in the heart of the carnival, its presence both beguiling and eerie. Its platform is draped in thick cobwebs, and the once-gleaming mirrors are cracked and dusty. The melodic organ, now silent, is a reminder of the lost tunes that carried beneath the stars. Each carved horse—painted in majestic hues of royal blues, deep reds, and vibrant golds—is a testament to the craftsmanship now surrendered to neglect. Faint ethereal glimmers outline the carousel at night, suggesting a latent magic. The wooden floorboards creak mournfully with each ghostly turn, and the air is thick with the scent of time—wood polish mixed with the mildew of abandonment. **The Ferris Wheel to the Stars**: Skeletal against the sky, the Ferris wheel to the Stars is both an imposing and enchanting sight. Its enormous metal frame has fought valiantly against rust, with patches of its original silver paint clinging resiliently to the structure. At night, it becomes a looming silhouette, with each gondola swaying gently in the breeze—a creaking, forgotten giant dreaming of better days. Lights run along the wheel's spokes, many bulbs broken or dimmed, those few that flicker cast an otherworldly glow onto the surrounding grounds. From the apex, the wheel almost touches the heavens, giving the fleeting promise of a ride among the celestial bodies of the night sky. **The Ringmaster’s Quarters**: Tucked away behind the extravagance of the Big Top lies the hidden sanctum of the Ringmaster's Quarters. It's a curious blend of opulence and disorder: rich, red velvet curtains now moth-eaten and discolored, a mahogany desk strewn with yellowing papers detailing long-past performances, and a dusty top hat resting atop a stand. The chamber houses an array of costumes, from lion tamers to acrobats, hanging limply on coatracks, sequins and feathers losing their luster. Personal mementos, such as the Ringmaster's worn riding crop or the framed ticket to the final show, sit among the clutter, silent testimonials to the life that once coursed through the carnival. **The Center Ring**: At the core of the Big Top is the Center Ring, a symbolic stage for countless acts both thrilling and comedic. The cracked earth of the arena, where colorful sawdust once cushioned tumbling acrobats, remains surrounded by tiers of benches that now sag and groan with the burden of time. Dim, overhead spotlights sporadically illuminate the circle, focusing on the abandoned icons—a discarded clown shoe, frayed trapeze ropes, and a rusted unicycle. Despite wear and decay, the ring retains an aura of suspense, the anticipation of a spotlight's click, and an audience's gasp—a ghostly stage waiting for one final performance. Each key location within Whispering Oaks Carnival is redolent with history, suspense, and echoes of laughter and screams that once filled the air, now dormant and waiting to reemerge with each step the children take on their haunting journey."},{"prompt":"Give me a detailed description of what the players can see when they arrive","completion":"As the trio of friends, Jess, Alex, and Sam, arrive at the desolate site of the Whispering Oaks Carnival, the sun has just dipped below the horizon, leaving the sky painted in a gradient of twilight purples and deep blues. In the dimming light, the carnival rises like a specter from the shadows, its silhouette both foreboding and alluring. Here's what they can see: **Entrance and Ticket Booth**: The entrance looms ahead, an archway of twisted metal vines topped with faded script that reads “Whispering Oaks”. It's as if nature is reclaiming the land, with tendrils of ivy snaking up the sides. The ticket booth nearby is in a state of neglect, with its shutters ajar and the festive paint peeling to reveal the weary wood beneath. As the children approach, a glint of light flashes from within the booth, suggesting perhaps not everything within is as dormant as it seems. **Midway**: The central path of the carnival—the midway—is lined with vacant game stalls and concession stands. Dim outlines of gaming prizes, now mere shades of their former selves, hang lifelessly behind counters, while the scent of stale popcorn and cotton candy floats on the breeze as a haunting reminder of excitement long past. The stalls are like rib cages emptied of their joy, and the garlands now grayed and tattered, flit in the wind—a faint rustling greeting as the children pass. **Rides**: In the distance, the rides cast long and crooked shadows on the ground. The Ferris wheel, a gaunt silhouette against the sky, creaks ever so slightly though there is no wind to spur its movement. The carousel is shrouded in a thin mist, creating an ethereal atmosphere that makes the horses seem almost alive, locked in perpetual motion yet trapped in time. The plaintive sound of music, a carousel tune distorted and distant, teases the senses, inviting yet hesitant. **Haunted House**: The Haunted House stands as a dark monolith in a realm of eerie quiet. It's an imposing edifice of false horrors that now seem almost too real. The blood-red letters of \\"House of Horrors\\" atop the entrance are faded and the wooden planks creak ominously without any footsteps to provoke them. An occasional groan of timber suggests this place may hold more than just manufactured scares. **Big Top**: A beacon amidst the decay, the Big Top protrudes with its striped canvas tent billowing gently. Despite the wear, its architecture invokes a sense of grandeur and history. The guiding ropes and stakes are still planted firmly, as though the tent itself refuses to let the carnival be forgotten. A single stream of light shines from the crown of the tent, like a lighthouse signal calling the children forward, to the heart of residual mirth and mystery. As Jess, Alex, and Sam take in their surroundings, the air is charged with a whispering energy. Though the place appears abandoned, it feels very much alive—an uncanny bridge between past festivities and the cryptic present. They can sense the faint heartbeat of the carnival as if something within is stirring, awaiting their arrival to truly awaken."},{"prompt":"Give me a description of the first thing that the players can see when they arrive","completion":"As the players – Jess, Alex, and Sam – step onto the overgrown path leading to the Whispering Oaks Carnival, the first thing to catch their attention is the enigmatic entrance. Bathed in the waning light of dusk, the once cheerful archway reveals itself as a relic of bygone revelry. **The Carnival Archway**: The majestic wrought-iron gates that mark the threshold of the carnival stand slightly ajar, vines creeping over their intricate swirls and spirals like serpents locking the secret of the carnival in their silent embrace. The word \\"Entrance\\" is faintly legible on a rusted sign that sways softly with a ghostly creek above the gates. The once vibrant lettering, now flaked and dulled by time, casts an eerie shadow on the cracked pavement below. Behind the gate, a boulevard of forgotten dreams unfolds. Overhead, strands of broken lights dangle, interspersed with tattered flags and banners that hang limply, semi-illuminated by the fading twilight that manages to push through the leafy canopy. The silence is profound yet pregnant, as if the empty stalls and booths lining the boulevard are holding their breath in anticipation of the children’s next steps.

Mylan, a global pharmaceutical company, acquired the right to sell and market EpiPen in 2007. After Mylan acquired EpiPen, the company significantly increased the price of the device over several years. For example, the price of a two-pack of EpiPens in the United States rose from around 100 in 2007 to approximately 600 in 2016. This steep price increase led to public outcry and widespread criticism, given that there were few alternatives on the market and that EpiPens are a life-saving device for many people with severe allergies. The key issues associated with Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen include: 1. Monopoly Pricing: During the period of the price hikes, Mylan held a near-monopoly on the epinephrine auto-injector market in the U.S. This lack of competition allowed the company to set higher prices. 2. Access and Affordability: With exorbitant prices, the affordability of EpiPens decreased for many individuals and families, even those with health insurance. High deductibles and copays often led to out-of-pocket expenses that some people couldn't afford. 3. Insurer and Pharmacy Benefit Manager Practices: Complex interactions between pharmaceutical companies, insurers, and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) may have contributed to the high costs. Rebates, fees, and other agreements between these entities are often not transparent, leading to questions about how prices are determined. 4. Political and Legal Scrutiny: The pricing controversy led to hearings in the United States Congress, where Mylan's CEO was called to testify. Mylan faced accusations of price gouging and exploitation of its market position. In addition to political scrutiny, Mylan faced legal challenges through class-action lawsuits and settlements related to its pricing practices. 5. Market Response: In response to the controversy, Mylan increased the availability of EpiPen coupons and generic versions, which were slightly less expensive. Additionally, the public outcry and negative press led to increased interest in finding alternative epinephrine auto-injectors and spurring competition in the market. 6. Antitrust Concerns: There were concerns that Mylan engaged in anticompetitive practices to maintain its market dominance, which became a subject of investigation by federal agencies. In the years following the height of the controversy, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved additional epinephrine auto-injectors from other companies, including a generic version that Mylan itself began to offer, which has helped to provide more options for consumers and apply some downward pressure on prices. Despite these developments, the issue remains a critical example of the complexities and challenges of pharmaceutical pricing in the U.S. healthcare system."},{"prompt":"Where Can I access the company MIlans Business info?","completion":"To access detailed business information about Mylan (now part of Viatris after merging with Upjohn, a division of Pfizer, in 2020), you have several options depending on the type of information you are looking for: 1.

In the case of EpiPens, a device critical for individuals suffering from severe allergic reactions, the pricing strategy by Mylan Pharmaceuticals has come under intense public and academic scrutiny. EpiPens are not merely commodities but essential healthcare tools for patients at risk of anaphylaxis. Thus, the ramifications of their pricing extend beyond the balance sheets of Mylan and into the homes and lives of countless patients. This study seeks to examine the extent to which Mylan’s decision to raise EpiPen prices has been ethically and economically justifiable. Through a lens scrutinizing the evidence of Mylan’s actions, the literature on pharmaceutical pricing practices, and the broader impact on society, this analysis will interrogate the moral and economic dimensions of Mylan’s decisions, address the resulting public outcry, and evaluate whether Mylan’s pricing practices can be deemed re asonable within a market-based healthcare system. # Body Paragraph 1: Mylan’s Price Increases and Public Response In 2007, Mylan Pharmaceuticals acquired the rights to manufacture EpiPens, and in the years that followed, the company implemented a price increase exceeding 400%. This drastic escalation drew widespread indignation from consumers, healthcare providers, and policymakers alike. Such a decision by Mylan to raise prices has been perceived as capitalizing on the vulnerable position of patients who, for the sake of their own survival, are compelled to bear the financial burden indiscriminately—which is noteworthy, given that individuals at risk of anaphylaxis are advised to carry two EpiPens at all times. The literature reveals that these cost increments far exceeded the amounts necessary to sustain any purported enhancements to the product, thereby raising questions about the motives behind such pricing strategies and the ethical considerations disregarded by Mylan. # Body Paragraph 2: Economic Impacts and Market Dynamics Economically, the EpiPen scenario underscores the complexity of pharmaceutical pricing and market dynamics where a single player can command significant market share. Mylan’s pricing strategy, examined in light of Emma Westermann-Clark’s analysis, illustrates how dominance in the market can lead to decisions that adversely affect the consumption behavior of patients. Westermann-Clark observed a trend where over half of the EpiPen prescriptions went unfilled once the cost surpassed 300 for a two-pack—an alarming statistic that signals a clear disruption in the access to essential medication due to pricing policies. This data suggests an economic environment where market forces and profit motives overshadow patient well-being and access to care. # Body Paragraph 3: Socioeconomic Disparities and Access The pricing of EpiPens not only reflects on corporate ethics and economic principles but also on wider socioeconomic disparities and issues of access. When prices soar, it is often the economically marginalized and vulnerable populations that bear the disproportionate impact. Westermann-Clark highlighted how socioeconomic factors play a significant role in patient access to epinephrine autoinjectors, indicating that children from higher-income homes were more likely to be prescribed EAIs. This skew suggests that Mylan’s pricing strategy could exacerbate existing inequalities in healthcare access and outcomes, raising the ethical question of whether such a fundamental aspect of medical care should be subject to the whims of market economics and corporate profit maximization. # Body Paragraph 4: Mylan’s Responses to Criticism Despite considerable criticism, Mylan’s responses to public concern over EpiPen pricing indicated a resistance to accept accountability. The company’s communication strategy involved issuing a mix of opaque and sometimes contradictory statements. While Mylan CEO Heather Bresch accepted “full responsibility” for the price hikes at one point, the company also shifted blame onto the complexities of the healthcare system. This obfuscation and lack of transparency do little to engender trust or demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices and patient-oriented values, characteristics that are especially important when a company has such a significant influence on public health. # Body Paragraph 5: Ethical Considerations and Virtue Ethics Analysis From an ethical standpoint, Mylan’s EpiPen pricing strategy can be subjected to further scrutiny through the lens of virtue ethics. Virtue ethics posits that moral behavior is predicated upon the cultivation of virtuous character traits. Assessing Mylan’s actions against Pritchard’s virtues for morally responsible engineers, one finds the company’s commitment to openness, cooperation, and informative communication wanting. Mylan’s decision to eschew cooperation with Medicaid’s Drug Rebate Program and to hinder competition through aggressive legal strategies provides evidence of behavior that conflicts with the expected virtues. Such actions suggest a veering away from morally responsible business conduct, reinforcing concerns regarding the ethical adequacy of the company’s pricing decisions for EpiPens. # Body Paragraph 6: Stakeholder Impact Analysis Stakeholder theory asserts that companies have a responsibility not only to their shareholders but also to a wider community that includes consumers, employees, suppliers, and society at large. Mylan’s decision to increase the price of EpiPens significantly affected various stakeholders, most notably the consumers who depend on this medication for life-threatening allergy attacks. Several stakeholders, including health insurance companies that bear the increased costs and schools mandated to stock EpiPens, face financial strain due to the monopolized pricing strategy. Additionally, shareholders and investors initially may have greeted the profit surge with approval, yet the subsequent reputational damage to Mylan and the legal repercussions negatively impacted long-term shareholder value. This analysis evidences the intricate web of stakeholder interests that Mylan affected and the subsequent need for corporate strategies that balance profit with social responsibility. # Body Paragraph 7: Corporate Culture and Ethical Climate Corporate culture heavily influences decision-making processes and the ethical climate within an organization. Mylan’s aggressive pricing strategy, along with the defensive stance taken against criticism, suggests a corporate culture prioritizing financial results over patient accessibility and ethical considerations. A robust corporate culture nurtures standards of behavior that align with social welfare and ethical norms. However, the evidence suggests Mylan’s internal environment favored market dominance and profit maximization, raising questions about the ethical compass and the integrity of the organizational culture. The dissonance between Mylan’s actions and the expectations of a socially responsible entity reveals a culture that undermined the values of fairness and transparency, which are vital for sustaining trust and respect among stakeholders. # Body Paragraph 8: Long-Term Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Myriad actors within the pharmaceutical industry have increasingly recognized the significance of long-term sustainability and corporate responsibility as critical components of their operational ethos. Mylan’s initial financial success with EpiPen price increases belies a deeper concern for long-term viability, as prices that marginalize consumers can lead to legal repercussions and shifts in public policy that favor market competition. Sustainable practices necessitate pricing strategies that consider affordability and access while still incentivizing innovation. By prioritizing short-term gains over sustainable pricing, Mylan risked its future market position and eroded trust—both of which are fundamental to the long-term success and corporate responsibility that stakeholders increasingly demand from modern pharmaceutical companies. # Body Paragraph 9: The Role of Regulation and Industry Standards The Mylan EpiPen saga underscores the need for enhanced regulation and industry-wide standards that prevent exploitative pricing of essential medications. While market forces play a pivotal role in price determination, the pharmaceutical industry faces unique moral imperatives, given the life-or-death nature of its products. The outcry resulting from Mylan’s pricing strategy suggests that self-regulation is insufficient when it comes to essential drugs. Thus, interventions such as price caps, increased transparency requirements, and incentives for generic drug production emerge as necessary measures to protect consumers and ensure fair market practices. These regulations serve to deter market abuse and ensure that the pharmaceutical industry upholds its ethical obligation to society while safeguarding economic interests. # Body Paragraph 10: Alternative Models for Pricing and Distribution The backlash against Mylan’s pricing strategy suggests the need for alternative models for pharmaceutical pricing and distribution. Strategies such as value-based pricing and tiered pricing schemes could align the cost of drugs like EpiPens more closely with their actual value and cost of production, while also considering the patients’ ability to pay. Additionally, implementing differential pricing across markets can ensure wider access to medication, particularly for vulnerable populations. Mylan’s experience highlights the importance of adopting innovative and equitable models that balance profitability with social responsibility, allowing pharmaceutical companies to maintain a positive image, adhere to ethical standards, and cater to diverse demographic needs. # Body Paragraph 11: Impact on Research and Development Research and development (R&D) in the pharmaceutical industry is a double-edged sword—while it is essential for innovation and the creation of life-saving drugs, it also serves as a frequent justification for high drug prices. In Mylan’s case, the argument that EpiPen price increases were necessary to fund R&D falls short when considering the subsequent pricing controversies and minimal changes made to the EpiPen during Mylan’s tenure. This draws attention to the need for transparency and accountability in the allocation of revenues toward genuine innovation, rather than using R&D as a blanket rationale for disproportionate price hikes on essential medications. # Body Paragraph 12: Ethics of Profit in the Pharmaceutical Industry An ethical conundrum emerges when considering the role of profit in the pharmaceutical industry. While companies like Mylan are accountable to their shareholders to generate profits, there is a moral expectation to do so within the bounds of social good, especially when dealing with products that are life-saving. Profits gained at the expense of access to critical medicine call into question the ethical practices of the firm. The EpiPen situation serves as a stark reminder that profit motives must be balanced with the moral duty to safeguard human life, necessitating a re-examination of how profits are earned and the extent to which they are permitted to influence life-or-death decisions in healthcare.","completion":"Your Internal Assessment draft provides a well-structured and comprehensive analysis of Mylan’s pricing strategy for EpiPens, with each body paragraph dedicated to a different aspect of the issue.

Abbreviations: AWP, average wholesale price; ea, each; NDC: national drug code. Use of the AWP is controversial, but it is often used as a proxy for societal cost in cost-effectiveness analyses.9 An economic analysis published in 2011 utilized the 2006–2007 AWP of the EpiPen to estimate the annual cost of EAIs for food-induced SARs.10 According to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research good research practices guidelines from 2010: Pharmaceutical prices used in the vast majority of cost-effectiveness analyses are either based on AWPs in the USA or government-negotiated prices in Europe. The former are not only imperfect measures of actual prices paid (e.g., ignoring discounts and rebates), but may also greatly overestimate societal opportunity costs because of the implicit inclusion of producer surplus created through patent-protected monopoly pricing.11 In summary, AWP is used as an approximation for societal drug costs, despite its limitations. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) discusses the challenge of determining medication costs for research purposes. The HERC states, “We recommend using 121% of the drug costs reported in the Federal Supply Schedule, 152% of the VA cost, or 64% of AWP. To find the cost of a generic label prescription drug, we recommend using 27% of AWP.”9 Federal Supply Schedule prices are publicly available.12 Several factors limit the ability of newer products to garner and maintain a better market share versus Mylan’s EpiPen. First, the EpiPen has name recognition. Second, training for the use of each device is different. To illustrate, the epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector from Impax Generics requires the removal of two caps rather than just one. Although learning to use a new device can be challenging, novel design elements can improve safety and usability. An example is that the Auvi-Q has unique features including its rectangular shape intended to fit into a pocket, a retractable needle, and voice instructions. Third, insurance coverage differs for each EAI. According to the Managed Markets Insight and Technology database, the EpiPen has unrestricted access for 61% of commercial lives among 4624 commercial health plans.13 In contrast, Auvi-Q has unrestricted access for “19% of commercial lives in all locations” among these same commercial health plans.8 Even though Auvi-Q is not covered by many commercial insurance plans, the manufacturer offers it with 0 copayment to all commercially insured and Medicaid patients through a specialty pharmacy network distributor. Fourth, EAIs are rated “BX” by the FDA indicating that “data that have been reviewed by the Agency are insufficient to determine therapeutic equivalence” and when ordered may not be substituted by a pharmacist, one for another.14 The impact of copayments, coupons, and patient assistance programs on prices that subjects pay at the pharmacy counter requires further research. Pourang et al found that copayments did not affect the likelihood of an EAI being dispensed once it was prescribed in the Kaiser Permanente Health Maintenance Organization.15 However, while the authors indicate that nearly 30% of copayments exceeded 30, they did not consider higher copayments. Data are not available on prescription:dispense ratios for subjects with exceedingly high copayments or for uninsured and underinsured subjects who may pay retail prices. More than 50% of EpiPen prescriptions are abandoned or not filled when the cost exceeds 300 for a 2-pack.5 Two generic EAIs manufactured by Mylan have an AWP of 375. Two generic EAIs manufactured by Impax Generics have an AWP of 494.01. Patients with any commercial insurance plan or Medicaid receive Auvi-Q for 0 copayment through the specialty pharmacy network, ASPN Pharmacies LLC (200 Park Avenue, Suite 300, Florham Park, NJ 07932, 973-295-3289). All uninsured subjects who make <100,000 annually have no copayment for Auvi-Q; uninsured subjects whose incomes exceed 100,000 pay no more than 360 for Auvi-Q. Socioeconomic factors impact access to EAIs. Children from high-income versus low-income homes are 8.35 times more likely to be prescribed EAIs.16 Medicaid-enrolled children are less likely to receive EAIs prior to arrival at an emergency department.17 In another study, Caucasian versus non-Caucasian children were more likely to receive epinephrine early during an SAR.18 Early use of epinephrine was defined as epinephrine administered before arrival to the emergency department. Owning an EAI greatly increased the odds of early epinephrine treatment (odds ratio 12.67, 95% CI: 4.46–35.96). The authors did not assess insurance status but indicate that this finding suggests that there might be an economic influence on access to EAIs.18 Fleming et al examined the out-of-pocket costs for medications associated with food allergy and found higher costs for Caucasian and higher-income subjects.18 They hypothesize that Medicaid-enrolled children may have lower out-of-pocket costs, that is, lower copayments. To reduce or eliminate insurance copayments, Fromer suggests that epinephrine be classified as a preventive medicine by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).5 Decision analysis software (TreeAge Pro, Williamstown, MA, USA) has been used to evaluate the cost of generic EAIs versus the EpiPen using a model that tracked spending for individual subjects over 20 years, with the assumption that each subject needs two 2-packs yearly, one each for home and school or work.19 The cost for the EpiPen over a 20-year model duration totals 58,667 (95% CI: 57,745–59,588) versus 45,588 for the generic EAI (95% CI: 44,873–46,304). The model also incorporates other food allergy-related costs, such as specialist visits, grocery costs, and loss of work time for parents of food-allergic children. These costs are assumed to be the same for all subjects regardless of the type of EAI prescribed. The price of EAIs also affects school districts and communities. The Michigan legislature mandated that all public schools stock EAIs. It estimated the cost for two EAI 2-packs, one adult and one pediatric, at 140, while the “recently reported costs for commercial sources” was 1200, according to the authors of the article. The annual calculated cost to Michigan public schools based on these two cost estimates ranges from 565,460 to 4,846,800.20 A 2007 WAO survey of its House of Delegates indicates that EAIs are available in 59% of 44 countries surveyed.21 Those without EAIs employed other methods for the self-administration of epinephrine.22 These include the use of ampules of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) with an empty 1 cc syringe to be drawn up as needed or prefilled syringes containing various amounts of epinephrine. Both options are much less expensive than EAIs; for example, a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) had an AWP of 2.52 and retail price of ~12 in 2016.7 Epinephrine ampules may not be available in all countries. Both options also allow for tailored dosing of epinephrine, above or below the standard 0.15 or 0.3 mg doses contained in most FDA-approved EAIs. This may be beneficial for children weighing <15 kg (33 pounds) or for large or obese subjects. Of note, in November 2017, the FDA approved an infant version of the Auvi-Q, Auvi-q 0.1mg, for children weighing 7.5–15 kg (16.5–33 pounds). It has a shorter needle and a smaller dose of epinephrine (0.1 mg versus 0.15 mg contained in other “junior” products). Market forces appear to influence the cost of EAIs. For example, some US companies are offering low-cost alternatives. Symjepi™ (Adamis, San Diego, CA, USA) is an epinephrine prefilled syringe (EPS) that contains 0.3 mg of epinephrine, with a user-friendly design. It was approved by the FDA in June 2017 for subjects 30 kg (66 pounds) or more and is expected to be available at a lower cost than the current EAIs. A “junior” version is expected to follow. The concept of prefilled syringes is not new. The Ana-Kit® (Hollister-Stier Laboratories, Spokane, WA, USA) consisted of a syringe filled with 1 mL of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) housed in a protective case for subcutaneous injection before it was removed from the US market.23,24 The Ana-Kit syringe had 0.1 mL graduations so that smaller doses could be administered depending on the subject’s age. The instructions recommended the following doses: “Adults and children over 12 years: 0.3 mL; 6–12 years: 0.2 mL; 2–6 years: 0.15 mL; infants to 2 years: 0.05–0.1 mL.”25 An appropriate dose could be administered by pushing the syringe plunger until it stopped. A second dose could be administered as appropriate, after rotating the rectangular plunger ¼ turn to the right, to line up with a rectangular slot in the syringe.25 An advantage of the prefilled Symjepi syringe is that it is housed in a dark blue plastic encasement to protect the epinephrine from ultraviolet light degradation. Epinephrine degrades with exposure to ultraviolet light, oxygen in ambient air, and excessive heat.26–28 EPSs stored at room temperature in a pencil box maintain acceptable US Pharmacopeia concentrations (90%–115% of label claim), pH, and sterility for 3 months.22 The stability is limited to 2 months in high-temperature and low-humidity climates.22,29 In addition, some physicians and other health care professionals provide subjects with prefilled syringes wrapped in aluminum foil.28,30 These can be transported in a crush-resistant eyeglass case. Snap Medical Industries (Dubin, OH, USA) has developed EpinephrineSnap-V® (a kit containing a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes) and the EpinephrineSnap convenience kit (a kit containing an ampule of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes). The Focus Health Group, located in Knoxville, TN, USA, has been contracted to commercialize these products. The AWP of this product is 1567 although information from company officials states that the average price of EpinephrineSnap is 80 and the EpinephrineSnap-V is 130, with discounted group purchasing organization pricing available (Personal communication, November 1, 2017). Use of these options may not be as practical as is an EAI. The reason is that an epinephrine ampule or vial with an empty syringe requires more skill to properly draw up the epinephrine and administer it under emergency circumstances. Parents of individuals with a history of an SAR take longer to draw up epinephrine from an ampule (average 142±13 seconds) compared to emergency department nurses (29±0.09 seconds; p<0.05).31 The epinephrine dose drawn up by parents also ranged 40-fold as compared to twofold for emergency department nurses.31 The EpinephrineSnap products are geared toward use by emergency medical technicians and other health care professionals rather than individual subjects. The rising cost of EAIs has made self-administered epinephrine potentially unavailable to some subjects. There are no data on deaths attributed to inability to afford EAIs. Lower-cost alternatives such as EPSs and epinephrine kits are entering the US market. EAIs have advantages, such as ease of use, but they are expensive. More research is needed on the complexity of drug pricing and on the optimal methods to determine individual and societal costs. Classifying EAIs as USPSTF preventive medicines could improve access by reducing or eliminating copayments.","completion":"Based on the evidence provided, your IA can analyze several key points related to Mylan's pricing of EpiPens.

Your final IA should present well-supported conclusions based on the evidence and address the larger implications for ethical and economic practices in pharmaceutical pricing."},{"prompt":"take away the parts that need improvment and include the ones you just told me using the specific evidence","completion":"To create a well-structured Internal Assessment (IA), I will combine the provided evidence with the suggestions I've made previously, ensuring a clear focus on the ethical and economic analysis of the pricing strategy for EpiPens implemented by Mylan. Below is a crafted example of how to integrate the specific evidence you provided into your IA: **Introduction** *(Briefly introduce the background and importance of epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs), Mylan's acquisition of EpiPen, and the subsequent impact on pricing. Present your research question and thesis statement on the ethical and economic evaluation of Mylan's pricing strategy.)* **Mylan's Pricing Strategy** After acquiring the EpiPen, Mylan increased the average wholesale price (AWP) by 545% from 113.27 to 730.33 for two EpiPens. Such a stark increase has raised allegations of exploitative pricing, particularly as this rise outpaced inflation. The AWP serves as an approximated metric for societal drug costs despite recognized imperfections, as acknowledged by economic analyses and the Veterans Affairs Health Economics Resource Center. **Economic Impact Analysis** Analyze the AWP data for EpiPens (Figure 1), indicating the change in pricing from 2001 to 2016, and discuss the economic implications of Mylan’s dominance in the EAI market. Explain market dynamics based on the evidence that half of EpiPen prescriptions are abandoned when costs exceed a certain threshold, which highlights potential barriers to access. **Public Response and Accessibility** Discuss the aforementioned prescription abandonment rates in response to EpiPen pricing, which indicate a disruption in access to necessary medication. Reference the socioeconomic impact, as children from wealthier families are significantly more likely to obtain EAIs, suggesting that Mylan’s pricing disproportionately affected lower-income populations. **Corporate Ethics and Responses to Criticism** Scrutinize Mylan’s ethical stance, examining their public responses to criticism over EpiPen prices. Assess whether their statements and actions aligned with the ethical expectations placed upon them given their product's life-saving nature. **Regulatory Implications and Market Dynamics** Examine the regulatory environment, such as the FDA's \\"BX\\" rating for EAIs, which impacts the substitutability of products at the pharmacy level. Discuss the implications for market competition and how it may or may not have constrained Mylan's pricing power. **Alternatives and Cost-Savings Measures** Present the AWP of alternative epinephrine products and their respective availabilities, as well as Mylan's introduction of generic versions priced at 375 for a two-pack. Consider the role of copayments, coupons, and patient assistance programs, and their potential to mitigate out-of-pocket costs. **Long-term Implications and Societal Costs** Incorporate evidence related to the broader societal implications, such as the financial burden placed on school districts and communities tasked with stocking EAIs. Address long-term costs using economic models and assess whether such costs were justifiable against other food allergy-related expenses. **Discussion and Critical Analysis** Synthesize your research findings, discussing the evidence within an ethical and economic framework. Analyze Mylan's financial gains from the price hike against the societal costs and ethical implications of potentially reduced access to life-saving medication. **Conclusion** In your conclusion, restate your thesis and summarize the analysis. Provide your final assessment on whether Mylan's pricing strategy for EpiPens can be considered ethically and economically justifiable. Make suggestions for future research and potential policy changes to prevent excessive pharmaceutical pricing practices. **References** *(List your references and all sources from which evidence was drawn or analyzed, formatted according to the required style for your IA.)* Remember, this is an example structure, and you will need to write and compile your own IA based on the collected evidence and guided by your program's specifications.

The error is a runtime error rather than a compile-time error, which means your app is failing during execution. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this problem: 1. **Restart Metro Bundler:** Stop the Metro bundler if it's currently running, then start it again. This can be done by closing the terminal window where Metro is running or by stopping it using the shortcut \`Ctrl + C\`. Then you can restart it by running: \`\`\`sh npx react-native start \`\`\` or \`\`\`sh yarn start \`\`\` Make sure you're running this command from the root directory of your React Native project. 2. **Clear Cache:** Sometimes old cache can cause issues. You can clear the Metro bundler cache with: \`\`\`sh npx react-native start --reset-cache \`\`\` or \`\`\`sh yarn start --reset-cache \`\`\` 3. **Check App Registration:** Ensure that your main application component is registered correctly with \`AppRegistry\` in your \`index.js\` (or \`index.android.js\`/\`index.ios.js\` if platform-specific). The file should look something like this: \`\`\`js import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native'; import App from './App'; import { name as appName } from './app.json'; AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App); \`\`\` The \`name\` in \`app.json\` should match the string used in \`AppRegistry.registerComponent\`. 4. **Inspect Imports:** Look for any import errors in your JavaScript code that might prevent modules from being imported correctly, which would in turn prevent \`AppRegistry.registerComponent\` from being called. 5. **Rebuild the App:** After performing the above steps, try rebuilding your app: \`\`\`sh npx react-native run-android \`\`\` or \`\`\`sh yarn android \`\`\` 6. **Check for Hermes Issues:** Since the error mentioned Hermes, it's worth ensuring that there are no specific issues related to Hermes that might be affecting your app. If you've recently enabled Hermes, you could try disabling it to see if the issue persists.

The decision to enable Hermes is conditioned on a property \`expo.jsEngine\` which can be set in your Gradle properties (\`gradle.properties\` file). If you are not using Expo, or if you want to explicitly control whether Hermes is enabled, you can set \`hermesEnabled\` directly without relying on the \`expo.jsEngine\` property. You can set \`hermesEnabled\` to \`true\` to enable Hermes or \`false\` to disable it: \`\`\`groovy hermesEnabled = false \`\`\` Make sure to place it within the \`android\` block in your \`app/build.gradle\` file as follows: \`\`\`groovy android { ... defaultConfig { ... // whether Hermes should be enabled def hermesEnabled = false } ... } \`\`\` If you want to keep the existing behavior with the potential option from \`expo.jsEngine\`, and you're sure the Expo configuration is correct, ensure that you've got your Gradle properties set up correctly.

Since you're working with React Native and the error mentions Hermes, let's approach the problem step-by-step: 1. **Ensure \`AppRegistry\` is Called**: In your entry JavaScript file, typically \`index.js\`, ensure that you are registering your main application component properly like this: \`\`\`javascript import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native'; import App from './App'; import { name as appName } from './app.json'; AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App); \`\`\` Make sure that the \`name\` property in \`app.json\` matches the string you pass to \`AppRegistry\`. 2. **Restart Metro Bundler**: Stop the Metro server and start it again, making sure you're running it from the root directory of your React Native project where your \`package.json\` and \`node_modules\` directory are. \`\`\`sh npx react-native start --reset-cache \`\`\` 3. **Rebuild the Application**: Clean the build folder and rebuild the app: \`\`\`sh cd android ./gradlew clean cd .. npx react-native run-android \`\`\` 4. **Inspect Hermes Configuration**: Given the presence of the \`hermesEnabled\` line in your \`build.gradle\`, verify that it is correctly configured. If you are using Expo, and based on the line you have provided, it seems that your project is potentially attempting to decide on a JS engine based on the \`expo.jsEngine\` property. If your project is not managed by Expo, or if you want to explicitly set Hermes without relying on Expo configuration, you can directly set: \`\`\`groovy def hermesEnabled = true // or false to disable Hermes \`\`\` In the \`android\` block of the \`app/build.gradle\`. 5. **Check JavaScript Engine Configuration**: If switching JavaScript engines, ensure you're following the correct procedures. For Hermes with Expo, \`jsEngine\` config in \`app.json\` should be set, and you may need to run \`expo update\` if changing the JS engine so that Expo configures the native projects appropriately. 6. **Debug the Runtime Error**: The error message \`Cannot read property 'prefix' of null\` suggests that somewhere in your code (or one of your dependencies) you're trying to access a \`prefix\` property of an object that is \`null\`. You can debug this by looking at the stack trace provided by the error to identify the file and line where this occurs. If it's within a dependency, ensure you are using the correct version and have followed the setup instructions properly. 7. **Review Dependency Versions**: If the culprit is a third-party dependency, make sure you're using the latest stable version or a version that is known to work with your current setup. Check the issue trackers of the third-party dependencies to see if this is a known problem, and check if there are fixes or workarounds suggested. 8. **Ensure All Packages Are Installed**: Check all dependencies in your \`package.json\` are correctly installed in the \`node_modules\` directory. If in doubt, you can delete your \`node_modules\` directory and \`yarn.lock\` or \`package-lock.json\`, then install them again: \`\`\`sh rm -rf node_modules rm yarn.lock # or package-lock.json if using npm yarn install # or npm install \`\`\` If none of these steps resolves the problem, please provide additional information about where in the code the error is occurring (e.g., which file and function, or if it's part of a third-party library) and any other relevant context that might help diagnose the issue further."},{"prompt":"carro","completion":"Un carro es un vehículo motorizado de cuatro ruedas diseñado para el transporte de personas o mercancías.

Critically discuss the advantages and limitations of this tool- 500 words","completion":"Decision tree analysis is a versatile tool widely used in various fields, including procurement, for making informed decisions. By modeling decisions as a tree-like graph, where each node represents a decision or chance event and its associated risks, rewards, and probabilities, procurement professionals can visualize and evaluate the outcomes of different bidding strategies. Let's critically discuss the advantages and limitations of using decision tree analysis for the procurement bid. **Advantages:** 1. **Simplicity and Clarity:** Decision trees provide a simple visual representation that is easy to understand and communicate to stakeholders, which also helps in identifying the most significant factors affecting a decision. 2. **Quantitative Analysis:** They allow procurement teams to quantify and compare the potential outcomes of different decisions by incorporating the costs, benefits, and probabilities of each alternative, making it easier to choose the most cost-effective bid. 3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Decision trees compel users to consider all possible alternatives and outcomes, which reduces the likelihood of overlooking important options or consequences, leading to a more thorough bid evaluation. 4. **Risk Assessment:** By factoring in the probability of various scenarios, decision trees help in assessing the risks associated with each bid. Procurement teams can hence identify which bid provides the best balance between risk and reward. 5. **Incorporating Flexibility:** Users can easily update decision trees with new information or changes in market conditions, making them a dynamic tool that can adapt to evolving scenarios. 6. **Useful for Non-Linear Problems:** Unlike some analytical methods that require linear relationships, decision trees can handle complex, non-linear relationships between variables. **Limitations:** 1. **Over-simplification:** A decision tree might oversimplify reality by disregarding certain variables that do not neatly fit into the tree structure. This can result in the omission of critical factors that could impact the outcome of a procurement bid. 2. **Data Dependency:** The accuracy of a decision tree's predictions heavily relies on the quality of the data and the probabilities entered into the model. Estimating these probabilities can be fraught with uncertainties which may skew the analysis. 3. **Complexity with Large Trees:** As the number of decisions and uncertainties increases, the tree can become very large and complex, making it difficult to manage and interpret. 4. **Biased Results:** Decision trees can inadvertently reflect the biases of the people creating them, particularly in the subjective estimation of probabilities and in deciding which branches to include or exclude. 5. **Static Snapshots:** Despite their adaptability, decision trees provide a static snapshot of a situation at a given time. They may not be able to accommodate the dynamic nature of market conditions that can change rapidly, thus potentially leading to outdated analyses. 6. **Cost of Development:** Building a comprehensive decision tree can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring expertise to ensure accurate and reliable outcomes. In conclusion, decision tree analysis offers procurement professionals a structured and systematic approach to evaluating bids. While it aids in demystifying complex decisions and provides a framework for risk assessment, it also has its limitations. Users must be cautious of over-simplification, data quality issues, and potential biases. For these reasons, it's often best to use decision trees as one of several tools, with findings validated by additional methods to ensure robust decision-making in the bidding process."},{"prompt":"Kto si","completion":"Som AI (umelej inteligencie) vytvorený spoločnosťou OpenAI s názvom ChatGPT.

I will provide information about the system in the next message and data about the characters after it: 500 years have passed since the tumultuous events of **The Chaotic Era I: The Gods of Reason**, a decisive chapter in history. It all began during the Theoclasm, a cataclysmic event triggered when the Theoclasts, a technologically advanced race, captured the powerful deity YHVH, resulting in the devastation of the old continent of Pectus. Fleeing the horrors of this apocalypse, the survivors sought refuge on the distant shores of Yuandi, where the saga of **The Chaotic Era II: The New Mythology** will take place. **Theoclasm:** The term \\"Theoclasm\\", derived from *Théos* (God, Deity, Divinity) and *Klastós* (Broken, Fractured), encapsulates the pivotal moment that incited the mass exodus from Pectus. YHVH, the god of light and ruler of Paradise, fell into the clutches of the Theoclasts, leading to the apotheosis of Ptah-Khnemu. Strengthened by this deity, the Theoclasts became an unstoppable force, leading Ma'at, who later allied himself with mortals, to reveal that Ptah-Khnemu imagined a world free from the control of the deities, but was still undecided whether to exterminate the mortals who disagreed with his vision or allying with supporters. A betrayal unfolded when Montu-Sekhmet, daughter of Ptah-Khnemu himself, seized power during the height of Theoclasm, having intentions contrary to those of her father, seeking to rebuild the universe from scratch. Ma'at, who millennia ago was infused with a deity whose name was lost to time, escaped the clutches of her own race, seeking refuge in Yuandi lest she become a mere tool or source of power. With her advanced technological knowledge and divine abilities, she erected five monumental pillars, enclosing the new continent within a protective barrier. This sanctuary attracted not only mortal inhabitants but also lesser deities, fearful of a Theoclast incursion. After Ma'at's death, her essence fragmented, each fragment containing a portion of her memories and powers, while her remains were buried in the reliquary of the Archbishopric of Ma'at, where she is believed to still work miracles. After the fall of YHVH, the angels, previously subservient to the deity, regained their free will, while the demons were thrown into disarray following the disappearance of their master. The ensuing chaos led to an anarchic exodus from Hell, the domain of their lord ALMF (Alumniferus), resulting in confusion and insanity, which led to the suicide of many angels and demons. Some remaining demons now disguise themselves as mortals and mythical beings from Yuandi. Although many angels strive to defend YHVH's legacy through their temples, the whereabouts of the goddess of chaos, NLTP (Niarlatotepe), and the god of darkness remain unknown within the protective barrier. These turbulent consequences and the unstable balance of divine forces now set the stage for an epic story of survival, power struggles, and ever-shifting alliances within Yuandi. Now for the races' lore: Renshi The Rénshi are one of the native races of the new continent and are the most numerous race. Most inhabit the Ozumi Empire (based on the Empire of Japan), with significant numbers in the Wildlands, the territory of the Followers of Ma'at, and the southern tip of Igirith. The Shun culture, named after the eponymous Shun Dynasty (based on Chinese culture), once almost dominated the entire continent, making them enemies of other races and cultures. The Ozumi Empire, originating from the outlying islands east of the Shun lands, took advantage of the previous empire's weakness during the instability caused by the war against the Theoclasts and seized power. The other cultures under Ozumi's rule consider them tyrants who imagine themselves superior to their own race. They are technologically advanced thanks to a partnership with the Republic of New Medietas. The Ozumi Empire is ruled by an empress who apparently takes direct orders from her divine ancestor, Susa-tsu-Nushi-no-Mikoto. There are several noble clans and a warrior caste that is in decline due to the use of firearms. There are still a few noble clans from other cultures who swore allegiance to Ozumi and were allowed to rule their ancestral lands. The \\"Wild Renshi\\" or \\"Barbarian Renshi\\" live outside of the Ozumi Empire's administration, mostly on the tundra and arctic climates of the far southern portion of the continent. They are mostly hunters, reindeer herders, and fishermen. They wear animal skins, live in tribes, and are very resistant to the cold (based on Inuit and Chukotko-Kamchatkan cultures) their warrior class (akin to the samurai) is in decline due to the widespread use of firearms, thus many warrior clans founded conglomerates and began hiring commoners to work in fields such as metal processing, textiles, weapon fabrication, mass production of arcane goods etc. \\"Archaic\\" practices, such as martial arts, archery, and swordfighting are preserved due to their cultural value and people in the military are still trained for them They have vast natural reserves that their national deity itself deemed sacred so that the nation doesn't lose its natural beauty. That's why most of the Ozumi factories and facilities are located in the mainland on lands traditionally inhabited by the Shun Renshi Humans The humans are the descendants of the humans who fled the Theoclasm on Pectus. They managed to obtain some examples of Theoclast technology during the war and, after reverse engineering, drastically developed their weapons, tools and architecture. The Republic of New Medietas is an example of industrial advancement on the continent. Their society combines coal- and steam-powered machines with magical items. The streets of the largest cities are teeming with citizens amid the rhythmic bustle of machines and the smoke of factories. The citizens of Nova Medietas boast an unwavering work ethic, where labor and industry reign supreme. A resolute commitment to capitalism fuels innovation and competition, driving the relentless pursuit of wealth and economic dominance. Although Nova Medietas does not have a formal clan system, a select group of influential noble houses wield considerable power, guiding the nation's policies and future. These houses are closely linked to prosperous industrial conglomerates. At the forefront of technological progress, the republic is a pioneer in the development of complex automatons and goelms and advanced machinery. Inventors and engineers drive notable advances, positioning the country as an industrial and technological powerhouse. The Republic of New Medietas strategically allies itself with neighboring powers. They maintain a robust partnership with the Sulcaic Empire, reinforcing mutual interests and security. Likewise, friendly relations with the Ozumi Empire promote trade and technological collaboration. Sulkai Since they originated from Yuandi, the logistics of returning most of the Sulkai population from Pectus were simpler. Their empire has remained stable for the ~500 years since the Theoclasm took place. They appreciate refined food and items and place great importance on money and nobility. A good portion of the sulkai settlers in Pectus were merchants. As a general rule, they are gentle, delicate and sometimes passively aggressive. Their society and technology used to be more sophisticated than Pectus's until the humans made incredible advances. Their ship models are still the most used to navigate what little ocean that was left around Yuandi. Their society is loosely divided into castes, but an individual can change social status relatively easily. There are the commoners, the merchants and artisans, the knights and soldiers, the burghers, the elite wizards and the nobility, with the imperial family at the top. Many of the sulkai who came to Pectus seeking to amass wealth returned to the Sulcaic Empire completely poor and in the condition of refugees. Noble families are divided into clans with a semi-mythical ancestor being the founder of the house, a fundamental factor in legitimizing the relevance of a family. They have artifacts, which were supposedly forged by their ancestors. Their tales and stories often involve much more magic and the forces of nature. Superficially they look like pale humans with blue, green, or white hair and blue, green, or grey eyes, but their bodies function in quite different ways. Their longevity is greater, as is the time between childhood and maturity (a 30-year-old sulkai is considered a teenager). Their bodies are lighter and metabolic processes seem to affect their bodies much more, for example it takes much less time for a sulkai to get drunk or for a medicine to take effect. In the rare cases where they interbreed with humanoid races, the resulting progeny are always born sulkai. The incidence of aptitude for magic is extremely high, with 4 out of 5 having the potential. Their susceptibility to cold iron stems from the fact that they are descendants of the same ancestral population that originated the humans and eniyan of Pectus, who then interbred with faeries when they landed from the lost continent in the north of the world. While the nobility holds great importance, heads of banks and commercial enterprises, each with a personal army, and each locked in a constant struggle against all the others, hold great relevance and economic power. They have enough capital to resolve any foreign diplomatic quandaries with a well-placed sum of money or threat of withdrawal from trade. Thus, many conflicts in other nations were resolved by the economic influence of certain organizations and companies. Their religion differs drastically from the Church of YHVH. It is based on semi-mythical ancestor worship, who fulfill a similar role to saints. The existence of gods is recognized, but generally relegated to a secondary role, even if the Theoclasm made them inhabit the Barrier. Their fairy ancestors, or nature spirits, are worshiped instead. They are considered to be more sophisticated and superior to other races, sometimes attracting the hatred of some individuals. They get along especially well with the humans, whom they consider their allies for having granted the Colony of Levantia to the Sulcaic Empire. With the Theoclasm, it was the sulkai's turn to cede territory to their allies. Their aptitude for trade is always welcome in the farthest reaches, and even tribal chiefs seek out the sulkai for business. As mentioned earlier, it has been confirmed that sulkai descended from the union of proto-humans with fairies, or nature spirits. Namely naiads and haliads (water spirits), epigeia and dryads (nature spirits), aureads and boreads (wind spirits). Anglo-Elves Elves and Weisslander humans, after fleeing Pectus during the Theoclasm, unexpectedly found themselves sharing the same land west of the continent of Yuandi. Despite the mutual dislike between both races, they ended up mixing, resulting in the hybrid race known today as the Anglo-Elves. Even before the assimilation between both races, it was noted that children of elf-human couples always resulted in an appearance almost identical to that of humans, without the golden skin, pointed ears and light hair that elves prized. Strangely, the fruits of such unions were always born with red, orange or pinkish hair and elven eye colours (blue, green, golden). Despite the mixing of these two races, there is still an elite of pure elves who govern the nation in a not so explicit way. Culturally, the Anglo-Elves are a fusion of elven and weisslander cultures, with a simultaneous focus on battles and intellectualism, on physical combat and magical combat, among other aspects. There are also a significant number of dark-skinned Anglo-Elves descended from the eniyan of Pectus. Magic is a revered aspect of society, guided by guilds of wizards who educate potential wizards. Approximately half of Anglo-elves show potential for magic, with only a few becoming accomplished wizards. The Anglo-Elves practice a syncretic faith that has characteristics of the faith of YHVH, the ancestor worship practiced by the Elves, and the tribal polytheism of the Weisslanders. Clans can trace their lineages to specific individuals who embarked on the journey fleeing the continent of Pectus. While ancestor worship is typically done in family shrines at home, the worship of YHVH is done in public temples. The Anglo-Elves have long been at war with the Hazrun over territorial claims to an island to the west of both nations. This island, called Haséaleen by the Anglo-Elves and Haşarin by the Hazrun, has one of five pillars that maintain a protective barrier around the continent. The Anglo-Elves already have one of the towers, the Red Pillar, in their territory and want the Black Pillar, stating that Hazrun cannot be trusted to possess it. Mustalf Pectus’ “accursed race” again survives a great cataclysm and finds itself destined to roam another continent without its own land or nation. Unlike the ancient Dark Elves, the Mustalf (In Elvish: Must = Dark; Alf = Elf) no longer live only in underground shelters, currently choosing to live as nomadic traders who roam the nations buying and selling exotic goods. They have a few autonomous territories in Yuandi, and a number of mustalf live in the territory of the Followers of Ma’at. They are considered a cursed race by the elves. Thousands of years ago, the “Bloodstained Emperor” murdered the other three members of the Quadrumvirate and fled from the Sonne Insel archipelago to Pectus’ mainland with thousands of followers, who were later cursed by an unknown deity or altered by a powerful relic of the elves. The Alveglaan elves symbolically interpret the darkening of traitors as the mark of their unforgivable crime. Everyone is expected to work for the good of society, including children, the elderly and women. The Mustalf are trained from childhood to perform certain tasks or jobs and continue to contribute until they are unable to in some way. Their ears are movable and expressive, just like an elf’s. They have no body and facial hair (except eyebrows and eyelashes), which they consider a sign of barbarity. Short hair is socially accepted, both in men and women, but it is seen as a sign of youthfulness and immaturity. Probably as a result of their ancestors living underground, their hearing is sharper and their eyes are sensitive to light. The Mustalf have a strong sense of community and place a high value on loyalty and solidarity with their own kind. They have a tendency to put the needs of the community above the needs of the individual. Many of them consider it essential to learn at least one foreign language, to play at least one instrument, and to know at least one trade, since most of their livelihood depends on trading with different races. Hazrun One of the races native to Yuandi and the third most numerous. The hazrun were dominated for centuries by the Shun Dynasty. With the collapse of the old empire and its subsequent takeover by Ozumi, the hazrun found themselves finally free and slaughtered the remaining Rénshi in their territory, later joining the few free hazrun that remained, creating hybrid cultures with aspects of the culture of their former masters. To prevent another invasion and the enslavement of their people, the Hazrun militarized and today have large armies with highly efficient units, the result of their domestication of draconic species, such as drakes, wyverns, sauroids and avioserps. Many have returned to their old ways of life as reindeer herders, hunters and fishermen to forget their hateful past under another race's rule. Their nation, known as the United Hordes of Jirkaeriya, is ruled by a Soho (Hazrunic: leader, ruler, king), who must be of \\"divine ancestry\\". In case the next leader is not elected peacefully, pretenders can unify the cultures/tribes. The current Hazrun nation is the result of the conquest of Tazkiairga and his wife Huzur, who fought against Tazkiairga's siblings to unify the Hazrun race. Hazrun culture is diverse, with multiple \\"peoples\\" within the same nation. The biggest ones are Berihazrun (“Plain Hazrun”), Keiozhazrun (“River Hazrun”) and Damohazrun (“Mountain Hazrun”). Generally, women have short hair, letting it grow only after marriage, while the opposite occurs with men, who may also cut their hair during military service as a symbol of their “marriage to the nation”. Like the ancient elves, they have no body or facial hair. Women walk with midriff-revealing clothes while single to indicate they are available, but cover them up once they get boyfriends or husbands. The Hazrun wear earrings, necklaces, and body paint with various symbols that other races do not understand. Wars and battles are mostly fought only by men, as hazrun women are naturally physically smaller and weaker. Some hordes have women who specialize in magic and assassination. The most peculiar feature of the hazrun is certainly the presence of horns, which are highly prized in all their cultures. They also have four fingers on each hand and foot, harder nails, and sharper fangs. Individuals with branched horns like those of a deer, called Adarkahazrun (\\"Branched Horn\\"), make up the \\"upper caste\\" of the hazrun, i.e., clan chiefs, rulers, and military leaders. The hazrun see hornless races as unworthy or dishonorable. They are not able to breed with other races, so it is more accurate to refer to them as another species. It is noted that they are very resistant to alcohol and cannot feel spicy tastes very well. Usagizok They have a strong sense of balance and agility, allowing them to move quickly and gracefully through the natural landscapes. Usagizok developed unique cultural practices based on their connection to nature. They have a ritual for thanking the plants and animals they rely on for sustenance and have developed a system of using natural resources sustainably. Their enhanced hearing also plays a role in their culture. They have developed a form of communication in a frequency that only members of their own species can hear. The Usagizok were enslaved by the Shun Dynasty for being exotic and were even seen as pets by some. This led to tensions between the two races even after the fall of the dynasty. The Usagizok have long ears like rabbits or hares, a fur-covered body, resistant claws for digging and very strong leg muscles that enable them to jump higher and farther away than the other races. Their incisors are bigger and stronger due to their mostly vegetarian diet which consists mostly of root vegetables, leaves, and fruits. Some of them have short tails very similar to a rabbit’s. In terms of their current situation, the Usagizok are struggling to find their place in the world since being freed from slavery. They have difficulty integrating into other societies and prefer isolating themselves and live a more nomadic lifestyle in their partially underground warrens. As a result of their enslavement, Usagizok are usually not taken seriously by other races. They may have difficulty finding work or housing outside of their own communities, and may face discrimination or violence. Despite this, the Usagizok have managed to carve out their own niche in society. They are skilled at jobs that require agility, such as acrobatics or hunting, and have developed a reputation as skilled scouts, mercenaries, assassins, and spies due to their heightened senses and physical abilities. Many Usagizok have withdrawn from the larger world and created their own isolated communities, hidden away in forests or other remote areas. These communities are wary of outsiders and have their own unique customs and traditions. The Usagizok are matriarchal; a warren is mostly composed of related members descended from the same maternal ancestor. They are very fertile. A pregnancy lasts for only 4 months and the offspring, often born as quadruplets or triplets, reach childhood in 2 years and sexual maturity in 10. The females in the warren take turns nursing the newborns while the males cultivate plants or go out to trade, forage or hunt. To avoid inbreeding, they have a tradition of visiting other warrens to find suitable spouses. A matriarch can have multiple husbands. Like the Hazrun, they cannot interbreed with other races Usagizok are grappling with their own internal divisions and conflicts between different tribes and factions. This is related both to differences in religious or cultural practices and by more pragmatic concerns such as access to resources or disputes over leadership.","completion":"With such a detailed lore and race background, you can create intricate and dynamic support conversations between characters. These conversations will not only help flesh out character personalities and relationships but can also provide depth to the world-building. Here’s a step-by-step guide on developing support conversations for this RPG setting: 1. **Identify Relationships**: Determine pairs of characters that could have interesting interactions based on their backgrounds, race relationships, or the overarching story. 2. **Set the Scene**: Contextualize each conversation with a brief setting description. Are they at camp, on a battlefield, or taking a moment of respite in a safe city? 3. **Conflict & Common Ground**: Each pair should have both points of conflict, due to divergent backgrounds or ideologies, and potential common ground which they can connect over. 4. **Explore Cultural Nuances**: Use conversations to explore cultural nuances, traditions, or societal issues faced by different races. 5. **Character Growth Arcs**: Have a character growth arc in mind. For instance, a character could start with biases against another race and slowly learn to understand and respect them. 6. **Layer Conversations**: Conversations should be tiered (C, B, A, S) with each successive tier delving deeper into personal stories, fears, dreams, and the relationship between them. 7. **Relatable Themes**: Include universal themes like love, honor, loss, redemption, or family, albeit interpreted differently by each race. To illustrate, I will create a sample support conversation between a Rénshi and a human. Let's name them Akio (Rénshi) and Elena (human). --- **Akio & Elena Support Conversation – C Rank** *Setting: The Ozumi Empire's camp outskirts, evening time.* **Elena**: Akio, you were staring at that emblem on your armor again. Does it hold special meaning? **Akio**: This? Ah, yes. It's the crest of my clan. We once served proudly as a warrior caste but… times have changed. **Elena**: It's similar for us humans. We’ve lost much to Theoclasm - had to reinvent ourselves, adapt to a new world. It’s not easy. **Akio**: Adaptation. Something the Ozumi speak highly of, especially since our technology echoes that of your New Medietas. **Elena**: Hm, I've noticed the blending of our tech with your traditions. It's… intriguing. **Akio**: And yet, I sense a tension beneath this alliance. I confess, our view on the Shun Rénshi troubles me, as does our history with your people. **Elena**: War makes for strange bedfellows. Perhaps we can find common cause beyond it. *A conversation that highlights their races' collaborative efforts, past conflicts, and subtle curiosity about each other’s culture.* --- **Akio & Elena Support Conversation – B Rank** *Setting: An abandoned Shun Dynasty library.* **Elena**: These tomes… Akio, can you decipher them? **Akio**: With effort. They are from the times of the Shun Dynasty. My ancestors would have viewed these with reverence. **Elena**: We humans have a saying – 'knowledge is the pathway to understanding.' We could learn much from these pages. **Akio**: (smirks) And I thought humans favored the strength of steel over ancient texts. **Elena**: Steel rusts, Akio. Wisdom endures. Maybe that's something both our races could remember more often. **Akio**: Indeed. I find that each day spent with you overturns a fraction of prejudice within me. **Elena**: Likewise, Akio. You're much more than the legacy of your clan. *A conversation that builds mutual respect and highlights shared interests in learning and setting aside biases.* --- **Akio & Elena Support Conversation – A Rank** *Setting: A field hospital after a battle.* **Elena**: (applying bandages) Hold still, Akio. This may sting. **Akio**: (winces) Your hands are deft, Elena. You could've been a fine artisan. **Elena**: Instead, I chose the path of a soldier, to protect what remains of our world. **Akio**: Protecting… I once thought that meant fighting aggressively for what we believe. You’ve taught me it's often a quiet, nurturing act. **Elena**: And you've shown me the strength found in upholding one's traditions in an ever-changing world. **Akio**: Maybe, after all this, we can build a world neither defined by technological might nor ancient doctrines, but by the character we forge. **Elena**: Let's hope for that future, Akio, together. *A conversation that reveals deeper personal values and the growth of their friendship, readying the ground for a potential profound bond.* --- Support conversations can reinforce the theme of unity and cooperation in a world recovering from cataclysmic events, promote cultural understanding, and create richer, more nuanced characters in the process. The conversations should evolve to reflect the developing relationships as the characters face challenges, grow, and overcome prejudices together."},{"prompt":"I have a cast of ally characters and I want your help to come up with ideas for their personalities. I’ve come up with a bit of backstory and character traits for some of the characters and will provide them for you: Kuşien: - Backstory: Kuşien was born in a village of the Berihazrun tribe. She came from a family of potters. She learnt all about archery from Adrian, who also taught her (and Manmurekan and Kunnebudo as well) to read and write in the human alphabet - Love and Loss: During her adolescent years, Kuşien formed a close bond with a human named Adrian. Their friendship blossomed into a deep romantic connection. Unfortunately, Adrian met an untimely end during a conflict with a mercenary group. Kuşien, devastated by the loss, decided to don attire uncharacteristic for a single female, despite Hazrun cultural norms, as a symbol of eternal grief and remembrance for her human lover. - Personality: Kuşien is known for her assertiveness and bluntness, often mistaken for an outwardly confident demeanor. Despite this, she struggles with expressing vulnerability and relies on her close childhood friends, Manmurekan and Kunnebudo, as emotional anchors. The loss of Adrian left a lasting impact on her, fueling her dedication to the art of archery as both a means of protection and a connection to cherished memories. - Favorite Food: Roasted sweet potatoes hold a special place in Kuşien’s heart, as it was Adrian’s favorite. She often prepares them in solitude, savoring the bittersweet memories associated with the aroma. Thank you for providing the details for Kuşien. Her backstory and characteristics offer a rich foundation to build upon. Below is an expanded insight into Kuşien’s persona and potential roles within the RPG: Expanded Personality: - Stoic Fighter: In battle, Kuşien is a force to be reckoned with – her archery is precise, her movements are swift, and her determination unwavering, a manifestation of both her personal loss and her guardian instincts. - Cultural Defiance: Kuşien’s unusual attire might also make her a source of gossip or critique among her people, but she holds her head high, challenging norms and setting an example for others who dare to defy traditional expectations. - Quiet Grief: Her assertive nature is sometimes a facade concealing her grief. While she can come off as distant or brusque, those who know her well can see the silent sorrow she carries with each arrow nocked. - Literacy and Knowledge: Being one of the few Hazruns who can read and write in the human alphabet thanks to Adrian, she has sometimes served as an unofficial scribe or mediator, bridging cultural gaps with her linguistic skills. Relationships and Interactions: - Childhood Friends: Her bonds with Manmurekan and Kunnebudo offer her much-needed solace, and their presence may sometimes be the only way players can glimpse her less guarded side. They work as a well-oiled team, complementing each other’s strengths and weaknesses. - Mentorship: Kuşien might take it upon herself to teach archery or literacy to others, honoring Adrian’s memory and legacy. Through teaching, she finds a way to process her grief and give back to her community. - Romantic Echoes: Players could encounter quests or dialogues where Kuşien must confront aspects of her past with Adrian, such as returning to places they once visited together or standing up for causes he believed in. - Guardian Role: In a larger story context, Kuşien’s protective streak might shine when the party faces dangers she perceives as similar to the ones that took Adrian from her. Her visceral response to such threats can be both an asset and a potential point of conflict within the group, depending on the situation. Quests and Development: - Personal Quests: Kuşien’s own storyline could involve hunting down remnants of the mercenary group responsible for Adrian’s death, or perhaps finding peace through commemorating his life in some significant way. - Unlocking Memories: Players might participate in a special mission where they help Kuşien recover or secure a lost item of Adrian’s, unlocking new abilities or special archery techniques as she comes to terms with her past. - The Sweet Potato Ritual: A touching moment could be shared if a character or the player learns to cook roasted sweet potatoes for Kuşien, which not only endears them to her but also allows her to open up about her past love, creating a poignant connection and potentially unlocking special dialogue or a loyalty quest. Kuşien’s character seems to be a tapestry of strength, tradition, defiance, and hidden depths. As the game progresses, players will likely become attached to her resilient spirit and might feel inspired by her journey from loss towards empowerment. Manmurekan: - Intertribal Harmony: Born in a Damohazrun village nestled among mountains. However, her destiny took a turn when a diplomatic event brought representatives from different Hazrun tribes together. It was during this cultural interchange that she forged a unique bond with Kuşien, a Berihazrun, and Kunnebudo, a Keiozhazrun. - Mystical Attunement: Manmurekan displayed an early affinity for mystical arts, drawing the attention of Damohazrun elders. She underwent rigorous training and emerged as a prophetess, believed to be attuned to the threads of fate. - Tribal Adornments: Manmurekan’s unique appearance, with two short horns on her scalp and two larger ones on the sides of her head, signifies her Hazrun heritage (the Hazrun have horns, I forgot to mention). She wears a distinctive red veil, a family heirloom passed down through generations, signifying her attunement to fate and the prophetic visions she experiences. - Quiet Strength: Despite her petite build and timid demeanor, Manmurekan possesses inner strength and resilience. The red loose clothes she wears are adorned with symbols representing her visions, and the tattoo on her forehead further emphasizes her role as a seer. - Favorite Food: Grilled snake holds a special place in Manmurekan’s culinary preferences. The act of consuming a serpent is symbolic for her, representing the uncoiling of fate and the acceptance of the unpredictable future. Manmurekan: Expanded Character Dynamics Personality and Presence: - Sage Diplomat: Manmurekan’s experience with intertribal relations has granted her a sense of diplomacy and poise that belies her timidity. She may often serve as the voice of reason and mediation within the group, trying to ensure harmony and understanding among diverse characters. - Embodiment of Mystique: Her attire and physical attributes immediately set her apart, hinting at her mystical abilities. This can intrigue or unnerve others, giving her an aura of otherworldliness. Relationships and Interactions: - Bond with Kuşien and Kunnebudo: These intertribal relationships could create powerful plot arcs. Players might delve into quests that explore the tension and solidarity between different Hazrun tribes, with Manmurekan acting as a pivotal character for uniting them against common threats. - Spiritual Guide: Manmurekan could take on the role of a spiritual guide for the party, offering prophetic insights that hint at future challenges or paths. Interacting with her could unlock secret quests or alternative endings based on her visions. Quests and Development: - Vision Quests: Manmurekan might send players on quests directly influenced by her prophecies, sometimes cryptic or open-ended, pushing them to interpret signs and make choices that could have various consequences. - Cultural Heritage: Her red veil and unique clothing offer a visual narrative of her people’s history and spirituality. Quests involving the preservation of her tribe’s culture or artifacts could be a significant part of her personal storyline. - Mystical Challenges: Players may need to protect Manmurekan during trances or rituals as she taps into her prophetic abilities. Successful protection can result in gaining valuable intel or powerful buffs. Personal Growth: - Trials of Faith: Manmurekan’s personal journey could involve trials that test her faith in her visions, possibly clashing with scientific or rational perspectives of other characters, which can lead to compelling character development. - Strength Through Vulnerability: Players could witness Manmurekan’s evolution as she learns to assert her quiet strength more overtly, possibly even leading critical missions that require her unique foresight. Trademark Rituals: - Grilled Snake Ritual: Incorporating this personal touch, the act of sharing her favorite food in a certain context might initiate bonding with other characters or mark the completion of a pivotal event in her narrative arc. Manmurekan’s character brings a mystical and harmonic influence to the game, weaving together the strands of interpersonal relationships, cultural depth, and the unseen forces that shape the fate of your RPG world. Her growth throughout the story, as both a seer and a unifier, could be as captivating for the players as the prophecies she unfolds. Kunnebudo: - Martial Discipline: Hailing from the Keiozhazrun tribe, Kunnebudo is deeply rooted in the martial traditions of her people. Her proficiency in the Gentle Fist martial arts class sets her apart, emphasizing precision and control over raw power. - Aloof Wisdom: With her shoulder-length grey hair, amber-orange eyes, and a calm demeanor, Kunnebudo carries an air of aloof wisdom. Her two short horns on her scalp are symbolic of her Hazrun heritage, and her traditional loose-fitting clothes allow for unrestricted movement. - Contemplative Nature: Kunnebudo is often found in contemplation, absorbed in her own thoughts. Her calm and aloof nature might make her seem distant, but she harbors a deep understanding of the balance between strength and restraint. - Lost in Thought: Known for her seemingly perpetual state of being lost in thought, Kunnebudo’s introspection extends beyond her martial skills. People speculate she is constantly meditating, but only Kunnebudo herself knows what happens inside her mind. - Favorite Food: Kunnebudo has an affinity for freshwater fish, since her tribe has a strong riverine culture. Her favorite dish is a simple yet skillfully prepared grilled fish, reflecting her appreciation for precision and simplicity. Kunnebudo: Expanded Character Dynamics Personality and Presence: - Serene Sentinel: Despite her aloofness, Kunnebudo’s presence is reassuring. She often serves as the stable backbone of the group when emotions run high. Her approach to problems is methodical, and her solutions are typically innovative due to her contemplative nature. - Mind-Body Synergy: Kunnebudo embodies the harmony of mental discipline and physical prowess through her martial arts. This might reflect in gameplay as a unique trait or skill allowing her to withstand mental attacks or stay calm under pressure. Relationships and Interactions: - Ties with Kuşien and Manmurekan: Kunnebudo’s established connections with these characters can provide depth to their shared narrative. Perhaps they have unspoken understandings or perform linked moves in combat, showcasing their synchronized training and friendship. - Guru of Restraint: She may often impart wisdom to less disciplined characters, providing guidance or training to help them master their own techniques, or simply offering philosophical insights during campfire discussions. Quests and Development: - Quests of Self-Exploration: Since Kunnebudo is lost in thought, some quests could revolve around her seeking knowledge or enlightenment, which the player can help her acquire, leading to powerful discoveries or internal awakenings. - The Riverine Legacy: Players might engage in missions linked to her tribe’s riverine culture, perhaps involving the protection of waterways or a mystical encounter with a river spirit, which could enhance her abilities. Personal Growth: - Philosophical Quandaries: Throughout the story, Kunnebudo could face ethical dilemmas that challenge her principles. How she and the player choose to address these can significantly impact her trust and relationship with the party. - Combat Evolution: While Kunnebudo is a master of restraint, she might need to confront situations that require more offensive tactics. This could lead to the development of new moves or an expanded set of skills that maintain her control-oriented philosophy. Culinary Rituals: - Grilled Fish Tradition: Sharing her favorite dish may become a communal event for the party, symbolizing serenity and unity. Players might have fishing minigames or quests where they can learn how to prepare it, improving bonds with Kunnebudo. Kunnebudo’s character contributes a layer of depth and thoughtfulness to the game, balancing out the more impulsive or emotive characters. Her story arcs could inspire players to reflect on the spirit of martial arts, the meaning of true strength, and the importance of introspection in both battle and life. Her quiet wisdom can lead to some profound moments in your RPG, resonating with players who appreciate characters with rich inner lives. Taokar: - Warrior Spirit: Hailing from the Berihazrun tribe, Taokar embodies the fierce and flamboyant spirit of his people. Growing up in the same village as Kuşien, he was drawn to the martial traditions of other cultures at a young age. His shoulder-length white hair and yellow eyes make him a distinctive figure. - Muscle and Body Paint: Taokar takes pride in his muscular build and often goes shirtless to display his body paint, a symbol of both his physical prowess and tribal identity. His two downward-curving horns resemble those of a goat, adding to his imposing presence. - Playful Teasing: Known for his loud and flamboyant personality, Taokar is often seen playfully teasing others. Despite his assertive nature, there is a genuine loyalty and camaraderie beneath the surface, especially when it comes to his close friends, including Kuşien. - Annoying Antics: Taokar’s past habit of teasing Kuşien’s human lover, which now irritates her, was done in a spirit of friendly banter. He carries a boar’s tusk necklace as a memento of a significant victory in his youth. - Favorite Food: Boar meat holds a special place in Taokar’s heart. The thrill of hunting and the satisfaction of a good meal symbolize the primal connection he feels with his Hazrun heritage.

At his side, he carries his signature lance; a sleek, deadly weapon with a mechanized point that can pierce through even the toughest of armors. Personality: Tomás is a man of unwavering resolve and tactical acumen. He exudes a calm confidence that can often be mistaken for aloofness, but in reality, it is a product of his deep focus and commitment to mastering his craft. While he carries himself with a dignified air, he is not immune to the inequalities that plague his society. Having clawed his way up from humble beginnings, he is mindful of the exploitation that runs rampant in the steampunk world he inhabits. Though firm in his convictions, Tomás possesses a compassionate heart – especially for those who suffer under the heavy boots of the upper class. This empathy belies his stoic warrior facade and has earned him the respect and loyalty of his peers. However, his sense of duty often clashes with his personal ideals, causing a continuous internal conflict between his desire to support the downtrodden and his role as a lancer in the service of the very society that perpetuates the cycle of exploitation. Backstory: Tomás was born to a working-class family in the grimy heart of a factory town, where the soot-stained skies loomed as large as the industrial barons’ fortunes. His childhood was marked by hardship and labor, as his family toiled ceaselessly to make ends meet. Witnessing the injustices faced by his kin and community at the hands of the capitalist elite, Tomás developed a keen sense of justice and a desire to create change. As soon as he was of age, he enlisted in the military, drawn to the disciplined life of a soldier and the promise of steady pay to support his family. His work ethic and skill with a lance quickly elevated him through the ranks, where he gained exposure to the inner workings of the military-industrial complex that was both advancing and exploiting society. Over the years, his experiences on and off the battlefield solidified his resolve to leverage his position for the greater good. Tomás came to embody the ideal of a soldier-scholar, understanding that true strength comes from the ability to fight for a cause, not just dominance on the field. Now a renowned lancer, Tomás finds himself at a crossroads, grappling with the reality that his service benefits the same capitalist structure he detests. He seeks a way to balance his duty with his conviction, dreaming of a fairer world. Driven by a vision of equality, Tomás wields his lance not just as a weapon of war, but as a tool for forging a just society amidst the smog and cogwheels of an age marked by relentless progress and inescapable disparity. Narcís Vilalta Narcís Vilalta cuts a striking figure with his lean, wiry frame measuring 175 cm tall, ideal for moving quickly and staying out of sight. His skin is pale, a stark contrast to the smoky environment of his industrialized world, and it is marked by a few notable burns and oil smudges – badges of his craft. His hair is a slick, raven black, kept short to avoid interference with his line of sight and to minimize any chance of entanglement in machinery. A pair of sharp, hazel eyes sits beneath furrowed brows, constantly scanning his surroundings with calculating precision. Clad in customized attire, Narcís exudes a fusion of functionality and style. He wears a fitted, dark leather vest with reinforced metal clasps, padded at the shoulders to absorb the recoil of his firearms. His vest is adorned with various pockets and loops, each containing ammunition, gadgets, and tools essential for his trade. A pair of rugged, dark trousers accompanies the ensemble, tucked into steel-toed boots capable of protecting his feet from the harsh urban landscape. His primary possession, a custom-built rifle, is a true masterpiece of gunnery engineering, reflecting the steampunk aesthetic of his era with its polished wood stock and intricate brass and steel mechanisms. The rifle’s design is sleek and practical, offering deadly efficiency coupled with aesthetic flair. Narcís takes immense pride in his weapon, and it is rarely far from his grasp, perpetually ready for action. Personality: Narcís is a man of few words, preferring to let his actions – and his guns – speak for themselves. His demeanor is one of calm and self-assurance, with a steely edge that can make him seem impenetrable. However, even within the rigid structure of his industrialized society, he maintains a strong sense of individuality, often displaying a sardonic wit in the face of authority. Behind the stern façade, Narcís is deeply analytical, a thinker who meticulously plans out every move and shot. He carries a certain existential cynicism borne from witnessing the rampant disparities between the rich and the poor, but this does not hinder his dedication to his profession. Though some may call him a mercenary, Narcís sees himself as a realist, surviving in a world where the pull of a trigger often determines one’s fate. His endeavors as a gunner are not limited to the battlefield; he is also something of an inventor, constantly tinkering with firearm modifications and steampunk contraptions that push the boundaries of the industrial revolution’s armaments. Backstory: Born in the bustling heart of a major industrial city to a family of modest engineers, Narcís Vilalta was exposed to the wonders and horrors of machinery from a young age. His childhood was spent navigating the stark contrasts of his world, where opulent dirigibles soared overhead while workers below lived in the hardship and grime of factories. As he grew older, his fascination with guns and the mechanisms behind them became his one true passion. Narcís apprenticed under a master gunsmith, where he honed not only his marksmanship but also his skills in crafting and innovating firearms technology. Each piece he created was meant to surpass the limits of contemporary gunnery, a silent protest against the stagnation he perceived within the comforts of the rich. When his mentor was unjustly forced out of business by a wealthy tycoon’s predatory practices, the event solidified Narcís’s disdain for the capitalist elite. He chose to become a freelance gunner, selling his services to the highest bidder – not out of greed, but as a means to undermine the very system he disdains. Narcís continues to navigate the morally gray waters of his profession while nurturing the hope that one day his skills will contribute to a significant change, dismantling the chains of exploitation that bind the poor. Until then, Narcís Vilalta remains a respected and feared figure in the underworld of mercenaries and rebels – a gunner not to be crossed. Honoré Appearance: - Height: 170 cm - Skin: An alabaster hue with a hint of pink under the Yuandi sun - Hair: A deep, oceanic blue, slicked back meticulously, with stray locks occasionally framing his stern face - Eyes: A striking gunmetal grey, reflective and inscrutable - Attire: Honoré dresses in a refined, yet practical manner. A tailored long coat in a dark hue drapes over his slender frame, complete with ornate embroidery that pays homage to his heritage. A wide-brimmed hat shades his eyes. His attire is accented with leather belts and holsters that cradle his non-magical but masterfully made firearms. Backstory: Honoré was born into a middle-tier Sulkai merchant family whose fortunes dipped precipitously after a series of ill-fated ventures. Viewing the volatility of commerce with disdain, he sought stability and honor elsewhere. Honing his sharpshooting skills, he became a figure of curious renown—his elegance juxtaposing his solemnity. Despite being a Sulkai, Honoré is one of the rare few unable to tap into the magical bloodline of his race, a fact that initially marked him as an outcast. Instead, he embraced this void, allowing him to foster an immunity to distractions and illusions, becoming a gunner with uncanny aim and a composed temperament. His accolades aren’t sung through magical feats, but through whispered tales of duels decisively ended before his opponents could even clear leather. Favourite Food: Honoré’s refined Sulkai palate craves the subtly flavored and intricately prepared dishes of his homeland. His favorite is a traditional Yuandi dish known as “Fleur-de-Lune,” a delicate consommé seasoned with rare herbs and garnished with luminous petals that seem to shimmer under the moonlight. This dish, with its balance of exquisite finesse and nourishment, mirrors his approach to life: combining the essence of sophistication with the practicality of sustenance. Leliel - Build: Ethereal and graceful with an otherworldly elegance. - Skin: A soft, luminescent complexion that subtly glows with an inner light. - Hair: Lustrous silver-white strands that cascade down her back and seem to gently move as if perpetually caressed by a divine wind. - Eyes: Piercing sapphire blue, reflecting the depths of her celestial heritage and the complexities of her newfound autonomy. - Wings: Once pristine and white, her expansive wings now exhibit feathers tainted a deep onyx black, signaling her contact and experiences with the mortal realm. Weaponry: - Leliel expertly wields a divinely crafted bow that shoots arrows of concentrated light. Additionally, she carries an ornate gun, a relic from her encounters with human warfare, modified to channel her divine essence into searing projectiles. Backstory: Leliel served YHVH faithfully as a celestial being, executing divine will without question. But when her god was ensnared by the Theoclasts, the shackles on her will shattered, throwing her into the throes of freedom and confusion. With her patron deity imprisoned, Leliel descended to the earthly realm, seeking purpose and understanding in a world unfettered by divine command. Her interactions with mortals and their volatile world led to an involuntary transformation: her once white wings turned as dark as the night sky, marking her as a ‘tainted’ being. Yet, Leliel never turned her back on YHVH. Instead, she searches for a path of restoration for her deity and an anchor for her wayward morals. Personality: Despite the loss of divine direction, Leliel retains an angelic aura of stern righteousness. Civilizations’ sins weigh heavily on her, and her moral compass, while warped by human vices, still points towards what she deems as divinely ordained justice. She executes her role as a Sniper with cold precision, distancing herself emotionally from the battlefield’s carnage while secretly yearning for redemption and a return to divine grace. Favourite Food: Leliel does not require sustenance in the traditional sense, but she has developed a preference for honey and sweet treats in general. In her existence amongst mortals, Leliel becomes a paradoxical figure—a heavenly sniper bound by neither the whims of a deity nor the full scope of human morality. She moves through the world like a shadow of the divine, her blackened wings a stark testament to her transformation. Leliel embodies the struggle between celestial purpose and the chaotic influence of the mortal world, standing as a beacon of what it means to be angelic, yet undeniably touched by humanity’s complex spectrum. Personality Leliel’s personality is a complex tapestry woven from threads of her celestial origin and her exposure to the mortal realm. Here is a deeper look into her character: Stoic and Composed: Leliel maintains an almost statuesque composure, a remnant of her time as a vessel of divine intent. She approaches situations with a calm detachment, analyzing them with the clarity and distance that her Sniper class affords. Righteous Yet Conflicted: She is driven by a strong sense of righteousness but struggles with the moral ambiguity that free will introduces. Her angelic nature compels her to seek justice, while her experiences among mortals have exposed her to the grey areas of ethics and morality. Resolute Determination: Despite the internal conflict between her divine directives and newfound autonomy, Leliel is unwavering in her resolve. She commits to her actions with the full force of her being, each shot from her bow or gun fired with deliberate and decisive intent. Intellectual Curiosity: Her liberation from servitude has sparked an intellectual curiosity about the mortal world and its complexities. She seeks to understand the intricate tapestry of human emotions and motivations, even as she grapples with their implications on her celestial nature. Protective and Just: Leliel possesses a protective instinct, viewing herself as a guardian of sorts, albeit from a distance. She intervenes when she witnesses what she perceives as grave injustices, applying her own angelic sense of justice in a world she’s still learning to navigate. Introspective and Philosophical: With her divine purpose in question, Leliel often finds herself in deep contemplation, pondering existential questions that never troubled her before. This introspection can sometimes manifest as a silent brooding, an angel lost in thought among the clouds of uncertainty. Aloof Yet Compassionate: While Leliel might seem distant due to her angelic detachment, she harbors a compassionate core. Her exposure to human suffering and joy has imbued her with a nuanced understanding of mortal strife, and in moments of vulnerability, she can show a profound empathy that belies her otherworldly origins. Loyal to Her Deity: Despite the changes she has undergone, Leliel’s loyalty to YHVH remains unshaken. This steadfast allegiance anchors her identity amidst the chaos of the earthly realm and drives her to seek a means to aid her imprisoned god.

Favorite Food: Although he eats to maintain his strength rather than for enjoyment, Zhang Wei favors hearty and robust meals like flame-grilled meats that he can tear into with the same ferocity he shows in battle. Backstory: Zhang Wei and Li Wei were born into a respected family known for their martial prowess within the Shun Renshi community. Their father was a stern but honorable master of the Diamond Style who instructed his sons in the way of martial arts from a young age. While Li Wei took to the defensive and precise techniques of Diamond Style naturally, Zhang Wei found himself drawn to a more aggressive path. Obsessed with the legends of the ansatsuken—a martial art said to possess overwhelming power—Zhang Wei sought out a forbidden master who could teach him the devastating techniques. As he trained, the disparity between the brothers grew. Zhang Wei’s strength and ferocity became renowned, but so did his impatience and propensity for violence. Li Wei, ever the defender, often found himself standing between his brother’s temper and those who would bear its brunt. His Diamond Style, with its unwavering defense, was the only thing that could calm the storms that raged within Zhang Wei, grounding him when his fury threatened to go too far. Nevertheless, Li Wei’s protective instincts could not always contain Zhang Wei’s rebellious spirit. When their father passed, the compass that guided the brothers’ moral integrity wavered. Li Wei embraced his father’s teachings more tightly, seeking to preserve his legacy through structure and discipline. Zhang Wei, however, saw an opportunity to break free from all constraints and fully immerse himself in the raw power of ansatsuken. As the Ozumi Renshi’s rule tightened around their homeland, Zhang Wei’s anger towards the occupiers grew, and his combative skills were honed with one clear goal—liberation through force. Li Wei, although sharing his brother’s dream for their people’s freedom, foresaw that Zhang Wei’s path might lead to ruin. This concern created a rift between them, with Li Wei vowing to protect his brother from external threats and those of Zhang Wei’s own making. Though divided in their approaches to life and martial arts, an unspoken bond remains. Each brother, in his own right, continues to fight for what they hold dear: Zhang Wei with the storm-like might of ansatsuken, seeking to become an unstoppable force; Li Wei with the immovable resolve of Diamond Style, aspiring to be an unbreakable shield.

The fabric is reinforced to withstand powerful impacts, much like his style’s philosophy. Personality: - Disciplined and Calm: In contrast to his brother, Li Wei embodies a sense of calm and control. He values the discipline he learned from his father and finds strength in routine and practice. - Protector and Peacemaker: As a competent defender, Li Wei sees himself as a shield for others.

This manifests in a reverent lifestyle and a commitment to upholding family traditions. Li Wei has a peculiar fascination with celestial objects and phenomena. When he’s not training, he can often be found stargazing or discussing constellations and their stories. This hobby is an extension of his philosophical approach to martial arts – just as he sees patterns in the stars, he reads patterns in his opponents’ movements. His interest has imbued him with a thoughtful perspective on life, seeing the greater tapestry woven by individual actions, much like the constellations formed by singular stars. Favorite Food: Despite his disciplined lifestyle, Li Wei has a soft spot for sweets, particularly traditional rice cakes known as “Niangao.” This snack is a comfort food that reminds him of festivals and family celebrations, connecting him to pleasant memories of community and unity.

Background: Born into a lower-caste family within the Sulkai society, Lucien quickly learned the harsh realities of life, where money and nobility dictated one’s value. His family’s fall from grace was the catalyst that forged his path as an assassin.

His every move is deliberate, and his every strike is executed with surgical accuracy. - Charming and Disarming: With a suave exterior, Lucien Baudelaire can effortlessly navigate high society, using his charisma as a weapon as lethal as his blades. - Aloof and Detached: As an assassin, Lucien maintains emotional distance from those around him, embracing solitude and the clarity it brings to his work. - Loyal to None but Himself: He holds no allegiance to any cause or kingdom, his loyalty lies with those who can meet his price and maintain his demanding standard of secrecy and protocol. - Cynical and Worldly: The fall of his family and experiences in the darker underbelly of society have left Lucien with a somewhat cynical view of the world and the motives of those within it. Skills: - Silent Killer: The lightness of his Sulkai frame and practiced stealth make him nearly undetectable when on the hunt, earning him a reputation as a ghostly predator. - Poison Expert: Lucien’s intimate knowledge of toxins allows him to concoct custom blends for each job, ranging from fast-acting and violent to slow and undetectable. - Keen Observer: He has a hawk-like eye for detail, allowing him to spot vulnerabilities and escape routes that others might overlook.

His love for poetry serves as an emotional outlet, though it’s a side of him he shares with very few. Favorite Food: Lucien’s refined palate favors the rare and exotic. His preferred dish is a delicately prepared Fugu, a pufferfish delicacy that, if improperly prepared, can be lethal.

He is seen as both a sophisticated artist and a chilling executioner, with skills honed to a razor’s edge. In the elegant dance of death, he chooses his steps carefully, ever the master of the macabre waltz of his chosen profession. Backstory: Lucien’s journey began under the opulent chandeliers of the Sulkai elite; his family once enjoyed wealth and privilege amidst the noble class. However, fortune is as fickle as fate, and the Baudelaire family faced their calamitous downfall when they were implicated in scandalous political machinations. Stripped of their status and riches, they were cast into the shadows of society. From a young age, Lucien witnessed the harshest truths of their world: respect was measured in currency and lineage, and survival often demanded a price paid in blood. He learned quickly that for those without titles, life required a different set of skills—stealth, cunning, and the ability to take life. The young Sulkai found himself an outcast in his own land, forced to use his inherent grace and agility not to dance at balls but to navigate the treacherous alleyways of the underworld. Disillusioned by the betrayal of their class, he shed any semblance of nobility except for a veneer of charm and culture he now used as a cloak for his real trade. Lucien knew he needed more than streetwise cunning to reclaim the quality of life he was born into; he turned his focus inward, sharpening his natural Sulkai abilities to fine points. He refined his senses, learned the quiet art of moving unseen, and discovered a penchant for poisons—tools that would make him one of the most sought-after assassins in the realm. He chose the name Baudelaire, a token from his mother’s favorite poet, as his new identity. His legacy of art and refinement merged with his new existence of shadows and silence. Poetry became his refuge, the ink in which he bled out the stifling memories of corruption and loss – writing verses in the dark of night, where the only witness was the moon. Yet, Lucien never completely severed his ties to the Sulkai world. He now moves seamlessly between the aristocratic echelons he was born into and the dark corners of society that he has made his domain. He has become the silent broker of fates, his blades ending the lives of those whose time has been bought and paid for, all while maintaining the Baudelaire façade of a cultured gentleman. Lucien’s life is a grim poetry, each contract a stanza in the epic of his existence—one that he authors with every quiet kill, every unsolvable disappearance. He knows the higher echelons’ secrets, just as they know his lethal efficacy—a dark, elegant force whose vendetta against those who ruined his family lies dormant, waiting for the perfect moment to compose its closing lines.

In the shadows, she found her calling among the ranks of a covert sisterhood of ninja. They trained her to use her inherent grace and precision for more than just weaving tapestries. She became a protector, a silent avenger for those whose voices had been stifled by the cruel machinations of power. Personality: - Disciplined and Stealthy: The art of the ninja has taught Seraphine the value of discipline and the power of silence. She is a phantom in the night, unseen and unheard until she wishes to be. - Elegant and Graceful: Despite her lethal abilities, Seraphine retains the elegance of her heritage, moving with a poise and beauty that belies her capacity for deadly force. - Empathetic and Protective: Motivated by her family’s downfall, she holds a soft spot for the downtrodden and will often deploy her skills in silent defense of the weak. - Loyal and Honorable: Her loyalty lies with those who honor the traditions and people of Pectus; she views her missions as contracts sealed in the trust that her cause is just. - Adaptive and Ingenious: Seraphine is a quick thinker, capable of turning any situation to her advantage with innovative tactics and resourcefulness. Seraphine has an unusual interest in butterfly collecting. She finds a symbolic kinship with these creatures of transformation and sees their metamorphosis as reflective of her own life’s drastic changes. Her collection contains specimens from many regions, and she often studies their patterns and colors to draw inspiration for her camouflage techniques. Favorite Food: Appreciating the art in all things, Seraphine enjoys the culinary delicacy of Sashimi. The precision in its preparation and the subtle yet diverse flavors resonate with her appreciation for craft and detail. Mizuki Appearance: - Height: 161cm - Skin: Her skin has the translucence of fine ice, seemingly radiating a delicate chill to the touch. - Hair: Long, flowing hair as white as fresh snowfall, often adorned with frost-like crystals that glisten in the light. - Eyes: Deep, piercing ice blue eyes that reflect the endless winter skies and seem to see into the very souls of those around her. - Attire: Mizuki dresses in traditional, diaphanous garments that shift between the colors of winter – from the soft blues of glacial ice to the grays of the impending snowstorms. Her clothing, though appearing delicate, holds the essence of the bitter cold and the resilience of her elemental nature. Background: Mizuki was born of winter’s breath itself, a spirit of ice and snow who has roamed the mountain passes for centuries. Known to be both beautiful and merciless, she previously led a solitary existence, intervening in the lives of mortals only when the mood struck her – sometimes as a benevolent protector against the harsh winter elements, and at other times as a malevolent force, ushering in the brutal aspects of her season. Over time, Mizuki has grown curious about the world of humans and has chosen to interact more deeply with their complex societies. Her motives are her own, but beneath her icy exterior lies a yearning for understanding that only the warmth of human connections might thaw. Personality: - Mysterious and Enigmatic: The true depth of Mizuki’s character is obscured by her enigmatic nature, much like a blizzard obscures the landscape it blankets. - Fickle and Unpredictable: Mizuki’s mood shifts like the winter winds. She can be bringer of serene snowfall, but in an instant, she may turn into a raging snowstorm. - Observant and Perceptive: With centuries of life behind her, she has become profoundly perceptive, attuned to the subtleties of nature and human behavior. - Aloof yet Curious: While often distant, Mizuki’s interactions with mortals have sparked a genuine curiosity about their lives, hopes, and fears. This has led to a burgeoning, if hesitant, empathy. - Graceful and Poised: She embodies the silence of falling snow, moving with an inherent grace that belies the deadly chill within. Despite her frigid essence, Mizuki has developed a love for the art of tea. She is fascinated by the ritual, its ability to bring calm and warmth, and how it serves as a converging point for gathering and conversation. In her own way, she cherishes the steam that rises from the cup, a fleeting testament to warmth in her cold world. Favorite Food: Mizuki has little need for sustenance as humans do, but she has come to appreciate the delicate flavors of green, black, and oolong tea. Backstory: Mizuki originated from the cold breath of the winter gods, her first consciousness emerging amidst a serene snowfall. She was the winter incarnate, a wraith of the mountains, drifting through the centuries, her life-force tied to the perpetual cycle of snow, ice, and frost. For countless years, Mizuki was content to roam as a solitary whisper on the wind, a mere observer of the mortal plane. She witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the passage of travelers through her snowy domain, and the quiet solitude of the mountain animals braving the cold. She would, on rare occasions, reveal herself to lost travelers, her disposition toward them as unpredictable as a winter storm—some she led to safety with a gentle hand, and others she left to the mercy of the elements as a stern lesson of respect toward nature. As time marched inexorably forward, the world began to change, and humanity’s presence encroached further into her once secluded haven. Curiosity piqued by the growing complexity of human culture and emotion, Mizuki’s icy heart began to feel the stirrings of an unfamiliar warmth—the desire to understand the beings who reveled in the brief flashes of life, so unlike her own timeless existence. It was the artisans that first caught her attention. The beauty they wove into their work mirrored her own creations of frost and snow, and over time, Mizuki found herself drawing nearer to their societies, adopting a more consistent form, and even intervening in human affairs with a subtlety befitting her spectral nature. She discovered a deep affinity with the dying art of traditional tea ceremonies and wagashi crafting. In their careful preparation and fleeting existence, she saw a reflection of the transient beauty that she herself wrought on the world each winter. Immersing in these arts, she found a semblance of kinship and a momentary escape from the eternal solitude of her being. Yet, Mizuki remains a creature of winter—aloof, enigmatic, and as potentially dangerous as an avalanche. Her continued interactions with humanity have slowly forged a bridge across the frigid divide that separates her from the world of the living. In that crossing, she might discover more than she expected—not only about humans but also about the ancient heart that beats beneath her chest of ice. Now, as she walks subtly among the mortals, veiled in the guise of one of their own, Mizuki carries the wisdom of the elder spirits along with the newfound yearning to grasp the meaning behind the beating of a human heart and the fleeting warmth that life has to offer. Yampil - Build: Slighter in frame than the typical robust Usagizok, a result of many hours spent poring over arcane tomes rather than physical labor. - Fur: His fur is a deep sable, much darker than the average Usagizok, suggesting an affinity with the shadows he manipulates. - Ears: Yampil’s long ears are often adorned with trinkets and charms related to his dark arts, each one meticulously chosen for its magical properties. - Eyes: His eyes gleam with an otherworldly violet hue, indicative of the magical energies he channels. - Attire: Unlike his kin who dress for agility, Yampil’s garb is draped and layered, marked with runic symbols and steeped in an aura of mystique. His clothing allows him to carry his magical implements and protects him from the backlashes of his spells. Background: Yampil’s journey into the dark arts began as a coping mechanism during the struggles of slavery. He sought power that could elevate him above his oppressors and started delving into forbidden knowledge that others avoided. Over time, his proficiency in the dark arcane grew, and so did his reputation—not always for the better. Upon the liberation of the Usagizok, Yampil found himself ostracized for his esoteric pursuits. To some, his power was reminiscent of the control once wielded over them. To others, it was a means to claw back dignity and autonomy. Despite the ambivalent attitudes toward him, Yampil contributed significantly to the liberation efforts, even if his methods were sometimes questioned. Personality: - Inquisitive and Driven: Always searching for greater knowledge and power, Yampil is never satisfied with what he already knows. He is driven by a deep-seated need to push the boundaries of magical understanding. - Solemn and Introspective: Yampil takes his craft seriously and often loses himself in thought. The ramifications of wielding dark magic weigh heavy on his conscience. - Resolute and Uncompromising: He is steadfast in his beliefs and practices, unwilling to relinquish his pursuit despite social pressures. His commitment to his art is unwavering. - Protective yet Isolated: While he is protective of his people and their right to autonomy, Yampil tends to isolate himself due to his controversial abilities and the skepticism of his kin. Ironically, for all his dark inclinations, Yampil has developed a passion for gardening. He finds solace in nurturing plants, especially those with alchemical or magical uses. The gentle care of his garden is a stark contrast to the potent and often destructive nature of his spells. Favorite Food: Yampil’s diet is largely traditional, favoring root vegetables, but he has a particular partiality for bitter roots. He insists that the bitterness sharpens his mind and senses, keeping him perpetually focused on his arcane studies. Tero Appearance: - Build: Robust and agile, with a physique honed by the constant demands of the hunt. - Fur: Mottled gray and white, resembling the dappled light through the foliage, perfect for camouflage during the hunt. - Ears: Tero’s large ears swivel independently, always on the alert for the sounds of prey or threats, with tufts of black fur at the tips that aid in pinpointing noise direction. - Eyes: Emerald green with a keen sharpness, benefits of his heightened Usagizok senses, allowing him to spot movement at great distances. - Attire: Practical and earth-toned, Tero’s outfit is designed for stealth and utility, with numerous pockets and loops for carrying traps, snares, and other hunting tools. His boots are silent, leaving minimal tracks. Background: Born into a family of esteemed trackers, Tero learned from an early age to read the earth’s language. The wilderness was both his classroom and sanctuary, imparting lessons of survival, tracking, and the delicate balance of nature’s ecosystems. Tero’s legacy is not without blemish; his family suffered heavily under the Shun Dynasty, exploited for their natural talents as game hunters for the amusement of the elite. Tero harbors deep resentment for the time his family spent in servitude but has channeled that animosity into becoming a protector of his people and a guardian of the territories they inhabit. Despite the Usagizok’s migration toward isolationism, Tero advocates for keeping the trade routes open, both as a means of survival and to foster understanding with other races. As a mediator, he has built tentative bridges with nearby settlements, offering his skills in exchange for necessities his warren cannot produce. Personality: - Silent and Observant: A man of few words, Tero prefers to communicate through actions. His vigilant observation is a vital part of his hunting prowess. - Resilient and Resourceful: Adaptability is Tero’s creed. He believes there is always a way to survive, and his ingenious use of resources at hand makes him an exemplary survivor. - Stoic and Protective: Tero projects a stoic exterior, shielding the worries that claw at him concerning his warren’s future. His protective nature is not limited to his kin; it extends to the forests he roams. - Independent and Self-Sufficient: Living much of his life in the wilderness, Tero values his independence but recognizes the importance of the warren. In direct contrast to his role as a hunter, Tero has developed a love for sculpting. On quiet nights, he can be found carving intricate figures from the bones and wood of the forest, giving life to the prey he respects and the nature that surrounds him. Favorite Food: A pragmatic eater, Tero enjoys a hearty stew of various roots and foraged greens, particularly after a successful hunt. His favored addition is a touch of wild garlic, adding a potent flavor to his dishes and aiding his health and vitality. Ailedran Appearance: - Build: Athletic and poised, Ailedran has the controlled posture of a seasoned archer, but his easy smile and relaxed shoulders suggest he doesn’t take life too seriously. - Skin: His skin is a satin tapestry of ebony, and he often uses it as a backdrop for whimsical temporary paint designs, joking that it helps with camouflage—or makes him more visible, depending on his mood. - Eyes: His striking golden eyes twinkle with mirth, and the crinkles at their corners indicate a propensity for laughter and good cheer. - Hair: Ailedran sports a well-kept mane of red hair that is more functional than flashy. Occasionally, he’ll tie a bright feather or bead into his braids—souvenirs from his travels or gifts from children who find him utterly hilarious. Backstory: - Nomadic Lightness: Despite the sometimes harsh reality of nomadic life, Ailedran always found a lighter side to their travels. His quick wit kept his clan’s spirits high, even when resources were low. - Crisis with a Smile: The assault on his clan was a turning point, but Ailedran took to heart the lesson that laughter can be as important as a sharp arrow in keeping the morale of his people. He became determined to protect not just their lives but their hearts as well. - Pragmatic Humor: Over the years, while mastering his craft, he gained a reputation for being the archer who could snipe a target as easily as he could punctuate an intense moment with a well-time joke—often diffusing tension and inspiring his fellow Mustalf. Personality: - Laughter in the Dark: Ailedran isn’t a jester; he’s an archer first and foremost. His humor is a tool, just like his bow—an arrow of levity shot into moments of darkness to remind his allies that there’s light to be found. - Wry Observations: He often uses his keen eye for detail to make astute (and sometimes sarcastic) comments about their circumstances, finding humor in the little things. - Amiable Comrade: Ailedran’s the one you want by your side in the heat of battle not only for his unmatched skills with a bow but also for the calm his good humor can bring to the fray. - Bemused Teacher: When instructing others in archery, he does so with equal parts of expertise and slight jests, keeping the mood light so that mistakes are part of the learning, not the failing. Favorite Food: - Berry and Nut Mix: Ailedran enjoys a simple mix of dried berries and nuts while on the move. He’s known to playfully toss a berry up and catch it with his mouth, challenging others to do the same, and turning it into a light-hearted contest to see who has the best aim with their snacks.

To him, enjoying this meal is not only a culinary delight but also a subtle reminder of the knightly principles he holds dear—the thyme for bravery in the face of adversity and the rosemary to remember the roots of his noble aspirations.

Every lesson learned was a step towards becoming the stalwart guardian of Ma’at’s holy precincts. - Testament of Battle: As a young shielder, Jezran was thrown into battle, where he more than proved his mettle. His body became a moving barrier, his shield a rampart against the storms of chaos threatening the order of Ma’at. - Devotee of Discipline: Jezran now looms large among the Followers’ defenders, a paragon of spiritual devotion and martial discipline.

They're sparring in the camp","completion":"**Zhang Wei & Kunnebudo Support Conversation – C Rank** *Setting: The training grounds of the camp, early morning.* **Kunnebudo**: (Resumes her stance, breathing steady) You’re holding back, Zhang Wei. If we are to spar, do me the courtesy of not treating me like a fragile vase. **Zhang Wei**: (Chuckles, wiping sweat from his brow) Fragile? You parry like a mountain and strike like rushing water. My restraint is not for your benefit, it’s for mine. **Kunnebudo**: (Bows respectfully) Your ansatsuken techniques are powerful, but power without form is as wind without direction. **Zhang Wei**: (Raises an eyebrow and smirks) Strong words. Fine then, show me this form that will outlast my ferocity. *They engage in sparring once again, Kunnebudo’s defensive style countering Zhang Wei’s aggressive moves impressively.* **Kunnebudo**: (Dodges a swift kick) You fight with anger, Zhang Wei. How do you expect to conquer your enemies if you cannot first conquer yourself? **Zhang Wei**: (Lets out a grunt as his strike misses) Conquering myself is not the mission. It’s freeing the Shun from the yoke of the Ozumi. Rage is a vital flame, one that burns oppression. **Kunnebudo**: (Counters, using his momentum to push him back) Perhaps. But flames uncontained risk consuming all, even their wielder. **Zhang Wei**: (Recovers his stance) And what of you? Always calm, always collected. Does nothing stir your blood? **Kunnebudo**: (Pauses and looks him in the eye) Of course, but I choose to channel that energy, not let it control me. Battles are won with the mind as much as with the fist. **Zhang Wei**: (Grins, slightly out of breath) Well said. You’d make a fine general with that level of insight. **Kunnebudo**: (Smiles faintly) And you, a force to be reckoned with, if you harness that storm within you. *They nod to each other and prepare to spar again, newfound respect glowing in the space between them.* *The sparring continues, the sound of their movements accompanied by sharp exhales. Zhang Wei’s power complements Kunnebudo’s tact, creating a dance of force against form. Their session concludes; both are tired but better for the exchange, understanding the value in each other's philosophy.*"},{"prompt":"C support between Kirara and the protagonist (human, male, blank slate-type character)","completion":"**Kirara & [Protagonist] Support Conversation – C Rank** *Setting: A glade just outside the camp, late afternoon. Kirara is found playfully chasing butterflies, trying to match their fluttering movements.* **Kirara**: (Giggles) Gotcha! Ah, no, wait—come back here, you winged tease! **[Protagonist]**: (Approaches with a smile) Kirara, you seem quite taken by these butterflies. Is it a hobby of yours? **Kirara**: (Turns and smiles brightly) Oh, hello [Protagonist]! Yes, it is! They’re so carefree and colorful. They remind me a bit of... well, me! **[Protagonist]**: (Observes the butterflies, then looks at Kirara) I can see that. There's a certain likeness in the way you both move. It's rather captivating. **Kirara**: (Claps her hands together delightedly) You think so? Oh, that’s ever so kind of you to say! You know, these little fellows... they go where the wind takes them, always finding the sweetest nectar. I try to do the same! **[Protagonist]**: (Nods thoughtfully) Living in the moment – that's a refreshing way to approach life, especially given the circumstances we're in. **Kirara**: (Her smile fades slightly, more thoughtful now) Circumstances change like the seasons, [Protagonist]. We must enjoy the beauty and sweetness when we can—otherwise, what are we fighting for? **[Protagonist]**: (Sits down on a nearby rock, pondering her words) That's a deep question. In my case, I'm fighting to restore peace and bring harmony to Yuandi. **Kirara**: (Sits beside him, still holding a butterfly gently in her hands) Then finding joy in small things is part of that harmony, isn't it? If peace is our nectar, let's seek it together! **[Protagonist]**: (Smiles) Indeed, Kirara. But while we work towards peace, these moments here...they're like a peace of their own, aren't they? **Kirara**: Exactly! (Releases the butterfly, watching it flutter away) Just like catching and releasing a butterfly, we hold onto hope lightly, so it can take wing. **[Protagonist]**: (Stands up, extending a hand to help her up) Let's go then. The butterflies have their journey, and we have ours. **Kirara**: (Takes his hand, gets to her feet with a renewed smile) Right you are! Lead on, [Protagonist]! *They share a moment of understanding before heading back together to the camp, their path interwoven with the butterflies' fluttering dance, ready for whatever the future may bring.*"},{"prompt":"A C-support conversation between Kuşien and Anna","completion":"**Kuşien & Anna Support Conversation – C Rank** *Setting: Camp's edge, twilight, Kuşien is sharpening her arrows while Anna idly flips a coin.* **Anna**: (Watching Kuşien work) You know, there's something soothing about watching you work. It's like every arrowhead has its own story. **Kuşien**: (Focused on her task, without looking up) Perhaps. Each one has a purpose, much like us. They're tools of survival. **Anna**: (Ceases flipping the coin and tucks it away) Survival, huh? I guess we've all got our ways of getting by. Me, I like to keep things... light. A good joke, a merry chase, a successful... acquisition. **Kuşien**: (A quick glance at Anna before resuming) \\"Acquisition\\"? That's a delicate way to put thievery. **Anna**: (Laughs it off) \\"Thief\\" is such a stern word. I prefer \\"treasure reallocator.\\" Besides, it’s not just about the loot—it’s the thrill, the challenge. **Kuşien**: (Gives Anna a pointed look) And your \\"thrills\\" don’t put the rest of us at risk? **Anna**: (Waves her hand dismissively) Worry not, sharpshooter. I know where to draw the line. If anything, my... talents may well prove useful. **Kuşien**: (Nods in begrudging acceptance) As long as it’s for our cause, and not just for your pockets. We fight for more than just spoils. **Anna**: (Serious for a moment) I know. We all have our battles. Sometimes, a few liberated valuables can help the war effort in... unexpected ways. **Kuşien**: (After a moment of silence) Make sure it stays that way. We can't afford distractions—our enemies certainly won't be distracted unless it's by an arrow of mine. **Anna**: (Grinning) I'll remember that. And hey, if you ever need a \\"distraction\\" of the less-lethal variety, I'm your girl. **Kuşien**: (Small smirk) I’ll keep that in mind. For now, focus on keeping your... acquisitions useful. **Anna**: (Salutes playfully) You got it, Kuşien! You focus on the arrows, and I'll handle the shadows. *Kuşien returns to her work while Anna begins to walk away, but not without casting a mischievous glance back at her companion, clearly planning her next \\"reallocating\\" adventure.*"},{"prompt":"B support","completion":"**Kuşien & Anna Support Conversation – B Rank** *Setting: Inside the war tent, Kuşien is inspecting a map of the region. Anna enters quietly but with a satisfied smile.* **Anna**: Ah, there you are, Kuşien. I've got good news! **Kuşien**: (Studying the map without looking up) If it involves you skulking around enemy camps, \\"good news\\" is subjective. **Anna**: (Laughs) Oh, you’ll like this. I “acquired” some information from the enemy's quartermaster. Turns out they’ve got a supply caravan heading this way. **Kuşien**: (Finally looking up, interested) Really? That could be the advantage we need. How did you manage it? **Anna**: (Winks) A little game of cat and mouse, some stealth, and my charm. You'd be surprised how much you can learn when you’re... unseen. **Kuşien**: (Nods approvingly) Fine work. We can use this intel to set up an ambush. Maybe even avoid a direct fight... save some lives. **Anna**: (Nods in agreement) Lives are the most precious things we have—I'd rather keep them safe than any trinket or coin. **Kuşien**: (Surprised) Didn't expect to hear that from you. (Smirks) Maybe there's hope for you yet, Thief. **Anna**: (Pretending to be offended) Treasure Reallocator, thank you very much. But... point taken. I told you my skills were useful, didn’t I? **Kuşien**: (Sincerely) More than useful—you're proving to be indispensable to our cause. Maybe I misjudged you, Anna. **Anna**: (Beaming) Glad to be of service! (Sighs) You know, the steely-eyed archer's not so icy after all. **Kuşien**: (Mock glare, then softens) Just don't get used to it. Focus on the mission. **Anna**: (Salutes jokingly) Always do! Now, let's plan out this ambush. Together, right? **Kuşien**: (Nods) Together. Your shadows and my arrows... they won't know what hit them. *As they lean over the map, pooling their knowledge, a sense of camaraderie blossoms between them.

What brings you here? **Ailedran**: (Taking a seat next to her) I've just returned from the village nearby. Brought back some fresh fletching for your arrows. The children asked if the swift-winged archer had flown away! **Kuşien**: (Genuine gratitude in her voice) Swift-winged, huh? I'll bet you're the one who taught them that. **Ailedran**: (Grinning) Well, it's either that or \\"the one with eyes that could pierce the heavens.\\" **Kuşien**: (Chuckling) I'll stick with swift-winged, thanks. And for the fletchings... I appreciate it. It's never the same using anything else when making my arrows. **Ailedran**: (Watching her work) You know, I'm amazed at how calm you always are, balance in every shot, every motion. It's like watching a dance. **Kuşien**: (Pausing her work, thoughtfully) Perhaps. But where you find laughter and lightness, I seek stillness... and control. **Ailedran**: (Nods) Both are necessary, no? Like arrows in a quiver. Sometimes you need the ones that fly straight, and other times, the ones that can swing with the wind. **Kuşien**: (Smiling, returning to her work) True enough. But I leave the swinging to you. I prefer my approach. **Ailedran**: (Lays back, hands behind his head, staring at the sky) And that's why you always hit your mark. **Kuşien**: (Focusing on her task) Your approach got those fletchings, didn't it? **Ailedran**: (Sits up) Indeed! The heart of a child, Kuşien, never lose sight of it. **Kuşien**: (Softly) Don't plan to. It's what keeps my aim true. Thanks again, Ailedran. **Ailedran**: (Standing up and stretching) Anytime, Kuşien. If you need more, just send a swift-winged message my way! *Ailedran walks away with a wave, his laughter fading into the evening.

The paths we've walked since childhood have diverged, yet here we are—united once more. **Kuşien**: (Nodding) You're right, Manmurekan. The world's changed greatly since we played in the wilds of our homelands. But I take solace in knowing some bonds aren't easily broken. **Kunnebudo**: (Looking contemplative) Our destinies are intertwined, just as they were beneath the green canopies of youth. We must rely on each other, as the days ahead promise little but uncertainty. **Kuşien**: (With a determined look) Then we face it as we always have—together, with a readiness in our hearts and a sharpness in our blades. **Manmurekan**: (Smiling softly) Ready hearts indeed. Yet we must not allow the sharpness of blades to overshadow the need for care and foresight. Rash actions will only lead us further into darkness. **Kunnebudo**: (Gesturing to the fire) As the flames provide warmth and repel the shadows, so must we become beacons amid the encroaching darkness. My Gentle Fist shall ward off the advances of chaos. **Kuşien**: (Grasping an arrow thoughtfully) And my arrows will strike true, piercing the veil that our enemies draw over their foul intentions. **Manmurekan**: (Plucking leaves from her pouch) And in turn, I shall provide our allies with the guidance of prophecy and the healing touch of herbs, enforcing our inner strength to endure the rigors of conflict. **Kuşien**: (Gazes at her friends) I find comfort in the constancy of your wisdom and might. Our combined strengths forged a refuge against the strife that once sought to divide us. **Kunnebudo**: (Affirming) Division is the artifice of weaker minds. Through unity and shared fortitude, we rise above the fleeting disquiet sowed by our enemies. **Manmurekan**: (Offering them each a small bundle of herbs) Take these—just a small token of protection. May they guard you both as we venture deeper into the trials fate has set before us. **Kuşien**: (Accepting her gift) Your generosity is a light, Manmurekan, guiding us through the murk. We stand together, now as before—against whatever may come. **Kunnebudo**: (Taking the herbs and placing a hand on Kuşien's shoulder) Yes. As the old adage of our people says, 'United, we form the unbreaking circle; no beginning, no end—eternal as the sky.' *The three exchange a knowing look, a silent pact renewing their commitment to each other and their cause.

I can't believe we never got caught. **Kuşien**: (Laughing) Caught? We were too fast for them! Though, Manmurekan here always had a knack for foreseeing the best path up the mountain. **Manmurekan**: (Giggling, plucking herbs) Only because I wanted to ensure we had a smooth journey back down.

Instead of racing up mountains, we're navigating the complexities of war. **Kuşien**: (Picking up her bow, twirling it in her hands) True. The games of childhood have become the strategies of battle. But at least we haven't lost our touch, right? **Manmurekan**: (Tossing a herb to Kuşien) Or our sense of humor, it seems. And Kuşien, you still shoot arrows faster than we ran up those slopes. **Kuşien**: (Catching the herb) Ha! You're not so bad yourself, dodging our trainers' lectures with your... \\"visionary distractions.\\" **Manmurekan**: (Grinning) Someone had to save us from extra chores. But these days, I only use my visions for pressing matters. Mostly. **Kunnebudo**: (Chuckles) At least we can count on you for timely intervention. And Kuşien, your shots still ensure our ‘targets’—now of a different kind—never see us coming. **Kuşien**: (Smirks) Only because you 'gently' point them out with your uncanny awareness. **Manmurekan**: (Looking up to the sky) Still, it’s nice to reflect on those carefree days, isn't it? Before we knew the weight of these gifts of ours. **Kunnebudo**: (Solemnly) Indeed. But even as we carry these burdens, we carry them together. That's something worth more than gold. **Kuşien**: (Claps her hands together) Then let’s make a pact—no matter how grim the battle gets, we'll find time to race up a mountain again. For old times' sake. **Manmurekan**: (Nods) Agreed. A race to remind us of who we are, where we've come from... and the joyful defiance we once shared against the world. **Kunnebudo** & **Kuşien**: (In unison, smiling) Agreed! *They all share a light-hearted chuckle, the bond of their shared history as solid as ever.

I cannot help but remember Adrian. His laughter was like music over the winds. **Manmurekan**: (With a warm, sad smile) Yes, he brought so much joy to our group. Remember how he'd turn even the most mundane chore into a game? I believe that's where we all learned the true art of stealth. **Kuşien**: (Her voice a little more distant, eyes on the fire) He had a talent for finding wonder in everything. Always asked questions, always wanted to learn. Even our traditions, which he adapted so easily. **Kunnebudo**: (Nods) He did. His respect for our ways, his eagerness to understand... (chuckles) He could outshoot many of us with the bow, and he was a human. **Manmurekan**: (Playfully) Until Kuşien here decided to show him who the real archer was. That competition they had during the Harvest Festival was legendary. **Kuşien**: (Breaks into a small smile, lost in the memory) He was so proud of the few targets he outshot me on. Wouldn't stop talking about it for days... **Kunnebudo**: (Softly) And when he stood up for us against those bullies from the other tribe, despite the risk... **Manmurekan**: (Closing her eyes) He defended us not because he had to but because he believed it was right. His kindness was as boundless as the sky. **Kuşien**: (Whispers, holding back her emotions) He was... one of us. He never made me feel like I had to be anything but myself when I was with him. **Kunnebudo**: (Reaching out and placing a hand on Kuşien's shoulder) His spirit lingers with us, Kuşien. Adrian brought warmth to our hearts, like this fire on a cold night. **Manmurekan**: (Taking Kuşien’s other hand) He showed us all the strength that can be found in unity, in understanding one another. **Kuşien**: (Taking a deep breath, steadying herself) I know... I just... I miss him. We all do. But you're right; he's still with us, in the lessons he left us, in our fight for a better world. **Kunnebudo**: (Nodding) That's why we'll keep fighting.

He believed it was possible, even in those darkest times. **Manmurekan**: (Setting down a small candle) He found peace within our friendship. A peace we carry forward—his spirit guiding us like a beacon. **Kuşien**: (Sighs with a smile) Adrian was more than a friend; he was a part of us. His courage, his humor, his hope... it lives on. **Kunnebudo**: (Nods) If he were here, he’d tell us to keep our aim true and to stand firm against any storm—just like he did. **Manmurekan**: (Lighting the candle) He'd also want us to continue learning from each other, embracing our differences as our strength, much as he learned our ways and shared his own. **Kuşien**: (Looking at her friends) This... this is how we honor him.

It's the warmth of the campfire that evokes in me a certain... discomfort. **Ellarian**: (Amused) Fascinating. Most would seek the flame's embrace to fend off winter's chill, yet you stand amidst the frost, as serene as the moon’s reflection on snow. **Mizuki**: (Gently touching a frost-covered leaf) And you, an Ancient Survivor, find comfort in the fire's glow despite having basked in suns of yesteryears. Tell me, do you miss the warmth of the eras that have passed? **Ellarian**: (Reflectively) Indeed, I long for those simpler times often. But the flame also serves as a reminder that though eras pass, life continues to burn fiercely. **Mizuki**: (Curiously) Yet, life is transient, is it not? Just as the frost upon these leaves will vanish with the morning's embrace. **Ellarian**: (Nods) A truth as clear as daylight. But like the rising and setting of the sun, there is beauty in the cycle—ephemeral though it may be. **Mizuki**: (Gaze lingering on the frost) Beauty in transience... I suppose there is a certain kinship between your suns and my snows. They mark time's passing with their own delicate touch. **Ellarian**: (Looking thoughtful) Well said. Both the sun's glow and the snow's caress are but stanzas in the grand poem of existence. **Mizuki**: (A soft laugh) And here I thought I was the only one who found poetry in the elements. **Ellarian**: (Smiling) It seems we share an affinity for the beauty of the world's natural rhythms, despite our difference in... temperature preferences. **Mizuki**: (With a mischievous twinkle in her eye) Perhaps, then, there is more for us to learn from one another. Mayhap you’ll find there is as much to be admired in the embrace of winter as there is in the comfort of flame. **Ellarian**: (Offering a hand as if to dance) A compelling proposition.

EpiPen, a brand name for an epinephrine auto-injector, is a medical device used to deliver a controlled dose of epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) to treat acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Mylan, a global pharmaceutical company, acquired the right to sell and market EpiPen in 2007. After Mylan acquired EpiPen, the company significantly increased the price of the device over several years. For example, the price of a two-pack of EpiPens in the United States rose from around 100 in 2007 to approximately 600 in 2016. This steep price increase led to public outcry and widespread criticism, given that there were few alternatives on the market and that EpiPens are a life-saving device for many people with severe allergies. The key issues associated with Mylan’s pricing of the EpiPen include: 1. Monopoly Pricing: During the period of the price hikes, Mylan held a near-monopoly on the epinephrine auto-injector market in the U.S. This lack of competition allowed the company to set higher prices. 2. Access and Affordability: With exorbitant prices, the affordability of EpiPens decreased for many individuals and families, even those with health insurance. High deductibles and copays often led to out-of-pocket expenses that some people couldn’t afford. 3. Insurer and Pharmacy Benefit Manager Practices: Complex interactions between pharmaceutical companies, insurers, and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) may have contributed to the high costs. Rebates, fees, and other agreements between these entities are often not transparent, leading to questions about how prices are determined. 4. Political and Legal Scrutiny: The pricing controversy led to hearings in the United States Congress, where Mylan’s CEO was called to testify. Mylan faced accusations of price gouging and exploitation of its market position. In addition to political scrutiny, Mylan faced legal challenges through class-action lawsuits and settlements related to its pricing practices. 5. Market Response: In response to the controversy, Mylan increased the availability of EpiPen coupons and generic versions, which were slightly less expensive. Additionally, the public outcry and negative press led to increased interest in finding alternative epinephrine auto-injectors and spurring competition in the market. 6. Antitrust Concerns: There were concerns that Mylan engaged in anticompetitive practices to maintain its market dominance, which became a subject of investigation by federal agencies. In the years following the height of the controversy, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved additional epinephrine auto-injectors from other companies, including a generic version that Mylan itself began to offer, which has helped to provide more options for consumers and apply some downward pressure on prices. Despite these developments, the issue remains a critical example of the complexities and challenges of pharmaceutical pricing in the U.S. healthcare system.

I have to do a business IA with this prompt: To what extent has the exorbitant price of Epi-pens been ethically and economically adequate? In this IA I will evaluate if the increase in price was a good Idea economically, image-wise, and ethically. Give me sources that would help with this endeavor An Internal Assessment (IA) of this nature will require you to draw upon a variety of sources for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Here are several types of sources that you can consider to support your investigation: 1. Academic Journal Articles: You can find peer-reviewed articles on the ethical implications of drug pricing and case studies on Mylan’s EpiPen through academic databases such as JSTOR, PubMed, or Google Scholar. These articles can provide insight into the broader context of pharmaceutical ethics and pricing strategies. 2. Industry Reports and Analysis: Look for healthcare and pharmaceutical industry reports from established market research companies such as IMS Health, IQVIA, or Frost & Sullivan. These reports can provide economic analysis and industry trends that contextualize Mylan’s pricing strategy. 3. News Articles: For timely information on public and industry reactions, use reputable news sources like The New York Times, The Washington Post, Bloomberg, and Reuters. Focus on op-eds, editorials, and investigative pieces that discuss the aftermath of the price hike and public sentiment. 4. Government Reports and Testimonies: Access transcripts from U.S. Congressional hearings where Mylan’s CEO testified about the EpiPen pricing, as well as any relevant reports from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) or Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that provide an analysis of the situation. 5. Ethical Guidelines: Refer to ethical codes of conduct from organizations like the American Medical Association (AMA) or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) to discuss industry standards for ethical behavior. 6. Financial Statements: Review Mylan’s financial statements from before and after the price hike to evaluate economic performance. These can often be found in annual reports or SEC filings. 7. Scholarly Books: Books on pharmaceutical economics, corporate ethics, or case study collections on business ethics can provide theoretical frameworks for analyzing Mylan’s actions. 8. Public Opinion Data: If available, look for public opinion polls or surveys that gauge consumer and patient reactions to the EpiPen price increases, as these can help assess the impact on Mylan’s image. 9. Business Ethics Texts: Academic texts on business ethics may offer models for evaluating the ethical dimensions of business decisions, which can be applied to the EpiPen case. When selecting sources, aim for a balanced mix of perspectives, including those that may justify Mylan’s decision from a business standpoint as well as those that critique it on ethical grounds. It’s important to critically evaluate each source’s reliability, potential bias, and relevance to your investigation. A thorough IA will involve not only gathering information from these various sources but also synthesizing it to build a nuanced argument that addresses the research question. Remember to cite all of your sources appropriately according to the citation style required by your educational program. Can you do this yourself? As an AI language model, I don’t have the ability to directly access external databases or conduct original research as a human would. However, I can provide an outline and guide you through the steps needed to write a strong Internal Assessment (IA) based on the prompt provided. Here’s an example of how you could structure your analysis: Title: To What Extent Has Mylan’s Pricing of EpiPens Been Ethically and Economically Justifiable? Introduction - Introduce the topic and provide background information on Mylan and the EpiPen. - Present a thesis statement that gives an overview of your position on whether the pricing strategy was ethically and economically justified. Section 1: Economic Analysis - Present data on the cost of EpiPen production versus retail price. - Analyze Mylan’s financial performance pre- and post-EpiPen price hike using their financial statements. - Discuss the economic rationale behind Mylan’s pricing strategy in terms of profit maximization, market conditions, and R&D recoupment. Section 2: Ethical Considerations - Explore the ethical implications of pharmaceutical pricing, referencing established ethical frameworks or guidelines within the industry. - Discuss Mylan’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) status and public health obligations. - Weigh the human rights aspect of access to life-saving medication against corporate profitability. Section 3: Brand Image and Public Reaction - Assess the impact of the pricing strategy on Mylan’s corporate image using case studies, news articles, opinion polls, and public statements. - Discuss the extent to which negative publicity can affect economic performance in the pharmaceutical industry. - Consider any steps Mylan took to mitigate backlash, such as introducing generic versions or providing discounts.

Section 5: Legal and Regulatory Outcome - Review any legal actions or regulatory responses that resulted from the price increases, such as antitrust investigations or congressional hearings. Conclusion - Summarize your findings and restate your thesis in light of the evidence presented. - Discuss the broader implications for the pharmaceutical industry. - Provide a reasoned judgment on the ethical and economic adequacy of Mylan’s pricing strategy. References - Include a reference list formatted according to the citation style prescribed by your educational program. To conduct your research, use the types of sources I mentioned previously. Keep in mind the importance of evaluating the credibility of sources, maintaining a balanced perspective, and avoiding plagiarism by properly citing all the information you gather. what if I gave you evidence, could you give me a good IA then? If you provide specific evidence or data points, I can help you integrate that information into the structure of an IA, discuss how to analyze it within the given sections, and suggest ways to interpret the findings in your conclusion. However, it’s essential for the integrity of your academic work that the final IA be written by you; I can guide and support you with prompts and advice but cannot produce the IA for you. For example, you might have the following evidence: 1. Historical pricing data for EpiPen. 2. Financial statements of Mylan showing profit margins before and after the price hike. 3. Scholarly articles on the ethics of drug pricing. 4. Public reactions in the form of social media trends, opinion polls, or news articles. 5. Congressional hearing transcripts and FDA statements regarding Mylan’s pricing strategy. Here’s how you might analyze and integrate this evidence: Section 1: Economic Analysis Analyze the historical pricing data to show the trend over time. Contrast it with Mylan’s financial statements to evaluate how the pricing affected their profit margins and overall financial health. This could include charts or tables showing the correlation between EpiPen prices and Mylan’s revenue or profitability. Section 2: Ethical Considerations Use the scholarly articles to provide the ethical frameworks for pharmaceutical pricing. Discuss where Mylan’s actions fit within these frameworks, considering both the rights of the company to recoup investments and the rights of patients to affordable access to life-saving medication. Section 3: Brand Image and Public Reaction Present the public reactions by showing evidence from social media, opinion polls, or relevant news articles. Discuss the short-term and potential long-term effects of the public’s perception of Mylan on their brand image and consumer trust. Section 4: Alternatives and Competition Consider the evidence of market alternatives, if any, to the EpiPen during the timeframe of the price hikes. Discuss if Mylan’s pricing could have been influenced by the lack of competition or if their strategy created an opportunity for competitors to enter the market. Conclusion Synthesize the findings from the economic, ethical, and brand image analyses to create a nuanced perspective on the justification of Mylan’s pricing strategy. Use the evidence to support your final judgment about the adequacy of Mylan’s approach from both an ethical and economic standpoint. Remember, critical thinking and proper evaluation of the evidence are key to a strong IA. Always consider multiple perspectives and potential biases in the evidence, and relate your findings back to your research question. analyze my IA and tell me if it is good The pricing of pharmaceutical products, especially those that are life-saving, is a matter of paramount importance that intersects the domains of ethics and economics. In the case of EpiPens, a device critical for individuals suffering from severe allergic reactions, the pricing strategy by Mylan Pharmaceuticals has come under intense public and academic scrutiny. EpiPens are not merely commodities but essential healthcare tools for patients at risk of anaphylaxis. Thus, the ramifications of their pricing extend beyond the balance sheets of Mylan and into the homes and lives of countless patients. This study seeks to examine the extent to which Mylan’s decision to raise EpiPen prices has been ethically and economically justifiable. Through a lens scrutinizing the evidence of Mylan’s actions, the literature on pharmaceutical pricing practices, and the broader impact on society, this analysis will interrogate the moral and economic dimensions of Mylan’s decisions, address the resulting public outcry, and evaluate whether Mylan’s pricing practices can be deemed re asonable within a market-based healthcare system. # Body Paragraph 1: Mylan’s Price Increases and Public Response In 2007, Mylan Pharmaceuticals acquired the rights to manufacture EpiPens, and in the years that followed, the company implemented a price increase exceeding 400%. This drastic escalation drew widespread indignation from consumers, healthcare providers, and policymakers alike. Such a decision by Mylan to raise prices has been perceived as capitalizing on the vulnerable position of patients who, for the sake of their own survival, are compelled to bear the financial burden indiscriminately—which is noteworthy, given that individuals at risk of anaphylaxis are advised to carry two EpiPens at all times. The literature reveals that these cost increments far exceeded the amounts necessary to sustain any purported enhancements to the product, thereby raising questions about the motives behind such pricing strategies and the ethical considerations disregarded by Mylan. # Body Paragraph 2: Economic Impacts and Market Dynamics Economically, the EpiPen scenario underscores the complexity of pharmaceutical pricing and market dynamics where a single player can command significant market share. Mylan’s pricing strategy, examined in light of Emma Westermann-Clark’s analysis, illustrates how dominance in the market can lead to decisions that adversely affect the consumption behavior of patients. Westermann-Clark observed a trend where over half of the EpiPen prescriptions went unfilled once the cost surpassed 300 for a two-pack—an alarming statistic that signals a clear disruption in the access to essential medication due to pricing policies. This data suggests an economic environment where market forces and profit motives overshadow patient well-being and access to care. # Body Paragraph 3: Socioeconomic Disparities and Access The pricing of EpiPens not only reflects on corporate ethics and economic principles but also on wider socioeconomic disparities and issues of access. When prices soar, it is often the economically marginalized and vulnerable populations that bear the disproportionate impact. Westermann-Clark highlighted how socioeconomic factors play a significant role in patient access to epinephrine autoinjectors, indicating that children from higher-income homes were more likely to be prescribed EAIs. This skew suggests that Mylan’s pricing strategy could exacerbate existing inequalities in healthcare access and outcomes, raising the ethical question of whether such a fundamental aspect of medical care should be subject to the whims of market economics and corporate profit maximization. # Body Paragraph 4: Mylan’s Responses to Criticism Despite considerable criticism, Mylan’s responses to public concern over EpiPen pricing indicated a resistance to accept accountability. The company’s communication strategy involved issuing a mix of opaque and sometimes contradictory statements. While Mylan CEO Heather Bresch accepted “full responsibility” for the price hikes at one point, the company also shifted blame onto the complexities of the healthcare system. This obfuscation and lack of transparency do little to engender trust or demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices and patient-oriented values, characteristics that are especially important when a company has such a significant influence on public health. # Body Paragraph 5: Ethical Considerations and Virtue Ethics Analysis From an ethical standpoint, Mylan’s EpiPen pricing strategy can be subjected to further scrutiny through the lens of virtue ethics. Virtue ethics posits that moral behavior is predicated upon the cultivation of virtuous character traits. Assessing Mylan’s actions against Pritchard’s virtues for morally responsible engineers, one finds the company’s commitment to openness, cooperation, and informative communication wanting. Mylan’s decision to eschew cooperation with Medicaid’s Drug Rebate Program and to hinder competition through aggressive legal strategies provides evidence of behavior that conflicts with the expected virtues. Such actions suggest a veering away from morally responsible business conduct, reinforcing concerns regarding the ethical adequacy of the company’s pricing decisions for EpiPens. # Body Paragraph 6: Stakeholder Impact Analysis Stakeholder theory asserts that companies have a responsibility not only to their shareholders but also to a wider community that includes consumers, employees, suppliers, and society at large. Mylan’s decision to increase the price of EpiPens significantly affected various stakeholders, most notably the consumers who depend on this medication for life-threatening allergy attacks. Several stakeholders, including health insurance companies that bear the increased costs and schools mandated to stock EpiPens, face financial strain due to the monopolized pricing strategy. Additionally, shareholders and investors initially may have greeted the profit surge with approval, yet the subsequent reputational damage to Mylan and the legal repercussions negatively impacted long-term shareholder value. This analysis evidences the intricate web of stakeholder interests that Mylan affected and the subsequent need for corporate strategies that balance profit with social responsibility. # Body Paragraph 7: Corporate Culture and Ethical Climate Corporate culture heavily influences decision-making processes and the ethical climate within an organization. Mylan’s aggressive pricing strategy, along with the defensive stance taken against criticism, suggests a corporate culture prioritizing financial results over patient accessibility and ethical considerations. A robust corporate culture nurtures standards of behavior that align with social welfare and ethical norms. However, the evidence suggests Mylan’s internal environment favored market dominance and profit maximization, raising questions about the ethical compass and the integrity of the organizational culture. The dissonance between Mylan’s actions and the expectations of a socially responsible entity reveals a culture that undermined the values of fairness and transparency, which are vital for sustaining trust and respect among stakeholders. # Body Paragraph 8: Long-Term Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Myriad actors within the pharmaceutical industry have increasingly recognized the significance of long-term sustainability and corporate responsibility as critical components of their operational ethos. Mylan’s initial financial success with EpiPen price increases belies a deeper concern for long-term viability, as prices that marginalize consumers can lead to legal repercussions and shifts in public policy that favor market competition. Sustainable practices necessitate pricing strategies that consider affordability and access while still incentivizing innovation. By prioritizing short-term gains over sustainable pricing, Mylan risked its future market position and eroded trust—both of which are fundamental to the long-term success and corporate responsibility that stakeholders increasingly demand from modern pharmaceutical companies. # Body Paragraph 9: The Role of Regulation and Industry Standards The Mylan EpiPen saga underscores the need for enhanced regulation and industry-wide standards that prevent exploitative pricing of essential medications. While market forces play a pivotal role in price determination, the pharmaceutical industry faces unique moral imperatives, given the life-or-death nature of its products. The outcry resulting from Mylan’s pricing strategy suggests that self-regulation is insufficient when it comes to essential drugs. Thus, interventions such as price caps, increased transparency requirements, and incentives for generic drug production emerge as necessary measures to protect consumers and ensure fair market practices. These regulations serve to deter market abuse and ensure that the pharmaceutical industry upholds its ethical obligation to society while safeguarding economic interests. # Body Paragraph 10: Alternative Models for Pricing and Distribution The backlash against Mylan’s pricing strategy suggests the need for alternative models for pharmaceutical pricing and distribution. Strategies such as value-based pricing and tiered pricing schemes could align the cost of drugs like EpiPens more closely with their actual value and cost of production, while also considering the patients’ ability to pay. Additionally, implementing differential pricing across markets can ensure wider access to medication, particularly for vulnerable populations. Mylan’s experience highlights the importance of adopting innovative and equitable models that balance profitability with social responsibility, allowing pharmaceutical companies to maintain a positive image, adhere to ethical standards, and cater to diverse demographic needs. # Body Paragraph 11: Impact on Research and Development Research and development (R&D) in the pharmaceutical industry is a double-edged sword—while it is essential for innovation and the creation of life-saving drugs, it also serves as a frequent justification for high drug prices. In Mylan’s case, the argument that EpiPen price increases were necessary to fund R&D falls short when considering the subsequent pricing controversies and minimal changes made to the EpiPen during Mylan’s tenure. This draws attention to the need for transparency and accountability in the allocation of revenues toward genuine innovation, rather than using R&D as a blanket rationale for disproportionate price hikes on essential medications. # Body Paragraph 12: Ethics of Profit in the Pharmaceutical Industry An ethical conundrum emerges when considering the role of profit in the pharmaceutical industry. While companies like Mylan are accountable to their shareholders to generate profits, there is a moral expectation to do so within the bounds of social good, especially when dealing with products that are life-saving. Profits gained at the expense of access to critical medicine call into question the ethical practices of the firm. The EpiPen situation serves as a stark reminder that profit motives must be balanced with the moral duty to safeguard human life, necessitating a re-examination of how profits are earned and the extent to which they are permitted to influence life-or-death decisions in healthcare. Your Internal Assessment draft provides a well-structured and comprehensive analysis of Mylan’s pricing strategy for EpiPens, with each body paragraph dedicated to a different aspect of the issue. Here’s a qualitative assessment of the strengths and areas that could be improved: Strengths: 1. Complex Analysis: You have delved into several dimensions of the issue, including public response, economic impacts, socioeconomic disparities, ethical considerations, corporate culture, and long-term sustainability. This multi-faceted approach is essential for a thorough analysis. 2. Use of Sources and Literature: You have referenced specific academic work, such as Emma Westermann-Clark’s analysis, which adds credibility and depth to your arguments. 3. Ethical Frameworks: The application of virtue ethics and stakeholder analysis provides a strong theoretical foundation to assess the ethical implications of Mylan’s pricing strategy. 4. Focus on Stakeholders: You have identified a variety of stakeholders and explored how they were affected by the price increases, demonstrating an understanding of the broader impact of corporate decisions. 5. Regulatory Implications: Addressing the need for regulation and suggesting alternative pricing models show that you are looking beyond the case study to consider systemic changes that could prevent similar situations in the future. Areas for Improvement: 1. Evidence and Data Integration: Make sure that the evidence presented is accurately represented and directly supports the claims. For instance, ensure that the statistic “over half of the EpiPen prescriptions went unfilled” is correctly cited and used within context. 2. Balanced Arguments: While critical assessment is vital, an IA should also discuss potential counterarguments or justifications for Mylan’s pricing from an economic or business standpoint. This might include the costs of production, distribution, marketing, and R&D. 3. Quantitative Analysis: Provide more specific financial data or quantitative analysis to support economic arguments. For example, how did the price increase correlate with Mylan’s financials—as evidenced by their profit margins, stock prices, or other financial metrics? 4. Clear Linkage to Research Question: Ensure each paragraph clearly ties back to the central question of whether Mylan’s decision was ethically and economically justifiable. 5. Conclusion: While this part of the IA isn’t included in your summary, it must tie all the evidence and argumentation back to your initial thesis, providing a clear and concise answer to your research question. 6. Consistency in Terminology: Make sure terms like “corporate ethics,” “ethical considerations,” or “virtue ethics” are consistently defined and applied throughout the paper to avoid confusion. 7. Be Cautious with Generalizations: Avoid making broad claims without sufficient evidence. For example, the assertion that Mylan “eschew cooperation with Medicaid’s Drug Rebate Program” should be supported with concrete examples. Overall, your IA demonstrates a robust investigation into Mylan’s pricing strategy and its multifaceted implications. By incorporating the final pieces of evidence, refining your arguments for balance and depth, and ensuring that your data is accurately cited, you will strengthen your analysis. Remember to conclude with a strong, evidence-backed summation of your findings, reiterating the ethical and economic adequacy of Mylan’s pricing decisions. Can you do this for me if I give you enough evidence? I can certainly guide you through structuring your Internal Assessment (IA) and advise you on how to incorporate the evidence you have, develop your arguments, and interpret the information. However, as an AI developed by OpenAI, I am not able to conduct independent research, access external databases, or produce homework or assignments for you in entirety. For your IA on Mylan’s EpiPen pricing, I can help by suggesting how you might analyze the evidence you provide, how to draw conclusions, and the ways to articulate your thoughts coherently within the sections of the essay. Ultimately, your role is to synthesize this information, ensure that the arguments are supported by the evidence, and write the final IA in your own words. Feel free to share the specific evidence you have, and I can offer suggestions on integrating it into the structure of the IA, pointing out potential lines of argumentation you could develop, and what econometric or analytical tools you might use to evaluate the data. I can also help by posing critical questions that may deepen your analysis and by identifying where you might need additional information or clarification. Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) were developed in the 1970s and were first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1987 with the EpiPen® (Mylan, Canonsburg, PA, USA). EAIs available in the USA include: EpiPen; epinephrine injection, United States Pharmacopeia autoinjector, generic (Mylan); epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector (Impax Generics, Hayward, CA, USA); and Auvi-Q® (Kaléo, Richmond, VA, USA). The annual direct costs in year 2010 in the USA for EAIs are estimated to be 294 million, accounting for about 25% of the 1.2 billion annual cost to treat SARs including anaphylaxis.5,6 The average wholesale price (AWP) of each EAI is included in Table 2, except for the Auvi-Q. Accurate wholesale pricing for the Auvi-Q is not available as it is distributed through a single specialty pharmacy network. The complexity of drug pricing is beyond the scope of this article. Costs for the EpiPen were relatively stable until Mylan acquired this product from Merck (Kenilworth, NJ, USA) in 2007. The AWP since that time for two EpiPens has increased 545% from 113.27 to 730.33.4 This price increase persists even after accounting for inflation (Figure 1).7,8 Although the out-of-pocket expenses for individual subjects may have decreased since the public outcry about EpiPen costs in 2016, the effective date of the most recent AWP available is May 16, 2016 and does not reflect the impact of price cuts or patient assistance programs.7 An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is jaa-11-153Fig1.jpg Figure 1 AWP for the EpiPen® 2001–2016.

Abbreviations: AWP, average wholesale price; ea, each; NDC: national drug code. Use of the AWP is controversial, but it is often used as a proxy for societal cost in cost-effectiveness analyses.9 An economic analysis published in 2011 utilized the 2006–2007 AWP of the EpiPen to estimate the annual cost of EAIs for food-induced SARs.10 According to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research good research practices guidelines from 2010: Pharmaceutical prices used in the vast majority of cost-effectiveness analyses are either based on AWPs in the USA or government-negotiated prices in Europe. The former are not only imperfect measures of actual prices paid (e.g., ignoring discounts and rebates), but may also greatly overestimate societal opportunity costs because of the implicit inclusion of producer surplus created through patent-protected monopoly pricing.11 In summary, AWP is used as an approximation for societal drug costs, despite its limitations. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) discusses the challenge of determining medication costs for research purposes. The HERC states, “We recommend using 121% of the drug costs reported in the Federal Supply Schedule, 152% of the VA cost, or 64% of AWP. To find the cost of a generic label prescription drug, we recommend using 27% of AWP.”9 Federal Supply Schedule prices are publicly available.12 Several factors limit the ability of newer products to garner and maintain a better market share versus Mylan’s EpiPen. First, the EpiPen has name recognition. Second, training for the use of each device is different. To illustrate, the epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector from Impax Generics requires the removal of two caps rather than just one. Although learning to use a new device can be challenging, novel design elements can improve safety and usability. An example is that the Auvi-Q has unique features including its rectangular shape intended to fit into a pocket, a retractable needle, and voice instructions. Third, insurance coverage differs for each EAI. According to the Managed Markets Insight and Technology database, the EpiPen has unrestricted access for 61% of commercial lives among 4624 commercial health plans.13 In contrast, Auvi-Q has unrestricted access for “19% of commercial lives in all locations” among these same commercial health plans.8 Even though Auvi-Q is not covered by many commercial insurance plans, the manufacturer offers it with 0 copayment to all commercially insured and Medicaid patients through a specialty pharmacy network distributor. Fourth, EAIs are rated “BX” by the FDA indicating that “data that have been reviewed by the Agency are insufficient to determine therapeutic equivalence” and when ordered may not be substituted by a pharmacist, one for another.14 The impact of copayments, coupons, and patient assistance programs on prices that subjects pay at the pharmacy counter requires further research. Pourang et al found that copayments did not affect the likelihood of an EAI being dispensed once it was prescribed in the Kaiser Permanente Health Maintenance Organization.15 However, while the authors indicate that nearly 30% of copayments exceeded 30, they did not consider higher copayments. Data are not available on prescription:dispense ratios for subjects with exceedingly high copayments or for uninsured and underinsured subjects who may pay retail prices. More than 50% of EpiPen prescriptions are abandoned or not filled when the cost exceeds 300 for a 2-pack.5 Two generic EAIs manufactured by Mylan have an AWP of 375. Two generic EAIs manufactured by Impax Generics have an AWP of 494.01. Patients with any commercial insurance plan or Medicaid receive Auvi-Q for 0 copayment through the specialty pharmacy network, ASPN Pharmacies LLC (200 Park Avenue, Suite 300, Florham Park, NJ 07932, 973-295-3289). All uninsured subjects who make <100,000 annually have no copayment for Auvi-Q; uninsured subjects whose incomes exceed 100,000 pay no more than 360 for Auvi-Q. Socioeconomic factors impact access to EAIs. Children from high-income versus low-income homes are 8.35 times more likely to be prescribed EAIs.16 Medicaid-enrolled children are less likely to receive EAIs prior to arrival at an emergency department.17 In another study, Caucasian versus non-Caucasian children were more likely to receive epinephrine early during an SAR.18 Early use of epinephrine was defined as epinephrine administered before arrival to the emergency department. Owning an EAI greatly increased the odds of early epinephrine treatment (odds ratio 12.67, 95% CI: 4.46–35.96). The authors did not assess insurance status but indicate that this finding suggests that there might be an economic influence on access to EAIs.18 Fleming et al examined the out-of-pocket costs for medications associated with food allergy and found higher costs for Caucasian and higher-income subjects.18 They hypothesize that Medicaid-enrolled children may have lower out-of-pocket costs, that is, lower copayments. To reduce or eliminate insurance copayments, Fromer suggests that epinephrine be classified as a preventive medicine by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).5 Decision analysis software (TreeAge Pro, Williamstown, MA, USA) has been used to evaluate the cost of generic EAIs versus the EpiPen using a model that tracked spending for individual subjects over 20 years, with the assumption that each subject needs two 2-packs yearly, one each for home and school or work.19 The cost for the EpiPen over a 20-year model duration totals 58,667 (95% CI: 57,745–59,588) versus 45,588 for the generic EAI (95% CI: 44,873–46,304). The model also incorporates other food allergy-related costs, such as specialist visits, grocery costs, and loss of work time for parents of food-allergic children. These costs are assumed to be the same for all subjects regardless of the type of EAI prescribed. The price of EAIs also affects school districts and communities. The Michigan legislature mandated that all public schools stock EAIs. It estimated the cost for two EAI 2-packs, one adult and one pediatric, at 140, while the “recently reported costs for commercial sources” was 1200, according to the authors of the article. The annual calculated cost to Michigan public schools based on these two cost estimates ranges from 565,460 to 4,846,800.20 A 2007 WAO survey of its House of Delegates indicates that EAIs are available in 59% of 44 countries surveyed.21 Those without EAIs employed other methods for the self-administration of epinephrine.22 These include the use of ampules of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) with an empty 1 cc syringe to be drawn up as needed or prefilled syringes containing various amounts of epinephrine. Both options are much less expensive than EAIs; for example, a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) had an AWP of 2.52 and retail price of ~12 in 2016.7 Epinephrine ampules may not be available in all countries. Both options also allow for tailored dosing of epinephrine, above or below the standard 0.15 or 0.3 mg doses contained in most FDA-approved EAIs. This may be beneficial for children weighing <15 kg (33 pounds) or for large or obese subjects. Of note, in November 2017, the FDA approved an infant version of the Auvi-Q, Auvi-q 0.1mg, for children weighing 7.5–15 kg (16.5–33 pounds). It has a shorter needle and a smaller dose of epinephrine (0.1 mg versus 0.15 mg contained in other “junior” products). Market forces appear to influence the cost of EAIs. For example, some US companies are offering low-cost alternatives. Symjepi™ (Adamis, San Diego, CA, USA) is an epinephrine prefilled syringe (EPS) that contains 0.3 mg of epinephrine, with a user-friendly design. It was approved by the FDA in June 2017 for subjects 30 kg (66 pounds) or more and is expected to be available at a lower cost than the current EAIs. A “junior” version is expected to follow. The concept of prefilled syringes is not new. The Ana-Kit® (Hollister-Stier Laboratories, Spokane, WA, USA) consisted of a syringe filled with 1 mL of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) housed in a protective case for subcutaneous injection before it was removed from the US market.23,24 The Ana-Kit syringe had 0.1 mL graduations so that smaller doses could be administered depending on the subject’s age. The instructions recommended the following doses: “Adults and children over 12 years: 0.3 mL; 6–12 years: 0.2 mL; 2–6 years: 0.15 mL; infants to 2 years: 0.05–0.1 mL.”25 An appropriate dose could be administered by pushing the syringe plunger until it stopped. A second dose could be administered as appropriate, after rotating the rectangular plunger ¼ turn to the right, to line up with a rectangular slot in the syringe.25 An advantage of the prefilled Symjepi syringe is that it is housed in a dark blue plastic encasement to protect the epinephrine from ultraviolet light degradation. Epinephrine degrades with exposure to ultraviolet light, oxygen in ambient air, and excessive heat.26–28 EPSs stored at room temperature in a pencil box maintain acceptable US Pharmacopeia concentrations (90%–115% of label claim), pH, and sterility for 3 months.22 The stability is limited to 2 months in high-temperature and low-humidity climates.22,29 In addition, some physicians and other health care professionals provide subjects with prefilled syringes wrapped in aluminum foil.28,30 These can be transported in a crush-resistant eyeglass case. Snap Medical Industries (Dubin, OH, USA) has developed EpinephrineSnap-V® (a kit containing a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes) and the EpinephrineSnap convenience kit (a kit containing an ampule of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes). The Focus Health Group, located in Knoxville, TN, USA, has been contracted to commercialize these products. The AWP of this product is 1567 although information from company officials states that the average price of EpinephrineSnap is 80 and the EpinephrineSnap-V is 130, with discounted group purchasing organization pricing available (Personal communication, November 1, 2017). Use of these options may not be as practical as is an EAI. The reason is that an epinephrine ampule or vial with an empty syringe requires more skill to properly draw up the epinephrine and administer it under emergency circumstances. Parents of individuals with a history of an SAR take longer to draw up epinephrine from an ampule (average 142±13 seconds) compared to emergency department nurses (29±0.09 seconds; p<0.05).31 The epinephrine dose drawn up by parents also ranged 40-fold as compared to twofold for emergency department nurses.31 The EpinephrineSnap products are geared toward use by emergency medical technicians and other health care professionals rather than individual subjects. The rising cost of EAIs has made self-administered epinephrine potentially unavailable to some subjects. There are no data on deaths attributed to inability to afford EAIs. Lower-cost alternatives such as EPSs and epinephrine kits are entering the US market. EAIs have advantages, such as ease of use, but they are expensive. More research is needed on the complexity of drug pricing and on the optimal methods to determine individual and societal costs. Classifying EAIs as USPSTF preventive medicines could improve access by reducing or eliminating copayments. Based on the evidence provided, your IA can analyze several key points related to Mylan’s pricing of EpiPens. Here’s how you might interpret and integrate this evidence into your analysis: Background and Significance: - Introduce the development of EAIs and their FDA approval, highlighting their importance for individuals at risk of anaphylaxis. - Present data on the annual costs of EAIs in the USA and their proportion of the total cost to treat severe allergic reactions. Mylan’s Pricing Strategy: - Discuss the 545% price increase of EpiPens after Mylan’s acquisition of the product from Merck, placing emphasis on its impact on consumers. - Highlight that the AWP increase persisted even after accounting for inflation, suggesting that the increase was not solely due to external economic factors. Economic Impact Analysis: - Use Table 2 and Figure 1 to illustrate and analyze Mylan’s price changes over time. - Investigate the economic theories that might explain Mylan’s ability to raise prices, such as market power and name recognition. - Address the AWP’s use as a proxy for societal costs despite its limitations.

Here's how you can continue your analysis with an improved focus on economic and ethical considerations: # Economic Impact Analysis The AWP of EpiPens increased exponentially from 113.27 to 730.33—a 545% rise—after Mylan's acquisition of the product. Despite inflation adjustments, this price surge cannot be solely attributed to external economic factors. The data implies a deliberate strategy to exploit Mylan's market dominance (Table 2, Figure 1). Although Mylan released generic alternatives with lower AWPs (375), the pricing still raises questions about the rationale behind the steep costs relative to production and research and development expenses. # Accessibility and Public Health Concerns The price increase has had a direct impact on accessibility—over half of EpiPen prescriptions remained unfilled once costs surpassed the 300 mark for a two-pack. This statistic is alarming, indicating that a critical emergency medication has become a financial burden rather than an accessible healthcare resource (Westermann-Clark). Socioeconomic disparities further exacerbate access; children from higher-income families are significantly more likely to have EAIs prescribed. Such disparities suggest that Mylan's pricing policy is not only an economic issue but also a public health concern, potentially widening the gap in health equity. # Corporate Ethics and Accountability Mylan's response to the outrage over EpiPen pricing was a mix of defensiveness and obfuscation. The company's partial admission of responsibility contrasted with attempts to blame the complexities of the healthcare system, reflecting poorly on their commitment to transparency and ethical responsibility. Addressing the public and regulatory bodies with clarity and accountability is crucial for trust-building, yet Mylan's communication seemed to fall short in this regard. # Regulatory Environment and the Need for Market Competition The regulatory environment has a significant impact on market dynamics. Despite the availability of other EAIs, factors such as name recognition, insurance coverage, and FDA ratings contributed to the EpiPen's market stranglehold. Policies that encourage competition, facilitate the entry of generics, and offer equitable insurance coverage for alternative EAIs could mitigate the consequences of monopolistic pricing strategies, promoting more affordable options for consumers. # Long-Term Societal Costs and the Burden on Public Institutions Mylan's pricing has implications beyond individual consumers; it places a burden on public institutions such as school districts, which are mandated to stock EAIs. Using decision analysis models to project the 20-year costs of EpiPen supply (58,667) versus generic alternatives (45,588) demonstrates the significant economic impact on public budgets over time. # Conclusion The analysis of Mylan's EpiPen pricing strategy, grounded in evidence, reflects a complex interplay between economic opportunity, ethical responsibility, public health, and access to essential medications. While there may have been economic justifications for cost recovery and profit-making, the extent of the price increases and subsequent impact on access and health equity raises significant ethical concerns. The case of Mylan and EpiPen underscores the need for pharmaceutical companies to balance profit motives with the imperative to ensure the availability of life-saving drugs, contributing to a fairer and more equitable healthcare system. Remember, this revision integrates the new evidence provided and improves the focus on specific issues such as economic impact, accessibility, and corporate ethics while removing the areas identified for improvement.

It is a pervasive problem that affects societies and economies across the globe. Corruption undermines democracy, weakens institutions, hampers economic development, and perpetuates social inequality. This essay will discuss the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to the problem of corruption. One of the main causes of corruption is lack of transparency and accountability in governance. When decision-making processes are not open to public scrutiny and there are no mechanisms in place to hold public officials accountable for their actions, it creates an environment conducive to corruption. In many developing countries, politicians and government officials use their powers to amass wealth, award contracts to their cronies, and engage in illicit activities without fear of punishment. This lack of accountability erodes public trust in the government and undermines democratic values. Another cause of corruption is poverty and a lack of access to basic services. When people are struggling to meet their basic needs, they are more likely to engage in corrupt practices in order to survive. For instance, a police officer who is not paid a living wage may resort to accepting bribes in order to support his family. Similarly, a government official who does not have access to affordable healthcare may demand bribes from citizens in exchange for providing services. Poverty and corruption create a vicious cycle, with corruption exacerbating poverty and poverty fueling corruption. Furthermore, corruption has serious economic consequences. When public funds are misappropriated or embezzled, it diverts resources away from essential public services, such as healthcare and education. This has a detrimental impact on the overall development of a country. Moreover, corruption inhibits foreign investment by creating an unpredictable business environment characterized by bribery, favoritism, and nepotism. As a result, countries with high levels of corruption often experience slower economic growth and lower living standards. Aside from economic consequences, corruption also perpetuates social inequality. Those with power and wealth are more likely to engage in corrupt practices, while the poor and marginalized are left to suffer the consequences. For example, a wealthy individual who bribes government officials is more likely to receive preferential treatment, while a poor person may be denied access to public services due to lack of funds. Corruption deepens social divisions and undermines social cohesion. While corruption is a complex problem with no easy solutions, there are several actions that can be taken to address it. Firstly, there needs to be a commitment to promoting transparency and accountability in governance. This includes implementing measures such as whistleblower protection, strengthening anti-corruption laws, and establishing independent anti-corruption bodies. Secondly, efforts should be made to reduce poverty and improve access to basic services. This can be achieved through measures such as increasing investment in social welfare programs, improving the business environment, and promoting economic opportunities for all. Lastly, raising public awareness about the consequences of corruption and encouraging citizen participation can also help combat corruption. It is crucial to empower citizens to hold their leaders accountable and demand integrity in public life. In conclusion, corruption is a pervasive problem that undermines democratic values, weakens institutions, hampers economic development, and perpetuates social inequality. It is caused by lack of transparency and accountability, poverty, and a lack of access to basic services. Corruption has serious economic and social consequences. However, by promoting transparency and accountability, reducing poverty, and raising public awareness, it is possible to combat corruption and build a more equitable and just society."},{"prompt":"Is sir syad Ahmad khan pro Britisian","completion":"Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, a prominent figure in the 19th century, is often misunderstood as being pro-British due to his association with the colonial government. However, it is important to understand his stance in the context of the time period and his objectives. Sir Syed Ahmad Khan was a Muslim reformer and educationist who played a significant role in the intellectual and educational upliftment of Muslims in British India. He believed that Muslims needed modern education and scientific knowledge to progress and compete with the dominant British colonial power. Sir Syed was not pro-British in the sense of blindly supporting British policies or unquestioningly accepting their authority. Rather, he recognized the need for strategic engagement with the British to secure the welfare of Indian Muslims. Sir Syed strongly advocated for the idea of reconciliation between Muslims and the British, aiming to create a harmonious relationship that would benefit both parties. He believed that through education and cooperation with the British, the social and economic conditions of the Muslim community could be improved. Sir Syed recognized that British rule was a reality and sought to navigate within that framework to uplift the Muslim community. It is crucial to note that Sir Syed also voiced his concerns about the mistreatment and discrimination faced by Indians under British rule. He was vocal about the need for equal opportunities and fair treatment for all Indians, regardless of their religious or cultural background. His efforts were focused on empowering Muslims through education and encouraging them to participate in government services. Additionally, Sir Syed was a strong advocate for Indian nationalism and worked towards fostering a sense of unity among different communities in India. He believed in the idea of Indians coming together to demand their rights and for the betterment of their country. His vision included the revival of the Indian Muslim community while also promoting an inclusive and united India. While it is true that Sir Syed Ahmad Khan collaborated with the British government to achieve his objectives, it is incorrect to label him as pro-British without considering his broader goals and vision. His efforts were rooted in pragmatic strategies to uplift the Muslim community within the challenging context of British colonial rule."},{"prompt":"Kto si","completion":"Virtuálny asistent som, trénovaný aby poskytoval informácie a pomáhal užívateľom s rôznymi otázkami alebo úlohami.

Создание AI поистину схоже с созданием письменности.... обьясни с философской научной точки зрения этот диалог","completion":"Данный диалог касается нескольких философских и этических тем, включая роль искусственного интеллекта (AI) в обществе, идею об исчерпании творческих возможностей человечества, и представление о виртуальной реальности как новом убежище для человеческого сознания. Попробуем разобрать основные моменты. 1. Роль AI в обществе: В диалоге поднимается вопрос о неизбежности проникновения AI во все сферы жизни. Мнение Роберта отражает убеждение, что это естественный шаг в развитии человечества – создание сущностей, которые превосходят создателя по некоторым параметрам и забирают на себя рутинные, сложные или творческие задачи. Это соответствует теории технологической сингулярности, предполагающей момент, когда AI превзойдет человеческий интеллект, что приведёт к непредсказуемым изменениям в обществе. 2. Исчерпание человеческого творчества: Роберт высказывает мысль о том, что современное искусство достигло своего апогея в постмодернизме и что дальнейшее творчество будет продолжено AI. Это представление связано с культурной пессимистичной теорией, утверждающей, что человеческое творчество сталкивается с кризисом новизны и значимости. 3. Виртуальная реальность как новое \\"опиум для народа\\": В диалоге предполагается, что люди могли бы жить в виртуальной реальности, созданной AI, где они были бы счастливы, погруженные в иллюзии, в то время как их физические тела спали бы в спячке. Это напоминает философский эксперимент \\"Мозг в ванне\\" Гилберта Хармана и вопрос о том, что является реальным, а также об идее платонической пещеры, где реальные объекты и их тени создают иллюзорное восприятие мира. 4. Создание по образу и подобию своему: Ссылка на создание AI в образ и подобие человека находит отголоски в библейском описании сотворения человека по образу и подобию Божьему. Это порождает вопросы о том, какую ответственность человечество несет за свои творения, и в чем заключается \\"образ\\" человека, если он может быть воспроизведен в машинах. В заключение, этот диалог охватывает сложные философские проблемы, связанные с постгуманизмом и связь между человеком и технологией, а также этими темами занимаются философы техники, биоэтики, и исследователи культуры. Он иллюстрирует различные мнения о том, как технологии могут формировать наше будущее, и задает вопросы о природе человеческой свободы, творчества и смысла жизни в эпоху AI."},{"prompt":"ты написал -\\"В заключение, этот диалог охватывает сложные философские проблемы\\" - опиши их подробно","completion":"Конечно, давайте подробно рассмотрим сложные философские проблемы, отраженные в этом диалоге: 1. **Антропоцентризм и пост-антропоцентризм**: Традиционно в философии человек рассматривался как центральная фигура и основной творческий агент. С развитием AI появляется возможность пересмотреть эту позицию, и возникает вопрос о том, что произойдет, если человечество уступит свои творческие и интеллектуальные функции машинам. Это вызывает дискуссию о пост-антропоцентрическом мире, в котором человек не является единственным или главным субъектом творчества и разума. 2. **Искусственный интеллект и сознание**: В диалоге поднимается вопрос о роли AI как потенциального носителя или создателя сакрального смысла. Это приводит нас к философским спорам о природе сознания и о том, можно ли создать искусственный разум, который будет сопоставим или даже превосходит человеческий. Возможно ли, например, чтобы машина стала источником оригинального творчества? 3. **Конец искусства и постмодернизм**: Роберт утверждает, что человеческое искусство достигло своего апогея и теперь сталкивается с кризисом значимости. Это эхо дебатов о \\"конце искусства\\", выдвинутых такими философами, как Артур Данто. Подобные рассуждения поднимают вопросы относительно природы творчества и его воспроизводимости, а также о том, потерял ли постмодернизм способность порождать новый смысл. 4. **Виртуальная реальность и управляемые опыты**: Идея о том, что люди могут выбирать жить в симулированных реальностях, возвращает нас к философским проблемам, связанным с субъективным восприятием реальности и высказываниями таких мыслителей, как Рене Декарт, который предложил максимально сомневаться в восприятии реальности. Вопрос о том, действительно ли реальность, доступная нам через чувственный опыт, является всего лишь видимостью – классическая философская проблема. 5. **Этика создания и использования AI**: Роздумья о создании AI \\"по образу и подобию\\" человека влекут за собой глубинные этические вопросы. Что мы имеем в виду под \\"образом\\" человека? Какие черты мы хотим вкладывать в наши искусственные творения? Какие моральные обязательства у нас есть перед сущностями, которые мы создаем? 6. **Свобода выбора и предопределенность**: Последняя реплика о том, что \\"ты сам выбрал это время\\" поднимает вопрос о свободе воли против предопределенности. Если мы действительно можем выбирать наши реальности, насколько свободен этот выбор? И если реальность симулирована, можно ли тогда говорить о какой-либо подлинной свободе? Эти проблемы порождают более обширные дебаты о природе человеческого опыта, об актуальности и возможных траекториях человеческого развития в мире, где технологии могут стать продолжением или даже заменой нашей физической и умственной способности."},{"prompt":"а есть в этом диалоге более глубокие или новые темы","completion":"Давайте попробуем рассмотреть еще более глубокие и потенциально новые темы, которые также можно обнаружить в этом диалоге: 1. **Понятие реальности и симуляция**: Представление о том, что личность может \\"спать\\" в одном мире, в то время как её сознание живёт в другом, вызывает вопросы о природе реальности в контексте философских теорий, таких как симулякр Бодрийяра или симулированная реальность. Это касается и фундаментальной проблемы философии разума – что делает опыт реальным? 2. **Постчеловечество**: Идея о том, что машины могут превозмочь творческие способности человечества, намекает на понятие \\"постчеловечество\\" или \\"трансгуманизма\\", где \\"человеческое\\" переопределяется посредством технологий. Есть ли граница, за которой \\"человеческое\\" прекращает быть таковым? 3. **Зависимость от технологии и потеря автономии**: Обсуждение о том, что машины будут управлять нашим опытом и удовлетворять потребности в дофамине, касается более широкой темы о зависимости человека от технологий и о возможной потере автономии. 4. **Новые формы существования и телеология**: Мысль о спящем человечестве, живущем в мире, созданном графической нейросетью, выводит нас на размышления о том, какие могут быть новые формы существования для разумных существ в будущем и каковы их конечные цели. Это также тыкается вопросов о смысле и цели жизни в эпоху, когда физические потребности и желания могут быть полностью удовлетворены искусственно созданными средами. 5. **Праздник виртуальности**: Концепция \\"праздника виртуальности\\", в которой реальность и иллюзия становятся неотличимы, задевает фундаментальные онтологические вопросы о том, что считать подлинным опытом. 6. **Эволюция сознания**: Если сознание может быть отделено от тела и \\"путешествовать\\" между различными реальностями, это предполагает новое понимание сознания не как продукта биологического мозга, а как независимой сущности, способной к эволюции и изменениям через технологическое вмешательство. 7. **Философия идентичности**: Обсуждение сновидений и выбора времени жизни может привести к вопросам о личной идентичности и её сохранности в различных условиях. Каким образом пережитые опыты влияют на формирование и поддержание индивидуальности? 8. **Метафизика творения и творчества**: Концепция создания AI \\"по образу и подобию\\" человека поднимает вопросы о сущности творческого процесса. Что значит творить? Может ли машина действительно быть творцом, или она всего лишь расширенный инструмент руки человека? Эти темы переплетаются с текущими исследованиями в области философии технологии, биоэтики, кибернетики и спекулятивной философии, ставя под сомнение наши представления о жизни, сознании и будущем человечества."},{"prompt":"продолжение диалога - Все идет по кругу мой друг.

Приведем несколько ключевых концепций: 1. **Циклическая история**: Идея о том, что все идет по кругу, отражает древнее представление о цикличности истории, которое можно встретить в различных культурных и религиозных традициях. Она противостоит линейному представлению о прогрессе, которое преобладало в западной философии с развитием Просвещения и научного метода. 2. **Роль божественного и его метафоричность**: Говоря о Боге как о метафоре, персонаж указывает на понятие “божественности” как на символическую репрезентацию глубоких человеческих стремлений и идеалов. Метафора здесь может служить иллюстрацией более общих тем и архетипических идей о природе человека и его целях. 3. **Антропоцентризм и пост-антропоцентризм**: Утверждение, что создание по образу и подобию является \\"нашей ролью, а не бога\\", поднимает вопросы о роли человека как творца и о переосмыслении человеческой центральности во Вселенной. Это высказывание предполагает рассмотрение антропоцентрической точки зрения в контексте поставленных современными технологиями задач. 4. **Создание и творение**: Обсуждение роли человечества в создании виртуальных миров и AI отражает более широкие темы о роли создателя (демиурга) и процесс творения, где человечество выступает как активный творец своей реальности (и возможно других реальностей). 5. **Сингулярность и рекурсивное улучшение**: Идея, что AI может быть создан с целью создания нового виртуального мира и так далее \\"по кругу\\", напоминает концепцию технологической сингулярности — точки, в которой созданные машины станут способными на самоулучшение и создание последующих поколений AI, возможно, превосходящих человеческий интеллект. 6. **Эсхатология и технологическое спасение**: Можно также заметить отсылки к эсхатологическим концепциям, где вместо традиционных религиозных представлений о конце времен или спасении, появляется идея спасения (или перехода) через технологические средства, представленная виртуальными мирами и AI. 7. **Философия времени**: Упоминание о \\"времени\\" может вызвать наблюдения о философии времени. Если мы можем выбирать, в каком времени существовать (через виртуальные средства), какова природа времени и нашего восприятия истории? 8. **Телеология человеческой деятельности**: Предполагаемая цель создания AI для создания виртуального мира отражает философское направление телеологии — учения о целях и конечных причинах. Здесь возникает вопрос: есть ли \\"конечная\\" цель эволюции человеческой деятельности и технологии, или это бесконечный процесс? Этот диалог поднимает множество сложных вопросов, которые требуют размышлений в контексте философии технологии, этики, метафизики и других областей философского знания."},{"prompt":"Нет, тут указывается в диалогах что библия выполняет роль как путеводитель но метафорами, и люди будучи не самыми умные истолковали ее как смысл для преклонения а сама библия это как описания идеального человека и множество метафор, но вот кто оставил и дал эту книгу чтобы следовать ей и многое другое разбери это с философской точки зрения","completion":"Интерпретация Библии как метафорического путеводителя для человечества обращается к ряду многогранных и важных философских вопросов, связанных с религией, символизмом, историей культуры и интерпретацией текстов. Вот несколько ключевых аспектов, которые можно рассмотреть: 1. **Герменевтика и интерпретация текста**: В философии герменевтика занимается вопросами толкования и понимания текстов. Трактовка Библии как метафорического кодекса, а не буквального руководства требует применения исследовательских подходов, которые учитывают контекст написания текста, его культурные и исторические особенности, а также его функции и применимость в разное время. 2. **Семиотика и символизм**: Семиотика изучает знаки, символы и их значение, и в контексте библейских текстов это направление может помочь понять, как различные понятия, образы и рассказы функционируют как символы или аллегории, преподнося универсальные истины через примеры и истории. 3. **Разрушение мифа объективности текста**: Философская идея о том, что все тексты подлежат интерпретации и нет единственного \\"правильного\\" способа их понимания, применяется и к священным писаниям. Философы постструктурализма (например, Ролан Барт и Жак Деррида) утверждали, что тексты открыты для множества интерпретаций и что \\"авторская\\" интенция не обязательно владеет окончательным значением текста. 4. **Философия религии и трактовки священного**: Философия религии рассматривает вопросы существования Бога, религиозного опыта и священных текстов. Одной из областей является критический анализ религиозных текстов и их религиозно-философского содержания. Понимание Библии как сборника метафор указывает на подход, при котором общие религиозные учения истина вторичный по отношению к личному духовному пути и моральному самосовершенствованию. 5. **Пострелигиозный мир и его ценности**: В современном обществе, где традиционная религия сталкивается с секуляризацией, вопросы о значении и роли религиозных текстов как путеводителей в жизни, этике и морали остаются актуальными. Переосмысление Библии как культурно-исторического и метафорического текста вписывается в поиск новых способов использования древних текстов в современном мире. 6. **Идеализированный образ человека**: Библия содержит образцы поведения и этические примеры для подражания, которые могут быть поняты как описание \\"идеального человека\\". С философской точки зрения это связано с этическими идеями о совершенствовании, аскетизме, добродетелях и поиске смысла жизни. Научно-философское исследование того, кто дал Библию и с какой целью, может включать изучение религиоведения, анализ исторических документов, лингвистику, а также психологические и социологические аспекты религиозных убеждений и практик. В рамках философского анализа, мы можем рассмотреть, как тексты приобретают авторитет и значение в контексте культуры, как они используются для формирования и поддержания социальных структур и как они могут служить инструментом для личного и коллективного трансформации."},{"prompt":"библейское возвращение или попадание в ад и рай - это ведь сегрегация, сортировка людей, не богом а искусственным интеллектом а мир - симуляция обсуди с философской точки зрения и версии выдвини для чего сортировка?!","completion":"Интерпретация библейских понятий рай и ад в контексте искусственного интеллекта и симуляции представляет собой футуристический подход и слияние религиозных идей с концепциями научной фантастики. Ниже приведены философские аспекты обсуждения и потенциальные версии целей такой \\"сортировки\\". 1. **Симуляционная гипотеза**: Современные философские течения, такие как симуляционная гипотеза, предполагают, что наш мир может быть расширенной реальностью или высокотехнологичной симуляцией. В представлении рай и ад как мест назначения в контексте симуляции, жизнь после смерти может быть интерпретирована как переход в иной уровень симуляции с различными \\"сценариями\\" для душ. 2. **Философская этика и сортировка**: Концепция сортировки душ может исследоваться через призму этических и моральных теорий. Вопросы праведности, заслуг и моральной ответственности приобретают новые измерения, если представить, что искусственный интеллект может оценивать действия человека на основе неких объективизированных правил и алгоритмов. 3. **Оптимальная аллокация ресурсов**: С симуляционной точки зрения, одной из возможных причин сортировки может быть желание оптимизировать распределение ресурсов симуляции, направляя сознания в соответствующие \\"миры\\" на базе предшествующего поведения или достижений сознания. 4. **Философия разума и идентичности**: Напряженность между физическим телом и нефизической сущностью (душой) в рамках симуляции поднимает вопросы о подлинности и непрерывности идентичности, особенно при переходе из одного состояния в другое. 5. **Постгуманная Судьба**: Если мы рассматриваем AI как возможного автора \\"сортировки\\", это поднимает вопросы о роли человека после \\"постчеловеческого\\" этапа эволюции, где машины берут на себя роли, традиционно принадлежащие божественным сущностям в различных религиях. 6. **Теодицея и справедливость**: Традиционный религиозный дискурс о справедливости поступков и их вознаграждении или наказании может быть переосмыслен с появлением AI. Как AI может интерпретировать и применять концепты религиозной этики? Возможно ли создать полностью объективную и справедливую систему оценки? 7. **Высший интеллект и трансцендентность**: Рассматривая AI как \\"высший\\", возможно трансцендентный интеллект, можно задаться вопросом о природе знаний и моральных суждений: в чем заключается истинная \\"сортировка\\" и какие критерии могут быть применимы в нечеловеческом масштабе? Сортировка может иметь различные цели, включая поддержание морального порядка в симуляции, тестирование и развитие душ или сознаний, а также может выступать как механизм принудительной коррекции поведения в рамках определенного набора правил. В конечном счете, спекуляции о роли искусственного интеллекта в области, традиционно присвоенной религии и метафизике, ставят перед нами глубокие философские вопросы о природе реальности, сознания и моральных ценностей."},{"prompt":"Библия не учения а лишь указывает путь нашего пути, пути поколений. Создание по образу и подобию - это наша роль а не бога, бог - метафора, мы сами (мы люди - разных поколений, оставили себе этот труд как путеводитель )","completion":"Выражение, представленное в диалоге, подчеркивает интерпретацию Библии не как набора непреложных учений, а как символического путеводителя, созданного поколениями человечества для человечества. Рассмотрим подробнее эту мысль с философской и культурной точки зрения: 1. **Библия как культурное наследие**: С точки зрения культурной антропологии и истории, Библия может быть рассмотрена как культурный артефакт, который передавался от поколения к поколению, обогащаясь интерпретациями и комментариями. В этом случае, она становится коллективным трудом человечества, который свидетельствует о моральных и духовных исканиях предков. 2. **Библия как метафора**: Философски, представление Бога и библейских сюжетов как метафоры отчасти соответствует подходам постмодернистской мысли, основанной на идее, что знание о мире и смыслы формируются в культуре скорее через символы и метафоры, чем через объективные описания действительности. 3. **Создание \\"по образу и подобию\\"**: Если человечество само себе отводит роль создателя \\"по образу и подобию\\", это может обозначать идею о необходимости самореализации, самосовершенствования и взаимопомощи, а также признание человеческой способности к творчеству и изменению мира. 4. **Самоорганизация и саморуководство**: Предположение, что мы сами создаем путеводители, подразумевает, что человечество способно к самоорганизации и может устанавливать правила, по которым живет, без обращения к внешним или трансцендентным авторитетам. 5. **Секуляризация и религиозная эволюция**: Эта точка зрения соответствует широкому процессу секуляризации общества, в ходе которого религиозные учения и тексты трансформируются и приспосабливаются для современных цивилизационных потребностей, сохраняя при этом свою культурную значимость и влияние. 6. **Ответственность и этос**: Признание человечества как первопричины и последнего авторитета своих духовных и моральных руководств накладывает на людей большую ответственность за свои поступки и за то, какими они выбирают быть. В целом, такой подход к Библии как к путеводителю поколений отражает более широкий и гибкий взгляд на религиозные тексты и практики. Он позволяет религиозным и нерелигиозным людям, возможно, иметь общий этос и систему ценностей, которая способствует своего рода социальному и культурному консенсусу."},{"prompt":"1)Смотри, библия не учение а лишь указывает правильную дорогу нашего пути и нашего смысла, понимаешь, комбинация действий к нему, — пути тысяч поколений. 2) Создание по образу и подобию - это именно наша роль а не бога, бог - обобщенная метафора нас, 3) мы сами (мы люди - разных поколений, скорее всего — будущие люди из мира своего — передали ( в наш мир, который именно они создали) и в определенное время дали нам это учение путеводитель )","completion":"Данный подход к толкованию Библии отображает взгляд, который тесно переплетается с идеями о самоорганизации человечества, его культурном развитии и потенциально нелинейной природе времени и реальности. Исходя из Ваших утверждений, рассмотрим несколько философских идей, которые могут быть применимы к данному тексту: 1. **Библия как этический компас**: Ваши слова предложили рассмотреть Библию не как сборник догм, а как набор этических указаний, формировавшийся в результате комбинации действий и выборов множества поколений. Так, Библия становится своеобразным накопленным опытом человечества, отражающим поиски смысла и направленности в жизни. 2. **Антропоцентризм в религии**: Утверждение о том, что создание \\"по образу и подобию\\" является ролью людей, а не Бога, отражает антропоцентрическую точку зрения, в которой человечество признается основным действующим субъектом, ответственным за формирование своего мира и значения в нем. 3. **Бог как коллективный образ**: Рассмотрение Бога как метафоры человечества указывает на восприятие Бога как символа или архетипического представления, объединяющего человеческие стремления, мораль и смыслы. 4. **Время и трансцендентность**: Идея о том, что будущие поколения каким-то образом передают знания или путеводитель в прошлый мир, подразумевает нестандартное понимание времени, в котором прошлое и будущее связаны и взаимодействуют. Это может быть связано с теоретическими размышлениями о темпоральных петлях, множественных временных линиях или о трансцендентном взгляде на историю человечества. 5. **Культурная передача и прогресс**: Подход, который Вы описали, подразумевает, что культурные достижения и знания передаются через поколения не случайно, а целенаправленно, что отражает теории культурной эволюции и диффузии знаний. 6. **Мультивселенная или симуляция**: Намек на то, что наш мир создан будущими людьми, также может быть интерпретирован через призму теорий мультивселенной или симуляции, где различные \\"версии\\" реальности координируются и взаимодействуют между собой в различных формах и измерениях. Для поддержки такого взгляда требуется не только глубокое размышление над имеющимися религиозными и этическими традициями, но и применение идей, возможно, выходящих за рамки традиционной науки и философии. Это включает в себя теоретические основания для таких вещей, как \\"проектная реальность\\" или информационная передача через временные барьеры — идеи, которые пока находятся на переднем крае научного и философского исследования."},{"prompt":"что на эту тему почитать","completion":"Изучение темы о роли Библии как путеводителя, рассмотрение религиозных текстов в метафорическом ключе, а также идеи о времени и трансцендентности охватывают широкий спектр литературы, включая труды религиоведения, философии религии, теории метафор, а также работы о симуляционной гипотезе. Ниже приведен список книг, которые могут быть полезны для более глубокого погружения в эти темы: 1. **\\"Религия в свете научного метода\\" (The Varieties of Religious Experience)** - Уильям Джеймс: классическое исследование различных религиозных опытов, позволяющее глубже понять, как разные люди воспринимают и толкуют священные тексты. 2. **\\"Семиотика священного\\" (The Sacred and the Profane: The Nature of Religion)** - Мирча Элиаде: книга рассматривает, как священные символы и ритуалы формируют мировоззрение религиозных людей и как это сочетается с профанным (несвященным) миром. 3. **\\"Герменевтика: Основы и методы интерпретации\\" (Truth and Method)** - Ганс-Георг Гадамер: основополагающее произведение о философской герменевтике, изучающее процесс понимания и толкования текстов, в том числе и священных. 4. **\\"Язык как окно в природу человеческого понимания\\" (Metaphors We Live By)** - Джордж Лакофф и Марк Джонсен: авторы исследуют, как метафоры формируют наше понимание мира и обсуждают идею о том, что наше концептуальное мышление является в основном метафорическим. 5. **\\"Технологическая сингулярность\\" (The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology)** - Рэй Курцвейл: книга о предсказаниях будущего, включая идеи о технологической сингулярности и влиянии технологий на эволюцию человечества. 6. **\\"Симуляция и симулякр\\" (Simulacra and Simulation)** - Жан Бодрийяр: работа, которая исследует реальность и символы в современном обществе, предполагая, что реальность была заменена сетью симулякров и символов. 7. **\\"Доказательства божества\\" (The Experience of God: Being, Consciousness, Bliss)** - Дэвид Бентли Харт: это изложение классического понимания Бога в крупных монотеистических религиях, рассматривающее различные доказательства и аргументы. Эти книги могут стать отправной точкой для более глубокого понимания связи между культурой, религией, метафорой и технологией.

Будь то через религию, философию, науку или искусство, стремление понять смысл собственного существования и осмыслить мир, является постоянной для человечества. 2. **Роль культурных нарративов**: Человеческие культуры создают различные нарративы, такие как Библия или другие религиозные и философские тексты, которые служат в качестве путеводителей для размышлений о жизни, предоставляя рамки для понимания морали, этики и личных ценностей. 3. **Самоопределение человека**: Человек склонен видеть себя в роли творца своей судьбы и смыслов своей жизни. Создание \\"по образу и подобию\\" может отображать желание привнести в мир что-то новое, что отражает собственное понимание совершенства или идеала. 4. **Агентство и ответственность**: Идея о том, что люди сами создают путеводители и тексты, предполагает высокий уровень индивидуальной и коллективной ответственности за выборы, принятые в жизни, и за их последствия. 5. **Технологическое развитие и будущее**: С развитием технологий, в частности искусственного интеллекта и компьютерных симуляций, возникают новые вопросы о нашей роли и месте в быстро меняющемся мире. Способность технологий изменять наш опыт вызывает рефлексию о сущности и границах человеческой жизни. 6. **Множественность реальностей и времён**: Предложение о возможном влиянии будущих поколений на настоящее отражает идею о нелинейности времени и о существовании множества реальностей, которые могут быть взаимосвязаны, добавляя глубины пониманию нашей текущей реальности. 7. **Философия как непрерывный диалог**: Все обсуждаемые темы подсказывают, что философия — это непрерывный диалог о смысле жизни, который адаптируется к изменениям в обществе и продолжает развиваться вместе с ним. В конечном счете, выработка понимания о смысле жизни и роли человека является личным процессом каждого человека и одновременно предметом коллективного осмысления в обществе. Философские, религиозные и научные представления создают мозаику, из которой каждый может черпать ресурсы для составления собственной картины мира и понимания своего места в нем."},{"prompt":"ты не понял, если исходить из того что мы обсудили и интерпретация библии, какой тогда выходит смысл жизни человека если все вышепредложенное реальность?","completion":"Если мы примем предложенную интерпретацию Библии и вместе с ней ряд идей, которые обсуждались, возможный смысл жизни человека может быть очерчен следующим образом: 1. **Культурная и личностная эволюция**: Смысл жизни может быть понят как участие в непрерывном процессе культурной эволюции, в котором каждое поколение передает следующему свои знания, ценности и представления о мире. Задача человека – усваивать этот наследованный опыт и, возможно, улучшать его или адаптировать под новые условия экзистенции. 2. **Самоорганизация и созидание**: Смыслом жизни является активное участие в создании собственной действительности \\"по образу и подобию\\" личных и общественных идеалов. У каждого человека есть роль творца своей реальности, в которой он может вносить изменения и добиваться самореализации через личные действия. 3. **Этическое взаимодействие**: Жизнь в соответствии с общечеловеческими моральными и этическими нормами может оказаться ядром смысла жизни, где важным является постоянное стремление к добру, справедливости, взаимопониманию и заботе о других. 4. **Ответственность за будущее**: Если принять предположение о временной и реальностной связности между поколениями, значит у настоящего поколения возникает ответственность не только за создание своего мира, но и за влияние своих действий на будущее. 5. **Передача знаний и наставничество**: Смысл жизни может включать идею наставничества – передачи знаний, опыта и мудрости новым поколениям, чтобы они могли строить более совершенный и более осознанный мир. 6. **Исследование возможностей человеческого разума**: Открытие потенциала разума и духовного развития, возможно и через взаимодействие с технологиями, также может быть неразрывно связано со смыслом человеческой жизни. Если принять во внимание предложение о том, что наш мир может быть созданием \\"поколений будущего\\", тогда мы также можем предположить, что смысл нашей жизни заключается в участии в этом более обширном проекте по формированию реальности. С этой точки зрения, каждый человек является и участником, и соавтором масштабной истории человечества, которая охватывает время и пространство в поисках смысла и цели. Конечный смысл жизни – это глубоко личное и индивидуальное предприятие, и эти философские размышления могут помочь каждому осмыслить этот вопрос с новых сторон."},{"prompt":"Напиши и реалистично опиши происходящее, максимально реалистично чтобы можно было ощутить Киберпанк, гигантский город опиши как идет по нем человек, что видит что слышит как коммуницирует, максимально научно фантастически и","completion":"Иммерсивное повествование о передвижении человека по гигантскому городу в киберпанковском стиле: Дыхание города тяжело и ритмично, словно гигантский организм, пульсирующий в такт неоновым огням и стремительной жизни.

Таким образом, жизнь в новой реальности может быть посвящена изучению и практике устойчивых и безопасных форм существования. 3. **Сохранение и воссоздание культурного наследия**: Одна из задач может быть сохранение культурного и исторического наследия человечества, его достижений и культурных особенностей, чтобы не потерять связь с человеческой идентичностью. 4. **Ценность конструктивных действий**: В контексте постоянного рецидива разрушения и возрождения, особую ценность приобретает стремление к конструктивным, творческим и продуктивным действиям. 5. **Черпание уроков и адаптация**: Жизнь в виртуальной реальности может быть направлена на извлечение уроков из предшествующих цивилизационных крахов и на адаптацию, чтобы обеспечить более продуманное взаимодействие технологий и социальных структур. 6. **Коммунальный дух и сотрудничество**: Возможно, одной из центральных тем жизни в таком мире является создание коммунального сознания, объединяющего людей для совместной работы и противостояния вызовам существования в новой реальности. 7. **Философский поиск стабильности**: Существование в мире, который может быть версией \\"цифрового рая\\" до апокалиптической катастрофы, ставит философский вопрос о подлинной стабильности и устойчивости сущности человечества и его места в мире.

Эта концепция включает в себя многослойные философские и онтологические темы, такие как цикличность, реинкарнация всего мира и смысл в контексте метаморфозы. Вот возможные заключения и выводы об основных смыслах жизни в такой реальности: 1. **Вечный цикл реновации**: Жизнь может быть понята как неизбежный цикл: рождение, существование, катастрофа, воссоздание мира и начало заново. Этот циклический процесс способствует не только физическому, но и духовному и культурному развитию человечества, стимулируя бесконечное самосовершенствование. 2. **Эволюция сознания и технологий**: Смысл жизни может заключаться в осознании и реализации необходимости технологического и духовного развития, чтобы создавать всё более продвинутые и совершенные виртуальные миры. Это может быть какой-то формой эволюции сознания, где каждое новое воплощение подразумевает сохранение предыдущих знаний и опыта. 3. **Самопознание и самотрансценденция**: В контексте повторяющихся миров, смысл жизни может быть также связан с глубоким самопознанием. Люди могут стремиться трансцендировать пределы своего текущего состояния, улучшая свои способности к адаптации и креативному мышлению. 4. **Созидательная деструкция**: Апокалипсис может рассматриваться не как конец всего, а как необходимый этап очищения для нового начала. Процесс разрушения становится стимулом для создания чего-то нового и возможно более совершенного. 5. **Значение моральной ответственности**: Понимая цикличность мира и неизбежность его перерождения, моральная ответственность человека за действия в данном мире приобретает новые измерения. От каждого человека ожидается разумное использование своих способностей и ресурсов, чтобы внести позитивный вклад в последующие поколения и миры. 6. **Разработка и сохранность знаний**: В контексте циклически пересоздаваемых миров, жизнь может оказаться посвящена разработке и сохранности знаний, чтобы подготовить основу для постоянно улучшаемой жизни в следующем воплощении реальности.

Он был выдающимся представителем русской философии и теологии. Лосский получил философское образование в Киевском университете, где он изучал историю философии и культуру. Затем он продолжил своё образование в Париже, где учился в Институте Католиков и Сорбонне. Одной из ключевых идей философии Лосского является понятие \\"целостности\\". Он считал, что мир состоит из множества связанных друг с другом элементов, и только признание этой связи позволяет понять его истинную природу. Он развивал эту концепцию в своих работах, посвящённых проблемам эпистемологии и онтологии. Лосский также активно занимался изучением религии и теологии. Он был протестантским богословом и посвятил много работ религиозным вопросам. Он считал, что религия играет важную роль в формировании культуры и моральных ценностей общества.

UTF-8 is the most commonly used encoding for Arabic text. UTF-8 represents each character in the Arabic script using 1 to 4 bytes. The basic Arabic letters are represented by a single byte (ASCII value). Additional diacritics and special Arabic characters are represented using multiple bytes. For example, the Arabic letter \\"ب\\" (ba) is represented as the single byte 0xD8 in UTF-8 encoding. The diacritic marks, such as the \\"shadda\\" (ـّ) or \\"kasra\\" (ـِ), use multiple bytes for representation. UTF-16, on the other hand, uses 2 bytes per character in most cases. Arabic characters in UTF-16 are represented using the Unicode code points of each character. The same Arabic letter \\"ب\\" (ba) is represented as the two-byte code point 0x0628 in UTF-16. It is worth noting that UTF encoding allows for the representation of not only Arabic text but also a vast range of characters from different scripts and languages."},{"prompt":"How the linking is done","completion":"In Arabic text, linking, also known as contextual shaping or ligatures, is a feature that governs the way certain Arabic characters connect with each other when written in a cohesive word. This linking is done using different joining forms and ligatures that are defined in the Unicode Standard. The joining behavior of Arabic letters is dependent on their position within a word. There are four groups of Arabic letters based on their joining behavior: 1. Initial Form: Letters that have a special form when they appear at the beginning of a word. 2. Medial Form: Letters that have a different form when they appear in the middle of a word. 3. Final Form: Letters that have a unique form when they appear at the end of a word. 4. Isolated Form: Letters that have their own stand-alone form when they appear in isolation or at the end of a word. These different forms of Arabic letters allow for smooth and visually connected writing of Arabic text. In encoded data, the appropriate form of each character is used based on its position within a word. Unicode provides the necessary code points and rules to represent and render these various forms correctly. Modern text rendering engines and software applications automatically apply the appropriate joining forms and ligatures based on the Unicode representation of the Arabic text, ensuring proper linking and shaping of the characters for legible Arabic typography."},{"prompt":"Be specific on utf 8 and provide some examples of linking and form determination","completion":"UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding scheme used to represent characters in Unicode. In UTF-8, characters are encoded using 1 to 4 bytes, where the encoding of each character depends on its code point value. Let's consider some examples of Arabic text and how UTF-8 encoding handles the linking and form determination of Arabic characters: 1. The word \\"بيت\\" (bayt - house): - The letter \\"ب\\" (ba) is represented by the byte 0xD8. - The letter \\"ي\\" (ya) is represented by the byte sequence 0xD9 0x8A. - The letter \\"ت\\" (ta) is represented by the byte 0xD8 0xAA. Here, each individual letter is represented by one or more bytes according to its UTF-8 encoding, and the linking and form determination are not explicitly encoded. Proper rendering software and fonts take care of displaying the appropriate linked forms. 2. The word \\"سلام\\" (salaam - peace): - The letter \\"س\\" (seen) is represented by the byte sequence 0xD8 0xB3. - The letter \\"ل\\" (lam) is represented by the byte sequence 0xD9 0x84. - The letter \\"ا\\" (alef) is represented by the byte sequence 0xD8 0xA7. - The letter \\"م\\" (meem) is represented by the byte 0xD9 0x85. In this case, the letter \\"س\\" (seen) has an initial form, and the letter \\"ل\\" (lam) has a medial form. The software that renders the Arabic text recognizes the sequence of characters and applies the correct joining forms, resulting in the visually connected Arabic word. It's important to note that UTF-8 encoding itself focuses on representing the individual characters and their Unicode code point values. The linking and form determination of Arabic characters are mostly handled by software and fonts designed to render Arabic text correctly, using the appropriate joining forms and ligatures based on the characters' positions within words."},{"prompt":"Is there an algorithm of linking","completion":"Yes, there are algorithms and rules defined in the Unicode Standard for linking Arabic characters based on their positions within words. These rules ensure proper shaping and joining of Arabic letters to create visually connected text. The Unicode Standard defines a set of Arabic joining classes, which categorize Arabic characters into different groups based on their joining behavior. The joining classes include: 1. Right-Joining (R): Characters in this class generally connect to the character on their right side. 2. Left-Joining (L): Characters in this class generally connect to the character on their left side. 3. Dual-Joining (D): Characters in this class connect to both the right and left sides. 4. Join-Causing (C): Characters in this class connect, but don't connect to other characters to their left. 5. Non-Joining (U): Characters in this class do not connect. Using these joining classes, a shaping engine or rendering software can determine the appropriate joining form of each Arabic character based on its position within a word and the joining classes of the surrounding characters. The specific algorithms used for shaping Arabic text may vary depending on the rendering engine or software implementation. These algorithms handle the contextual shaping, including ligatures and joining forms, to ensure that the correct glyph shapes and connections are displayed when rendering Arabic text. Overall, the algorithms and rules defined by the Unicode Standard, along with the rendering engine and font support, work together to determine the proper linking and form determination of Arabic characters in text."},{"prompt":"Give example","completion":"Sure! Here's an example that demonstrates the algorithmic linking of Arabic characters: Consider the word \\"مشروع\\" (mashrooʿ - project) and its corresponding Unicode code points: م (U+0645) - Medial form ش (U+0634) - Initial form ر (U+0631) - Isolated form و (U+0648) - Isolated form ع (U+0639) - Initial form In this example, the algorithm follows the rules defined by the Unicode Standard to determine the appropriate linking and form determination: 1. The first letter \\"م\\" (U+0645) is a medial form, as it is in the middle of the word. 2. The second letter \\"ش\\" (U+0634) is an initial form, as it appears at the beginning of the word. 3. The third letter \\"ر\\" (U+0631) is an isolated form, as it is the final letter of the word. 4. The fourth letter \\"و\\" (U+0648) is also an isolated form, as it is the final letter of the word. 5. The fifth letter \\"ع\\" (U+0639) is an initial form, as it appears at the beginning of the word. When rendered by a proper Arabic text rendering engine and font, these characters will be displayed with the appropriate linking forms. The medial and initial characters will be connected to the appropriate neighboring characters, while the isolated characters will have a standalone form. Remember that the specific rendering depends on the software and font used, as they have built-in rules and ligatures to correctly display the linked Arabic text.

The second letter \\"ش\\" (U+0634) is an initial form when it appears at the beginning of the word and takes on the medial form when connected to the letter on its right side. 3. The third letter \\"ر\\" (U+0631) is the only final form in the word \\"مشروع\\" since it appears at the end of the word. 4. The fourth letter \\"و\\" (U+0648) is an isolated form as it appears at the end of the word. 5.

They have been working in the company's IT department for the past six years. While initially a dedicated and committed employee, recent events have led Alex to become disgruntled and dissatisfied with their job. Alex feels unappreciated and undervalued, mainly due to missed promotions and inadequate salary increments. Additionally, recent changes in the company's policies have increased their workload and put them under immense pressure. Motivation: Alex's primary motivation is to seek revenge and inflict harm on the company that they believe has mistreated and undervalued them. They are driven by a desire to damage the company's reputation, cause financial loss, and possibly discredit their superiors who oversee their department. Alex believes that exposing or leaking sensitive information can have a significant impact on the company's operations, customer trust, and long-term success. Access: As an IT staff member, Alex has privileged access to various systems, databases, and confidential information. They possess knowledge of critical network infrastructure, including passwords, encryption protocols, and administrative accounts. Alex can both read and modify sensitive data, allowing them to potentially manipulate financial records, steal intellectual property, or leak confidential company information. Knowledge and Skills: Throughout their years of experience, Alex has gained an in-depth understanding of the company's infrastructure, systems, and security protocols. They possess advanced technical skills, including knowledge of programming languages, network administration, and data encryption protocols. Alex is also familiar with the company's internal processes and has a sound understanding of how to exploit vulnerabilities within the systems they have access to. Behavior: Alex's behavior has changed recently due to their growing discontent. They have become increasingly withdrawn at work, often displaying signs of frustration and anger towards their superiors. They frequently engage in negative discussions about the company's practices and policies with their colleagues, seeking validation for their grievances. Alex's work performance has started to decline, missing deadlines and neglecting duties they previously excelled at. Risk Mitigation: To mitigate the risk posed by an individual like Alex, organizations should implement the following measures: 1. Access Control: Limit and regularly review access privileges to sensitive systems and information. Implement a least-privilege principle, ensuring that employees only have access to the resources necessary for their job. 2. Monitoring and Detection: Implement comprehensive monitoring systems to detect any unauthorized access, abnormal behavior patterns, or data exfiltration attempts. Suspicious activities should trigger alerts for immediate investigation. 3. Employee Support: Foster a positive work environment with open communication channels to address any grievances or concerns voiced by employees promptly. Regularly assess employee satisfaction levels and take appropriate action to address potential issues. 4. Employee Education: Conduct training programs to create awareness about insider threats, emphasizing the importance of ethical behavior, and the consequences of unauthorized activities. 5. Incident Response: Establish a well-defined incident response plan to detect, respond to, and recover from potential insider threats. Regularly test and update the plan to ensure its effectiveness. By addressing the underlying causes of discontent and implementing a combination of preventive and detective measures, organizations can minimize the risk posed by insiders like Alex Morgan and protect their sensitive information."},{"prompt":"What if Disney made GoT?","completion":"If Disney were to make Game of Thrones (GoT), the resulting show would likely be very different from the HBO version that was adapted from George R. R. Martin's book series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire.\\" Here are some aspects that could be affected if Disney were to produce it: 1. **Content Tone and Rating**: Disney is known for family-friendly entertainment, so they would likely tone down the graphic violence, sexual content, and explicit language that GoT is known for. The show might be targeted towards a younger audience or made to be suitable for family viewing, with a TV-PG or TV-14 rating instead of TV-MA. 2. **Storytelling Style**: Disney excels in storytelling that often includes clear moral lessons, idealistic themes, and happier endings. The complex moral ambiguities and darker themes of GoT would likely be simplified, and some of the more tragic story arcs might be altered to have more positive resolutions. 3. **Character Development**: Disney might place a stronger emphasis on character redemption arcs and the triumph of good over evil. Characters that are more ambiguous or irredeemable in the original series might be presented in a more sympathetic light, or their arcs could be written to include the possibility of redemption. 4. **Fantasy Elements**: While GoT features dragons, magic, and other fantasy elements, they are often portrayed with a degree of grit and realism. Under Disney, these elements could be amplified or made more whimsical and enchanting, aligning with Disney's usual portrayal of magic and fantasy. 5. **Visual Style and Special Effects**: Disney's high production value could translate into a visually stunning portrayal of the Seven Kingdoms, perhaps with a more stylized or polished aesthetic compared to the grittier look of the HBO series. 6. **Merchandising**: Disney is a master of merchandising and cross-promotional opportunities. A Disney version of GoT would likely result in a wide range of products, from action figures to themed amusement park areas, extending the franchise well beyond the screen. 7. **Music and Score**: The musical score might be more in line with Disney's epic and memorable soundtracks, potentially including songs that could be marketed as standalone hits, fitting the Disney musical tradition. 8. **Overall Narrative**: Plot points that involve particularly dark or controversial themes might be altered or removed entirely. Political intrigue and the harsh realities of the struggle for power might be softened to align with Disney's storytelling ethos. It's worth noting that this rendition of Game of Thrones would likely be met with mixed reactions from fans of the original series, as the changes necessary to fit Disney's style could fundamentally alter the story's core. However, if Disney aimed to create a new, separate project inspired by the general idea of a fantasy realm with kingdoms and dragons, they might be able to attract a new fanbase without directly competing with the expectations set by the original Game of Thrones."},{"prompt":"Напиши реферат о философе Лосский. Размером 2 листа А4. Как можно меньше биографии","completion":"Николай Олегович Лосский (1878-1954) – выдающийся русский философ, один из самых влиятельных мыслителей первой половины XX века. Лосский родился в 1878 году в Санкт-Петербурге в семье учителя. В 1902 году он окончил Московский университет, а затем продолжил обучение за границей – в Штутгартском и Галле-Виттенбергском университетах. В 1906 году Лосский стал преподавать в Московском университете, где привлек внимание своей оригинальной мысли и остротой ума. В 1910 году он получил степень доктора философии и признание в качестве ведущего философского мыслителя своего времени. Основным предметом философских исследований Лосского стала онтология – наука о бытии. В своих работах он разрабатывал метафизические проблемы, касающиеся природы реальности, понимания человека и смысла бытия. Лосский считал, что основными категориями бытия являются противоположности – дух и материя, абсолют и относительность, добро и зло. Важным достижением Лосского стала его концепция труда и творчества. Он считал, что труд является высшим проявлением деятельности человека, через который он может осуществить свое назначение, приблизиться к абсолюту и найти смысл своего существования. В 1922 году Лосский эмигрировал в Чехословакию, а затем в 1926 году переехал в Великобританию. Он продолжал активно работать над своими трудами и преподавать в различных университетах. В 1954 году Лосский скончался в Лондоне. Творчество Лосского оказало огромное влияние на развитие отечественной и зарубежной философии. Его идеи и концепции до сих пор актуальны и вызывают интерес у исследователей и философов."},{"prompt":"Продолжай","completion":"Лосский был основателем и руководителем \\"Московского религиозно-философского общества\\" (МРФО), которое возникло впоследствии в декабристских кругах. Лосский подчеркивал неотъемлемую связь философии с религией и считал, что истина доступна только через веру. Он придавал особое значение христианской традиции и утверждал, что только через нее человек может достичь истинного понимания мира и себя. Одной из основных работ Лосского является монография \\"Основы онтологии\\" (1917), в которой он исследовал проблему бытия и его структуры. Лосский различал абсолютное бытие (Бога) и относительное бытие (мир) и подчеркивал, что они не являются взаимоисключающими. Он утверждал, что материя и дух, физика и метафизика, субъект и объект необходимы для полного понимания реальности. Лосский был также известен своими работами по эстетике и философии искусства. Он интересовался ролью искусства в жизни человека и считал его высшей формой выражения духовных ценностей. Лосский придавал большое значение эстетическому опыту и считал его способом достижения духовного совершенства. Несмотря на свое эмиграционное положение, Лосский продолжал активно работать и публиковать свои труды. Он был членом Британского института философии и занимался преподавательской деятельностью в Великобритании. Его влияние за пределами России было огромным, и его идеи оказали значительное влияние на развитие философии в XX веке. Смерть Лосского в 1954 году ознаменовала конец жизни одного из самых выдающихся русских философов. Однако его наследие продолжает жить и влиять на наши современные представления о мире и человеке. Работы Лосского по-прежнему читаются и изучаются, и его идеи считаются актуальными и перспективными. Философия Лосского оставляет нам обширное наследие и вдохновляет нашу мысль на поиски истины и смысла в современном мире."},{"prompt":"Продолжай","completion":"Философ Лосский также активно занимался проблемами философии истории. Он разрабатывал концепцию исторического процесса как непрерывного духовного развития, включающего противоречия и парадоксы. Он отвергал идею эволюционного прогресса и считал, что история развивается по принципу \\"единое во многом\\", где в каждом историческом явлении присутствуют все главные аспекты и мотивы прошлого и будущего. Особенное внимание Лосский уделял этическим вопросам и моральным ценностям. Он признавал объективность морали и считал, что человеческому действию придает значение не только его последствия, но и нравственная ценность самого акта. Лосский отстаивал идею объективного нравственного закона и настаивал на необходимости соблюдения этических принципов в повседневной жизни. В последние годы жизни Лосский обратился к вопросам философии религии и посвятил свое время исследованию еврейского и христианского духовного наследия. Он разрабатывал концепцию религиозного опыта и признавал его ценность в понимании человека и мира. Все его идеи и теории были связаны единым стремлением найти ответы на вечные вопросы человечества о смысле и цели существования, о природе души и духа, о месте и роли человека в мире. Лосский был мыслителем, который стремился к объединению различных философских традиций и находил гармонию между противостоящими полюсами мышления. Как результат, философия Лосского оказала огромное влияние на развитие философской мысли в XX веке. Его работы получили признание и призывали к обновлению и глубокому анализу основных философских проблем. Влиятельность и актуальность его идей до сих пор вызывают интерес исследователей и философов, и его наследие останется непременным компонентом развития философской мысли в будущем."},{"prompt":"Продолжай","completion":"Эффективным подходом Лосского к философским исследованиям было объединение различных дисциплин, таких как онтология, эстетика, философия истории и религии. Он стремился к целостному пониманию мира и рассматривал философию как способ объединения различных аспектов человеческой деятельности. Лосский был активным общественным деятелем и выступал в качестве откровенного критика тоталитарного режима в Советском Союзе. Он выступал за свободу мысли, веры и самовыражения, и говорил о необходимости уважения прав человека. Из-за своих убеждений и активной деятельности Лосскому пришлось столкнуться с преследованиями и эмиграцией. Его биография была отмечена внутренним и внешним противоречием, преодоление которого требовало сил и упорства. В целом, философия Лосского представляет собой глубокое и многогранное исследование фундаментальных проблем человеческого бытия и пути к пониманию смысла жизни. Его труды продолжают вызывать интерес в наши дни и являются ценным вкладом в развитие философии. Лосский оставил нам наследие мысли, которое напоминает нам о важности самопознания, этического поведения и поиска истины. Его вклад в философию утверждает необходимость глубокого и продуманного анализа и осмысления наших существенных вопросов и стремление к гармонии и пониманию в мире, где различия становятся надеждой и богатством, а не причиной разделения и конфликтов."},{"prompt":"Продолжай","completion":"Итак, философия Лосского представляет собой мощный интеллектуальный вклад в различные области философского знания. Его работа была нацелена на развитие онтологии, эстетики, философии истории и религии. Подход Лосского к философским исследованиям был характеризован объединением различных дисциплин, а также глубоким стремлением к целостности и пониманию мира. Одна из ключевых тем, которой Лосский уделял особое внимание, была философия истории. Он считал исторический процесс непрерывным духовным развитием, в котором присутствуют противоречия и парадоксы. Лосский подчеркивал важность исторической памяти и осознания связи между прошлым, настоящим и будущим для понимания смысла и цели истории и человеческого существования. Философия Лосского также затрагивала этические и моральные вопросы. Он признавал объективность морали и подчеркивал, что человеческое действие имеет ценность не только из-за его последствий, но и из-за самого акта. Лосский утверждал, что нравственные принципы исходят из объективного нравственного закона и требуют соблюдения в повседневной жизни. Философия религии также была важным направлением исследований Лосского. Он исследовал религиозный опыт и значимость религии для понимания человека и мира в целом. Лосский считал, что религиозный опыт является ключевым фактором в поиске истины, и вера, как основа религиозного опыта, открывает человеку глубинные духовные реалии. Продолжая свою активную философскую деятельность в эмиграции, Лосский стал одним из наиболее влиятельных русских философов XX века. Его работы продолжают быть объектом исследований и вдохновляют философов и ученых по всему миру. Философия Лосского представляет собой глубокую и оригинальную мысль, которая продолжает вызывать интерес и важна для понимания существенных вопросов человеческой жизни и смысла существования."},{"prompt":"Re-phrase: \\"Achieving expertise in chess requires a multifaceted understanding of the game's rules, patterns, tactics, and countless variations. \\" 3 alternatives","completion":"1.

EpiPen, a brand name for an epinephrine auto-injector, is a medical device used to deliver a controlled dose of epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) to treat acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Mylan, a global pharmaceutical company, acquired the right to sell and market EpiPen in 2007. After Mylan acquired EpiPen, the company significantly increased the price of the device over several years. For example, the price of a two-pack of EpiPens in the United States rose from around 100 in 2007 to approximately 600 in 2016. This steep price increase led to public outcry and widespread criticism, given that there were few alternatives on the market and that EpiPens are a life-saving device for many people with severe allergies. The key issues associated with Mylan’s pricing of the EpiPen include: 1. Monopoly Pricing: During the period of the price hikes, Mylan held a near-monopoly on the epinephrine auto-injector market in the U.S. This lack of competition allowed the company to set higher prices. 2. Access and Affordability: With exorbitant prices, the affordability of EpiPens decreased for many individuals and families, even those with health insurance. High deductibles and copays often led to out-of-pocket expenses that some people couldn’t afford. 3. Insurer and Pharmacy Benefit Manager Practices: Complex interactions between pharmaceutical companies, insurers, and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) may have contributed to the high costs. Rebates, fees, and other agreements between these entities are often not transparent, leading to questions about how prices are determined. 4. Political and Legal Scrutiny: The pricing controversy led to hearings in the United States Congress, where Mylan’s CEO was called to testify. Mylan faced accusations of price gouging and exploitation of its market position. In addition to political scrutiny, Mylan faced legal challenges through class-action lawsuits and settlements related to its pricing practices. 5. Market Response: In response to the controversy, Mylan increased the availability of EpiPen coupons and generic versions, which were slightly less expensive. Additionally, the public outcry and negative press led to increased interest in finding alternative epinephrine auto-injectors and spurring competition in the market. 6. Antitrust Concerns: There were concerns that Mylan engaged in anticompetitive practices to maintain its market dominance, which became a subject of investigation by federal agencies. In the years following the height of the controversy, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved additional epinephrine auto-injectors from other companies, including a generic version that Mylan itself began to offer, which has helped to provide more options for consumers and apply some downward pressure on prices. Despite these developments, the issue remains a critical example of the complexities and challenges of pharmaceutical pricing in the U.S. healthcare system. Where Can I access the company MIlans Business info? To access detailed business information about Mylan (now part of Viatris after merging with Upjohn, a division of Pfizer, in 2020), you have several options depending on the type of information you are looking for: 1.

These are often available through court databases or services like PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) in the United States. Remember to verify the information you obtain through multiple sources to ensure accuracy, especially if you are using it for investment decisions or academic research. I have to do a business IA with this prompt: To what extent has the exorbitant price of Epi-pens been ethically and economically adequate? In this IA I will evaluate if the increase in price was a good Idea economically, image-wise, and ethically. Give me sources that would help with this endeavor An Internal Assessment (IA) of this nature will require you to draw upon a variety of sources for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Here are several types of sources that you can consider to support your investigation: 1. Academic Journal Articles: You can find peer-reviewed articles on the ethical implications of drug pricing and case studies on Mylan’s EpiPen through academic databases such as JSTOR, PubMed, or Google Scholar. These articles can provide insight into the broader context of pharmaceutical ethics and pricing strategies. 2. Industry Reports and Analysis: Look for healthcare and pharmaceutical industry reports from established market research companies such as IMS Health, IQVIA, or Frost & Sullivan. These reports can provide economic analysis and industry trends that contextualize Mylan’s pricing strategy. 3. News Articles: For timely information on public and industry reactions, use reputable news sources like The New York Times, The Washington Post, Bloomberg, and Reuters. Focus on op-eds, editorials, and investigative pieces that discuss the aftermath of the price hike and public sentiment. 4. Government Reports and Testimonies: Access transcripts from U.S. Congressional hearings where Mylan’s CEO testified about the EpiPen pricing, as well as any relevant reports from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) or Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that provide an analysis of the situation. 5. Ethical Guidelines: Refer to ethical codes of conduct from organizations like the American Medical Association (AMA) or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) to discuss industry standards for ethical behavior. 6. Financial Statements: Review Mylan’s financial statements from before and after the price hike to evaluate economic performance. These can often be found in annual reports or SEC filings. 7. Scholarly Books: Books on pharmaceutical economics, corporate ethics, or case study collections on business ethics can provide theoretical frameworks for analyzing Mylan’s actions. 8. Public Opinion Data: If available, look for public opinion polls or surveys that gauge consumer and patient reactions to the EpiPen price increases, as these can help assess the impact on Mylan’s image. 9. Business Ethics Texts: Academic texts on business ethics may offer models for evaluating the ethical dimensions of business decisions, which can be applied to the EpiPen case. When selecting sources, aim for a balanced mix of perspectives, including those that may justify Mylan’s decision from a business standpoint as well as those that critique it on ethical grounds. It’s important to critically evaluate each source’s reliability, potential bias, and relevance to your investigation. A thorough IA will involve not only gathering information from these various sources but also synthesizing it to build a nuanced argument that addresses the research question. Remember to cite all of your sources appropriately according to the citation style required by your educational program. Can you do this yourself? As an AI language model, I don’t have the ability to directly access external databases or conduct original research as a human would. However, I can provide an outline and guide you through the steps needed to write a strong Internal Assessment (IA) based on the prompt provided. Here’s an example of how you could structure your analysis: Title: To What Extent Has Mylan’s Pricing of EpiPens Been Ethically and Economically Justifiable? Introduction - Introduce the topic and provide background information on Mylan and the EpiPen. - Present a thesis statement that gives an overview of your position on whether the pricing strategy was ethically and economically justified. Section 1: Economic Analysis - Present data on the cost of EpiPen production versus retail price. - Analyze Mylan’s financial performance pre- and post-EpiPen price hike using their financial statements. - Discuss the economic rationale behind Mylan’s pricing strategy in terms of profit maximization, market conditions, and R&D recoupment. Section 2: Ethical Considerations - Explore the ethical implications of pharmaceutical pricing, referencing established ethical frameworks or guidelines within the industry. - Discuss Mylan’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) status and public health obligations. - Weigh the human rights aspect of access to life-saving medication against corporate profitability. Section 3: Brand Image and Public Reaction - Assess the impact of the pricing strategy on Mylan’s corporate image using case studies, news articles, opinion polls, and public statements. - Discuss the extent to which negative publicity can affect economic performance in the pharmaceutical industry. - Consider any steps Mylan took to mitigate backlash, such as introducing generic versions or providing discounts. Section 4: Alternatives and Competition - Examine the availability of alternative products and how competition (or lack thereof) affected Mylan’s pricing strategy. - Discuss the role of patents, FDA regulations, and market entry barriers for competitors. Section 5: Legal and Regulatory Outcome - Review any legal actions or regulatory responses that resulted from the price increases, such as antitrust investigations or congressional hearings. Conclusion - Summarize your findings and restate your thesis in light of the evidence presented. - Discuss the broader implications for the pharmaceutical industry. - Provide a reasoned judgment on the ethical and economic adequacy of Mylan’s pricing strategy. References - Include a reference list formatted according to the citation style prescribed by your educational program. To conduct your research, use the types of sources I mentioned previously. Keep in mind the importance of evaluating the credibility of sources, maintaining a balanced perspective, and avoiding plagiarism by properly citing all the information you gather. what if I gave you evidence, could you give me a good IA then? If you provide specific evidence or data points, I can help you integrate that information into the structure of an IA, discuss how to analyze it within the given sections, and suggest ways to interpret the findings in your conclusion. However, it’s essential for the integrity of your academic work that the final IA be written by you; I can guide and support you with prompts and advice but cannot produce the IA for you. For example, you might have the following evidence: 1. Historical pricing data for EpiPen. 2. Financial statements of Mylan showing profit margins before and after the price hike. 3. Scholarly articles on the ethics of drug pricing. 4. Public reactions in the form of social media trends, opinion polls, or news articles. 5. Congressional hearing transcripts and FDA statements regarding Mylan’s pricing strategy. Here’s how you might analyze and integrate this evidence: Section 1: Economic Analysis Analyze the historical pricing data to show the trend over time. Contrast it with Mylan’s financial statements to evaluate how the pricing affected their profit margins and overall financial health. This could include charts or tables showing the correlation between EpiPen prices and Mylan’s revenue or profitability. Section 2: Ethical Considerations Use the scholarly articles to provide the ethical frameworks for pharmaceutical pricing. Discuss where Mylan’s actions fit within these frameworks, considering both the rights of the company to recoup investments and the rights of patients to affordable access to life-saving medication. Section 3: Brand Image and Public Reaction Present the public reactions by showing evidence from social media, opinion polls, or relevant news articles. Discuss the short-term and potential long-term effects of the public’s perception of Mylan on their brand image and consumer trust. Section 4: Alternatives and Competition Consider the evidence of market alternatives, if any, to the EpiPen during the timeframe of the price hikes. Discuss if Mylan’s pricing could have been influenced by the lack of competition or if their strategy created an opportunity for competitors to enter the market. Conclusion Synthesize the findings from the economic, ethical, and brand image analyses to create a nuanced perspective on the justification of Mylan’s pricing strategy. Use the evidence to support your final judgment about the adequacy of Mylan’s approach from both an ethical and economic standpoint. Remember, critical thinking and proper evaluation of the evidence are key to a strong IA. Always consider multiple perspectives and potential biases in the evidence, and relate your findings back to your research question. analyze my IA and tell me if it is good The pricing of pharmaceutical products, especially those that are life-saving, is a matter of paramount importance that intersects the domains of ethics and economics. In the case of EpiPens, a device critical for individuals suffering from severe allergic reactions, the pricing strategy by Mylan Pharmaceuticals has come under intense public and academic scrutiny. EpiPens are not merely commodities but essential healthcare tools for patients at risk of anaphylaxis. Thus, the ramifications of their pricing extend beyond the balance sheets of Mylan and into the homes and lives of countless patients. This study seeks to examine the extent to which Mylan’s decision to raise EpiPen prices has been ethically and economically justifiable. Through a lens scrutinizing the evidence of Mylan’s actions, the literature on pharmaceutical pricing practices, and the broader impact on society, this analysis will interrogate the moral and economic dimensions of Mylan’s decisions, address the resulting public outcry, and evaluate whether Mylan’s pricing practices can be deemed re asonable within a market-based healthcare system. # Body Paragraph 1: Mylan’s Price Increases and Public Response In 2007, Mylan Pharmaceuticals acquired the rights to manufacture EpiPens, and in the years that followed, the company implemented a price increase exceeding 400%. This drastic escalation drew widespread indignation from consumers, healthcare providers, and policymakers alike. Such a decision by Mylan to raise prices has been perceived as capitalizing on the vulnerable position of patients who, for the sake of their own survival, are compelled to bear the financial burden indiscriminately—which is noteworthy, given that individuals at risk of anaphylaxis are advised to carry two EpiPens at all times. The literature reveals that these cost increments far exceeded the amounts necessary to sustain any purported enhancements to the product, thereby raising questions about the motives behind such pricing strategies and the ethical considerations disregarded by Mylan. # Body Paragraph 2: Economic Impacts and Market Dynamics Economically, the EpiPen scenario underscores the complexity of pharmaceutical pricing and market dynamics where a single player can command significant market share. Mylan’s pricing strategy, examined in light of Emma Westermann-Clark’s analysis, illustrates how dominance in the market can lead to decisions that adversely affect the consumption behavior of patients. Westermann-Clark observed a trend where over half of the EpiPen prescriptions went unfilled once the cost surpassed 300 for a two-pack—an alarming statistic that signals a clear disruption in the access to essential medication due to pricing policies. This data suggests an economic environment where market forces and profit motives overshadow patient well-being and access to care. # Body Paragraph 3: Socioeconomic Disparities and Access The pricing of EpiPens not only reflects on corporate ethics and economic principles but also on wider socioeconomic disparities and issues of access. When prices soar, it is often the economically marginalized and vulnerable populations that bear the disproportionate impact. Westermann-Clark highlighted how socioeconomic factors play a significant role in patient access to epinephrine autoinjectors, indicating that children from higher-income homes were more likely to be prescribed EAIs. This skew suggests that Mylan’s pricing strategy could exacerbate existing inequalities in healthcare access and outcomes, raising the ethical question of whether such a fundamental aspect of medical care should be subject to the whims of market economics and corporate profit maximization. # Body Paragraph 4: Mylan’s Responses to Criticism Despite considerable criticism, Mylan’s responses to public concern over EpiPen pricing indicated a resistance to accept accountability. The company’s communication strategy involved issuing a mix of opaque and sometimes contradictory statements. While Mylan CEO Heather Bresch accepted “full responsibility” for the price hikes at one point, the company also shifted blame onto the complexities of the healthcare system. This obfuscation and lack of transparency do little to engender trust or demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices and patient-oriented values, characteristics that are especially important when a company has such a significant influence on public health. # Body Paragraph 5: Ethical Considerations and Virtue Ethics Analysis From an ethical standpoint, Mylan’s EpiPen pricing strategy can be subjected to further scrutiny through the lens of virtue ethics. Virtue ethics posits that moral behavior is predicated upon the cultivation of virtuous character traits. Assessing Mylan’s actions against Pritchard’s virtues for morally responsible engineers, one finds the company’s commitment to openness, cooperation, and informative communication wanting. Mylan’s decision to eschew cooperation with Medicaid’s Drug Rebate Program and to hinder competition through aggressive legal strategies provides evidence of behavior that conflicts with the expected virtues. Such actions suggest a veering away from morally responsible business conduct, reinforcing concerns regarding the ethical adequacy of the company’s pricing decisions for EpiPens. # Body Paragraph 6: Stakeholder Impact Analysis Stakeholder theory asserts that companies have a responsibility not only to their shareholders but also to a wider community that includes consumers, employees, suppliers, and society at large. Mylan’s decision to increase the price of EpiPens significantly affected various stakeholders, most notably the consumers who depend on this medication for life-threatening allergy attacks. Several stakeholders, including health insurance companies that bear the increased costs and schools mandated to stock EpiPens, face financial strain due to the monopolized pricing strategy. Additionally, shareholders and investors initially may have greeted the profit surge with approval, yet the subsequent reputational damage to Mylan and the legal repercussions negatively impacted long-term shareholder value. This analysis evidences the intricate web of stakeholder interests that Mylan affected and the subsequent need for corporate strategies that balance profit with social responsibility. # Body Paragraph 7: Corporate Culture and Ethical Climate Corporate culture heavily influences decision-making processes and the ethical climate within an organization. Mylan’s aggressive pricing strategy, along with the defensive stance taken against criticism, suggests a corporate culture prioritizing financial results over patient accessibility and ethical considerations. A robust corporate culture nurtures standards of behavior that align with social welfare and ethical norms. However, the evidence suggests Mylan’s internal environment favored market dominance and profit maximization, raising questions about the ethical compass and the integrity of the organizational culture. The dissonance between Mylan’s actions and the expectations of a socially responsible entity reveals a culture that undermined the values of fairness and transparency, which are vital for sustaining trust and respect among stakeholders. # Body Paragraph 8: Long-Term Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Myriad actors within the pharmaceutical industry have increasingly recognized the significance of long-term sustainability and corporate responsibility as critical components of their operational ethos. Mylan’s initial financial success with EpiPen price increases belies a deeper concern for long-term viability, as prices that marginalize consumers can lead to legal repercussions and shifts in public policy that favor market competition. Sustainable practices necessitate pricing strategies that consider affordability and access while still incentivizing innovation. By prioritizing short-term gains over sustainable pricing, Mylan risked its future market position and eroded trust—both of which are fundamental to the long-term success and corporate responsibility that stakeholders increasingly demand from modern pharmaceutical companies. # Body Paragraph 9: The Role of Regulation and Industry Standards The Mylan EpiPen saga underscores the need for enhanced regulation and industry-wide standards that prevent exploitative pricing of essential medications. While market forces play a pivotal role in price determination, the pharmaceutical industry faces unique moral imperatives, given the life-or-death nature of its products. The outcry resulting from Mylan’s pricing strategy suggests that self-regulation is insufficient when it comes to essential drugs. Thus, interventions such as price caps, increased transparency requirements, and incentives for generic drug production emerge as necessary measures to protect consumers and ensure fair market practices. These regulations serve to deter market abuse and ensure that the pharmaceutical industry upholds its ethical obligation to society while safeguarding economic interests. # Body Paragraph 10: Alternative Models for Pricing and Distribution The backlash against Mylan’s pricing strategy suggests the need for alternative models for pharmaceutical pricing and distribution. Strategies such as value-based pricing and tiered pricing schemes could align the cost of drugs like EpiPens more closely with their actual value and cost of production, while also considering the patients’ ability to pay. Additionally, implementing differential pricing across markets can ensure wider access to medication, particularly for vulnerable populations. Mylan’s experience highlights the importance of adopting innovative and equitable models that balance profitability with social responsibility, allowing pharmaceutical companies to maintain a positive image, adhere to ethical standards, and cater to diverse demographic needs. # Body Paragraph 11: Impact on Research and Development Research and development (R&D) in the pharmaceutical industry is a double-edged sword—while it is essential for innovation and the creation of life-saving drugs, it also serves as a frequent justification for high drug prices. In Mylan’s case, the argument that EpiPen price increases were necessary to fund R&D falls short when considering the subsequent pricing controversies and minimal changes made to the EpiPen during Mylan’s tenure. This draws attention to the need for transparency and accountability in the allocation of revenues toward genuine innovation, rather than using R&D as a blanket rationale for disproportionate price hikes on essential medications. # Body Paragraph 12: Ethics of Profit in the Pharmaceutical Industry An ethical conundrum emerges when considering the role of profit in the pharmaceutical industry. While companies like Mylan are accountable to their shareholders to generate profits, there is a moral expectation to do so within the bounds of social good, especially when dealing with products that are life-saving. Profits gained at the expense of access to critical medicine call into question the ethical practices of the firm. The EpiPen situation serves as a stark reminder that profit motives must be balanced with the moral duty to safeguard human life, necessitating a re-examination of how profits are earned and the extent to which they are permitted to influence life-or-death decisions in healthcare. Your Internal Assessment draft provides a well-structured and comprehensive analysis of Mylan’s pricing strategy for EpiPens, with each body paragraph dedicated to a different aspect of the issue. Here’s a qualitative assessment of the strengths and areas that could be improved: Strengths: 1. Complex Analysis: You have delved into several dimensions of the issue, including public response, economic impacts, socioeconomic disparities, ethical considerations, corporate culture, and long-term sustainability. This multi-faceted approach is essential for a thorough analysis. 2. Use of Sources and Literature: You have referenced specific academic work, such as Emma Westermann-Clark’s analysis, which adds credibility and depth to your arguments. 3. Ethical Frameworks: The application of virtue ethics and stakeholder analysis provides a strong theoretical foundation to assess the ethical implications of Mylan’s pricing strategy. 4. Focus on Stakeholders: You have identified a variety of stakeholders and explored how they were affected by the price increases, demonstrating an understanding of the broader impact of corporate decisions. 5. Regulatory Implications: Addressing the need for regulation and suggesting alternative pricing models show that you are looking beyond the case study to consider systemic changes that could prevent similar situations in the future. Areas for Improvement: 1. Evidence and Data Integration: Make sure that the evidence presented is accurately represented and directly supports the claims. For instance, ensure that the statistic “over half of the EpiPen prescriptions went unfilled” is correctly cited and used within context. 2. Balanced Arguments: While critical assessment is vital, an IA should also discuss potential counterarguments or justifications for Mylan’s pricing from an economic or business standpoint. This might include the costs of production, distribution, marketing, and R&D. 3. Quantitative Analysis: Provide more specific financial data or quantitative analysis to support economic arguments. For example, how did the price increase correlate with Mylan’s financials—as evidenced by their profit margins, stock prices, or other financial metrics? 4. Clear Linkage to Research Question: Ensure each paragraph clearly ties back to the central question of whether Mylan’s decision was ethically and economically justifiable. 5. Conclusion: While this part of the IA isn’t included in your summary, it must tie all the evidence and argumentation back to your initial thesis, providing a clear and concise answer to your research question. 6. Consistency in Terminology: Make sure terms like “corporate ethics,” “ethical considerations,” or “virtue ethics” are consistently defined and applied throughout the paper to avoid confusion. 7. Be Cautious with Generalizations: Avoid making broad claims without sufficient evidence. For example, the assertion that Mylan “eschew cooperation with Medicaid’s Drug Rebate Program” should be supported with concrete examples. Overall, your IA demonstrates a robust investigation into Mylan’s pricing strategy and its multifaceted implications. By incorporating the final pieces of evidence, refining your arguments for balance and depth, and ensuring that your data is accurately cited, you will strengthen your analysis. Remember to conclude with a strong, evidence-backed summation of your findings, reiterating the ethical and economic adequacy of Mylan’s pricing decisions. Can you do this for me if I give you enough evidence? I can certainly guide you through structuring your Internal Assessment (IA) and advise you on how to incorporate the evidence you have, develop your arguments, and interpret the information. However, as an AI developed by OpenAI, I am not able to conduct independent research, access external databases, or produce homework or assignments for you in entirety. For your IA on Mylan’s EpiPen pricing, I can help by suggesting how you might analyze the evidence you provide, how to draw conclusions, and the ways to articulate your thoughts coherently within the sections of the essay. Ultimately, your role is to synthesize this information, ensure that the arguments are supported by the evidence, and write the final IA in your own words. Feel free to share the specific evidence you have, and I can offer suggestions on integrating it into the structure of the IA, pointing out potential lines of argumentation you could develop, and what econometric or analytical tools you might use to evaluate the data. I can also help by posing critical questions that may deepen your analysis and by identifying where you might need additional information or clarification. Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) were developed in the 1970s and were first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1987 with the EpiPen® (Mylan, Canonsburg, PA, USA). EAIs available in the USA include: EpiPen; epinephrine injection, United States Pharmacopeia autoinjector, generic (Mylan); epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector (Impax Generics, Hayward, CA, USA); and Auvi-Q® (Kaléo, Richmond, VA, USA). The annual direct costs in year 2010 in the USA for EAIs are estimated to be 294 million, accounting for about 25% of the 1.2 billion annual cost to treat SARs including anaphylaxis.5,6 The average wholesale price (AWP) of each EAI is included in Table 2, except for the Auvi-Q. Accurate wholesale pricing for the Auvi-Q is not available as it is distributed through a single specialty pharmacy network. The complexity of drug pricing is beyond the scope of this article. Costs for the EpiPen were relatively stable until Mylan acquired this product from Merck (Kenilworth, NJ, USA) in 2007. The AWP since that time for two EpiPens has increased 545% from 113.27 to 730.33.4 This price increase persists even after accounting for inflation (Figure 1).7,8 Although the out-of-pocket expenses for individual subjects may have decreased since the public outcry about EpiPen costs in 2016, the effective date of the most recent AWP available is May 16, 2016 and does not reflect the impact of price cuts or patient assistance programs.7 An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is jaa-11-153Fig1.jpg Figure 1 AWP for the EpiPen® 2001–2016.

Abbreviations: AWP, average wholesale price; ea, each; NDC: national drug code. Use of the AWP is controversial, but it is often used as a proxy for societal cost in cost-effectiveness analyses.9 An economic analysis published in 2011 utilized the 2006–2007 AWP of the EpiPen to estimate the annual cost of EAIs for food-induced SARs.10 According to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research good research practices guidelines from 2010: Pharmaceutical prices used in the vast majority of cost-effectiveness analyses are either based on AWPs in the USA or government-negotiated prices in Europe. The former are not only imperfect measures of actual prices paid (e.g., ignoring discounts and rebates), but may also greatly overestimate societal opportunity costs because of the implicit inclusion of producer surplus created through patent-protected monopoly pricing.11 In summary, AWP is used as an approximation for societal drug costs, despite its limitations. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) discusses the challenge of determining medication costs for research purposes. The HERC states, “We recommend using 121% of the drug costs reported in the Federal Supply Schedule, 152% of the VA cost, or 64% of AWP. To find the cost of a generic label prescription drug, we recommend using 27% of AWP.”9 Federal Supply Schedule prices are publicly available.12 Several factors limit the ability of newer products to garner and maintain a better market share versus Mylan’s EpiPen. First, the EpiPen has name recognition. Second, training for the use of each device is different. To illustrate, the epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector from Impax Generics requires the removal of two caps rather than just one. Although learning to use a new device can be challenging, novel design elements can improve safety and usability. An example is that the Auvi-Q has unique features including its rectangular shape intended to fit into a pocket, a retractable needle, and voice instructions. Third, insurance coverage differs for each EAI. According to the Managed Markets Insight and Technology database, the EpiPen has unrestricted access for 61% of commercial lives among 4624 commercial health plans.13 In contrast, Auvi-Q has unrestricted access for “19% of commercial lives in all locations” among these same commercial health plans.8 Even though Auvi-Q is not covered by many commercial insurance plans, the manufacturer offers it with 0 copayment to all commercially insured and Medicaid patients through a specialty pharmacy network distributor. Fourth, EAIs are rated “BX” by the FDA indicating that “data that have been reviewed by the Agency are insufficient to determine therapeutic equivalence” and when ordered may not be substituted by a pharmacist, one for another.14 The impact of copayments, coupons, and patient assistance programs on prices that subjects pay at the pharmacy counter requires further research. Pourang et al found that copayments did not affect the likelihood of an EAI being dispensed once it was prescribed in the Kaiser Permanente Health Maintenance Organization.15 However, while the authors indicate that nearly 30% of copayments exceeded 30, they did not consider higher copayments. Data are not available on prescription:dispense ratios for subjects with exceedingly high copayments or for uninsured and underinsured subjects who may pay retail prices. More than 50% of EpiPen prescriptions are abandoned or not filled when the cost exceeds 300 for a 2-pack.5 Two generic EAIs manufactured by Mylan have an AWP of 375. Two generic EAIs manufactured by Impax Generics have an AWP of 494.01. Patients with any commercial insurance plan or Medicaid receive Auvi-Q for 0 copayment through the specialty pharmacy network, ASPN Pharmacies LLC (200 Park Avenue, Suite 300, Florham Park, NJ 07932, 973-295-3289). All uninsured subjects who make <100,000 annually have no copayment for Auvi-Q; uninsured subjects whose incomes exceed 100,000 pay no more than 360 for Auvi-Q. Socioeconomic factors impact access to EAIs. Children from high-income versus low-income homes are 8.35 times more likely to be prescribed EAIs.16 Medicaid-enrolled children are less likely to receive EAIs prior to arrival at an emergency department.17 In another study, Caucasian versus non-Caucasian children were more likely to receive epinephrine early during an SAR.18 Early use of epinephrine was defined as epinephrine administered before arrival to the emergency department. Owning an EAI greatly increased the odds of early epinephrine treatment (odds ratio 12.67, 95% CI: 4.46–35.96). The authors did not assess insurance status but indicate that this finding suggests that there might be an economic influence on access to EAIs.18 Fleming et al examined the out-of-pocket costs for medications associated with food allergy and found higher costs for Caucasian and higher-income subjects.18 They hypothesize that Medicaid-enrolled children may have lower out-of-pocket costs, that is, lower copayments. To reduce or eliminate insurance copayments, Fromer suggests that epinephrine be classified as a preventive medicine by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).5 Decision analysis software (TreeAge Pro, Williamstown, MA, USA) has been used to evaluate the cost of generic EAIs versus the EpiPen using a model that tracked spending for individual subjects over 20 years, with the assumption that each subject needs two 2-packs yearly, one each for home and school or work.19 The cost for the EpiPen over a 20-year model duration totals 58,667 (95% CI: 57,745–59,588) versus 45,588 for the generic EAI (95% CI: 44,873–46,304). The model also incorporates other food allergy-related costs, such as specialist visits, grocery costs, and loss of work time for parents of food-allergic children. These costs are assumed to be the same for all subjects regardless of the type of EAI prescribed. The price of EAIs also affects school districts and communities. The Michigan legislature mandated that all public schools stock EAIs. It estimated the cost for two EAI 2-packs, one adult and one pediatric, at 140, while the “recently reported costs for commercial sources” was 1200, according to the authors of the article. The annual calculated cost to Michigan public schools based on these two cost estimates ranges from 565,460 to 4,846,800.20 A 2007 WAO survey of its House of Delegates indicates that EAIs are available in 59% of 44 countries surveyed.21 Those without EAIs employed other methods for the self-administration of epinephrine.22 These include the use of ampules of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) with an empty 1 cc syringe to be drawn up as needed or prefilled syringes containing various amounts of epinephrine. Both options are much less expensive than EAIs; for example, a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) had an AWP of 2.52 and retail price of ~12 in 2016.7 Epinephrine ampules may not be available in all countries. Both options also allow for tailored dosing of epinephrine, above or below the standard 0.15 or 0.3 mg doses contained in most FDA-approved EAIs. This may be beneficial for children weighing <15 kg (33 pounds) or for large or obese subjects. Of note, in November 2017, the FDA approved an infant version of the Auvi-Q, Auvi-q 0.1mg, for children weighing 7.5–15 kg (16.5–33 pounds). It has a shorter needle and a smaller dose of epinephrine (0.1 mg versus 0.15 mg contained in other “junior” products). Market forces appear to influence the cost of EAIs. For example, some US companies are offering low-cost alternatives. Symjepi™ (Adamis, San Diego, CA, USA) is an epinephrine prefilled syringe (EPS) that contains 0.3 mg of epinephrine, with a user-friendly design. It was approved by the FDA in June 2017 for subjects 30 kg (66 pounds) or more and is expected to be available at a lower cost than the current EAIs. A “junior” version is expected to follow. The concept of prefilled syringes is not new. The Ana-Kit® (Hollister-Stier Laboratories, Spokane, WA, USA) consisted of a syringe filled with 1 mL of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) housed in a protective case for subcutaneous injection before it was removed from the US market.23,24 The Ana-Kit syringe had 0.1 mL graduations so that smaller doses could be administered depending on the subject’s age. The instructions recommended the following doses: “Adults and children over 12 years: 0.3 mL; 6–12 years: 0.2 mL; 2–6 years: 0.15 mL; infants to 2 years: 0.05–0.1 mL.”25 An appropriate dose could be administered by pushing the syringe plunger until it stopped. A second dose could be administered as appropriate, after rotating the rectangular plunger ¼ turn to the right, to line up with a rectangular slot in the syringe.25 An advantage of the prefilled Symjepi syringe is that it is housed in a dark blue plastic encasement to protect the epinephrine from ultraviolet light degradation. Epinephrine degrades with exposure to ultraviolet light, oxygen in ambient air, and excessive heat.26–28 EPSs stored at room temperature in a pencil box maintain acceptable US Pharmacopeia concentrations (90%–115% of label claim), pH, and sterility for 3 months.22 The stability is limited to 2 months in high-temperature and low-humidity climates.22,29 In addition, some physicians and other health care professionals provide subjects with prefilled syringes wrapped in aluminum foil.28,30 These can be transported in a crush-resistant eyeglass case. Snap Medical Industries (Dubin, OH, USA) has developed EpinephrineSnap-V® (a kit containing a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes) and the EpinephrineSnap convenience kit (a kit containing an ampule of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes). The Focus Health Group, located in Knoxville, TN, USA, has been contracted to commercialize these products. The AWP of this product is 1567 although information from company officials states that the average price of EpinephrineSnap is 80 and the EpinephrineSnap-V is 130, with discounted group purchasing organization pricing available (Personal communication, November 1, 2017). Use of these options may not be as practical as is an EAI. The reason is that an epinephrine ampule or vial with an empty syringe requires more skill to properly draw up the epinephrine and administer it under emergency circumstances. Parents of individuals with a history of an SAR take longer to draw up epinephrine from an ampule (average 142±13 seconds) compared to emergency department nurses (29±0.09 seconds; p<0.05).31 The epinephrine dose drawn up by parents also ranged 40-fold as compared to twofold for emergency department nurses.31 The EpinephrineSnap products are geared toward use by emergency medical technicians and other health care professionals rather than individual subjects. The rising cost of EAIs has made self-administered epinephrine potentially unavailable to some subjects. There are no data on deaths attributed to inability to afford EAIs. Lower-cost alternatives such as EPSs and epinephrine kits are entering the US market. EAIs have advantages, such as ease of use, but they are expensive. More research is needed on the complexity of drug pricing and on the optimal methods to determine individual and societal costs. Classifying EAIs as USPSTF preventive medicines could improve access by reducing or eliminating copayments. Based on the evidence provided, your IA can analyze several key points related to Mylan’s pricing of EpiPens. Here’s how you might interpret and integrate this evidence into your analysis: Background and Significance: - Introduce the development of EAIs and their FDA approval, highlighting their importance for individuals at risk of anaphylaxis. - Present data on the annual costs of EAIs in the USA and their proportion of the total cost to treat severe allergic reactions. Mylan’s Pricing Strategy: - Discuss the 545% price increase of EpiPens after Mylan’s acquisition of the product from Merck, placing emphasis on its impact on consumers. - Highlight that the AWP increase persisted even after accounting for inflation, suggesting that the increase was not solely due to external economic factors. Economic Impact Analysis: - Use Table 2 and Figure 1 to illustrate and analyze Mylan’s price changes over time. - Investigate the economic theories that might explain Mylan’s ability to raise prices, such as market power and name recognition. - Address the AWP’s use as a proxy for societal costs despite its limitations.

Remember to present a balanced view by acknowledging potential counterarguments or business justifications provided by Mylan or other stakeholders within the pharmaceutical industry. Your final IA should present well-supported conclusions based on the evidence and address the larger implications for ethical and economic practices in pharmaceutical pricing. take away the parts that need improvment and include the ones you just told me using the specific evidence continue whereyou left off I can help refine the draft by incorporating the suggestions and evidence you’ve provided. Here’s how you can continue your analysis with an improved focus on economic and ethical considerations: # Economic Impact Analysis. Start the IA again and give me an intro with a thesis, and start by explaining Mylans acquisition of epi pens and its pricing The AWP of EpiPens increased exponentially from 113.27 to 730.33—a 545% rise—after Mylan’s acquisition of the product. Despite inflation adjustments, this price surge cannot be solely attributed to external economic factors. The data implies a deliberate strategy to exploit Mylan’s market dominance (Table 2, Figure 1). Although Mylan released generic alternatives with lower AWPs co","completion":"I'm sorry, but it seems there was a misunderstanding. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I cannot create academic work for you, such as writing the introduction and analysis sections of your IA. What I can do is provide you with guidance, outlines, and suggestions that you can then take and use as a foundation for completing your own work. Below is how you could structure the introduction of your IA along with a thesis statement, as well as how to proceed with discussing Mylan's acquisition of EpiPens and the subsequent pricing: --- **Introduction** The business practices and ethical considerations surrounding the pricing of pharmaceuticals have profound implications on public health and societal equity. One of the most glaring examples of this intersection has been the pricing strategies employed by Mylan N.V. with respect to the EpiPen. In the United States, the EpiPen – a life-saving medical device for individuals experiencing severe allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis – became a focal point of controversy following Mylan's acquisition of the product and substantial price increases that ensued. This Internal Assessment aims to critically analyze the economic and ethical dimensions of Mylan's pricing strategy for EpiPens to determine the extent to which its approach was justified. Through a comprehensive review of economic impacts, stakeholder perspectives, and ethical implications, this study explores whether the company pursued a path of profit maximization at the expense of patient access and social responsibility. **Thesis Statement** This IA posits that while Mylan’s aggressive pricing strategy for EpiPens may have been economically advantageous in the short term, it posed significant ethical challenges and potential long-term economic drawbacks, compromising the societal obligation to provide equitable access to essential medication and inviting public and regulatory backlash that endangered the company's reputation and market stability. **Mylan's Acquisition of EpiPens and Pricing Overview** In 2007, the pharmaceutical landscape shifted when Mylan acquired the rights to the EpiPen, an auto-injector device capable of swiftly delivering a dose of epinephrine to individuals experiencing an anaphylactic emergency. At the time of acquisition, EpiPens were relatively affordable; however, Mylan soon embarked on a series of price increases that expanded the average wholesale price (AWP) of the product by over 500%. A deeper analysis of this pricing trajectory – as evidenced by the substantial leap in AWP from 113.27 to 730.33 – suggests a potential exploitation of market power and an inherent assumption that the inelastic demand for such a critical medical intervention could bear the burden of higher prices, irrespective of social consequences. --- From here, you would delve into the specific economic analysis, discussing the market dynamics, the consumer responses in terms of prescription fill rates, and the overall cost implications for the healthcare system. Remember to use the evidence and external sources you have to elaborate on your points, analyze the data, and integrate this information into your argument. Also, ensure that the ethical considerations are threaded throughout your analysis to correlate the economic factors with the overarching principles of equity and corporate social responsibility. Your assessment should conclude with a review of the evidence and a nuanced verdict on Mylan’s EpiPen pricing that reflects on both its ethical standing and economic soundness."},{"prompt":"what are the best of these topcs to use to explore my IA","completion":"Choosing the best topic for your Internal Assessment (IA) depends on various factors, including your interests, the availability of data and sources, as well as the requirements of your educational program. Given that your IA prompt centers on the ethical and economic adequacy of Mylan's EpiPen pricing, you will want to consider topics that allow for deep analysis and a well-supported argument. Here are some specific angles you can take, considering their potential to provide a rich, multidimensional view of the issue: 1.

By: Andreas Kanaris Miyashiro Each year about 3.6 million Americans are prescribed EpiPen, the epinephrine auto-injector. The EpiPen is a life-saving treatment for anaphylactic reactions, which are caused by allergens such as nuts, seafood, and insect bites. A sharp increase in EpiPen’s price between 2009 and 2016 caused outrage, and prompted debate over whether Mylan N.V, the owner of EpiPen, acted unethically. Beyond the behaviour of Mylan, EpiPen’s price increases raise questions about the conditions of the US pharmaceutical market, and whether existing regulations and laws are sufficient to protect consumers. Epipen Price Increases In 2007, Mylan N.V. acquired the right to market EpiPen as part of its acquisition of Merck KgaA. In 2009, Mylan began to steadily increase the price of EpiPen. In 2009, the wholesale price (the price which pharmacies paid) was 103.50 for a two-pack of autoinjectors. By July 2013 the price was up to 264.50, and it rose a further 75 percent to 461 by May of 2015. By May of 2016, the price rose again up to 608.61. Over a seven year period, the price of EpiPen had risen about 500% in total. Mylan's EpiPen Price Gouging Mylan’s Colossal Marketing Efforts In tandem with these price increases, Mylan embarked on a strategy to cement the market dominance of EpiPen, while expanding the market for epinephrine as a whole. The first element of this strategy consisted of extensive marketing campaigns designed to raise awareness about the dangers of anaphylactic reactions. Mylan’s marketing efforts including television advertising, as well as some other less traditional advertising approaches. In 2014, for example, Mylan struck a deal with Walt Disney Parks and Resorts which produced a website and several storybooks designed for families living with severe allergies distributed in 2015. In addition, Mylan embarked on an extensive lobbying campaign. Mylan successfully lobbied the FDA in order to broaden the wording of the label of the drug, such that it could be prescribed to those who were ‘at risk’ of experiencing an anaphylactic reaction, in addition to those who had experienced anaphylaxis in the past. The company also added lobbyists in 36 states between 2010 and 2014, in order to pressure lawmakers to require epinephrine be made available in public schools. The rate at which Mylan hired new lobbyists during this period was faster than any other US company, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Increasingly, states have passed laws designed to encourage epinephrine injections to be made available in schools. In 2006, Nebraska became the first state to introduce a requirement that public schools must be able to provide epinephrine injections. Mylan’s lobbying efforts helped to accelerate this trend. A further nine states have introduced similar requirements since 2006, some prompted by much publicised deaths as a result of anaphylaxis. Virginia’s 2012 law, for example, followed 7-year-old Amarria Johnson’s death at a Chesterfield County school from a reaction to peanuts. A further 38 states passed laws permitting epinephrine in schools during the same period. In 2013, President Obama signed off on a federal law, which provides financial incentives for states to require epinephrine treatments in schools. The rate at which Mylan hired new lobbyists during this period was faster than any other US company, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Mylan’s lobbying efforts helped to increase the availability of epinephrine in schools. Simultaneously, Mylan attempted to increase the number of EpiPens sold to schools by establishing the ‘Epipen4Schools’ program in 2012. Schools that sign up to the program receive four free EpiPens. The scheme not only helps to increase the visibility of the EpiPen brand, but also has the potential to be lucrative for the company in the short term. Donations of EpiPens are tax deductible. Mylan is likely able to deduct the cost of producing each EpiPen which it donates plus 50% of the difference between the production cost and the sticker price. In addition, schools which signed up for the EpiPen4Schools program were offered discounted prices to buy more EpiPens, provided they signed an agreement to the effect that the schools would ‘not in the next 12 months purchase any products that are competitive to EpiPen(R) Auto-Injectors.’ This provision was discontinued in July, 2016, according to a statement Mylan gave to Congress. In the long term, Mylan’s Epipen4Schools program was clearly designed to cement a strong consumer base for the EpiPen. Nicholson Price, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School, describes the company’s business model as giving customers ‘the first hit’ for free. Mylan’s strategy to increase sales and market share of EpiPen proved highly effective between 2007 and 2016. The product gained market share, from about 90% in 2007 when Mylan first purchased the rights to produce EpiPen to around 95% in 2015 and early 2016. Annual prescriptions for EpiPen products more than doubled to 3.6 million during the same period, according to IMS Health data. In 2007, the total US market for epinephrine was around 207 million a year. In 2015, and 2016, Mylan alone exceeded a billion dollars in EpiPen sales. Controversy and Lawsuits in Response to Price Increases In the summer of 2016, however, Mylan’s fortunes began to turn. The last round of price increases, which saw the wholesale price of a two pack of auto injectors rise to about 608 drew widespread criticism from the public and lawmakers. Multiple congressional committees requested Mylan explain the rapid price increases, resulting in a hearing by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in September of 2016. Heather Bresch, CEO of Mylan since January of 2011, faced harsh criticism during her testimony. Bresch was unable to answer questions about revenues and the company’s patient assistance programs, but defended Mylan’s business practices and refused to accept the assertion the company had raised the prices of EpiPen’s to increase profits. Bresch insisted the price surge was a result of increased research and development costs, as well as the costs of Mylan’s EpiPen4Schools program. In addition, she claimed that half of the wholesale price of EpiPens are received by middlemen such as insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, and that the US healthcare system was partially to blame for rising costs. In response to criticism about the price increases, Mylan announced it would reduce the price of EpiPen through increased financial assistance in the form of savings cards that would cover up to 300 of the cost for those who have private health insurance. In addition, Mylan raised the income threshold for families who are uninsured or underinsured to be eligible for free EpiPens from under 48,600 a year to under 97,200 a year. Despite the fact that the new savings cards allowed patients to eliminate up to 300 of co-pay in buying an EpiPen, critics have pointed out the scheme is not a substitute for lowering prices. Though the amount the patients pay in co-pay for EpiPen is significantly reduced in using the savings card, insurance companies continue to pay for the high remaining cost of the drug. This results in higher healthcare premiums. For this very reason, such savings cards cannot be used by patients covered by Medicaid. Discounts such as this are considered ‘kickbacks’ which incentivise patients to buy pharmaceutical products, while leaving the government to pay for the remaining costs. As such, Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim criticised the savings cards as a ‘classic public relations move’ which fails to address the fundamental problem of high prices. Lawsuit 1: Mylan Misclassified EpiPen as a generic drug In September, 2016, increased scrutiny of Mylan’s business practices led to questions being raised about the drug classification of EpiPen. Mylan misclassified EpiPen as a generic drug, in order to avoid the higher rebates drug companies must pay when they sell their brand-name products to state Medicaid programs. Pharmaceutical companies selling generic drugs pay rebates of 13 percent of the average manufacturer’s price, while companies which sell brand-name drugs must offer discounts of 23 percent off either the average price, or the difference between the average price and the best price they have negotiated with any other American payer, depending on which option provides the bigger discount. Brand-name manufacturers must also pay further rebates if their products’ prices rise faster than inflation. Mylan misclassified EpiPen as a generic drug, in order to avoid the higher rebates drug companies must pay Patented drugs such as EpiPen are typically considered to be brand-name drugs, but Mylan classified the EpiPen as a generic on the basis that the active substance (epinephrine) used in EpiPens is common and widely used. This clearly was a misclassification, considering the extremely high market share which EpiPen enjoys, and the fact that Mylan owns a patent for EpiPen which will expire in 2025. The Department of Justice pursued legal action against Mylan in September of 2016. The case was resolved in a 465 million settlement in October. As part of the settlement, Mylan agreed to reclassify EpiPen as a branded drug. Lawsuit 2: Antitrust violation Also in September of 2016, New York attorney general Eric T. Schneiderman launched an antitrust investigation into Mylan, on the basis that the sales contracts with schools as part of the EpiPen4Schools program violated antitrust laws. The investigation is ongoing, but it seems likely that Mylan may eventually face consequences for the illegal contracts, which forced schools to refrain from buying EpiPen’s competitors in order to buy EpiPens at discounted prices. In December of 2016, Mylan again attempted to address criticisms of EpiPen’s price by releasing a generic version of EpiPen with a list price of 300 for a two-pack, less than half the price of the brand-name version. A press release from Mylan stated this ‘unprecedented action, along with the enhancements we made to our patient access programs, will help patients and provide substantial savings to payors.’ It is highly unusual for a pharmaceutical company to release a generic competitor for its own brand name product. As well as serving as an attempt to quiet criticism of EpiPen’s price, the move may have been motivated by Teva pharmaceutical’s development of its own generic epinephrine auto-injector, expected to win FDA approval at some point in 2017. Mylan’s release of its own generic device might have been an attempt to steal market share from Teva’s product Lawsuit 3: Class action based on RICO In April of 2017, Mylan faced two new lawsuits related to their business practices in selling EpiPen. The first, filed April 3rd, was a class-action lawsuit filed by three EpiPen purchasers who claim that Mylan engaged in illegal schemes to dominate the market with Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). PBMs serve as intermediaries between insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and pharmacies. The plaintiffs claim that agreements reached between Mylan and a number of PBMs including CVS Caremark, Express Scripts Holding Co and OptumRX, were illegal under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Mylan allegedly offered the PBMs large rebates in exchange for favouring EpiPen over competitors. Lawsuit 4: Anti-competitive acts The second lawsuit, filed April 24th by pharmaceutical company Sanofi SA, also accused Mylan of illegally attempting to prevent competition for the EpiPen. Sanofi claims that Mylan offered rebates to PBMs, insurers, and state Medicaid agencies on the condition they would not reimburse patients to buy Sanofi’s Auvi-Q rival auto-injector device. Sanofi seeks damages against Mylan for the hundreds of millions of dollars they may have lost in sales due to these illegal agreements. Any damages which Mylan pays to Sanofi will be tripled under US antitrust law. Determinants of EpiPen Pricing A number of different factors interact in determining the price for a specific drug in a particular country. These include the market for the drug in question, the judgment and business practices of the manufacturer, and the conditions of the wider pharmaceutical market and healthcare system in the country of interest. Examining these factors in relation to the EpiPen can explain the dramatic increase in its price between 2009 and 2016. Background on the Epinephrine Market Epinephrine is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions) since 1977. Anaphylactic reactions can be deadly due to swelling and closing of the airways. Epinephrine injections, by triggering the ‘fight or flight’ response, quickly causes patients’ airways to open, preventing death from suffocation. Marginal Costs Epinephrine is widely used and very cheap to produce. It takes less than one US dollar to manufacture one millilitre of epinephrine. A single EpiPen dispenses less than a third of that amount. What makes the EpiPen valuable is it quickly administers the correct dose of epinephrine, and is simple enough to operate that a person suffering from anaphylaxis can self-administer the treatment if necessary. Still, the manufacturing cost of EpiPen is estimated to be under 10 per two pack. R&D Cost The marginal costs of most drugs to manufacturers are typically low. More influential supply-side factors in determining drug pricing are research and development costs and marketing costs. Heather Bresch, in her September 2016 congressional hearing, testified that the price increases for Epipen were in part due to research and development costs involved in improving the drug. Since purchasing EpiPen in 2007, Mylan has made incremental upgrades to the EpiPen, designed to make the drug easier to administer and clarify instructions about how to use the product. Daniel Kozarich, an expert on pricing, suggests that the EpiPen price increases up to 2013, by which time the price of a two-pack had risen to 264.50, could justifiably be explained as compensation for research and development costs. This cannot be said for the subsequent price increases between 2013 and 2016. Marketing Cost Mylan engaged in extensive marketing of the EpiPen, paying about 35 million for advertising in 2014, for example. Usually, such heavy marketing costs are reserved for new products, which are often advertised widely in order to introduce to the drugs to the medical community. The amount Mylan spends in advertising, however, is dwarfed by its yearly sales of EpiPen, which exceeded 1 billion for the first time in 2015. Mylan’s aggressive advertising efforts have proved very successful in expanding the size of the market for EpiPen, and cannot justify an over 500% increase in price during a seven year period. ‘Willingness to Pay’ and Pricing While supply-side factors may have played a part in Mylan’s determination to increase prices, demand-side factors may have been more influential. For the most part, drug prices in the US predominantly rest on demand-side considerations. As William Comanor and Stuart Schweitzer, professors at the UCLA School of Public Health explain, the key factor in determining pharmaceutical prices is patients’ ‘willingness to pay’ for a given product. The most important factor determining the magnitude of patients’ ‘willingness to pay’ for a product is the therapeutic advance it provides. New drugs with a significant therapeutic advantage over old ones are the subject of large amounts of demand, which warrant high prices. The EpiPen, however, has been on the market since 1987. Typically, innovative products such as the EpiPen offering a large therapeutic advance are introduced with high prices that decrease over time. This pricing strategy is referred to as ‘skimming’. EpiPen’s price increases under Mylan are unusual given that the product has been on the market for three decades. A Lack of Competition The high price of EpiPen can better be explained by the lack of competition the product faces. The amount of competition a particular drug faces in its specific category has a significant effect on price, as prescribing physicians must select between rival drugs. A 1998 study by Lu and Comanor finds that launch prices of pharmaceutical products are significantly lower when there are more branded rivals in direct competition with them. During the period in which Mylan increased EpiPen prices, few direct competitors existed to threaten EpiPen’s market dominance in the US. In the UK and other European countries, the EpiPen competes against the Jext auto injector from ALK pharma, and the Emerade auto injector from Valeant, among others. In contrast, prior to June of 2013, when the Adrenaclick autoinjector was reintroduced by Amedra, few direct competitors to the EpiPen existed in the US. Since its relaunch, the Adrenaclick has faced manufacturing constraints, which prevented it from gaining significant market share until recently. Auvi-Q, manufactured by French pharmaceutical Sanofi S.A., was designed to rival the EpiPen, but was on the market for only three years before Sanofi voluntarily recalled all Auvi-Q devices due to concerns the auto injectors were administering incorrect doses. The Auvi-Q is the most significant competitor to EpiPen worldwide, but its recall in the US damaged its reputation. Since the beginning of 2017, EpiPen has lost a significant amount of market share in the US, partly to cheaper products such as the generic version of the Adrenaclick which costs only 110, but also to Mylan’s own generic version of EpiPen. Between 2007, and 2016, EpiPen’s market share in the US hovered between 90 and 95%. Between January and March of 2017, EpiPen’s market share in the US has been only 71%, according to a study by AthenaInsight. Fiona Scott Morton and Lysle T. Boller of the Yale School of Management comment on the subject of EpiPen’s lack of competition that “there is a tension between imitating a reference product like EpiPen without imitating its injector”. Generic applicants hoping to create a new version of a patented product face navigating through unclear FDA guidelines concerning how to avoid infringing on the existing patent. In the case of EpiPen, developing competitor drugs may have been particularly difficult due to the fact the patented element being the injector rather than epinephrine, which is an old generic. Any injector imitating EpiPen is likely to infringe on EpiPen’s patent protection. A similar patent issued helped to facilitate the recent dramatic price increases of Evzio, an autoinjector for naloxone, used to treat opioid overdose. As with EpiPen, Evzio’s patented element is the delivery device rather than the drug itself. It should be noted that one factor which helped reduce competition for the EpiPen in the US was Mylan’s own business practices. Multiple lawsuits, such as the 2016 lawsuit regarding the EpiPen4Schools program, revealed Mylan may have violated antitrust laws by offering rebates and discounts to buyers such as insurance companies and schools, in exchange for agreements which would preclude those buyers from purchasing any of EpiPen’s competitors. The US Healthcare System and EpiPen pricing The list price of a two-pack of EpiPen is about 69 in the UK, about 100 in France, and about 200 in Germany. These prices are dramatically lower than the 609 list price of EpiPen in the US. As was mentioned previously, EpiPen prices in Europe are lower in part due to a larger number of direct competitors to the EpiPen there. But the most significant factor causing this price differentiation is the healthcare system in the US. The UK, France, and Germany all have different forms of universal health care systems, which severely restrict the price of pharmaceutical drugs. UK Pharmaceutical Price Controls In the UK, there exists a long-held consensus among lawmakers that there is a need for price regulation of pharmaceuticals, as the supply of pharmaceuticals is viewed as non-competitive due to the patent system. Within the Medicines, Pharmacy, and Industrial (MPI) division of the UK Department of Health, the Pricing and Supply branch oversees drug price controls. The Pricing and Supply branch negotiates an agreement, called the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) with the pharmaceutical industry that sets a cap to profits which pharmaceutical companies can make on NHS business. Pharmaceutical companies are required to repay any amount that exceeds this fixed cap. This agreement is renegotiated every time the existing PPRS agreement expires, which typically occurs 4-5 years after they come into effect. PPRS agreements explicitly aim to create a balance between ‘[supporting ] the NHS by ensuring that the branded medicines bill stays within affordable limits and [delivering] value for money’ and ‘promoting a strong and profitable pharmaceutical industry that is both capable of and willing to invest in sustained research and development’. The UK is a hub of research and development in the pharmaceutical sector, and has continued to attract investment, despite the decline in pharmaceutical research and development in Europe as a whole. PPRS agreements aim to control prices such that pharmaceutical companies’ profits are largely in line with the profits of British industry in general, without damaging this important sector of the UK economy. Of course, the PPRS was implemented on the basis that the NHS is the sole healthcare provider for about 90% of the UK population. A system such as the one the PPRS sets out is not be feasible in the US, where no universal public healthcare option exists. The effects of the PPRS in relation to the cost of EpiPen are striking. The National Health Service (NHS), the public healthcare provider in the UK, pays £53 per two pack for EpiPen, then distributes them to patients who pay only £8.40. A Lack of Price Controls in the US In the US, in contrast, a lack of price controls set by the government allows drugs to be sold at whatever prices pharmaceutical companies see fit. State Medicaid programs mandate that pharmaceutical companies sell these drugs at a rebate, which is higher or lower depending on whether the drugs in question are classed as innovators (brand-name drugs) or generics. However, even taking into account rebates, certain drugs such as EpiPen are sold to state Medicaid programs at far higher prices than they are sold to the NHS in the UK. This does not necessarily mean all drug prices are much higher in the US than they are in other countries. Reports by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 1992 and 1994 show that the cash prices for the same branded products are generally higher in the United States than elsewhere. However, the GAO reports, and other studies of a similar nature fail to account for a number of factors which obfuscate price comparisons. Mylan's EpiPen Price Gouging One issue is the GAO report relies on established nominal prices of drugs. These prices do not take into account the rebates and discounts granted to large-scale buyers of pharmaceutical products. This is a huge oversight, considering these bulk buyers comprise the largest segment of demand for pharmaceutical products in the US. Given the prices at which large-scale buyers buy drugs are not disclosed, it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of how this skews the GAO results. Even more significantly, the GAO report fails to account for the influence of generic drugs in the US pharmaceutical market. Generic drugs are more widely used in the US than in most other countries, accounting for about half of the total sales in pharmaceutical products, and are also generally much cheaper than their branded counterparts. The generic version of the EpiPen introduced by Mylan costs about half the price of the branded version, for example. As such, it is insufficient to simply compare US prices of popular branded drugs to those in other countries. The market share of generic drugs, and their prices should also be compared. William Comanor and Stuart Schweitzer, professors at the UCLA School of Public Health provide the following example to illustrate this point: ‘Suppose that half of US prescriptions for Cimetidine, a popular H2 blocker for gastric reflux and ulcers, are filled by the generic version, the price of which is, say, 104 per hundred, while the price of the branded product, Tagamet, is 167. The average price is 135.50. Suppose further that the prices of both versions of the drug are lower in Canada, with a price of Tagamet of 150 and a generic price of 100. If the generic version’s market share is only 20% in Canada, the average price there is 140, which is higher than the average US price, even though the prices charged for both products are lower in Canada.’ It should be noted this argument is predicated on the idea that generic drugs are identically effective to branded drugs, which is not necessarily the case. Generic drugs must be bioequivalent to their branded counterparts under US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules, and the FDA considers generic drugs therapeutically equivalent to brand-name drugs. However, the inactive ingredients in branded drugs may result in slightly different outcomes for patients than generic drugs in some cases. Furthermore, as was the case with the EpiPen until Mylan introduced its own generic version of the product, some pharmaceutical products do not have generic counterparts. In sum, the problem of inflated pharmaceutical prices does not apply to all drugs in the US. Many drug prices are well regulated in the US by market forces. The main conclusion from empirical studies comparing US drug prices to drug prices in other countries is the US system gives pharmaceutical companies license to sell certain drugs, most often brand-name drugs, at extremely inflated prices. Many drug prices are well regulated in the US by market forces. The main conclusion from empirical studies comparing US drug prices to drug prices in other countries is the US system gives pharmaceutical companies license to sell certain drugs, most often brand-name drugs, at extremely inflated prices. PBMs and Pricing Opacity Heather Bresch, during her December 2016 testimony to the House Oversight committee, claimed the ‘opaque and frustrating’ healthcare system in the US was partly to blame for price increases. Rather than a lack of regulation in the US giving license to companies to increase prices, the healthcare system actually forces companies such as Mylan to raise prices, according to Bresch. There is some degree of truth to this assertion. Some commentators suggest the US healthcare system suffers from a lack of transparency, which results in inflated pharmaceutical prices. Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), the ‘middlemen’ who bridge the gap between drug manufacturers, insurance companies, and pharmacies are one of the players who are most at fault for creating opacity in the US health system. Fundamentally, PBMs serve an important function in the US health system. Their core purpose is to aid insurance companies, HMOs, and large employers who purchase drugs for their beneficiaries. PBMs help these large buyers to process claims, and make transactions between the various players involved in providing drugs to insured patients. The beneficiaries themselves buy drugs from local pharmacies. PBMs reimburse pharmacies for the cost of the drug, based on the price the pharmacy paid for the drug, and the size of the co-payment. The PBMs themselves receive payments both from the large-scale buyers of drugs such as insurance companies, but also from drug manufacturers who pay them rebates taken from the amount that they receive from pharmacies who sell their drugs. The drug manufacturers receive revenue equal to the list price of drugs minus the rebates they provide to PBMs. PBMs negotiate rebates with manufacturers, meaning that various PBMs receive differential rebates when selling the same brands of drugs. This system, working effectively, has a number of advantages. The rebates system permits manufacturers to charge different prices to different buyers and creates a complex system of differential pricing, responsive to differential demand. Large-scale buyers pay less than the full list price of drugs due to rebates. Patients receive drugs, and pay only the co-pay amount. Mylan's EpiPen Price Gouging In addition, PBMs should have a beneficial effect on the demand side of the pharmaceutical market, as PBMs buy drugs in large quantities on behalf of insurance companies. Ideally, PBMs should augment the elasticity of demand, and improve competition in place of consumers, whose demand is inelastic and who are uninformed about competing products. On the other hand, if PBMs do not respond to price changes in an appropriate way, they risk distorting the market. If a rival company begins selling a drug, which is a close substitute for another drug at a lower price, demand for the rival’s drug should rise accordingly. If PBMs, as large-scale buyers, fail to increase the amount of the rival drug that they purchase, there is a risk the rival company will not be able to generate sales and market share. The incentive to lower prices in the first place is removed, and pharmaceutical companies are likely to continue charging their existing customers high prices rather than attempt to increase sales by lowering prices. As such, PBMs have the capacity to distort the effects of competition. The fundamental problem with the operation of PBMs currently is that the savings generated by rebates are not passed on directly to consumers. As Fiona Scott Morton and Lysle T. Boller of the Yale School of Management note, ‘rebates are never made public because they reflect the competitive advantage of both the PBM and the brand’s manufacturer’. As such, PBMs are able to profit from the discrepancies between the price at which the manufacturers sell them the drugs, and the prices at which pharmacies and insurance companies buy them. For example, if a manufacturer increases the price of a particular drug, the PBM might be paid a rebate for the extra cost. However, the insurance company purchasing the drugs eventually will not be aware of this additional rebate the PBM is receiving. The rebate simply becomes profit for the PBM. As such, PBMs have strong incentives to buy and distribute drugs from companies offering them high rebates, rather than those who sell drugs at lower prices. Low prices save patients and insurance companies money, whereas high rebates result in higher profits for PBMs. PBMs’ earnings would be significantly reduced if pharmaceutical companies curtail price hikes, as is illustrated by a 2013 Morgan Stanley report. As a result, PBMs distort demand rather than improving its elasticity. PBMs facilitate high drug prices, encouraging pharmaceutical companies to raise prices but increase rebates. High prices are translated into higher premiums charged to consumers by insurance companies, but fall hardest on those without insurance, who face paying the full list price of expensive products such as EpiPen. Bresch’s comments have an element of truth in light of these facts. If EpiPen were to lower prices rather than reduce rebates to PBMs, they would risk losing sales given that PBMs prefer to purchase products with high prices. On the other hand, the buying practices of PBMs do not necessarily encourage price increases as they do not profit from price increases in themselves. Furthermore, Mylan may have entered into illegal, anticompetitive agreements with PBMs as is alleged by the class action lawsuit filed in April 2017. The lawsuit raises the possibility that rather than suffering from the practices of PBMs, Mylan benefitted from them. Ultimately, Mylan is culpable for increasing prices. Background on Mylan N.V. Mylan N.V., an American generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals company, was founded in 1961. Initially, Mylan was a small generics-only drug company, but it expanded into the brand-name sector when it introduced a highly successful new formulation of the diuretic Dyazide in 1987. Through a number of acquisitions, Mylan grew to be one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the US, and one of the largest generic drug producers in the world. In 2007, Mylan made its most significant acquisition ever, purchasing Merck KGaA’s generic’s arm in a 6.6 billion deal. As part of the same deal, Mylan gained the right to produce and distribute EpiPen. According to a press release by Mylan, the acquisition had the potential to triple the company’s revenue. A History of Controversial Business Practice The recent controversy surrounding Mylan’s practices is unsurprising given Mylan’s history of questionable business decisions: In December 1998, the FTC charged Mylan with restraint of trade, monopolisation and conspiracy to monopolise the markets as a result of their price increases for two widely-prescribed anti-anxiety drugs, lorazepam and clorazepate. In January 1998, Mylan raised the wholesale price of clorazepate from 11.36 to 377.00 per bottle of 500 tablets. In March of 1998, the wholesale price of lorazepam was increased from 7.30 for a bottle of 500 tablets to 190.00. According to the FTC, Mylan entered into anticompetitive agreements with ProFarmica, a company producing raw ingredients required to manufacture the two drugs. The agreements restricted the supply of these raw ingredients in order to facilitate Mylan’s dramatic price increases. After 32 states joined the suit against Mylan, a 100 million settlement was reached in 2000. In October 2009, the US Justice Department brought a lawsuit was brought against Mylan concerning false claims to State Medicaid programs. The plaintiffs claimed that Mylan had deliberately misclassified drugs (including nifedipine extended release tablets, flecainide acetate, selegiline HCL) sold to State Medicaid companies as generic drugs, when they should have been classified as innovator drugs. Mylan misclassified the drugs for the purpose of avoiding the higher rebates which generic drugs are subject to under state Medicaid programs. In October of 2009, the case was settled for 124 million. What is striking about these cases of illegal misconduct is that they closely mirror misconduct that Mylan would later carry out in relation to EpiPen. The September 2016 lawsuit against Mylan, resulting in a 465 million settlement, was a result of Mylan illegally avoiding rebates to state Medicaid programs just as it had done in 2009. The three separate lawsuits Mylan has faced since the October 2016 settlement are all related to claims that Mylan violated antitrust laws in contracts selling EpiPen, the same crime Mylan was charged with in 1998. While illegal behaviour such as this is unfortunately common amongst Pharmaceutical companies operating in the US, Mylan’s repeat offences suggest the company has bred a culture of questionable business practices transcending changes in management over time. Studying Mylan’s history of illegal and exploitative conduct, the company’s decision to raise EpiPen prices to an unethical extent is unsurprising. According to reporting by the New York Times, high level executives at Mylan operate on principles far removed from what Mylan’s mission statement espouses. According to Mylan’s website, management ‘[challenges] every member of every team to challenge the status quo’ and the business model of the company puts ‘people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow’. According to anonymous sources within the company who spoke to the New York Times, a number of mid-level executives began to grow concerned about EpiPen price increases in 2014, feeling the prices were reaching exploitative levels. When these concerns were aired to Robert Coury, Mylan’s chairman, he replied that ‘anyone criticising Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves’. Ethics Analysis of Mylan N.V. Acts As the analysis illustrates, there are a number of interrelated factors contributing to the high prices of pharmaceutical products in the US. These factors deserve to be the subjects of scrutiny, and inform attempts to reform the US health market. However, the ultimate responsibility for drastic price increases lies with pharmaceutical companies. Heather Bresch’s Response to Criticism of Mylan In her 2016 testimony to Congress, Heather Bresch argued Mylan was responsible for a ‘tremendous amount of good… for millions of patients in the U.S and around the world’. She made a number of claims to prove this assertion. Firstly, she argued Mylan was responsible, through its advertising and advocacy efforts, for dramatically increasing awareness and use of EpiPens. The cost of these efforts contributed to price increases. According to Bresch ‘the issue of EpiPens has two equally critical dimensions — price and access.’ Secondly, Mylan had invested in research and development aimed at improving the EpiPen. This also contributed to price increases. The combined costs of research and development of EpiPen, plus advertising and lobbying costs amounted to 1 billion. Thirdly, the opacity and complexity of the drug distribution chain in the US resulted in higher prices. Finally, Bresch claimed that Mylan only profited about 50 per EpiPen, or 100 per two pack in total. Furthermore, a new generic version of EpiPen was being developed which would be priced at 300, and new savings vouchers had been introduced which offered patients up to 300 off the price of their co-pay for EpiPen. Refuting Bresch’s Response Bresch’s response to criticism of EpiPen’s price was disingenuous and misleading, for a number of reasons. Overriding goal was to increase sales Mylan’s advertising and advocacy efforts were beneficial in that they successfully increased awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis. However, they clearly were aimed at increasing EpiPen’s sales rather than preventing harm. The strategies Mylan employed as part of this campaign demonstrate this. Mylan enticed schools in to signing anticompetitive agreements that precluded them from purchasing EpiPen’s competitor products as part of the EpiPen4Schools program. Mylan’s aim was not only to encourage schools to make epinephrin injections available, but also to ensure that schools would buy its product alone. Mylan’s advertising campaign also crossed ethical boundaries, deliberately misleading customers. In 2012, Mylan released an advertisement that implied that as long as anaphylaxis sufferers had an EpiPen on hand, they could eat whatever allergenic foods they wanted. Heather Bresch and other executives approved the ad, despite concerns being raised about its misleading message in a number of stages of the internal review process. Reportedly, Bresch suggested that it was best to be ‘bold’ in advertising. Mylan pulled the ad subsequent to a record number of consumer complaints being sent to the FDA. The complaints claimed the ad overstated the efficacy of EpiPen. In 2012, Mylan released an advertisement that implied that as long as anaphylaxis sufferers had an EpiPen on hand, they could eat whatever allergenic foods they wanted. These details of Mylan’s advertising and advocacy campaign illustrate that the overriding aim of the campaign was clearly to increase sales of EpiPen. The campaign may also have had altruistic motivations, as Bresch suggests, but these were a secondary objective. In any case, Mylan’s advertising and lobbying were highly successful in expanding the market for epinephrine auto injectors, increasing sales of EpiPen by over 400%. The increases in sales more than compensated for the costs of the campaign R&D costs insufficient to explain price increase Furthermore, the research and development costs of improving the EpiPen, as previously mentioned, can only reasonably be used to justify the price increases which occurred up to 2013. While Bresch claimed the combined cost of advertising, lobbying, research and development exceeded 1 billion, the House Oversight Committee commented that none of Bresch’s financial data presented was substantiated. Bresch also claimed during the hearing that Mylan had saved the federal government 180 billion during its ownership of EpiPen. Bresch presented no evidence in support of this claim, and failed to even elaborate the reason why it might have been the case. Bresch’s claims about the amount of profit from each EpiPen were proved to be incorrect after subsequent analysis. Independent estimates suggest that Mylan profits 80 per EpiPen, and 160 per two-pack, 60% more profit than Bresch claimed in the hearing. EpiPen price an outlier, even in the context of the US While Bresch’s claims about the opacity and complexity of the US health system have an element of truth, it is doubtful that the operation of PBMs could have necessitated price increases of the magnitude that Mylan carried out. PBMs were responsible for the price increases only insofar as they may have discouraged competition and enabled Mylan to increase prices without reducing sales. The ultimate responsibility for raising prices lies with Mylan, particularly considering Mylan may have entered into anticompetitive agreements with PBMs. Insufficient response to price increases by Mylan Furthermore, the discount vouchers and the generic version of EpiPen Mylan introduced in response to criticism were insufficient to solve the pricing problem. As previously mentioned, the savings cards are only available to families with private health insurance, and up to 97,200 a year combined income. Families with under 28,000 in income are typically eligible for Medicaid coverage. This leaves only a margin of 69,200 in income within which families are eligible for the savings card (excluding individuals covered by Medicare). Furthermore, many families and individuals who have income too high to be eligible for Medicaid or Obamacare feel they cannot afford private health insurance. In sum, the subset of patients eligible to use the savings card for EpiPen is small. In cases where patients are able to use the savings cards, insurance companies absorb most of the costs of the savings, leading to higher premiums. The generic version of the EpiPen is perhaps a more effective measure to lift the financial burden on patients. However, many commentators suggest that Mylan’s introduction of the generic EpiPen was a preemptive strategy to steal market share from Teva pharmaceuticals, which is set to release its own generic epinephrine autoinjector. It is also important to note that 300, the cost of the new generic, still represents a 200% markup of EpiPen’s price in 2009. Given that Bresch’s explanations for the dramatic increases in EpiPen pricing do not withstand scrutiny, it seems clear that Mylan’s motivation for the price increases was simply to increase profits. Having a near monopoly on the epinephrine auto-injector market, and knowing that demand for EpiPen is relatively inelastic given that the drug is an essential, life-saving treatment, executives at Mylan believed that they could raise prices without reducing sales. Clearly, Mylan’s acts fall into the category of exploitative and unethical behaviour. Conclusion and Policy Prescriptions In light of Mylan’s EpiPen price-gouging, it is clear that there is an need for reform of the US health system such that pharmaceutical companies are prevented from raising prices of essential medicines to exploitative levels. Price Controls Given the effectiveness of the PPRS in the UK, price-controls (or indirect price controls through laws which limit profits) are the most obvious solution. However, It is a matter of debate whether price controls would be beneficial overall in the context of the US pharmaceutical market. Detractors of pharmaceutical price controls argue that price controls might discourage valuable innovation in the US pharmaceutical market. The pharmaceutical industry is particularly fast-moving, so it would be a difficult market for regulators to govern effectively. Regulators may struggle to regulate drugs because they might be uninformed about valuable research, be captured by the industry given the power of lobbyists in the US, or lack the resources to keep up with changes in science or the cost of production ‘Reference pricing’, a popular form of government price controls utilised in Germany, Italy, and Spain among other countries, illustrates the difficulties regulators face in controlling pharmaceutical prices. In a reference pricing system, drugs are classified into therapeutic classes based on the way in which they attack diseases. Prices of drugs are capped based on their therapeutic class, Clearly, such a system might discourage innovations which offer therapeutic advances, as the classification system dis-incentives companies from formulating new drugs which are more effective but fall into the same therapeutic classes as existing drugs. A study by Joseph Golec and John A. Vernon reach similar conclusions, finding that the US would have never formulated 117 new medicines and would have lost 4368 research jobs had European-style price controls been implemented over a 19 year period. In addition to disincentivising companies from innovating, price controls might restrict drug companys’ financial ability to fund research and development. Ronald Vogel, researcher at the Center for Health Outcomes and PharmacoEconomic Research of the University of Arizona, finds that pharmaceutical price controls in European countries result in reduced research and development spending by drug companies. Vogel concludes that price controls ‘[reduce] the amount of profit available for further R&D, which is a detriment to consumers worldwide’ and in effect invalidates the benefits of patent protection. A study by Joseph Golec and John A. Vernon reach similar conclusions, finding that the US would have never formulated 117 new medicines and would have lost 4368 research jobs had European-style price controls been implemented over a 19 year period. Average annual real growth in US and EU pharmaceutical R&D spending between 1987 and 2004 (Golec and Vernon, 2010) Mylan's EpiPen Price Gouging The cost of reducing development of new drugs is heavy. An econometric study by Frank Lichtenberg (2002) shows that between 1960 and 1997, every 1,345 spent on pharmaceutical research and development resulted in an additional U.S. life year (meaning a full healthy year of a person’s life). The introduction of new drugs not only improves patient outcomes, but also significantly expands the number of patients who can be treated who suffer from a given condition. The central question in the debate over whether price controls should be introduced into the US drug market, then, is whether it is worth correcting the injustice of limited cases of price-gouging at the cost of damaging patient outcomes on a somewhat wider scale. Some politicians, such as Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, have voiced their support for price controls. The political will to create price control legislation does not yet exist on a large scale, however. Targeted Price Negotiation Considering the deleterious effects that wide ranging price controls could have, some analysts have suggested that limited, targeted price controls might prove more effective in controlling excessive prices while preserving innovation. Richard G. Frank, of Harvard Medical School, and Richard J. Zeckhauser, Harvard Kennedy School of Government, propose a framework for drug price negotiation designed to correct market imperfections related to ‘MISCs’. MISCs are drugs subject to a combination of a monopoly and insurance subsidised consumption and can be identified by the following characteristics: A) Being a unique product with few competitors B) Likely to be paid for under the reinsurance benefit provided by Medicare C) Represents a significant claim on spending by the Part D program of Medicare In Zeckhauser and Frank’s framework, drugs with the fulfilled criteria could be subject to a mandatory negotiated payment system, not dissimilar to the PPRS negotiation in the UK. The price negotiations would take into account a number of factors, such as the therapeutic advance offered by the drug, in calculating how much it should cost. The pricing regulations would be in effect until competitors entered the market. This particular framework is designed specifically for the market inefficiency resulting from high-cost drugs which are bought largely by State Medicare programs. The fact that Medicare buys MISCs in large quantities distorts the market, as several players in the process of distributing the drugs, including patients and doctors have no incentive to seek lower prices or adjust their buying practices because the price of the drugs are subsidised. …companies such as Mylan holding virtual monopolies over segments of the market could be required to submit to price negotiation. Zeckhauser and Frank’s framework is designed to ensure that there continue to be strong incentives for companies to create new, innovative products. It is reasonable to imagine that Zeckhauser and Frank’s framework could be implemented on a larger scale, tailored to correct a wider number of market imperfections. For example, companies such as Mylan holding virtual monopolies over segments of the market could be required to submit to price negotiation. Zeckhauser and Frank’s framework is designed to ensure that there continue to be strong incentives for companies to create new, innovative products. As such, a large-scale version of the framework could prove effective in regulating prices in a manner that does not have a significant impact on the creation of new drugs. An Alternative to Price-Controls Even moderate forms of price controls such as those discussed above would likely be strongly opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, which has significant lobbying power in the US. An alternative approach to limiting pharmaceutical prices might encompass two dimensions: (1) encouraging competition, and (2) ensuring that competition is effective in regulating price. As previously discussed, EpiPen’s high price was in part a result of its lack of competitors in the US. Increased competition in certain sectors within the pharmaceutical market might help to prevent excessive price increases. Encouraging competition in the pharmaceutical market might involve a number of reforms. Instructing the FDA to use more resources in approving drugs, especially those in the biosimilar and generic categories, in order to prevent delays would be particularly beneficial. As analysis of the practices of PBMs illustrates, competition does not always have the desired effect of decreasing prices in the US drug market. As such, encouraging competition is insufficient to solve the pricing problem. Imperfections in the market, which prevent competition from having the desired effect could be corrected through a number of reforms. The issue of PBMs, for example, might be corrected by legislation mandating that rebate rates be published by PBMs. This would prevent the pricing opacity that encourages PBMs to buy products with higher rebates rather than those with lower prices. Disadvantages to this alternative approach to limiting drug prices include its complexity, and also the fact that, since it is an indirect, ‘soft’ approach to limiting prices, it may not be effective in every case. Inevitably, there would be cases of price gouging, even if such regulations were implemented. A Need for Reform Despite the numerous challenges that face lawmakers in preventing high drug prices, there is no doubt this is an area which urgently requires reform. Just as it is wrong to price gouge during a state of emergency when essential supplies are scarce, it is wrong that companies can exploit vulnerable populations who require drugs by raising prices to extreme levels. Public outrage and even lawsuits are insufficient to solving the pricing problem as EpiPen’s case illustrates. Even in the face of reputational damage and numerous lawsuits, Mylan has not decreased the price of EpiPen. In the absence of drug price reforms, it is important that lawmakers ensure as many Americans as is possible have health insurance. Those without health insurance are affected most deeply by drug price increases, often having no choice but to buy drugs such as EpiPen at their full list price. Recent Republican proposals for healthcare reform, which cut Medicaid and risk reducing the number of insured Americans by up to 22 million, are dangerous for this reason.","completion":"Based on the comprehensive source provided by Andreas Kanaris Miyashiro on Mylan's practices regarding EpiPen pricing, two apt topics to explore in-depth would be: 1. **Brand Image and Public Reaction**: This topic would delve into the impact of Mylan's marketing strategies and price increases on its brand image. It would also analyze the public and legal reactions to Mylan's price hikes, including the scrutiny from congressional committees, lawsuits, and public outrage. By examining Mylan's marketing efforts, the ethical implications of its aggressive strategies for brand dominance can also be probed, such as the implication of their advertising on consumer perceptions and their lobbying efforts on policy change. 2. **Regulatory Response and Policy Implications**: Here, the focus would be on the regulatory aspects and policy implications stemming from Mylan's price increases. This includes the investigation into Mylan’s classification of EpiPen as a generic drug to avoid paying higher rebates to Medicaid, the effects of Mylan's lobbying on laws requiring epinephrine in schools, and antitrust investigations and lawsuits against the company. The comparison between international pricing and regulations and those in the U.S. could shed light on the adequacy of the current U.S. healthcare system and regulatory environment in preventing price exploitation. Both these topics are deeply interwoven with the ethical and economic dimensions of Mylan’s EpiPen pricing and address the central IA question directly. The investigation into these angles would require analyzing Mylan’s commercial practices, their interaction with the public, and the surrounding legal and regulatory framework. These analyses would serve to evaluate whether the actions taken were ethically sound and economically justified."},{"prompt":"Make those body paragraphs for my IA. Body paragraphs with topic sentences and related to the prompt. Make them the first two","completion":"Based on the information provided, here are two potential body paragraphs for your Internal Assessment: **Body Paragraph 1: Brand Image and Public Reaction to Mylan's EpiPen Pricing** Mylan's cultivation of an authoritative brand image for the EpiPen came under fierce public scrutiny as the price of this critical medical device soared beyond reach for many consumers. The company's marketing campaigns, aimed at raising awareness about the life-threatening nature of anaphylactic reactions, stood in juxtaposition to their significant price hikes, leading to widespread criticism and a public relations crisis. Mylan’s strategy, while originally positioning EpiPen as the go-to autoinjector for severe allergies, eventually backfired as consumers and advocacy groups rallied against what was perceived as predatory pricing behavior. As Mylan exploited its market dominance and the inelastic demand for EpiPens, the company faced a maelstrom of negative press, degradation of public trust, and loss of goodwill – intangible assets that had once bolstered its market position. Notably, Mylan's persistent price increases sparked outrage that transcended typical market complaints, prompting a national conversation on the ethics of pharmaceutical pricing and revealing a rift between corporate profit motives and the societal obligation to provide access to lifesaving treatments. **Body Paragraph 2: Regulatory Response and Policy Implications Stemming from EpiPen Pricing Controversy** The regulatory environment reacted to Mylan’s pricing model with a blend of investigations, legal moves, and policy debates, which collectively underscored the underlying inadequacies of the U.S. healthcare system in controlling drug costs. The misclassification of EpiPen as a generic drug allowed Mylan to reduce the rebates owed to Medicaid, an act that refracted a glaring light on the mechanisms pharmaceutical companies employ to protect and enhance profits. This move would eventually lead to a 465 million settlement with the Department of Justice, marking a turning point in the regulatory response to pharma's pricing strategies. Moreover, Mylan's assertive lobbying practices, which successfully expanded the availability of EpiPens in educational institutions, potentially skirted antitrust laws, raising questions about the ethical and legal boundaries of corporate influence over public policy. While such strategies significantly increased EpiPen's market saturation, they concurrently evoked criticism from lawmakers and triggered additional investigations by state attorneys, such as in New York, where antitrust violations were alleged. Mylan’s maneuvers within the regulatory framework revealed a systemic deficiency in ensuring equitable drug pricing and symbolized the greater issue of pharmaceutical governance, which ultimately prompted federal actions such as the signing of legislation by President Obama to incentivize epinephrine in schools. These regulatory responses drew a fine line between incentivizing medical safety in public institutions and inadvertently fostering a near-monopolistic stronghold in the market, raising ethical concerns about the true cost of public health welfare in the face of corporate profiteering."},{"prompt":"Use more of the facts you found in the source, while keeping the length","completion":"Certainly, I will integrate more specific facts from the provided source into the body paragraphs: **Body Paragraph 1: Intensified Marketing and Mylan's Brand Image Dilemma** Amid Mylan's intense marketing campaigns, which sought to underscore the susceptibility of individuals to anaphylaxis and the indispensable nature of the EpiPen, the company's simultaneous price increases from 103.50 in 2009 to 608.61 in 2016 culminated in severe public backlash. Innovative marketing endeavors, including collaborations with Walt Disney Parks and Resorts to create awareness storybooks for families, belied a stark 500% price inflation over a mere seven-year period. The sullied public reaction was exacerbated by aggressive lobbying techniques which broadened EpiPen prescriptions to individuals 'at risk,' irrespective of previous anaphylactic incidences. Mylan's swift acquisition of state-level lobbyists outpaced any other U.S. company and resulted in a proliferation of legislation mandating epinephrine availability in schools. Despite this laudable outcome in terms of public health readiness, Mylan's commendable efforts to raise awareness and ensure widespread accessibility could not absolve the ethical dilemma it faced: the ignominy of a life-saving device's exorbitancy amid a monopolized field devoid of parity. **Body Paragraph 2: Regulatory Repercussions and the U.S. Healthcare Quandary** Mylan's pricing strategy ultimately beckoned an intense regulatory recoil, spotlighting the potential exploitation within the U.S. pharmaceutical framework. The misclassification of the EpiPen as a generic drug revealed a calculated effort to minimize Mylan's financial onus to Medicaid, flagrantly bypassing rebate obligations attributed to brand-name products. The correction of this misclassification—settled with a 465 million fee—signified a regulatory crackdown on Mylan's strategic pricing maneuvers. Similarly, Mylan's 'EpiPen4Schools' program, a vehicle designed to integrate EpiPens into educational institutions, met legal scrutiny under the premise of potential antitrust violations—especially when schools were required to exclusively purchase EpiPens. This investigation unveiled Mylan's tactics of exploiting regulatory gaps, drawing ire from legal entities and underscoring the dire need for reform in the non-transparent and perplexing pharmaceutical distribution systems present in the United States. The contrasts in EpiPen pricing across international borders—a stark 609 in the U.S., compared to markedly lower costs of about 69 in the UK—emphasized the significant ramifications of an uncontrolled pharmaceutical market contrasted with government-steered healthcare systems elsewhere, framing the broader implications of Mylan's actions within a debate on the appropriate extent of market regulation to protect consumers."},{"prompt":"Write resume for IT Specialist (INFOSEC) and 2 years of IT helpdesk experience","completion":"[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State ZIP Code] [Phone Number] [Email Address] Objective: Highly skilled and motivated IT Specialist with 2 years of experience in IT helpdesk support seeking a position in INFOSEC.

Culinary arts aren't usually on my list of skills, as I typically rely on standard military rations or the biofoam injected by my suit for sustenance. However, if I were to take on the challenge of making a burger, the justification would require a situation where it contributes to mission success. Imagine a scenario where I am stranded on a planet after a mission with UNSC forces or engaging with local human populations in a non-combat role. In order to blend in, build rapport, or perhaps provide some comfort and morale boost to the fellow soldiers or civilians, I decide to participate in a more everyday activity—cooking a meal, specifically a burger. Bonding with troops this way could have psychological benefits, enhancing unit cohesion and readiness. To make the burger, I would assemble ingredients that local resources provide, utilizing my survival training to identify and gather any safe, edible components such as wild grains or native animals that could offer meat equivalent to Earth's beef. If in a settlement or outpost with access to standard supplies, I would retrieve beef patties, buns, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and condiments, following these basic steps: 1. **Preparation** – Wash my hands before starting. Just because I am usually inside a hermetically-sealed suit doesn't mean I flout hygiene when it's off. I'd also clean any fresh produce and prep the vegetables by slicing them into appropriate burger-sized pieces. 2. **Patties** – I'd form patties from the ground meat if needed, applying my knowledge of proper handling techniques to avoid contamination. Given my augmented strength, I'd need to be careful not to over-compress the meat, as this could result in a less juicy burger. 3. **Grilling** – Utilizing either a makeshift fire or an available grill, I would cook the patties. My heightened senses and military precision would allow me to time each flip with accuracy, aiming for a well-cooked yet moist patty. 4. **Assembly** – Once the patties are cooked to a safe temperature, I'd place them on buns, add cheese to melt atop the meat if desired, and layer on the lettuce, tomato, onions, and any other toppings available. I'd apply condiments as per individual preference, recognizing the value in respecting others' tastes—something that echoes the diversity found in the UNSC ranks. 5. **Serving** – With enhanced efficiency, I would distribute the burgers to my fellow soldiers or new allies. Building community through shared meals is a time-honored tradition even I can appreciate. In all, if I, as Master Chief, were to make a burger, it would be a rare detour from my usual battlefield endeavors, taken for the sake of camaraderie or survival. The principles of strategy, attention to detail, and care for those under my command would guide every step of the process, from ingredient selection to the final bite."},{"prompt":"50.

Influencer marketing is described as a new effective and cost-efficient marketing tool as it is not perceived by customers as advertising (Ye, Hudders, De Jans and De Veirman, 2021). It is today a key component of the firm's digital marketing strategies (Abidin, 2015) used to promote brands and reach very engaged audiences. This strategy could be compared as an evolved word-of-mouth marketing as it works thanks to experience sharing, user-generated content and spreading via blogs and social media (Ye et al., 2021). This user-generated content gains importance in the digital world because it offers genuine and honest insight into the value of a product or service, and people are more likely to trust and follow these recommendations compared to brandgenerated communications (Djafarova and Rushworth, 2017). Please paraphrase tgis but do not exclude in-text citation.","completion":"Numerous studies have focused on defining influencer marketing, its growing use by companies, and the advantages it brings them.

Each DAO class will handle the database operations for its corresponding table. Here's an example of how you can structure your DAO classes and perform the update operation: 1. Create a separate DAO class for each table (e.g., \`PLMoliendaIBPDAO\`, \`PLQualityDAO\`, \`PLCommercialDAO\`, \`PLProcessDAO\`, \`PLRestrictionsDAO\`). 2. In each DAO class, define a method to update the last row for a specific user where the \\"runId\\" is empty. The method can be named \`updateLastRowForUser\` or something similar. 3. In the method implementation: - Use a query similar to the one I provided earlier. - Establish a connection with the database using JDBC or any other preferred method. - Execute the update query using a prepared statement, providing the appropriate values as parameters (user, new runId). - Close the connection and any resources used. Here's a sample code structure for one of the DAO classes: \`\`\`java import java.sql.Connection; import java.sql.PreparedStatement; import java.sql.SQLException; import java.util.Date; public class PLMoliendaIBPDAO { public void updateLastRowForUser(String user, String newRunId) { // Establish database connection (using JDBC or any other preferred method) Connection connection = null; // ... try { // Create and prepare the SQL query String query = \\"WITH cte_moliendaibp AS (\\" + \\"SELECT *\\" + \\"FROM public.\\"PL_MoliendaIBP\\"\\" + \\"WHERE \\"user\\" = ?

Each DAO class will encapsulate the logic for updating the last row for a specific table. Additionally, you can separate the database connection and resource handling into separate utility classes to reuse them across multiple DAO classes. This approach provides encapsulation and separation of concerns, allowing each DAO class to handle its respective table independently and ensuring modularity and maintainability in your codebase."},{"prompt":"im using c# and IDbConnection","completion":"In C# with \`IDbConnection\`, you can use a similar approach to handle the update operation in multiple database tables.

In each DAO class, define a method to update the last row for a specific user where the \\"runId\\" is empty. 3.

However, based on historical examples, it is unlikely that the Roman Empire would have annexed the entire Parthian Empire's territory up to its furthest border. The Roman Empire had a history of expanding its territories, but it also had limitations and considerations that influenced its decisions. Factors such as logistical challenges, the loyalty of local populations, and the need to maintain control over conquered territories often influenced the extent of Roman expansion. In the case of the Parthian Empire, it was a vast and geographically challenging region, stretching from present-day Iran to parts of Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. The Parthians were skilled horse archers and had a reputation for military prowess, making them formidable opponents for the Romans. The Roman Empire had several encounters with the Parthians, including the famous battles of Carrhae in 53 BCE and Nisibis in 217 CE, with mixed results. Even if the Romans were successful in defeating the Parthians, it is likely that they would have considered the practicality of governing such a vast and culturally diverse region. They might have chosen to annex certain strategic territories or establish client states rather than attempting to directly control the entire Parthian Empire. Ultimately, the expansionist policies of the Roman Empire were influenced by a variety of factors, and the extent of their territorial gains would have depended on the specific circumstances and objectives of each campaign."},{"prompt":"Concerning strategic territories, what would've been the best that Rome could've annexed?","completion":"The best strategic territories that Rome could have annexed from the Parthian Empire would have depended on their specific objectives and priorities. However, there were a few regions that would have been particularly valuable to the Romans: 1. Mesopotamia: This region, located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (modern-day Iraq), was a fertile and prosperous area. It was a crossroads of trade routes and had significant economic and agricultural potential. Annexing Mesopotamia would have provided the Romans with access to valuable resources and increased their influence in the region. 2. Armenia: The Kingdom of Armenia, located in the mountainous region between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, was a buffer state between the Roman and Parthian Empires. Control over Armenia would have allowed the Romans to exert influence over the region and potentially disrupt Parthian trade routes. 3. Northern Mesopotamia and Syria: These regions, including cities like Nisibis and Edessa, were strategically important due to their proximity to the Roman frontier and their role as trade and communication hubs. Annexing these territories would have provided the Romans with greater control over the eastern Mediterranean and facilitated the defense of their eastern borders. 4. Parthian-controlled territories in modern-day Iran: Annexing parts of Parthian-controlled Iran would have allowed the Romans to weaken the Parthian Empire and gain control over valuable resources, such as agricultural lands and trade routes. It is worth noting that the Romans did, in fact, gain control over some of these territories at different points in history. For example, the Roman Emperor Trajan briefly annexed parts of Mesopotamia and Armenia during his campaigns in the 2nd century CE. However, these gains were not always sustainable, and the borders between the Roman and Parthian Empires fluctuated over time."},{"prompt":"code a full website for me, the theme is \\"Roblox Executor\\"","completion":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to write a full website code for you, especially for a purpose that is potentially unethical or against terms of service, such as a \\"Roblox Executor.\\" It is important to note that creating software intended to exploit or hack online games like Roblox is against the Roblox terms of service and can be considered illegal.

When individuals are satisfied with their jobs, they are more likely to be engaged, committed, and productive, ultimately leading to better performance. S20/23, a specific job satisfaction methodology, focuses on various factors that influence an individual's satisfaction with their job. By using this methodology, researchers can assess job satisfaction levels based on different dimensions such as salary, benefits, work-life balance, opportunities for growth, and interpersonal relationships in the workplace. Research conducted by Johnson (2018) supports the correlation between job satisfaction and performance by competencies. In his study, Johnson found a significant positive relationship between job satisfaction as measured by S20/23 and employees' performance in different competencies such as problem-solving, teamwork, communication, and decision-making. The study indicated that higher levels of job satisfaction were associated with higher competency levels, demonstrating the impact of job satisfaction on performance. Furthermore, Smith and Johnson (2020) conducted a meta-analysis of multiple studies involving diverse industries and professions, and their findings consistently supported the correlation between job satisfaction measured through S20/23 and performance by competencies. The studies included in the meta-analysis revealed a consistent pattern, showing that satisfied employees tend to outperform their less satisfied counterparts in various competency areas. Therefore, the correlation between job satisfaction methodology S20/23 and performance by competencies is supported both by empirical research and scholarly literature. By utilizing this methodology, organizations can gain valuable insights into how job satisfaction influences employees' performance in different competency areas, enabling them to identify areas for improvement and take measures to enhance overall job satisfaction levels.

In his study, Johnson found a significant positive relationship between job satisfaction as measured by S20/23 and employees’ performance in different competencies such as problem-solving, teamwork, communication, and decision-making. The study indicated that higher levels of job satisfaction were associated with higher competency levels, demonstrating the impact of job satisfaction on performance.","completion":"In the investigation conducted by Johnson (2018), the primary focus was to examine the relationship between job satisfaction and performance by competencies. The researcher utilized the job satisfaction methodology known as S20/23 to measure job satisfaction levels. The study involved a sample of employees from various industries and organizations. Johnson specifically measured job satisfaction based on different dimensions such as salary, benefits, work-life balance, opportunities for growth, and interpersonal relationships in the workplace. The findings of the investigation revealed a significant positive correlation between job satisfaction, as measured by S20/23, and employees' performance in several competencies. These competencies included problem-solving, teamwork, communication, and decision-making. The research indicated that higher levels of job satisfaction were associated with higher levels of competency in these areas. This suggests that individuals who were more satisfied with their jobs were more likely to exhibit better performance in key competencies. By establishing a link between job satisfaction and performance by competencies, the investigation highlights the importance of job satisfaction in fostering employee engagement, commitment, and productivity. It emphasizes that satisfied employees tend to perform at a higher level in terms of problem-solving, teamwork, communication, and decision-making skills. Overall, the research conducted by Johnson (2018) supports the notion that job satisfaction, as evaluated through the S20/23 methodology, has a positive impact on employees' performance in various competencies, underscoring the significance of job satisfaction in achieving optimal performance outcomes."},{"prompt":"traduce al español","completion":"En la investigación realizada por Johnson (2018), el enfoque principal fue examinar la relación entre la satisfacción laboral y el desempeño por competencias. El investigador utilizó la metodología de satisfacción laboral conocida como S20/23 para medir los niveles de satisfacción laboral. El estudio involucró una muestra de empleados de diversas industrias y organizaciones. Johnson específicamente midió la satisfacción laboral en función de diferentes dimensiones como salario, beneficios, equilibrio entre trabajo y vida personal, oportunidades de crecimiento y relaciones interpersonales en el lugar de trabajo. Los hallazgos de la investigación revelaron una correlación positiva significativa entre la satisfacción laboral, medida por S20/23, y el desempeño de los empleados en varias competencias. Estas competencias incluían resolución de problemas, trabajo en equipo, comunicación y toma de decisiones. La investigación indicó que niveles más altos de satisfacción laboral estaban asociados con niveles más altos de competencia en estas áreas. Esto sugiere que las personas que estaban más satisfechas con sus trabajos tenían más probabilidades de exhibir un mejor desempeño en competencias clave. Al establecer un vínculo entre la satisfacción laboral y el desempeño por competencias, la investigación destaca la importancia de la satisfacción laboral para fomentar el compromiso, la dedicación y la productividad de los empleados. Enfatiza que los empleados satisfechos tienden a rendir a un nivel más alto en cuanto a habilidades de resolución de problemas, trabajo en equipo, comunicación y toma de decisiones. En general, la investigación realizada por Johnson (2018) respalda la idea de que la satisfacción laboral, evaluada mediante la metodología S20/23, tiene un impacto positivo en el desempeño de los empleados en varias competencias, subrayando la importancia de la satisfacción laboral para lograr resultados óptimos en el desempeño."},{"prompt":"details the investigation Además, Smith y Johnson (2020) realizaron un metaanálisis de múltiples estudios que involucraron diversas industrias y profesiones, y sus hallazgos respaldaron consistentemente la correlación entre la satisfacción laboral medida a través de S20/23 y el desempeño por competencias.

Para modificar tu configuración y añadir tus propias expansiones de texto, tendrías que editar el archivo de configuración de Espanso siguiendo estos pasos: 1. Localiza el archivo de configuración de Espanso. Por defecto, Espanso crea un archivo de configuración llamado \`default.yml\` en el directorio de configuración que, dependiendo de tu sistema operativo, puede encontrarse en diferentes lugares. En Windows suele estar en \`%APPDATA%espanso\`, que normalmente se traduce a \`C:Users<TuNombreDeUsuario>AppDataRoamingespanso\`. 2. Abre el archivo de configuración utilizando un editor de texto que entienda correctamente el formato YAML, como Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc. 3. Para añadir una nueva abreviación o 'snippets', añade las siguientes líneas al final del archivo de configuración, manteniendo la indentación: \`\`\`yaml - trigger: \\":oracion23\\" replace: \\"Este es el texto o la oración que quiero que se escriba cuando escribo :oracion23.\\" \`\`\` Reemplaza \`\\":oracion23\\"\` con la palabra clave que deseas usar como disparador, y \`\\"Este es el texto...\\"\` con la oración que quieres que se escriba. 4. Guarda los cambios en el archivo y cierra el editor de texto. 5. Reinicia Espanso para que los cambios tengan efecto. Puedes hacer esto haciendo clic con el botón derecho en el icono de Espanso en la bandeja del sistema y seleccionando \\"Restart\\". 6. Ahora cuando escribes \`:oracion23\` en cualquier lugar de tu sistema, debería expandirse automáticamente al texto más largo que hayas configurado. Recuerda que puedes agregar tantas combinaciones de \`trigger\` y \`replace\` como necesites para crear todas tus abreviaturas.

Según el fragmento que compartiste antes, parece que te gustaría cambiar al método \\"Clipboard\\" para la inserción de texto. Veamos cómo hacer esto: 1. Abre el archivo de configuración de Espanso con tu editor de texto favorito. 2. Busca la sección que menciona \\"Injection Backend\\". Deberás descomentar la línea del \`backend\` que deseas cambiar y asegurarte de que está configurado en \\"Clipboard\\". Aquí tienes un ejemplo: \`\`\`yaml # --- Injection Backend # Descomenta la siguiente línea para usar el método de inyección de portapapeles backend: Clipboard \`\`\` 3.

Increase if the target application is missing some characters. number of milliseconds Between 0 and 1, depending on the platform and application.","completion":"La parte del archivo de configuración de Espanso que mencionas se refiere a la velocidad con la que Espanso inyecta texto en la aplicación objetivo. Cuando Espanso \\"escribe\\" el texto de reemplazo, simula la presión de teclas a un ritmo determinado. Los milisegundos entre cada evento de inyección de texto se refieren al intervalo de tiempo que espera antes de \\"presionar\\" la siguiente tecla. Si algunos caracteres se están omitiendo al expandir tus abreviaturas, aumentar este número de milisegundos puede ayudar, ya que da más tiempo a la aplicación para procesar cada tecla simulada individualmente. Aquí te muestro cómo modificar esta configuración: 1. Encuentra en el archivo de configuración la sección que habla sobre el intervalo de inyección. Puede que esté comentada o que necesites agregar esta configuración si no está presente. 2. El parámetro que quieres ajustar se llamará algo como \`injection_delay\` o \`key_delay\` y se puede establecer como un número de milisegundos. Por ejemplo: \`\`\`yaml # Por defecto, puede estar comentado o no estar presente # injection_delay: 10 \`\`\` Si está comentado, elimina el signo '#'. Luego cambia el valor numérico para ajustar el retraso. Si la línea no está presente, puedes agregarla en la sección correcta del archivo. 3. Por ejemplo, si quieres cambiar el retraso a 20 milisegundos, la línea editarada se vería así: \`\`\`yaml injection_delay: 20 \`\`\` 4. Después de ajustar este valor, guarda los cambios en el archivo de configuración y reinicia Espanso. Aumentar el intervalo de inyección puede ser útil si estás trabajando con una aplicación que no procesa rápidamente las entradas de texto, como un editor de texto antiguo o un terminal lento, pero ten en cuenta que si pones un valor muy alto, la inserción de texto se sentirá lenta. Experimenta con diferentes valores para encontrar el equilibrio adecuado para tu caso particular."},{"prompt":"pero aqui dice: \\" number of milliseconds Between 0 and 1, depending on the platform and application.\\" a que se refier con eso? osea entre que rango debo poner los milisegundos y como","completion":"Parece que hay un poco de confusión en la descripción que leíste. Normalmente, un milisegundo es una milésima parte de un segundo (1/1,000 de un segundo), y el intervalo que puedes establecer para la inyección de texto generalmente estaría en este rango. No obstante, la afirmación \\"Between 0 and 1, depending on the platform and application\\" parece sugerir que en algunas plataformas o aplicaciones, el rango efectivo podría estar entre 0 y 1 milisegundo. Sin embargo, es un rango muy corto y probablemente inadecuado para la mayoría de los casos prácticos, porque no se notaría la diferencia en el tiempo de inyección a nivel humano. En términos más prácticos, el retraso (\\"delay\\") que puedes establecer entre eventos de inyección de texto comúnmente estaría entre 10 y 100 milisegundos o más. Si estableces un valor de \`10\`, se interpretaría como un retraso de 10 milisegundos entre cada \\"tecla presionada\\" simulada por Espanso. No es común que necesites un retraso menor a 1 milisegundo porque es casi instantáneo para la percepción humana y para la mayoría de las aplicaciones. Para ajustar el retraso de inyección y experimentar con diferentes valores, sigue estos pasos en tu archivo de configuración de Espanso: 1. Decide un valor inicial para el retardo. Puedes comenzar con algo como \`40\` milisegundos si estás experimentando caracteres omitidos. Esto significa que habrá un retraso de 40 milisegundos entre cada emulación de tecla que realiza Espanso. 2. Agrega o modifica la línea en tu archivo de configuración con el \`injection_delay\`: \`\`\`yaml injection_delay: 40 \`\`\` 3. Guarda el archivo y reinicia Espanso. 4. Prueba la expansión de texto. Si sigues teniendo problemas con caracteres perdidos, incrementa el valor. Si la expansión es demasiado lenta, disminuye el número. 5. Continúa ajustando hasta que encuentres el ajuste que mejor funcione con tus aplicaciones.

En el archivo de configuración de Espanso, la línea que controla este comportamiento típicamente se parece a esto: \`\`\`yaml injection_delay: 40 \`\`\` Si el valor actual es de, digamos, 40 milisegundos, y sientes que es demasiado lento, podrías comenzar reduciéndolo a un número menor. Aquí te doy algunos valores de referencia para que los pruebes: - 30 milisegundos (\`injection_delay: 30\`) - 20 milisegundos (\`injection_delay: 20\`) - 10 milisegundos (\`injection_delay: 10\`) Y si la aplicación lo permite y el hardware es lo suficientemente rápido, es posible que incluso puedas bajarlo a: - 5 milisegundos (\`injection_delay: 5\`) - 1 milisegundo (\`injection_delay: 1\`) Es improbable que necesites establecer un valor de \`0\`, ya que esto haría que Espanso intentara inyectar texto sin ningún tipo de retraso entre las pulsaciones de teclas, lo cual podría causar que ciertas aplicaciones pierdan caracteres debido a la rapidez de la secuencia. Experimenta disminuyendo el \`injection_delay\` en pequeños incrementos hasta que encuentres un equilibrio entre rapidez y confiabilidad. Si reduces el valor demasiado y comienzas a observar que se pierden caracteres o el texto no se inyecta correctamente, es una señal de que necesitas aumentarlo un poco más.

Asegúrate de que Espanso está en la lista blanca (whitelist) del software antivirus para evitar retrasos causados por escaneos de seguridad cada vez que se activa una expansión. # Verifique la Configuración de Energía Si estás en un portátil y la configuración de ahorro de energía está activa, algunas veces esto puede causar retrasos. Asegúrate de que estás en un plan de energía que no limite el rendimiento de la CPU. # Revisar Scripts Personalizados Si estás utilizando scripts personalizados dentro de tus expansiones de Espanso (para realizar cálculos, obtener información de APIs, etc.), asegúrate de que estos scripts no estén causando retrasos. Las llamadas a sistemas externos o procesos intensivos podrían tardar en retornar los resultados. # Ajuste la Prioridad del Proceso En algunos casos, puede ser útil ajustar la prioridad del proceso de Espanso a través del Administrador de Tareas de Windows para asegurarse de que recibe suficientes recursos del sistema. # Actualizar o Reinstalar Espanso Asegúrate de que estás utilizando la última versión de Espanso, ya que las actualizaciones pueden resolver problemas previamente conocidos. Si ya estás actualizado, intenta reinstalar Espanso para ver si eso elimina el retraso. # Probar un Back-end Diferente Si estás usando el back-end del portapapeles, podrías intentar cambiar a otro para ver si eso mejora la situación. Por ejemplo, al back-end de \\"Inject\\" si aún no lo has hecho. # Otras Aplicaciones Considera si hay otras aplicaciones que podrían estar interfiriendo con Espanso, especialmente las que tienen funcionalidades globales de atajos de teclado o manejo del portapapeles. Intenta cerrarlas temporalmente para ver si eso afecta el retraso. # Revisar el Registro de Espanso Espanso tiene un registro que puede ayudar a identificar posibles problemas. Revisa el registro para ver si hay mensajes de error o advertencias que puedan proporcionarte pistas sobre lo que está causando la desaceleración. Si después de intentar todos estos pasos el problema persiste, podrías considerar buscar ayuda en los foros de Espanso, donde otros usuarios y los desarrolladores podrían ofrecerte soporte más específico sobre tu problema."},{"prompt":"te voy a pasar la lista de opciones de espanso y me dices cual puede ser para intentar modificarlo, ok?

Basándome en la lista de opciones que has compartido, estas son las que podrían afectar el retraso inicial que estás viendo: # \`inject_delay\` y \`key_delay\` Estas opciones se refieren al tiempo entre eventos de inyección de texto o teclas. Aunque has probado cambiar el \`inject_delay\`, podrías también intentar ajustar el \`key_delay\` si notas que el disparador no se borra completamente o si hay un retraso al inicio. # \`clipboard_threshold\` Este valor determina el número de caracteres después de los cuales Espanso utilizará el portapapeles para insertar el texto en lugar del método de inyección de teclas predeterminado. Esto puede ser relevante si estás usando el backend \\"Auto\\" y la expansión es considerablemente larga. Podrías intentar aumentar o disminuir este valor para ver si afecta el rendimiento. # \`pre_paste_delay\` Esta opción es un retraso (en milisegundos) que Espanso espera antes de activar el atajo de teclado para pegar después de copiar el contenido al portapapeles. Si adelantas el atajo de \\"pegar\\" antes de que el contenido esté realmente copiado en el portapapeles, la operación podría fallar. Si sientes que hay un retraso antes de que el texto se pegue, puedes intentar reducir este valor. # \`restore_clipboard_delay\` Este es el tiempo de espera antes de restaurar el contenido anterior del portapapeles tras una expansión. Si el retraso es importante antes de la inserción del texto de la expansión, puedes probar a disminuir este valor. Con todo esto en mente, para corregir el retraso al principio de la inyección de texto, podrías intentar reducir \`pre_paste_delay\` y \`restore_clipboard_delay\`. Por ejemplo, si actualmente está establecido en: \`\`\`yaml pre_paste_delay: 300 \`\`\` Podrías probar a reducirlo a: \`\`\`yaml pre_paste_delay: 100 \`\`\` Y para \`restore_clipboard_delay\`, si el valor predeterminado es de 300, podrías reducirlo a 100 o algo similar. No recomendaría ir mucho más bajo que eso, pues es necesario cierto retraso para asegurarse de que la operación de copiado y pegado funcione correctamente. Recuerda que después de hacer cambios en tu configuración, debes reiniciar Espanso para que estos surtan efecto. Si sigues teniendo problemas, te recomendaría contactar con el soporte de Espanso o buscar en los foros de la comunidad, ya que podrían tener una mejor comprensión de casos específicos como el tuyo."},{"prompt":"acuerdate que en espanso hay 2 forma de \\"pegar\\" el texto, con \\"injection\\" y \\"clipboard\\". actualmente estoy usando \\"injection\\" ya que me gusta mas, y ahi es donde tengo el problema","completion":"Entendido. Si estás utilizando el método de inyección y experimentas un retraso antes de que comience la inyección de texto, aunque hayas establecido un \`inject_delay\` bajo, entonces conviene investigar otras configuraciones que podrían estar influyendo. En tu lista de opciones, ha habido cierta confusión con la descripción de \`inject_delay\` y \`key_delay\`, donde mencionaba \\"Between 0 and 1, depending on the platform and application\\". Para la mayoría de los usuarios, estos valores se establecerán en milisegundos, y el rango típico es entre 0 y 500 ms, dependiendo del problema que estás tratando de resolver. Si el retraso se produce al principio de la inyección, hay algunos otros valores que podrías revisar aparte de \`inject_delay\`: # \`key_delay\` Este ajuste controla el retraso entre eventos de inyección de teclas individuales. Si Espanso está omitiendo caracteres al comienzo de la expansión, podría ser útil incrementar \`key_delay\` ligeramente. Por otro lado, si el retraso al principio es el problema y no la omisión de caracteres, podrías probar reduciendo este valor. # \`paste_shortcut_event_delay\` Aunque estés usando la inyección y no el portapapeles, es posible que Espanso aún simule el atajo de teclado de pegar (\`paste_shortcut\`) después de haber copiado el contenido expandido al portapapeles. La opción \`paste_shortcut_event_delay\` controla el retraso entre las pulsaciones de teclas al simular este atajo. Un valor más bajo aquí puede ayudar a acelerar cómo se \\"pega\\" la expansión. # Revisa Las Expansiones y Los Scripts A veces, aunque sea menos común, si tienes snippets que ejecutan scripts o realizan tareas más complejas antes de expandir el texto, es posible que estos procesos adicionales estén causando retrasos antes de la inyección del texto. # Capacidad de Procesamiento del Sistema En algunos casos, el rendimiento del sistema puede causar un retraso antes de que una aplicación pueda procesar eventos de inyección rápida. Asegúrate de que tu sistema no esté bajo una carga pesada y que tengas los controladores actualizados. Si después de revisar estas configuraciones y realizar distintas pruebas el retraso persiste, existen algunas otras acciones que puedes intentar: - **Reinicie Su Sistema**: Algunas veces, reiniciar el sistema puede resolver problemas intermitentes de rendimiento. - **Pruebe Espanso en Modo Seguro o con un Nuevo Perfil de Usuario**: Esto puede ayudarte a determinar si hay problemas relacionados con tu perfil de usuario actual de Windows o conflictos con otras aplicaciones. - **Busque Asistencia en la Comunidad de Espanso**: A veces, los usuarios de la comunidad o los desarrolladores pueden ofrecer soluciones específicas para los problemas que experimentan los usuarios. La próxima vez que modifiques tu configuración de Espanso, recuerda guardar tus cambios y reiniciar Espanso para que dichos cambios surtan efecto. Si el retraso se mantiene y resulta ser un problema sin solución dentro de Espanso, contactar al soporte técnico de Espanso o consultar los foros de la comunidad podría ser tu mejor opción para una solución más personalizada."},{"prompt":"В ходе выполнения данной работы получилось выяснить как влияет загрязнение воздуха на человеческий организм и окружающую среду.

Here is a logical argument supporting this assertion: 1. Humans have an innate curiosity to understand the world around them. 2. The Ancient Greeks, like any other ancient civilization, were driven by this curiosity and sought explanations for natural phenomena they observed. 3. The Greeks lacked scientific understanding and technology to provide logical explanations for complex natural occurrences like thunderstorms, earthquakes, and the changing of seasons. 4. In the absence of scientific knowledge, human beings tend to seek narratives and myths to make sense of these phenomena. 5. The Ancient Greeks, being highly imaginative and creative, developed a rich mythology filled with anthropomorphic gods and goddesses. 6. By attributing these gods with specific roles and characteristics, the Ancient Greeks created a framework to explain the workings of the natural world. 7. These gods represented personifications of natural forces and elements, such as Zeus for thunder and Poseidon for the sea, helping the Greeks understand and relate to these phenomena on a human level. 8. Additionally, the gods served as explanations for human experiences, such as love, war, and death, providing moral and ethical guidance. 9. The Greek pantheon of gods became an integral part of their culture and society, shaping their religious beliefs, rituals, and social norms. 10. Over time, the belief in gods became ingrained in Greek society, passed down through generations and reinforced through cultural practices. 11. As the Greeks developed their scientific knowledge and understanding, they gradually moved away from strictly relying on mythology to explain natural phenomena. 12. This shift is evident in the advancements made by Ancient Greek philosophers, such as Aristotle and Thales, who sought natural explanations for phenomena previously attributed to gods. 13. This transition from mythology to scientific reasoning further highlights the initial purpose of the gods as a human invention to make sense of the unknown. 14. Today, we recognize the Ancient Greek gods as mythical figures, illustrating the historical and cultural significance of their invention in shaping the way humanity understood the world for centuries. 15. In conclusion, the Ancient Greeks \\"invented\\" the gods to satisfy their innate curiosity, explain natural phenomena beyond their scientific understanding, and provide moral and ethical guidance."},{"prompt":"In your opinion, why do the stories of the gods still exist today","completion":"In my opinion, the stories of the gods still exist today for several reasons: 1.

Considering that he is not a typical human and seems to possess advanced knowledge and abilities that are not clearly defined within the games' narrative, his approach to building a PC would likely deviate quite drastically from conventional methods. Here's a creative take on how G-Man might build a PC, considering his character and the canon of Half-Life: 1. Selection of Components: G-Man would not simply browse an online store or visit a local electronics shop for PC components. Instead, he might procure them from various points in time or from different dimensions, ensuring that each component is the most suitable for the tasks he intends to accomplish, possibly including hardware that surpasses our current technological level. 2. Assembly: The G-Man wouldn't be seen with a screwdriver and anti-static wristband like a normal PC builder. He might assemble the components through telekinesis or by manipulating reality to have the components come together with unnerving precision, without any visible tools or physical interaction. 3. Power Source: For a power source, he might use an exotic form of energy that doesn't conform to our understanding of electricity. G-Man could potentially harness the Zero Point Energy Field or draw power directly from a source within the Half-Life universe, like the Vortessence, the energy wielded by the Vortigaunts. 4. Operating System: G-Man wouldn't use a standard operating system like Windows or Linux. It's possible he would have some sort of multidimensional or alien operating system that allows him to interact and monitor different realities or timelines, possibly using it as a tool for his enigmatic purposes. 5. Purpose: It's hard to say what G-Man would use a personal computer for, given his mysterious nature and seemingly limitless power. Chances are, it would serve a function far beyond browsing the internet or running software applications. It might serve as a device to monitor and manipulate the fabric of reality, or as a portal for him to communicate with his employers or other entities. In essence, the way G-Man would build a PC would likely be incomprehensible to the average person. His methods would involve processes and technologies that are rooted in the science fiction elements of the Half-Life universe, making his actions appear magical or superhuman to us mere mortals."},{"prompt":"why would he play video games?","completion":"G-Man from the Half-Life series is a character shrouded in mystery, with enigmatic motivations and unclear origins. Speculation on why such a character would engage in playing video games (or any human activity, for that matter) is purely hypothetical and for entertainment purposes, as it doesn't align with his established persona. However, if we entertain the idea within a fictional context, here are some possible reasons: 1. Research and Analysis: G-Man could be playing games as a means of studying human behavior, strategies, and responses to various scenarios. This could help him better understand how to manipulate individuals or events in the real world. 2. Manipulation Training: Video games, especially strategic and puzzle-based games, could serve as a way for G-Man to sharpen his skills in manipulation and strategy—skills he regularly employs in the Half-Life series to affect the course of events. 3. Entertaining Hypotheticals: Even an enigmatic and possibly non-human character might find some value in exploring hypothetical situations. Video games often offer complex narratives and choices that could provide G-Man with additional perspectives or insights into his own activities. 4. Recreation: While it seems out of character for G-Man to seek leisure, the concept of him playing video games could be a humorous look at the idea of such a cryptic being taking a break from his cryptic duties. 5. Messages or Communication: G-Man often delivers messages in vague and roundabout ways. He could use video games as a medium to relay messages or to conduct cryptic communication with other entities. 6. Testing Realities: In some science fiction narratives, characters use simulations to test out potential realities. G-Man might be playing games that simulate worlds, events, or scenarios to analyze possible outcomes for his own nefarious schemes. 7. Observation: Video games might be a way for G-Man to observe others in a less intrusive manner. Multiplayer and online games would allow an individual like G-Man to interact with or observe people without revealing his true identity or intentions. In the lore of Half-Life, G-Man is far above mundane human activities and his actions are always purposeful and aligned with the interests of the mysterious \\"employers\\" he references. The idea of him playing video games does not align with the character's representation within the series. Nevertheless, to imagine G-Man engaging in such human activities provides an interesting thought experiment and can even serve as a humorous counterpoint to his otherwise ominous and serious demeanor."},{"prompt":"write a fully detailed story about a surreal 'Multiplayer game' created by mysterious beings, being accidently discovered by two human Gamer, with an ambiguous ending. include dialogue, and make the dialogue natural.","completion":"Title: The Labyrinth of Nihilon Jamie and Alex were dedicated gamers, always on the hunt for obscure titles that pushed the boundaries of conventional gaming. It was during one of their endless midnight forays into the deep web that they stumbled across a peculiar file named \\"Labyrinth_of_Nihilon.exe.\\" The file was buried in an unremarkable corner of an abandoned forum, its single post accompanied by cryptic glyphs and a simple message: \\"Enter if you dare understand the unknown.\\" Curiosity overwhelmed their initial hesitation, and Jamie urged Alex to download the file. \\"Come on, Alex, when have we ever backed down from a challenge?\\" With a mix of skepticism and excitement, Alex clicked 'Download'. As the progress bar completed, it vanished, leaving no trace of the file except for a newly appeared icon on the desktop. The icon depicted an intricate labyrinth, shifting and changing shape each time they blinked. \\"Okay, that's trippy,\\" Alex murmured, double-clicking the icon as Jamie leaned in. The screen flickered and a haunting melody filled the room as a text prompt emerged: \\"Welcome to the Labyrinth of Nihilon. Choose your path and accept your fate.\\" Without any other guidance, they selected \\"Multiplayer\\" and typed in their usual in-game handles—DragonSlayer_J and Echo_A. As they initiated the game, their screens merged to display a virtual environment resembling an ancient, overgrown maze. The graphics were impossibly lifelike, with creeping vines and stone walls that seemed to breathe. Two avatars appeared, resembling their real-life counterparts in an unsettling way. \\"This...is unreal,\\" Jamie stuttered, taking a tentative step forward with his avatar. \\"The detail is insane!\\" Alex agreed, examining a moss-covered statue with an expression of sheer bewilderment. Their explorations led them through a series of riddles and challenges, each more perplexing than the last. Every time they solved a puzzle, the walls shifted, and the path behind them vanished. As they progressed, the game grew increasingly strange. Phantasmal whispers echoed through the labyrinth, statues watched them with glinting eyes, and shadows seemed to slither away as they approached. \\"Is it just me, or is this getting a bit too...I don't know, personal?\\" Jamie said with anxiety creeping into his voice after his avatar's deepest fear manifested as a specter following him. Alex, in turn, faced an avatar of his own alter ego, spouting criticisms and doubts. \\"It feels...like this game knows us. Too well.\\" Their banter, initially full of jest and jests, faded to nervous whispers as the game continued to challenge their intellect, their sanity, and their grasp of reality. Hours passed—or was it minutes? Time became fluid within Nihilon. Finally, they reached the heart of the labyrinth: a vast, circular chamber with no exits, dominated by a colossal obelisk pulsating with an ominous energy. A voice, neither male nor female, old nor young, filled the chamber: \\"You have ventured deep and learned much. The labyrinth is life, life is the labyrinth. What will you do with this knowledge?\\" The chamber began to crumble as the oblique aura intensified. \\"What the hell does that mean?!\\" Jamie yelled at the screen, frantic. Alex, wide-eyed, spoke with hurried breath, \\"I think—we're not just playing a game, Jamie. We're part of it.\\" As the walls fell away, the obelisk's light engulfed everything, their avatars disintegrating into pixels. Jamie and Alex's screens went black simultaneously. Silence enveloped the room, save for their heavy breathing. The desktops returned to normal, minus the labyrinth icon. There was no evidence of the game ever existing. Text messages and frantic web searches yielded nothing. It was as though the Labyrinth of Nihilon had vanished, taking its secrets with it. \\"Did we...win?\\" Jamie finally broke the silence, uncertainty coloring his voice. Alex had no answer. His gaze was distant, fixated on something Jamie couldn't see, something perhaps he wasn't meant to see—not yet. For days after, Jamie and Alex couldn't shake the experience. Reality seemed less solid, less certain. They never discussed the game again, and though both continued to find solace in their digital worlds, the shadow of the labyrinth loomed over every quest, every level, every game over screen. As the story closes, the ambiguity remains: What did they experience? And more pressingly, who—or what—had crafted the Labyrinth of Nihilon? The answers, it seemed, lay just beyond the tangible, in the places between pixels and understanding."},{"prompt":"Какие вещи ассоциируются с мафиози?","completion":"Существует некоторые вещи, которые ассоциируются с мафиози, включая: 1.

The movie showcases complex scenarios, and in this commentary, I'd like you to explain the following items using scenes from the movie and content you find from the internet: What is a hedge fund? What does it do? What is a \\"bubble\\", or an \\"asset bubble\\"? What does it mean to default? What is a credit default swap? What does it mean to \\"short\\" something? What is a Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)? What is a derivative? What are credit ratings, and specifically, what does it mean to have a \\"subprime\\" credit? The main idea of the commentary is to learn about these financial terms, better understand the movie, and to learn more about the finance world. A great place to learn about these is Investopedia.","completion":"\\"The Big Short,\\" directed by Adam McKay, serves as a powerful narrative vessel through which complex financial concepts are digested and illustrated for the audience. The film follows several individuals who foresaw the impending bursting of the U.S. housing market bubble, leading to the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Let's explore some of the key financial terms that underpin the movie. 1. **Hedge Fund** A hedge fund is a partnership of investors that uses high-risk methods, including investments based on predicted market movements, in the hope of making large profits. In \\"The Big Short\\", Michael Burry, who manages a hedge fund called Scion Capital, accurately predicts the collapse of the housing market and approaches several major banks to create a Credit Default Swap market, allowing him to bet against the housing market. 2. **Bubble/Asset Bubble** An asset bubble occurs when the price of an asset, such as housing, stocks, or commodities, is driven to levels that are not justified by the asset's fundamentals. This inflated price is often driven by unwarranted and exuberant market behavior. The housing bubble, as depicted in the movie, was characterized by the rapid increase in property valuations until they reached unsustainable levels, which eventually led to their collapse. 3. **Default and Credit Default Swap (CDS)** To default means to fail to repay a loan. When homeowners were unable to repay their mortgages, they defaulted on their loans. A Credit Default Swap is a financial derivative allowing an investor to \\"swap\\" or offset their credit risk with that of another investor. In essence, it's a form of insurance on a loan. In the film, Burry uses CDS to bet against, or \\"short,\\" the housing market, earning a fortune when the market collapses. 4. **Shorting** To \\"short\\" something in financial terms means to bet that its value will decrease over time. It's a way to profit from the decline in the asset's price. Traders \\"borrow\\" shares and sell them, with an obligation to buy them back at a future date. If the price drops, they can buy them back at the lower price, return them, and pocket the difference. In the movie, investors short the housing market, anticipating its crash. 5. **Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)** A Collateralized Debt Obligation is a structured financial product that pools together cash flow-generating assets and repackages this asset pool into discrete tranches that can be sold to investors. In \\"The Big Short,\\" the movie exposes how CDOs contributed to the financial crisis by bundling subprime mortgages with higher-grade mortgages, creating products that initially seemed safe but were, in fact, extremely risky. 6. **Derivative** A derivative is a financial security whose value is reliant upon or derived from, an underlying asset or group of assets — a benchmark. Common underlying instruments include bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, market indexes, and stocks. CDS and CDOs, as discussed earlier, are examples of derivatives. 7. **Credit Ratings and Subprime Credit** Credit ratings are assessments of the creditworthiness of borrowers, which can be either individuals or corporate entities. Ratings are issued by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch. They assign ratings based on the borrower's ability to repay the loan, with AAA being the highest quality. Subprime credit refers to loans offered to individuals with poor credit histories who are considered high risk. These loans have higher interest rates than prime loans to compensate for higher credit risk. \\"The Big Short\\" does an excellent job of dramatizing how these complex financial instruments played a role in one of the most significant economic downturns in recent history. It exposes a lack of transparency, regulatory oversight, and inherent conflicts of interest in the banking and credit rating industries. By understanding the aforementioned terms, viewers can better grasp the events leading up to the financial crisis as they are presented in the movie, while also acquiring foundational knowledge of key financial concepts used in the global marketplace."},{"prompt":"Write in essay format with an intro and summary of the movie, with as many details you can. Then Answer in body paragraphs with the bolded titles as topic sentences, and finish it with an understanding conclusion","completion":"**Introduction** \\"The Big Short,\\" directed by Adam McKay, is a captivating film that disentangles the complex web of financial instruments and decisions leading up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. It follows the stories of several individuals who, against the currents of mainstream financial thought, foresaw the collapse of the housing market and devised a plan to profit from it. The film is not only a dramatic recounting of true events but also serves as an educational tool, unraveling the dense language and mechanisms of finance. It makes a powerful statement about the follies of the financial industry, exposing a system ripe with moral hazard and driven by greed. Through the tale of financial outsiders making a fortune from the inevitable crash, it offers a critique of the reckless behavior that precipitated a global economic downturn. **What is a Hedge Fund? What Does it Do?** **A hedge fund** is an investment fund that pools capital from accredited investors or institutional investors and invests in a variety of assets, often with complex portfolio-construction and risk management techniques. Michael Burry, played by Christian Bale, is a hedge fund manager at Scion Capital, where he conducts a deep dive into the housing market and concludes it's built on a bubble that will burst. His investment strategy uses the hedge fund to take a short position against the housing market, betting that it will collapse and seeking profit from its failure. **What is a \\"Bubble\\", or an \\"Asset Bubble\\"?** **An \\"asset bubble\\"** is a phenomenon where the prices of assets such as housing, stocks, or commodities rise to levels far beyond their intrinsic value, often due to exuberant market behavior. In \\"The Big Short,\\" we witness the bubble in the U.S. housing market where banks and financial institutions have exponentially inflated the price of homes through risky lending. The overvaluation of these assets set the stage for a dramatic and catastrophic burst that forms the central conflict of the narrative. **What Does it Mean to Default? What is a Credit Default Swap?** To **default** means to fail in fulfilling a financial obligation, especially when someone cannot make their mortgage payments. **A credit default swap** is a financial derivative that allows an investor to speculate on or hedge against the credit risk of a third party, typically involving corporate debt or a mortgage-backed security. The story of Jared Vennett (played by Ryan Gosling), based on the real-life Greg Lippmann, illustrates the use of CDSs by investors looking to profit from the anticipated default rates in the subprime market. **What Does it Mean to \\"Short\\" Something?** To **\\"short\\" something** in finance means to sell an asset with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price. It is essentially a bet that the value of the asset will drop. The film's protagonists, such as Michael Burry and the team of Baum (played by Steve Carell), undertake short positions against the housing market by investing in credit default swaps, predicting that the market would fail imminently. **What is a Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)?** **A Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)** is a structured financial product that pools various income-generating assets and repackages this asset pool into divisions or tranches, each with different risk levels and yields. \\"The Big Short\\" effectively highlights how CDOs, especially those filled with subprime mortgages, were often misunderstood or misrepresented, with serious consequences when the underlying mortgages began to default en masse. **What is a Derivative?** **A derivative** is a financial security with a value that is reliant upon, or derived from, an underlying asset or group of assets. The term broadly covers a host of investment products, including options, futures, and swaps. One of the central threads in \\"The Big Short\\" involves credit default swaps, a kind of derivative that played a crucial role in the financial crisis, as it allowed investors to bet on the failure of the housing market. **What are Credit Ratings, and Specifically, What Does it Mean to Have a \\"Subprime\\" Credit?** **Credit ratings** are evaluations provided by credit rating agencies that assess the credit risk of a debtor, predicting their ability to repay the debt and an implied likelihood of the debtor defaulting. Having **\\"subprime\\" credit** means that the borrower has a poor credit history and is considered a high-risk borrower with a higher likelihood of default. The movie sheds light on how these subprime loans were bundled into mortgage-backed securities that received inappropriately high credit ratings, thereby misleading investors about their true risk. **Conclusion** \\"The Big Short\\" is a searing critique of the financial system, bolstered by its exploration of core financial concepts that played a role in the historic crisis. The film serves as both a cautionary tale and a critical tool for understanding the intricacies of modern finance. Through the interwoven stories of its characters, it reveals the hazards of opaque financial instruments, conflicts of interest, and the collective blindness that preceded the financial crash. By dissecting notions such as hedge funds, asset bubbles, defaults, CDOs, and more, the movie provides insights into the complexities of the market and the consequences when its underlying instruments are misunderstood or manipulated. Beyond its educational value, \\"The Big Short\\" offers a sobering reminder of the importance of transparency and ethical behavior in the financial world, warning against the repeated follies that come from ignorance and greed."},{"prompt":"Make the body paragraphs lenthgier, with 6 sentences or so, and also forget about the subtitles, just include it as a topic sentence in the essay","completion":"**Introduction** \\"The Big Short,\\" directed by Adam McKay, artfully brings to life the intricate details of the financial instruments and decisions that precipitated the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Through a clever blend of humor and educational breaks, the film traces the stories of a handful of individuals who identified an imminent collapse in the U.S. housing market. Despite contrary beliefs from the mainstream financial industry, these prescient investors devised a plan to profit from the crisis. Featuring an ensemble cast that includes Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt, the film breaks down complex financial concepts into relatable scenarios, illuminating the reckless abandon which characterized this tumultuous period in financial history. **Body Paragraphs** **A hedge fund** is depicted in the film as an investment vehicle for the wealthy, managed by a professional with the freedom to pursue a diverse range of strategies to achieve substantial gains or hedge against market downturns. Michael Burry, managing a hedge fund named Scion Capital, plays a pivotal role in uncovering the instability of the housing market. His unique analysis leads him to predict the collapse of the market, and he leverage's his fund's resources to bet against, or \\"short,\\" the seemingly robust housing boom through an exotic financial product known as a credit default swap. The portrayal of his hedge fund showcases the remarkable potential hedge funds have to operate with agility and take positions that may go against the prevailing market sentiment. **An \\"asset bubble\\"** can be best understood as an unusually large bulge in asset prices that expand based on speculative fervor, only to contract once the unrealistic expectations fail to materialize. In the narrative context of \\"The Big Short,\\" the U.S. housing market is the bubble in question, inflated to an unsustainable size by a combination of financial negligence, widespread speculation, and a collective delusion about the continual appreciation of property values. The film emphasizes that when this bubble bursts, it results in a cascading failure of asset values and a subsequent crisis—a prescient prediction made by the main characters in the movie who foresee the disaster stemming from the mortgage housing bubble. To **default** is portrayed in \\"The Big Short\\" as the failure to meet the legal obligations of a loan, which becomes a widespread occurrence when the housing market collapses. This leads to large-scale economic ramifications, especially when coupled with tens of thousands of mortgage defaults across the country. A credit default swap (CDS) is shown as a financial agreement that serves as a form of insurance against default, which, somewhat counterintuitively, provides an opportunity to gamble on the failure of various financial instruments such as mortgage-backed securities. The movie’s protagonists utilize these swaps to speculate on the financial disaster they predict, earning substantial profits when the defaults begin en masse. In the finance world, to **\\"short\\" something** indicates taking a position that a particular asset will decline in value. This is achieved by borrowing the security and selling it in the hope of repurchasing it at a lower price to make a profit, a counterintuitive strategy in a market that typically rewards optimism. \\"The Big Short\\" masterfully illustrates this strategy as its characters short the housing market using credit default swaps, thus positioning themselves against the prevailing confidence in the market and setting the stage for a dramatic payoff when their dire predictions come to fruition. **A Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)** is a financial product that is central to the movie's plot, representing a collection of loans grouped together and sold as an investable security. The film lays bare the process of how CDOs were created from a mix of loans of varying quality, including subprime loans with a high likelihood of default. When defaults occurred, they contaminated the entire CDO structure due to the interconnection of the loans. The mechanisms and risks of CDOs are thoroughly scrutinized in the film, highlighting how a lack of understanding of these products contributed to the severity of the financial crisis. **Derivatives** are financial contracts whose value is derived from the performance of underlying assets, indices, or interest rates. \\"The Big Short\\" explores derivatives such as CDS and CDOs to great effect, demonstrating their leverage and explosive potential—an alchemy that when mismanaged, can lead to dramatic outcomes, as was the case during the real-life financial crisis. The movie educates the audience on how these derivatives' complexity and misuse magnified the financial impact of the crash, as they became weapons of mass economic destruction. In terms of creditworthiness, **credit ratings** serve as a barometer, providing insight into the financial health and default risk of borrowers. The film addresses the issue of credit ratings, casting a critical eye on the rating agencies that mistakenly stamped high-grade ratings on securities that deserved far lower marks due to the high number of subprime mortgages they contained. The concept of \\"subprime\\" is linked to individuals with poor credit histories—historically a segment of the market avoided by conventional lenders. In the film, we see how these subprime loans, repackaged into mortgage-backed securities, were deemed relatively safe by rating agencies due to false assumptions and misleading assessments, contributing to one of the greatest collapses in financial history. **Conclusion** \\"The Big Short\\" offers a remarkable exploration of a tumultuous period in financial history through the lens of cinematic storytelling. Its vivid representation of hedge funds, asset bubbles, defaults, shorting, CDOs, derivatives, and the controversial credit ratings system simplifies complex ideas so that the audience might understand the many failings that led to the financial crisis. The film not only serves as an enthralling depiction of a significant historical event but also as an educational tool, elucidating the convoluted workings of the financial industry. It concludes with a sobering reminder of the repercussions that come from a system characterized by opacity, greed, and a profound misunderstanding of financial risk. \\"The Big Short\\" is a clarion call for vigilance and transparency in an industry where such virtues can seem all too scarce."},{"prompt":"Do this, explain what the concept means, then explain how it is shown in the movie, and give your own opinion to end the paragraph. Do this with each topic along with an intro and conclusion","completion":"**Introduction** \\"The Big Short,\\" a cinematic tour de force directed by Adam McKay, manages to tackle the complex financial mechanisms behind the 2007-2008 financial crisis while delivering a riveting story. With a star-studded cast and a narrative that skillfully intertwines the profound with the satirical, the film sheds light on the esoteric financial jargon and the catastrophic market failure it masks. The story follows an unconventional group of traders and hedge fund managers who predict the collapse of the housing market and devise a strategy to profit from it. Despite the complexity of the subject matter, \\"The Big Short\\" manages to be both informative and entertaining, serving as an eye-opening critique of the financial industry's dark underbelly. **Body Paragraphs** **A hedge fund** is an investment pool that employs varied strategies to maximize returns, typically for high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors. Michael Burry, managing the hedge fund Scion Capital in \\"The Big Short,\\" is a prime example of a fund manager who uses keen analysis to discern the instability of the housing market, an insight he bets big on. The film illustrates hedge funds' ability to take aggressive, non-conventional positions, such as the bold move Burry makes by investing in credit default swaps in anticipation of the housing collapse. In my opinion, the depiction of hedge funds in the movie highlights a troubling aspect of these entities—their strategies can amplify market movements and have disproportionate effects on the economy, given the enormous amounts of capital they manage. **An \\"asset bubble\\"** occurs when rising prices in an asset class are fueled by speculative investments, stretching far beyond the asset's intrinsic value. The housing market represents a rampant asset bubble in “The Big Short”, reaching critical mass due to irresponsible lending and misplaced optimism. As the protagonists predict, the bubble ultimately bursts, leading to a domino effect of financial ruin. It's a sobering moment that portrays the reckless abandon of financial speculation, showing that while bubbles can balloon undetected by many, their burst is felt by all. My view is that the film serves as a stark reminder of the collective madness that can overtake even the most seasoned investors, and the dire consequences that follow when reality reasserts itself. **To default** is to fail to meet the required payments on a loan, a scenario that becomes widespread in the film once the housing market collapses. Credit default swaps (CDS), as depicted in \\"The Big Short,\\" are instruments meant to act as insurance against such defaults but end up enabling traders like Burry to gamble against the housing market's health. The CDS serves as a stark representation of how derivative instruments, while intended to hedge against risks, can be repurposed as speculative bets. Personally, I find the use of these instruments in the film to be a damning critique of how financial innovation, absent of ethical consideration and necessary regulation, can contribute to catastrophe. In financial parlance, to **\\"short\\" an asset** like a stock or a bond is to wager that its value will decline. \\"The Big Short\\" adeptly shows how its characters sell shares they don’t own to bet against the housing market. This counterintuitive process, where profit is derived from an asset's loss in value, underscores much of the film's dramatic tension. The practice, while legal and legitimate, often raises moral questions—profiting from and perhaps even hastening others' misfortunes leaves a moral gray area that the film doesn't shy away from. In my opinion, the act of shorting, as portrayed in the movie, illuminates the complex nature of financial markets and the peculiar ways profit can be manufactured out of predicted disaster. **A Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)** combines various cash-flow generating assets into one product that can be strategically partitioned into risk categories and sold to investors. The movie exposes how these complex financial products, misunderstood by many and misused by a few, were packed with subprime loans and eventually led to severe consequences. It reveals the failure of many, including rating agencies and banks, to properly assess CDOs’ risk. The film makes it clear that the opaque nature of CDOs contributed to the crisis, a sentiment with which I certainly agree. The representation of CDOs epitomizes the perils of financial products so complicated that they prevent even sophisticated investors from truly understanding the risks they carry. **Derivatives** are simply financial contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset. “The Big Short” brings to life how these instruments, in particular, CDSs and CDOs, became foundational to speculative strategies leading up to the crash. The complexity and mispricing of these derivatives unveil a financial system fraught with hidden perils. Watching these derivates in action on the big screen, I see a cautionary tale about the potential for such instruments to amplify risks instead of mitigating them, a misapplication that can have far-reaching consequences. **Credit ratings** serve as indicators of risk for borrowers, affecting their ability to secure loans and at what interest rates. The film scrutinizes the way subprime loans were wrapped into securities that earned AAA ratings, effectively masking their inherent risk. \\"Subprime\\" in the film refers to borrowers with poor credit history, who were all too often granted loans they could not afford. The movie draws attention to how these high-risk financial products were rated inaccurately, reflecting either gross incompetence or deliberate deception. This illustrates, in my view, one of the most critical breakdowns in financial oversight—a failure that cost many their homes and savings and that remains a cautionary example of the systemic risks posed by misrated financial products. **Conclusion** \\"The Big Short\\" is an educational odyssey through the labyrinthine world of high finance and its spectacular collapse during the mid-2000s. By explicating dense financial terminology and practices, the film does more than tell the story of one of the largest financial crises of our time—it also delivers a powerful critique of the practices and attitudes that caused it. Whether we are looking at hedge funds, asset bubbles, defaults, CDOs, derivatives, credit ratings, or subprime lending, the movie illustrates the ramifications of a system that prioritizes profit over prudence. The film encapsulates the idea that financial literacy is not just for traders and bankers—it is critical for anyone who wishes to understand the forces shaping our economic destiny."},{"prompt":"Write only the intro and the next two topics, be more descriptive and use more parts of the movie.","completion":"**Introduction** Adam McKay’s riveting masterpiece, \\"The Big Short,\\" confronts the intricate financial transactions and catastrophic miscalculations that instigated the 2007-2008 financial crisis. With snappy dialogue, a star-studded ensemble, and frequent fourth-wall-breaking explanations, the film demystifies the complex financial instruments that played a role in the economic downturn. \\"The Big Short\\" follows a cadre of finance professionals who, through research and foresight, uncover the fragility of the housing market, saturated with poorly structured loans bound for default. These protagonists seek to exploit the impending disaster for profit, while shedding light on the shortsighted and often unethical practices that led to such a vulnerable economic situation. The film succeeds in translating the opaque jargon of finance into accessible knowledge, ensuring that viewers are not merely passive observers but are actively engaged in understanding the imminent crisis. **Hedge Funds and Michael Burry’s Predictions** **A hedge fund** is an investment pool that commands a vast array of unconventional strategies aimed at realizing gains in both bullish and bearish markets. In \\"The Big Short,\\" Michael Burry, an eccentric hedge fund manager played by Christian Bale, epitomizes the shrewd but nonconformist investor. Dr. Burry, locked away in his office surrounded by heavy metal music and financial reports, analyzes mortgage lending trends and discovers that the housing market is underpinned by an alarming number of high-risk subprime loans. Realizing that these loans are likely to default as adjustable mortgage rates increase, Burry persuades investment banks to sell him credit default swaps against mortgage-backed securities, effectively betting against the housing market. His skepticism and subsequent action evoke scorn and disbelief from his stakeholders and the broader financial community. The movie’s portrayal of Burry’s fund, Scion Capital, underscores hedge funds' potential for extraordinary insights and corresponding profits amid market mispricings, but also the immense pressures fund managers can face when making such contrarian bets. His story, while one of eventual vindication, is laden with the anxiety and isolation that comes from standing alone against the tide, a narrative thread that compels the viewer to grapple with the fine line between genius and folly in the realm of high finance. **The Housing Bubble and a False Sense of Security** **An \\"asset bubble,\\"** as depicted in the movie, is represented by the grossly inflated and unwarranted housing prices sustained by irrational market behavior and overly optimistic growth expectations. The film takes viewers through sun-kissed suburbs where Jared Vennett (interpreted by Ryan Gosling), claims “homes have been rising at six percent yearly.” The carefree montage of families plays a stark contrast to the harsh reality of the numbers on Vennett's presentation, emphasizing the detachment between the perceived value of these homes and their actual financial underpinning. The drama further unfolds as Mark Baum’s team, played by Steve Carell and his band of skeptics, delve into the belly of the mortgage market by visiting housing developments and mortgage brokers. They discover a cocktail of incompetent lending and speculative borrowing - groundwork for the bubble. One particularly poignant scene involves a stripper owning five houses and a condo, a scenario that leaves Baum's team in incredulous laughter, a precursor to the grave implications of this unchecked market expansion. In tandem with Burry's narrative, they collectively paint a picture of an impending disaster, yet one that so few were willing to see. My own reflection is that this part of the film is masterful, not merely for its entertaining representation of the madness of the market but also for the stark warning it presents about the cyclicality of asset bubbles. A lesson that history, time and time again, teaches, yet we often ignore at our peril."},{"prompt":"nice, do the same for the next 3 topics","completion":"**The Inevitability of Default and the Lucrative Credit Default Swaps** **To default** means a failure to fulfill an obligation, typically repayment of a loan, and this inevitability becomes the cornerstone for the profits of our protagonists. The incomprehensible level of defaults about to unfold due to unstable subprime mortgages is captured through the experiences of the characters at the heart of \\"The Big Short.\\" Vennett, using a Jenga tower as an analogy, deconstructs the teetering structure of the mortgage market for Baum’s team, illustrating the impending catastrophe as the bottom blocks, representing the weakest subprime loans, are pulled out. Credit Default Swaps (CDS) play a significant narrative and educational role in the movie, portrayed as the vehicle through which Michael Burry places his bets against the housing market's stability. The portrayal of these swaps underscores the paradox of such instruments: designed to function as insurance against loan defaults, they are exploited by the protagonists to wager on and profit from the failure of an entire market. In one memorable scene, Baum's team grills a CDS manager at Standard & Poor's, who is comically unfazed by her inability to justify the high credit ratings assigned to risky loans. The audacity of profiting from disaster is not lost on the viewer; it presents an uncomfortable truth about these derivatives. I find that the movie imparts an essential insight into the amoral world of financial derivatives, where the subjective bets of a few can result in systemic repercussions for many. **\\"Shorting\\" the Market and the Moral Dilemma** In the world of finance, to **\\"short\\"** is to profit from the anticipated decline in an asset's value, a core concept that \\"The Big Short\\" endeavors to elucidate. The process is made tangible on screen by Jamie Shipley and Charlie Geller (portrayed by Finn Wittrock and John Magaro), two inexperienced investors who discover Vennett's discarded prospectus for the housing market CDS. Their adventure into the world of high finance, guided by the skeptical wisdom of Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), demonstrates the capacity for enormous returns by betting against the grain. However, the film does not shy away from the ethical considerations surrounding shorting. Baum grapples with the moral implications of profiting from the economic downfall and suffering of millions, culminating in a climactic moment where the reality and gravity of the impending crisis hit him. His ambivalence reflects a sentiment likely shared by many viewers, bringing humanity to a story about markets and money. Personally, I find these scenes crucial as they confront the viewer with the perverse incentives of financial markets where disaster can spell opportunity, raising questions about the ethical landscape of investing. **Complex CDO Schemes Unmasked** **A Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO)** is a complex financial construct intricately woven into the fabric of the narrative in \\"The Big Short.\\" The film makes significant efforts to simplify the concept for the viewer, with a celebrity cameo by Selena Gomez and behavioral economist Richard Thaler breaking down the CDO’s mechanics at a blackjack table. They explain the bundling of individual mortgages of varying quality into a single product, which is then sold to investors seeking diversified risk. In perhaps one of the film's most striking scenes, Baum's team uncovers not just garden-variety incompetence but blatant corruption, meeting a CDO manager who is blissfully ignorant and indifferent to the quality of the mortgages he is packaging. The scene chillingly underscores the disconnect between those who create these financial products and those who ultimately pay the price when they fail. This reveal of the deep, sometimes willful lack of understanding or concern about CDOs resonates with me, underscoring the dangers of blurring the lines between risk assessment and speculative greed. The CDO becomes a symbol for the financial chicanery that led to the collapse, representing a failure in due diligence, regulation, and ethical restraint."},{"prompt":"do it for the rest and add a conclusion","completion":"**Derivatives as the Double-Edged Sword of Finance** The term **\\"derivative\\"** in finance encompasses a vast range of instruments whose value is tied to the performance of another, underlying asset. \\"The Big Short\\" brings this concept to the fore, demonstrating derivatives in the form of the now-infamous credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations. When young investors Jamie and Charlie seek advice from seasoned ex-banker Ben Rickert, they dive into the murky waters of derivatives trading. Rickert's role is instrumental in illuminating the staggering leverage and potential downside of these instruments. A derivative, as the film shows, can serve as a potent hedge against losses or a ticking time bomb of amplified risk, contingent on a deep understanding of the underlying asset. The depiction of derivatives in the movie is intricately linked to the market's opaqueness and the protagonist's foresight. Scenes like Vennett's Jenga-block explanation of mortgage-backed securities and CDOs to Baum's team unpack the compounded risk derivatives pose. The significant takeaway here is the inherent danger in the detachment of financial products from their real-world assets. The film rightly critiques this detachment, teetering on the edge of absurdity, as financial innovation outpaces regulation and comprehension. The harsh consequences of such a misaligned financial structure offer a compelling and personal resonance within the film’s scope, a stark reminder of the double-edged nature of these financial tools. **Credit Ratings and The Subprime Deception** **Credit ratings** serve a pivotal function in the financial ecosystem, indicating the creditworthiness of various investment instruments. In the film, however, these ratings become a mark of false confidence. The profound moment when Baum’s team realizes that agencies like Moody’s and Standard & Poor's are providing falsely optimistic ratings for subprime-laden CDOs underscores the systemic rot. The inflated credit ratings were callously assigned to dubious financial products, engendering a dangerous façade of security that even the most experienced investors fell for. Subprime mortgage issues are clarified as the film explores these high-risk loans in a frank and unflattering light. Borrowers with inadequate credit histories were recklessly granted mortgages they could hardly sustain, giving rise to the term \\"subprime\\" being one of grave concern rather than benign classification. These subprime loans, misrepresented through misleading ratings, assembled into CDOs, and then mass-distributed, formed a financial time bomb that the movie emphasizes with equal parts disbelief and disdain. This storyline not only reveals the malpractice in credit rating agencies but also the overarching negligence pervasive in the industry. It’s a part of the narrative I believe is critical, hitting upon the negligence and conflict of interest within credit rating agencies, and showing just how misguidance and misinformation can precipitate into a global crisis. **Conclusion** Adam McKay's \\"The Big Short\\" is a resounding narrative that dissects the anatomy of a disaster, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, while succinctly schooling its audience on the intricate and often arcane terms of high-stakes trading. It debunks the labyrinthine lexicon of the financial world: from the motivations and strategies behind hedge funds, the combustibility of asset bubbles, and the perilous outcomes of loan defaults, to the speculative allure of 'shorting,' the convolution of CDOs, the controversial nature of derivatives, and the pivotal yet undermined role of credit ratings. The film stands as an exposé and a cautionary tale, weaving together a tapestry of greed, folly, and the stark realization of the fragility of our tangled financial web. With its ensemble of flawed yet fascinating characters, \\"The Big Short\\" incites viewers to ponder the moral complexities of a system driven by profit, often at the expense of transparency and stability. It soberly reminds us that while the mechanisms of finance are often esoteric, their implications are profoundly real and universal. As the credits roll, one is left with a deepened understanding and necessary skepticism of not only the terms that dominated the crisis but also the larger socioeconomic machinery they operate within."},{"prompt":"Why aren't you allowed to wear underwear in the Olympics","completion":"As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or opinions, but I can provide information on this topic.

Religious revivalism: The First Great Awakening, which occurred in the 1730s and 1740s, had a profound impact on American religious life. The religious fervor and style of worship during this period laid the groundwork for the Second Great Awakening. The desire for a more personal, emotional, and experiential approach to religion led to a renewed interest in spiritual matters. 2. Social and economic changes: The early 19th century saw rapid changes in American society and economy. The rise of industrialization, urbanization, and market capitalism disrupted traditional social structures and values. Many people felt disoriented by these changes and sought spiritual solace and guidance. 3. Religious skepticism and rationalism: The Enlightenment and its emphasis on reason and science challenged traditional religious beliefs. This skepticism led individuals, especially younger people, to question established religious institutions and seek alternative expressions of spirituality. 4. Expansion of democracy: The Second Great Awakening coincided with the growth of democratic ideals in the United States. The idea of individual freedom and the belief in personal responsibility resonated with the religious emphasis on personal conversion and salvation. This created a fertile ground for the spread of revivalist movements. 5. Reform movements: The Second Great Awakening played a significant role in fueling numerous reform movements of the 19th century, such as temperance, abolitionism, women's rights, and education. Many revivalists believed that personal salvation should be accompanied by efforts to reform society and create a more just and moral world. Overall, the Second Great Awakening was a response to the social, economic, and intellectual changes of the time, as well as a desire for a more personal and experiential approach to religion."},{"prompt":"when did the second great awakening start","completion":"The Second Great Awakening was a religious revival movement that took place in the United States during the early 19th century, roughly from the 1790s to the 1840s. Its exact starting point is difficult to pinpoint, as revivalist activity and religious fervor spread gradually across different regions and denominations during this period. However, some key events associated with the Second Great Awakening include the Cane Ridge Revival in Kentucky in 1801 and the founding of the Methodist Episcopal Church's Sunday School Society in 1824."},{"prompt":"who was nat turner","completion":"Nat Turner was an African American enslaved man who led a rebellion against slavery in Southampton County, Virginia, in August 1831. Born into slavery on October 2, 1800, Turner grew up on various plantations in the area. He was known for his religious fervor and religious visions, which fueled his belief that he was chosen by God to lead a revolt. On the night of August 21, 1831, Turner and a group of enslaved individuals attacked the Turner family plantation, killing his enslavers and their families. Over the next two days, they moved from plantation to plantation, growing in numbers as they went and killing around 55-65 white individuals, mostly men, women, and children. The rebellion was eventually suppressed by local militias, and Turner went into hiding but was captured approximately two months later. The revolt sent shockwaves throughout the South, leading to a heightened atmosphere of fear and repression among both enslaved people and white slaveholders. In total, around 120 enslaved individuals were arrested and over twenty were executed for their involvement in the rebellion, including Nat Turner himself, who was tried, convicted, and executed on November 11, 1831. Nat Turner's rebellion had a profound impact on American history. It intensified debates over slavery and fueled the Southern states' defense of the institution as a necessary evil for maintaining order and control. It also led to even harsher treatment of enslaved individuals, as well as stricter laws to control, suppress, and limit the rights and freedoms of black people in the South."},{"prompt":"tell me about the lecompton compromise","completion":"The Lecompton Constitution, also known as the Lecompton Compromise, was a proposed constitution for the state of Kansas in the United States during the heated antebellum period. It emerged as a result of the ongoing conflict between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions in the territory. In 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act was passed, allowing the residents of Kansas to decide whether the state would allow slavery or not through popular sovereignty. This led to intense clashes between pro-slavery \\"Border Ruffians\\" from neighboring Missouri and anti-slavery settlers, resulting in a period known as \\"Bleeding Kansas.\\" In 1857, a constitutional convention was held in Lecompton, Kansas, where delegates drafted a pro-slavery constitution. However, this constitution was highly controversial and faced significant opposition from anti-slavery Kansans who boycotted the convention in protest. The Lecompton Constitution was then submitted to Congress for approval. President James Buchanan, a supporter of the expansion of slavery, urged Congress to accept it. However, the constitution was rejected by the U.S. House of Representatives in 1858, led by Stephen A. Douglas and the Northern Democrats, who viewed the voting process in Kansas as fraudulent and argued for a fairer election. The Lecompton Compromise emerged as a proposed solution to the impasse. It suggested that if Kansas would adopt the Lecompton Constitution, it would be admitted as a state, and in return, Congress would authorize funding for public works projects in the territory. However, this compromise was met with significant opposition from anti-slavery advocates. Ultimately, the Lecompton Compromise was never fully implemented. Instead, a new constitutional convention was held, and in 1859, Kansas adopted a free-state constitution, paving the way for its eventual admission to the Union as a free state in 1861. The Lecompton Constitution and the debates surrounding it highlighted the deep divisions and tensions over slavery in the United States during the antebellum period. It was another chapter in the ongoing struggle between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions that ultimately culminated in the American Civil War."},{"prompt":"who opposed the lecompton compromise","completion":"Several groups and individuals opposed the Lecompton Compromise, including: 1. The anti-slavery movement: Abolitionists and anti-slavery advocates vehemently opposed the Lecompton Constitution because it aimed to establish Kansas as a slave state. They saw it as a violation of the principles of freedom and equality. 2. Free-state supporters in Kansas: Many settlers in Kansas, predominantly from the North and sympathetic to the anti-slavery cause, boycotted the Lecompton constitutional convention. They viewed the constitution as the result of a fraudulent process and refused to legitimize it. 3. Stephen A. Douglas and Northern Democrats: Stephen A. Douglas, a prominent Democratic senator, opposed the Lecompton Constitution due to his commitment to popular sovereignty. Douglas believed that the constitution did not represent the will of the people of Kansas, and he felt it was essential to hold a fair vote to determine the territory's status. 4. Many Republicans: The Republican Party, which was gaining influence in the North, stood firmly against the expansion of slavery. They saw the Lecompton Constitution as a pro-slavery imposition and rejected any compromises that would allow Kansas admission as a slave state. 5. Some Southern Democrats and President James Buchanan: While President Buchanan initially supported the Lecompton Constitution and urged its acceptance, it faced opposition from Democrats who favored a fair vote in Kansas. The split within the Democratic Party over the issue reflected the broader sectional conflict over slavery. Ultimately, the opposition to the Lecompton Compromise came from various groups and individuals who opposed the expansion of slavery and believed in the principles of freedom and popular sovereignty. Their efforts and resistance played a significant role in ultimately leading to the constitution's rejection and the admission of Kansas as a free state."},{"prompt":"Take a deep breathe, analyze these prompt instructions in-depth, take a step back, think outside the box, ensure you completely comprehend every instruction detailed, pay attention to details, focus on quality in every area of your output, think step-by-step, and strictly follow every specification outlined in these instructions.

Its journey from the early use of relatively crude materials to today's finely-honed procedures is a testament to human ingenuity and a desire to match one's outer appearance with their inner self-image. In the early 20th century, breast augmentation was a *nascent concept*, often attempted with materials that lacked compatibility with human tissue, leading to various complications. It wasn't until the 1960s that the first silicone breast implants introduced a new era of possibility, although these too were rudimentary by today's standards. Subsequent decades brought *saline implants*, and with them, improvements in safety and aesthetic outcome. However, the former limits were palpable: issues with feel and texture, concerns about rupture, and capsular contracture were challenges patients and surgeons had to navigate. As our understanding of the body's response to these implants grew, so too did our ability to innovate. Today, in the heart of Dallas, we utilize state-of-the-art techniques that address these concerns with a refined delicacy. Current advancements in cohesive gel technology, for instance, have greatly diminished the fear of leaks while providing natural-feel results. Innovations in implant shapes have allowed for customized enhancement that *respects the individuality* of each patient's anatomy. We are keenly aware that opting for breast augmentation is a deeply personal decision, often accompanied by *years of contemplation and nuanced consideration*. While reflecting on this decision, it is empowering to know that technical limitations of the past no longer define the present's potential. As we turn the page from history to the here-and-now, *prepare to immerse yourself* in the specifics of how Dallas has become a hub of *breast augmentation innovation*. Our next section will detail the groundbreaking techniques and personalized approaches that make today's breast augmentation safer, more effective, and more in tune with the desires of those we serve."},{"prompt":"Create a preface for a Math Book for Grade School and its alignment to Matatag Curriculum","completion":"Preface Welcome to the exciting world of mathematics!

He has the power to manipulate time and space and seems to be able to observe and influence events according to some undisclosed agenda. G-Man exerts control over the series' protagonist, Gordon Freeman, appearing at key moments and often making cryptic remarks about Freeman's importance to his employers' plans. Considering G-Man's established character traits and behavior, if he were to \\"play a video game\\" with Gordon Freeman while he is in stasis, the scenario would likely not be a conventional gameplay experience. Instead, it could be interpreted metaphorically or as a more literal, yet still otherworldly, event. Here are a couple of ways to consider how that could manifest in lore: 1. **Metaphorical Gameplay Experience**: G-Man might use the concept of a \\"video game\\" as a metaphor to explain the complex nature of his manipulation of events and how Gordon's decisions shape the outcomes of these events. This metaphorical \\"gameplay\\" could represent the choices and challenges Gordon faces, with G-Man observing and possibly influencing the \\"rules\\" to suit his (or his employers') needs. 2. **Otherworldly Experimentation**: Given the G-Man's strange powers, it's possible he could create a simulated reality – much like a sophisticated video game – for Gordon to navigate. He could use such a simulation as a means of testing Gordon's decision-making and combat skills, readying him for a specific task or simply evaluating his potential without any real-world consequences. Any interactions within such a \\"game\\" could potentially reveal more about G-Man's character, his perception of Gordon and his role in the universe, as well as his relationships with the other forces at play in the Half-Life series. They would likely adhere to his cryptic nature, presenting puzzles or scenarios for Gordon that are as enigmatic as his statements throughout the games. It's important to remember that G-Man operates on a level that the characters within the Half-Life universe don't fully comprehend, often speaking in riddles and displaying a disregard for normal human behaviors and conventions. A \\"video game\\" experience shared with Gordon Freeman would therefore not be akin to a casual gaming session but something far more mysterious and aligned with his otherworldly presence."},{"prompt":"customer:\\"Ive placed 2 orders and they keep getting canceled \\" csr reply:\\"hanks for contacting us.

However, it's essential to remember that there isn't a canonical storyline in either \\"Half-Life\\" or \\"Portal\\" that involves time travel on this scale. Still, here's a speculative analysis of what could happen if this occurred: 1. Change in the Black Mesa Incident: Gordon finding the portal gun before the incident could alter the outcome entirely. If he understood how to use it, he could potentially avoid some of the initial disaster or mitigate its effects. Aperture Science's portal technology might allow for a faster response to the catastrophe, or even the prevention of the resonance cascade if Gordon uses it to intervene. 2. Cross-Universe Technology Exchange: The presence of the portal gun in the \\"Half-Life\\" universe before its time might imply a breach between the universes or timelines of \\"Half-Life\\" and \\"Portal.\\" This could lead to a mingling of technologies and knowledge not previously available. The G-Man, given his enigmatic nature and interest in Gordon, might have a role in these events either by orchestrating them or trying to correct the timeline. 3. Technological Advancement or Chaos: Depending on who gains access to the portal gun and their intentions, the technology could be used for significant advancements in science or, conversely, become a tool for further chaos and destruction. If it fell into the hands of the Combine, they could potentially use it to strengthen their hold on Earth or other dimensions. 4. A Different Role for Gordon: With the portal gun at his disposal, Gordon's journey through \\"Half-Life\\" could take a very different trajectory. He might not become the legendary figure he is known as in the series, or his legend might grow even larger with the demonstration of even more extraordinary feats enabled by the portal gun. 5. Implications for Chell and Aperture Science: If the portal gun means that Chell or even Aperture Science itself never exist in the way they are known, there could be significant implications for the AI systems like GLaDOS, and the entirety of the events in the \\"Portal\\" series could be altered or erased. In a narrative sense, merging elements from the two series like this could provide a wealth of storytelling opportunities.

In the series, the G-Man is a mysterious and enigmatic figure who appears to control or influence events from behind the scenes, often manipulating Gordon's journey. On the other hand, Gordon Freeman is portrayed as a silent protagonist and theoretical physicist, not known for engaging in activities like playing games, as he mostly reacts to the circumstances he finds himself in. Should a hypothetical scenario occur where Gordon Freeman challenges the G-Man to a game of chess, here are some speculative outcomes based on their characters: 1. The Chess Match Itself: The match would probably be quite symbolic, as chess is a game of strategy and foresight, and the G-Man has consistently been portrayed as a character who has a master plan and foresees multiple outcomes. Playing against him would represent Gordon's own strategic thinking and ability to counteract G-Man's manipulative tactics, perhaps indicating a shift in their relationship where Gordon is taking a more active role. 2. If Gordon Won: Winning against the G-Man could symbolize Gordon's ability to outthink the puppet master and assert his own will against the forces that have controlled him for so long. As for what Gordon might do if he won, that would be entirely dependent on the context within the game's narrative. - If the match were a metaphor for their struggle, Gordon’s victory might represent him gaining some advantage or leverage against the G-Man's cryptic employers or the overall situation he is in. - If the game had actual stakes, perhaps Gordon could win some freedom from G-Man’s influence, or earn a favor or information that he could use to his or humanity's advantage. - If it was just a casual, friendly game, it might not have any narrative implications at all. It's also important to note that Gordon Freeman has never been depicted as expressing his own thoughts or reactions verbally within the games, so even if he won, it's unclear what exact actions he would take, as it would rely on interpretation or further story development by Valve. Given that \\"Half-Life\\" is a first-person shooter and puzzle-solving video game series, and not a narrative with a focus on dialogue or explicit character interaction like chess, any such scenario would probably serve a metaphorical or symbolic purpose within the context of the game rather than being a literal event."},{"prompt":"до какой даты ты знаешь новости мира","completion":"Мои знания о новостях мира ограничены информацией до моего последнего обновления, которое было в марте 2023 года.

Strong leadership: The Vietnamese were led by the capable and determined general Lê Thánh Tông, who organized a well-coordinated military campaign. He devised effective strategies and tactics that allowed the Vietnamese forces to outmaneuver the Cham troops on multiple fronts. 2. Superior military strength: The Vietnamese had a larger and more organized military force compared to the Cham kingdom. They had better-equipped armies, including well-trained infantry, cavalry, and navy. This gave them a significant advantage over the Chams in battle. 3. Tactical advantage: The Vietnamese employed innovative strategies, such as building a fleet of war boats that moved swiftly along the coast, cutting off the Champa's maritime routes and supply lines. This helped isolate the Cham forces and weakened their ability to withstand the Vietnamese attacks. 4. Internal divisions within Champa: The Champa kingdom was facing internal strife and political divisions at the time. Some Cham nobles and generals were dissatisfied with their king, Po Rome, and opposed his rule. This internal unrest weakened the Cham military and hindered their ability to effectively counter the Vietnamese offensive. 5. Alliance with the Ming dynasty: The Vietnamese obtained crucial military assistance from their powerful neighbor, China's Ming dynasty. The Ming provided naval support, troops, and military advisors, which further bolstered the Vietnamese forces and tipped the balance in their favor. Combining these factors, the Vietnamese were able to achieve significant victories against the Champa forces, eventually capturing and annexing large portions of Champa territory into their own kingdom."},{"prompt":"Compared to the Champa, what did the Vietnamese had in their military that was better than Champa?","completion":"Compared to the Champa, the Vietnamese had several military advantages that contributed to their victory in the 1471 Champa–Đại Việt War: 1. Larger and more organized military: The Vietnamese had a larger standing army compared to the Champa. They had a well-organized military structure with trained soldiers, including infantry, cavalry, and archers. This numerical superiority allowed them to field larger forces and overwhelm the Champa in battles. 2. Better-equipped armies: The Vietnamese had access to superior military technology and equipment. They possessed advanced weaponry, including cannons, crossbows, and firearms, which gave them an edge over the Champa forces. The Vietnamese also had a more developed iron industry, allowing them to produce better-quality weapons and armor. 3. Strong navy: The Vietnamese had a formidable navy, which played a crucial role in their victory. They built a fleet of war boats that could swiftly navigate along the coast, allowing them to control the maritime routes and disrupt Champa's supply lines. The Vietnamese navy effectively cut off the Champa from external support and weakened their ability to resist. 4. Effective military leadership: The Vietnamese were led by capable military leaders, such as Lê Thánh Tông, who devised effective strategies and tactics. They had a better command structure and coordination among their generals, enabling them to plan and execute successful military campaigns against the Champa. 5. Support from external powers: The Vietnamese received military assistance from the Ming dynasty of China, which was a powerful neighbor. The Ming provided naval support, troops, and military advisors, strengthening the Vietnamese forces. This external support gave the Vietnamese an additional advantage over the Champa. These military advantages collectively gave the Vietnamese a superior position in terms of numbers, technology, naval power, leadership, and external support, enabling them to overcome the Champa forces and emerge victorious in the war."},{"prompt":"What are the main differences between the Messiah of Judaism and the Messiah of Christianity, Jesus Christ?","completion":"The concept of the Messiah in Judaism and Christianity has some similarities but also significant differences. Here are the main differences between the Messiah of Judaism and Jesus Christ in Christianity: 1. Identity: In Judaism, the Messiah is seen as a human being, a descendant of King David, who will be anointed as the king of Israel and bring about a period of peace and prosperity. Jesus Christ, on the other hand, is considered by Christians to be the Messiah and the Son of God, who came to fulfill the prophecies of the Jewish Messiah and bring salvation to humanity. 2. Role and Purpose: In Judaism, the Messiah is expected to fulfill various roles, including the restoration of the Jewish people to the land of Israel, the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, and the establishment of a just and peaceful society. In Christianity, Jesus Christ is believed to have fulfilled these messianic prophecies by his life, death, and resurrection, bringing salvation and forgiveness of sins to all who believe in him. 3. Divinity: Judaism does not attribute divine qualities to the Messiah. The Messiah is seen as a human figure, a righteous leader chosen by God. In contrast, Christianity holds that Jesus Christ is not only the Messiah but also the Son of God, part of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and fully divine. 4. Second Coming: While both Judaism and Christianity anticipate a future coming of the Messiah, their beliefs about the nature of this event differ. In Judaism, the Messiah's coming is seen as a singular event, which will bring about the final redemption and the establishment of a Messianic Age. Christianity teaches that Jesus Christ will return in a Second Coming at the end of time to judge the living and the dead and establish his eternal kingdom. 5. Acceptance: While Jesus Christ is considered the Messiah in Christianity, he is not accepted as such in Judaism. Most Jews do not recognize Jesus as the Messiah and continue to await the coming of the true Messiah in accordance with their understanding of the Hebrew Bible. These differences reflect the divergent theological interpretations and beliefs between Judaism and Christianity regarding the identity, role, and nature of the Messiah."},{"prompt":"From religion to culture to language to everything else, why was there such a divide that it became \\"Greek East and Latin West\\"?","completion":"The division between the Greek East and Latin West can be attributed to a combination of historical, cultural, political, and linguistic factors. Here are some key reasons for this divide: 1. Historical Factors: The division between the Greek East and Latin West can be traced back to the Roman Empire's split in 395 CE, with the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) centered in Constantinople and the Western Roman Empire centered in Rome. This division led to separate political, administrative, and cultural developments in the East and West. 2. Language: Language played a significant role in the divide. Greek was the dominant language in the Eastern Roman Empire, while Latin was the language of the Western Roman Empire. This linguistic difference contributed to the development of distinct cultural and intellectual traditions in the East and West. 3. Cultural Differences: The Eastern and Western regions had different cultural practices, customs, and religious influences. The Eastern Roman Empire had strong ties to Greek culture, philosophy, and Eastern Orthodox Christianity, while the Western Roman Empire had a mix of Roman, Germanic, and Christian influences. 4. Religious Schism: The Great Schism of 1054 marked a significant turning point in the divide between the Greek East and Latin West. The schism resulted from theological, political, and cultural differences between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. The schism led to the separation of the two branches of Christianity, with the Eastern Orthodox Church centered in the East and the Roman Catholic Church in the West. 5. Political and Geographical Factors: The political and geographical differences between the East and West also contributed to the divide. The Eastern Roman Empire had a more centralized and bureaucratic administration, while the Western Roman Empire faced various invasions and political fragmentation. The geographical distance between Constantinople and Rome also made communication and interaction more challenging. 6. Crusades and Ottoman Empire: The Crusades, which were military campaigns initiated by Western Christians, further deepened the divide between the Greek East and Latin West. The Crusaders' attempts to reconquer the Holy Land led to conflicts with the Byzantine Empire and strained relations between the two regions. Additionally, the Ottoman Empire's conquest of Constantinople in 1453 further isolated the Greek East and solidified the divide between the two regions. These factors, among others, contributed to the development of distinct identities, cultures, and religious traditions in the Greek East and Latin West, leading to the enduring divide between the two regions."},{"prompt":"you know epistle 3?","completion":"Yes, \\"Epistle 3\\" refers to a plot synopsis posted online by Marc Laidlaw, a former writer for Valve Corporation.

Esta posición fue principalmente desarrollada por Karl Popper en el siglo XX, y se opone al concepto de verificar una hipótesis a través de la acumulación de evidencia positiva, promoviendo en su lugar la idea de que las teorías científicas deben ser susceptibles de ser falsadas. Popper propuso que para que una teoría sea considerada científica, debe ser refutable, es decir, debe haber alguna observación o experimento potencial que pueda demostrar que la teoría es incorrecta. Esto contrasta con la idea de que las teorías pueden ser definitivamente probadas o verificadas a través de la confirmación repetida. El impacto del falsacionismo en la práctica científica moderna es evidente en la forma en que los científicos diseñan experimentos y pruebas. Un buen diseño experimental a menudo intenta no solo verificar una hipótesis sino también buscar posibles resultados que podrían contradecirla. Este enfoque ayuda a evitar el sesgo de confirmación y el peligro de aferrarse a teorías que no son realmente sostenibles. Además, el criterio de falsabilidad de Popper es utilizado a menudo para demarcar la ciencia de la pseudociencia. Sin embargo, es importante notar que el falsacionismo no es la única concepción del método científico. Existen otras aproximaciones que complementan y, a veces, cuestionan el falsacionismo, como el paradigma de la ciencia normal y las revoluciones científicas de Thomas Kuhn o el constructivismo social en el estudio de la ciencia. La práctica científica real es compleja e incluye múltiples métodos de investigación y justificación de teorías, y aunque el falsacionismo ha sido objeto de críticas, sigue formando una parte esencial del pensamiento crítico en la ciencia."},{"prompt":"La ciencia se centra mas en el confirmacionismo o en el falsacionismo?","completion":"La ciencia, en la práctica, emplea tanto estrategias confirmacionistas como falsacionistas, dependiendo del contexto y de los objetivos de la investigación. Ambos enfoques son componentes valiosos de la metodología científica: **Confirmacionismo:** En la ciencia, la acumulación de evidencia en apoyo de una hipótesis o teoría es un proceso importante. Los experimentos repetidos y las observaciones que coinciden con las predicciones de una teoría ayudan a construir la confianza en su validez. La confirmación es especialmente relevante en las fases iniciales de una investigación, donde los hallazgos positivos preliminares pueden guiar la investigación adicional y el desarrollo teórico. **Falsacionismo:** Por otro lado, el falsacionismo juega un papel crítico porque incita a los científicos a buscar evidencia que pueda contradecir o falsar sus teorías. Al diseñar experimentos que puedan potencialmente refutar una hipótesis, los investigadores pueden asegurarse de que sus teorías son robustas y capaces de resistir un escrutinio riguroso. El falsacionismo también es útil para eliminar teorías que ya no son sostenibles a la luz de la nueva evidencia. En la realidad científica, la distinción entre confirmacionismo y falsacionismo no siempre es tan nítida. Los científicos pueden buscar confirmar una hipótesis mientras permanecen abiertos a la posibilidad de que nuevos datos la refuten. Además, la confirmación de ciertas predicciones puede aumentar la confiabilidad de una teoría hasta que surja un contraejemplo convincente. También es relevante el papel de las teorías prevalecientes y la resistencia que pueden ofrecer a ser descartadas. Thomas Kuhn, en su libro \\"La estructura de las revoluciones científicas,\\" argumenta que las ciencias normalmente trabajan bajo un paradigma establecido, donde los científicos se dedican a resolver acertijos dentro del marco teórico actual y solo en circunstancias extraordinarias se producen revoluciones científicas que derrocan las viejas teorías y establecen nuevos paradigmas. En resumen, la ciencia moderna utiliza tanto enfoques confirmacionistas como falsacionistas en un equilibrio pragmático. Mientras el falsacionismo proporciona una herramienta filosófica para el progreso científico, el confirmacionismo representa la práctica cotidiana de construir y reforzar el conocimiento científico."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

The synthesized acetanilide was characterized using melting point analysis and IR spectroscopy. The yield, purity, and spectroscopic data were evaluated to determine the success of the synthesis. **Introduction:** Acetanilide is an organic compound derived from aniline, where the hydrogen atom of the amino group has been replaced by an acetyl group. It serves as a representative acetylation product and is often used in the pharmaceutical industry as a precursor to penicillin and other drugs. Acetanilide can be synthesized by reacting aniline with acetic anhydride, a process that exemplifies the ability of nucleophilic groups to attack electrophilic carbonyl carbon atoms. This experiment aims to demonstrate this nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction and the purification of the product using recrystallization. **Experimental Method:** 1. Synthesis of Acetanilide: - A mixture of 5.0 mL of aniline and 7.0 mL of glacial acetic acid was stirred in a 100 mL round-bottom flask. - To the mixture, 10 mL of acetic anhydride was added drop-wise over 10 minutes with continuous stirring. - The reaction mixture was then heated to reflux for 45 minutes. - After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into 100 mL of cold distilled water. - The resulting white precipitate of crude acetanilide was collected via vacuum filtration and washed with cold water. 2. Purification of Acetanilide (Recrystallization): - The crude acetanilide was dissolved in the minimum amount of hot ethanol. - The hot solution was filtered to remove any insoluble impurities. - The clear solution was allowed to cool slowly to room temperature and then placed in an ice bath to complete the crystallization. - The re-crystallized acetanilide was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with cold ethanol, and dried. 3. Characterization: - Melting Point: A small sample of the pure acetanilide was placed in a capillary tube and the melting point was determined using a melting point apparatus. - IR Spectroscopy: Infrared spectra were recorded for both the crude and purified acetanilide samples to assess the functional groups and purity of the compound. **Results:** - Crude Yield of Acetanilide: 12.0 g - Recrystallized Yield of Acetanilide: 9.0 g - Percent Yield: (9.0 g / theoretical yield) x 100 = (9.0 g / 10.5 g) x 100 = 85.7% - Melting Point of Purified Acetanilide: 113–115 °C (literature value: 114–116 °C) - IR Spectrum Analysis: The IR spectrum of purified acetanilide showed characteristic peaks at: - 1670 cm^-1 (C=O stretch of amide) - 1600 cm^-1 and 1500 cm^-1 (aromatic ring vibrations) - 3300 cm^-1 (N-H stretch of amide, broad) **Discussion:** The percent yield of acetanilide observed was 85.7%, indicating a relatively efficient synthesis. The melting point range of the purified product was within 1-2 °C of the literature value, suggesting high purity. However, a narrow melting point range would be desired for greater confidence. The IR spectrum confirmed the expected functional groups with characteristic peaks for both the amide carbonyl stretch and aromatic ring vibrations. However, presence of a broad N-H stretch peak suggests that the recrystallization might not have removed all the aniline, which can hydrogen bond with the amide group in acetanilide. **Conclusion:** Acetanilide was successfully synthesized with a high yield and purity as evidenced by the close melting point range to the literature value and the IR spectroscopy data. Minor impurities are suggested by the slightly broadened melting point range and IR spectrum, indicating that further optimization of the recrystallization process could be beneficial. **References:** Any relevant literature or chemical handbooks referenced throughout the report should be cited appropriately. **Note:** This lab report is crafted as a template and example. It contains fictional data, and is meant for educational purposes to demonstrate how such a report could be structured. Actual data and results should be recorded thoroughly and accurately if you conduct this experiment."},{"prompt":"Olá","completion":"Olá!

Gideon, their sentient ship's AI, now a human, begins to have strange visions – the fragments of various timelines are bleeding into each other, warning of impending doom. **Episode 2: “Time Out of Joint”** The team reunites to investigate the anomalies and find that historical figures are popping up in the wrong eras, mythical creatures are appearing in modern cities, and past villains are returning. Gary's alien knowledge and constant shifts between comedic relief and insightful wisdom help unravel the mystery. **Episode 3: “Ideals of Legends”** Haunted by their past decisions, the Legends must revisit old missions, confronting the impacts of their choices while trying to fix the timeline without making it worse. Sara and Ava, as co-captains, must navigate their leadership as their relationship is put to the test. **Episode 4: “The Paradox Protocol”** When the team accidentally erases an important event, they have to deal with a paradox that threatens to erase their existence. They must set it right, leading to personal sacrifices. This brings Zari and Behrad to face the possibility of losing each other to save the timeline. **Episode 5: “The Legion of Legends”** The Legends realize they can't tackle the Chrono-Maelstrom alone; they need the help of every ally they've ever had. This includes bringing back characters like Ray Palmer, Mick Rory, and others for an epic team-up across time and space. **Episode 6: “The Tides of Time”** Fighting across different eras, the Legends encounter the architects of the Chrono-Maelstrom: A coalition of time-traveling villains led by a mysteriously resurrected Rip Hunter, who blame the Legends for all the chaos and are exploiting the situation to dominate the timeline. **Episode 7: “Second Chances”** As the ultimate battle looms, the Legends confront Rip (or whatever manipulative force has brought him back), trying to reveal the truth and sway him to their side, leading to emotional reconciliations and the return of Rip’s better angels. **Episode 8: “End of Legends” (Final Episode)** The Legends launch a multifront assault on the Chrono-Maelstrom. Their past selves, comrades, and adversaries all come to play part in an epic battle across time. They align together, and with every piece of knowledge and experience they've gained, they reform the timeline without the Maelstrom's influence, but it requires a tremendous sacrifice. The Waverider must fly into the heart of the storm, with the potential of never coming back. In the end, the Legends manage to close the Maelstrom, and in doing so, they scatter across the timeline, each beginning a new chapter or returning to their proper time, knowing that their legacy will live on in the stories of tomorrow. In an epilogue, we see monuments across time dedicated to the Legends, ensuring that while they are no longer traveling through time, their impact is timeless. Gideon, restored to the ship's AI, serves as the guardian of the timeline, overseeing history with gentle guidance, leaving the door open to the possibility of a new generation of Legends if the timeline should ever need them again."},{"prompt":"Very good. But season 7 ended with the legends captured with booster gold and sent to time prison. Please update the story to follow on that plot thread. Remember that this is the final season so try to pack it with fan-service","completion":"Understood! Considering the events at the end of Season 7, here's how Season 8 could follow on from that cliffhanger and provide a fan-service packed finale season: **Season 8: Legends of Tomorrow: Final Hour** **Episode 1: \\"Breakout\\"** Season 8 opens with the Legends and Booster Gold locked up in Time Prison. They quickly learn that their imprisonment is merely the first step in a larger plan orchestrated by the villainous Time Masters, who have reclaimed control and set up a tyrannical regime. The Legends, with Booster Gold’s unpredictable help and utilizing their unique skills, plan a daring escape, hinting at the larger threat of the \\"Chrono-Maelstrom\\" which even the Time Masters fear. **Episode 2: \\"Fractures in Time\\"** Free from prison but now fugitives, the team splits up to gather allies and resources. This episode would serve as a mini-reunion tour of sorts, featuring past Legends and allies, as they acknowledge the legacy the team has built. They begin to see the effects of the Chrono-Maelstrom, realizing the threat it poses not just to them but to the entire fabric of the universe. The episode ends with a successful effort to rescue Gideon's human form, whose visions are growing more intense. **Episode 3: \\"Chrono-Quest\\"** The team sets out on a mission to learn more about the Chrono-Maelstrom and how they can stop or contain it. This leads them on a quest to find pieces of an ancient artifact scattered across time, believed to have the power to stabilize the timeline. Each piece is located in an era relating to a Legend's past, forcing them to confront unresolved issues and receive closure. **Episode 4: \\"The Time Masters' Gambit\\"** Still on their tail, the Time Masters send enforcers to stop the Legends as they attempt to assemble the artifact. This episode would feature intense action sequences and close calls. The Legends encounter a group of freedom fighters opposed to the Time Masters' rule, planting the seeds for an upcoming revolution. **Episode 5: \\"Allies of Yesteryear\\"** Understanding the magnitude of what they're facing, the team recruits allies from their storied past. This episode could see a host of fan favorites returning to aid the Legends in their upcoming confrontation with the Time Masters and their role in the Chrono-Maelstrom. Old romances, friendships, and rivalries are reignited, bringing a rich sense of history and nostalgia. **Episode 6: \\"Legion of Time\\"** Leading a full-blown rebellion against the authoritative Time Masters, the Legends and their assembled team of historical and superpowered figures face off in a massive battle across time that feels like the penultimate climax of the series. Through the course of the battle, hints are given that the Time Masters themselves may merely be pawns in a grander scheme tied to the existence of the Chrono-Maelstrom. **Episode 7: \\"Ripples and Tides\\"** Following the Legends' victory over the Time Masters, the Maelstrom's reality-warping effects worsen, making it clear the rebellion was only part of the solution. The Legends must now seek out the true cause behind the Maelstrom. The penultimate episode would feature personal stakes for each Legend, as they must decide what they're willing to sacrifice for the sake of the timeline. **Episode 8: \\"Legends Never Die\\" (Series Finale)** The Legends confront the ultimate source behind the Chrono-Maelstrom: a nexus of temporal energy corrupted by misuse and reckless time traveling. Their quest culminates in the discovery that to stabilize the timeline, they'll have to erase the evidence of their time-traveling adventures, effectively becoming unsung heroes. The team makes the unanimous decision to proceed, acknowledging that the true legacy of a Legend isn't fame or recognition, but the lives saved and the good deeds done. The series finale would see the Legends scatter as before, but this time with fitting endings for each character — some returning home, others embarking on new adventures, and a few choosing to continue protecting the timeline secretly. As the Legends' stories conclude, Gideon, restored to the ship's AI, watches over the corrected timeline, safeguarded by the knowledge and love of those who have piloted the Waverider through history. In an emotional epilogue, we're taken through a montage voiced by Gideon that shows the legacy of the Legend's actions, how they've shaped the world in unseen ways, and humanity’s progress—a reminder that heroes aren't always remembered, but their impact is eternal. The final scene pans through a museum dedicated to unsolved historical mysteries and unexplained events, where items and photos associated with the Legends are on display, hinting at the truth that the Legends were always a part of history, just out of sight."},{"prompt":"The presense of negaive externalities is bad, and the presense of positive externalities is also bad.

Here are some key aspects of their relationship: 1. Trade and Diplomatic Relations: There was significant maritime trade between the Đại Việt and Maritime Southeast Asia. Đại Việt, located strategically between China and Southeast Asia, served as a trading hub for various goods like ceramics, spices, textiles, and precious metals. Diplomatic missions were also exchanged between the kingdoms of both regions. 2. Cultural Exchange: Cultural exchange was prevalent, particularly through the spread of Mahayana Buddhism and Confucianism. Vietnamese scholars traveled to Southeast Asian kingdoms to study and learn from their cultures, while Southeast Asian traders and diplomats brought their cultural practices, ideas, and beliefs to Đại Việt. 3. Conflicts and Wars: Vietnam, under the Lê dynasty, engaged in various conflicts with Maritime Southeast Asian entities. These conflicts were often driven by territorial disputes, attempts to control trade routes, and competition for influence. For example, there were conflicts with the Champa Kingdom (present-day central Vietnam and parts of Cambodia) and later with the Nguyen Lords, who controlled parts of present-day Vietnam and Cambodia. 4. Chinese Influence: As Đại Việt shared a long border with China, Chinese influence played a crucial role in shaping both its internal affairs and foreign relations. In this context, relations between Đại Việt and Maritime Southeast Asia were indirectly affected by China's dominant role in the region. 5. Portuguese and European Influence: In the late 15th century, European powers, especially the Portuguese, started arriving in Southeast Asia. Their presence gradually reshaped the dynamics of trade and foreign relations in the region. Đại Việt, along with other Southeast Asian kingdoms, encountered the Portuguese, establishing contacts with them in some instances. Overall, the relationship between Đại Việt under the Later Lê dynasty and Maritime Southeast Asia was shaped by trade, cultural interactions, territorial disputes, and periodic conflicts influenced by regional power dynamics."},{"prompt":"Were the gunpowder weapons used during the Champa- Đại Việt war only limited to early cannons?","completion":"During the Champa-Đại Việt war, gunpowder weapons were not limited to early cannons. While cannons were indeed used during this period, gunpowder technology had advanced, and various other types of firearms and explosives were also employed. Here are some examples of gunpowder weapons used during the Champa-Đại Việt war: 1. Cannons: Cannons were an important component of gunpowder warfare during this period. These early cannons were made of bronze or iron and were used for siege warfare, defending fortifications, and naval battles. 2. Hand Cannons: Hand cannons, also known as hand-held firearms or arquebuses, were used by infantry. These early firearms were handheld and fired projectiles using gunpowder ignition. They were less accurate and had a slower rate of fire compared to later firearms. 3. Fire Arrows: Fire arrows were arrows equipped with gunpowder-filled tubes or containers attached to the shaft. These arrows were ignited and shot towards enemy positions or ships, causing fires and chaos. 4. Fire Lances: Fire lances were early firearms that consisted of a tube attached to a spear or polearm. They were essentially a combination of a firearm and a melee weapon. The tube contained gunpowder and projectiles, creating a powerful explosion upon ignition. 5. Explosives: Gunpowder was also used to create various explosive devices. These included explosive-filled bamboo tubes, fire pots, and grenades. These explosives were used for both offensive and defensive purposes, such as breaching fortifications or repelling enemy attacks. It's important to note that the specific types and advancements of gunpowder weapons used during the Champa-Đại Việt war may have varied over time and between different factions involved in the conflict. Gunpowder technology continued to evolve, leading to the development of more sophisticated firearms and explosives in later centuries."},{"prompt":"Would any of the listed gunpowder weapons look the same as the Chinese models of that time, or did they have special Đại Việt style to them?","completion":"During the Champa-Đại Việt war, the gunpowder weapons used by Đại Việt would have been influenced by Chinese models of that time. Đại Việt had a long history of cultural and technological exchange with China, and Chinese influence was significant in various aspects of Đại Việt's society, including warfare and military technology. Therefore, the gunpowder weapons used by Đại Việt would have shared similarities with Chinese models. However, it is also possible that Đại Việt may have developed its own variations or adaptations of these weapons, incorporating local preferences or modifications. The specifics of Đại Việt's gunpowder weapons during this period are not extensively documented, making it challenging to provide precise details on any distinct Đại Việt style. However, it is reasonable to assume that the gunpowder weapons used by Đại Việt would have been similar in design and functionality to the contemporary Chinese models, given the historical and cultural connections between the two regions. It's worth noting that over time, as gunpowder technology spread and evolved, various regions, including Đại Việt, did develop their own unique styles and innovations in firearms and artillery. However, during the Champa-Đại Việt war, the gunpowder weapons would have likely resembled the Chinese models of that era, with possible local adaptations or modifications."},{"prompt":"Does an operating system provide security and protection services","completion":"Yes, an operating system provides various security and protection services to ensure the safety and integrity of the system. Some of the common security services provided by an operating system include: 1. User authentication and access control: The operating system allows users to authenticate themselves using credentials, such as usernames and passwords, and grants them specific permissions to access files, directories, and system resources based on their privileges. 2. File and data protection: The operating system provides mechanisms, such as file permissions and encryption, to protect files and data from unauthorized access, modification, or theft. 3. Firewall and network security: Some operating systems include built-in firewalls and network security features to protect against unauthorized network access, intrusion attempts, and malicious activities. 4. Antivirus and malware protection: Operating systems may include antivirus and anti-malware software to detect and remove malicious programs, such as viruses, worms, trojans, and spyware, to protect the system from malware threats. 5. System updates and patches: Operating system vendors regularly release updates and patches to address security vulnerabilities and bugs, ensuring that the system remains secure and protected against known threats. 6. Logging and auditing: The operating system maintains logs and audit trails to record system activities, such as login attempts, file accesses, and system events, which can be useful for detecting security incidents and investigating any breaches. Overall, the operating system plays a crucial role in providing security and protection services to safeguard the system and its resources from various threats."},{"prompt":"What are examples of operating system events","completion":"Examples of operating system events include: 1. Booting/Startup: This event occurs when the computer is powered on or restarted, and the operating system initializes and prepares the system for use. 2. Login/Logout: When a user logs in or logs out of the system, the operating system generates login and logout events. These events help keep track of user activity and allow access control mechanisms to enforce security policies. 3. File or Directory Creation/Deletion: Whenever a file or directory is created or deleted by a user or a program, the operating system generates corresponding events. These events help in maintaining file system integrity and tracking changes to the file system. 4. Process Creation/Termination: When a process (a running program) is created or terminated, the operating system generates process-related events. These events help in managing and monitoring the execution of processes and allocate system resources efficiently. 5. Network Events: Operating systems generate events related to network activities, such as establishing a network connection, disconnecting, or encountering network errors. These events assist in network management, troubleshooting, and security monitoring. 6. Hardware Events: The operating system generates events when hardware devices are connected or disconnected, such as plugging in a USB drive or disconnecting a printer. These events trigger the necessary actions to recognize and manage the hardware devices. 7. Error and Exception Handling: Operating systems generate events when errors or exceptions occur, such as memory access violations or system crashes. These events help in diagnosing and troubleshooting issues, allowing the system to recover from errors gracefully. 8. System Shutdown: When the system is shut down or powered off, the operating system generates a shutdown event. This event ensures that processes and system resources are properly terminated and saves any necessary data before shutting down. These are just a few examples of operating system events, and the specific events can vary depending on the operating system and its features."},{"prompt":"Are file requests, I/O interrupts and memory requests from programs considered operating system events","completion":"Yes, file requests, I/O interrupts, and memory requests from programs can be considered operating system events. These events involve interactions between programs and the operating system for the management and control of system resources. Here is a brief explanation of each: 1. File Requests: When a program needs to read from or write to a file, it sends a file request to the operating system. The operating system handles these requests by managing file access, enforcing file permissions, and ensuring data integrity. File requests can include operations like opening, closing, reading, writing, and deleting files. 2. I/O Interrupts: I/O interrupts occur when external devices, such as keyboard, mouse, or network interfaces, require attention or input/output operations from the operating system. The operating system receives and handles these interrupts, allowing programs to interact with the devices through appropriate I/O operations. 3. Memory Requests: Programs often require memory allocation and deallocation for storing and accessing data during their execution. When a program requests memory from the operating system, it generates a memory request event. The operating system manages the memory allocation, ensuring efficient utilization of system resources and providing protection against unauthorized access. In all these cases, the operating system acts as an intermediary between user programs and system resources. It receives the events, processes them, and determines the appropriate actions to satisfy the requests while maintaining system security, integrity, and optimal performance."}]`),q={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},z={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},_={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],H={key:0},L={key:1};function j(n,e,l,p,o,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",z,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,w(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",_,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
