Given that the original selling price is 40 yuan and the cost price is 30 yuan, the profit per T-shirt can be expressed as (x + 40 - 30). Also, the sales volume decreases by 10 pieces for every 1 yuan increase in price, so the new sales volume can be represented as (300 - 10x). The total profit, therefore, is given by the product of the profit per T-shirt and the number of T-shirts sold, which leads to the equation: [ (x + 10)(300 - 10x) = 3360 ] Expanding and simplifying this equation: [ 10x(300 - 10x) + 3000 = 3360 ] [ 3000x - 100x^2 + 3000 = 3360 ] [ -10x^2 + 300x + 3000 = 3360 ] [ -10x^2 + 300x - 360 = 0 ] [ -10(x^2 - 30x + 36) = 0 ] [ x^2 - 30x + 36 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find two possible values for x: [ x_1 = 2, quad x_2 = 18 ] Since the goal is to reduce inventory as much as possible, we choose the smaller increase in price, x_1 = 2. Therefore, the selling price of the T-shirt should be increased by boxed{2 text{ yuan}}. Part 2: To find the selling price that maximizes profit, we use the profit equation derived from the given conditions: [ M = (x + 10)(300 - 10x) ] [ = -10x^2 + 200x + 3000 ] [ = -10(x^2 - 20x - 300) ] [ = -10(x^2 - 20x + 100) + 4000 ] [ = -10(x - 10)^2 + 4000 ] This equation represents a parabola that opens downwards, indicating that the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at x = 10. Substituting x = 10 into the equation for M, we find the maximum profit: [ M_{text{max}} = -10(10 - 10)^2 + 4000 = 4000 ] Thus, the selling price should be set to 40 + 10 = boxed{50 text{ yuan}}, and the maximum profit earned is boxed{4000 text{ yuan}}."},{"prompt":"What is the lesser of the solutions to the equation x^2 + 10x 24 = 0?","completion":"To solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 10x - 24 = 0, we seek factors of -24 whose sum is 10.

This suggests that there might be a consistent bias in the outcomes, which could be due to the material of the bottle cap not being uniform. If the material were uniform, we might expect the frequency to approach 0.50, representing an equal chance of landing \\"Caps Up\\" or \\"Caps Down.\\" Therefore, the inference that the bottle cap is likely not made of uniform material is based on the observed deviation from the expected 0.50 frequency in a fair scenario. boxed{text{Inference 1 is correct}} 2. **Inference about the Result of the 2000th Experiment:** The data provided does not give specific outcomes for individual tosses, such as the 2000th experiment.

Note that point (D) lies on the line segment extending perpendicular from (P) to (PA). 2. **Analyzing Angles:** Observe that: [ angle MPD = angle AQP ] This is true because (M) and (Q) are on the same circle (O) and (I) respectively such that (MP) and (PQ) subtend equal angles at point (P). 3. **Calculation of Arc Lengths:** Understanding that: [ overarc{PAM} = overarc{PA} + overarc{MB} ] implies: [ overarc{AM} = overarc{MB} ] With (MN) being a diameter of circle (O), it implies: [ MN perp AB. ] 4. **Connection to (C_1):** Draw (QI) extended such that it intersects (AN) at (C_1), implying that: [ C_1Q perp AB. ] Hence, point (C_1) lies on a parallel line to (MN), suggesting: [ MN parallel C_1Q. ] 5. **Analyzing Intersection Angles:** Next, understand that: [ angle AC_1Q = angle ANM = angle APQ. ] This might imply the cyclic nature of points (A), (P), (C_1), and (Q), making points lie on a common circle. Thus: [ angle APC_1 = 180^circ - angle AQC_1 = 90^circ = angle APC. ] 6. **Conclusion:** Since (angle APC_1 = angle APC), point (C_1) coincides with point (C). Therefore, points (C), (I), and (Q) are indeed collinear.

Assume ( p_1 < p_2 < cdots < p_{25} ). - If ( p_1 > 2 ), then 2 cannot be represented as a sum of distinct positive divisors of ( left( p_1 cdots p_{25} right)^{2004} ). Therefore, in this case, ( T = 1 ). 4. For ( p_1 = 2 ), we demonstrate the following general result: - Let ( k geq 1 ) and ( p_1, cdots, p_k ) be ( k ) distinct primes satisfying ( p_i < p_{i+1} leq p_i^{2005} ) for ( i = 1, cdots, k-1 ) and ( p_1 = 2 ). - Then, the set of positive integers, which can be represented as a sum of distinct terms from ( left( p_1 cdots p_k right)^{2004} ), is ( {1, 2, cdots, T_k } ) where: T_k = frac{p_1^{2005} - 1}{p_1 - 1} cdot frac{p_2^{2005} - 1}{p_2 - 1} cdots frac{p_k^{2005} - 1}{p_k - 1}. 5. [Remark: The terms in ( left( p_1 cdots p_k right)^{2004} ) include all sums of distinct positive divisors.] 6. We proceed by induction on ( k ): - **Base Case (( k = 1 ))**: - When ( k = 1 ), and ( p_1 = 2 ), the integers from 1 up to ( T_1 = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + cdots + 2^{2004} ) can easily be represented as sums of distinct powers of 2, considering the binary representation. - **Inductive Step**: - Assume the result holds for some ( k ). That is, any integer ( n ) such that ( 1 leq n leq T_k ) can be expressed using ( left( p_1 cdots p_k right)^{2004} ). - Let ( 1 leq n leq T_{k+1} ). By definition: T_{k+1} = T_k left( 1 + p_{k+1} + p_{k+1}^2 + cdots + p_{k+1}^{2004} right). - There exists an integer ( i ) (where ( 0 leq i leq 2004 )) such that: T_k left( p_{k+1}^{i+1} + cdots + p_{k+1}^{2004} right) < n leq T_k left( p_{k+1}^{i} + p_{k+1}^{i+1} + cdots + p_{k+1}^{2004} right). 7. Define: n - T_k left( p_{k+1}^{i+1} + cdots + p_{k+1}^{2004} right) = m_i p_{k+1}^i + r, where ( m_i geq 0 ) and ( 0 leq r < p_{k+1}^i ). Given ( m_i leq T_k ), proceed as follows: 8.

By induction hypothesis, each ( m_j ) can be expressed using terms from ( left( p_1 cdots p_k right)^{2004} ). Hence, ( n ) itself can be expressed using distinct terms from ( left( p_1 cdots p_k p_{k+1} right)^{2004} ). - This completes the induction step. 9.

By placing one pile of chemicals and as many weights as necessary on the pans of the scale, Gerome can measure out various amounts of the chemicals in the pile.

The weights available are three 1-gram weights, three 5-gram weights, and three 50-gram weights. 1. **Understanding the Balance Scale:** - On a two-pan balance scale, if we place weights (A) on one side and weights (B) on the other side, we can measure a chemical weight of (|A - B|). Without loss of generality, assume (A geq B), so we can drop the absolute value and consider (A - B). 2. **Possible Combinations of Weights:** - We can place 0 to 3 weights of each type (1-gram, 5-gram, 50-gram) on either side of the balance. This gives us (4) choices (0, 1, 2, or 3 weights) for each type of weight on each side. 3. **Calculating the Total Number of Combinations:** - For each type of weight, there are (4) choices (0 to 3 weights) on each side. Since there are three types of weights, the total number of combinations for one side is (4^3 = 64). - However, we need to exclude the case where no weights are placed on either side (i.e., (A = 0) and (B = 0)), which is not a valid measurement. Thus, we have (64 - 1 = 63) different weights for (B = 0). 4. **Considering Different Values of (B):** - For (B = 1) (one 1-gram weight on the other side), we can place 0 to 3 weights of each type on the (A) side. This gives (4^2 = 16) combinations for the remaining weights. Excluding the case where no weights are placed on the (A) side, we have (15) valid combinations. - For (B = 2) (two 1-gram weights on the other side), we again have (4^2 = 16) combinations for the remaining weights on the (A) side, excluding the case where no weights are placed on the (A) side, giving (15) valid combinations. - This pattern continues for all possible values of (B). 5. **Summing Up All Possible Weights:** - We need to consider all possible values of (B) and sum up the valid combinations for each case. The total number of different positive weights Gerome can measure is the sum of all these combinations. By carefully considering all possible combinations and ensuring no duplicates, we can determine the total number of different positive weights Gerome can measure.

Matt uses the massager for 5 minutes at the highest setting. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 5 minutes is equal to 5 * 60 = 300 seconds. The total number of vibrations experienced by Matt at the highest setting is 768,000. This is the product of the number of seconds and the vibrations per second at the highest setting: 768,000 = 300 seconds * 1.60V To find the vibrations per second at the lowest setting (V), we need to divide 768,000 by 300 seconds and then by 1.60: V = 768,000 / (300 * 1.60) V = 768,000 / 480 V = 1600 vibrations per second So, the massager vibrates at boxed{1600} vibrations per second at the lowest setting."},{"prompt":"Let a triangle b and a nabla b represent the minimum and maximum of two numbers a and b, respectively.

By taking a cross section of the cone along its axis of rotation, we obtain triangle ABC with inscribed circle ⊙O_1 and circumscribed circle ⊙O_2. Since both circles share the same center, the incenter and circumcenter of triangle ABC coincide, indicating that it is a right triangle. According to the problem, the radius of ⊙O_1 is r=1.

Since both circles share the same center, the incenter and circumcenter of triangle ABC coincide, which implies that it is a right triangle. Given that the radius of ⊙O_1 is r=1, we deduce that the side length of triangle ABC is 2sqrt{3}. Consequently, the radius of the cone's base is sqrt{3}, and its height is 3.

We need to prove that the angle angle ACB is obtuse when C is inside the circle, and acute when C is outside the circle. Step 1: Proving the angle is obtuse inside the circle. 1. Extend the line segment AC to meet the circle again at point D. This divides the circle into an interior part and an exterior part. 2. Note that angle ADB = 90^circ because ADB is a right angle since AB is the diameter. 3. In the triangle ADC, the external angle angle ACB is formed by extending AC past the circle, and it's opposite to the right angle angle ADB. Specifically: - Since angle ADB = 90^circ, we know angle ACB is an external angle to angle ADC. - The measure of an external angle of a triangle is greater than either of the non-adjacent internal angles. Therefore, angle ACB is greater than angle ADC, which confirms that angle ACB is greater than 90^circ (i.e., angle ACB is obtuse). Conclusion: The angle angle ACB viewed from inside the circle is obtuse. Step 2: Proving the angle is acute outside the circle. 1. Consider point C outside the circle. Extend AC and BC such that they intersect the circle at points D and D'. Note that D lies on AC while D' lies on BC. 2. In this configuration, angle ADB = 90^circ because AB is still the diameter of the circle. 3. The angle angle ACB is internal to the triangle CDB. Specifically: - Since angle ADB = 90^circ, angle ACB must be an internal angle of triangle CDB. - An internal angle in a triangle must be less than 90^circ if the triangle is right-angled, confirming that angle ACB < angle ADB = 90^circ. Conclusion: The angle angle ACB viewed from outside the circle is acute.

Conclusion: (boxed{text{a) Such integers exist}}) Part (b): 1. We consider the function and the equation: [ x^2 + 2ax + b = 0 ] 2. Let's rewrite the quadratic in the form: [ f(x) = x^2 + 2ax + b = (x + a)^2 + b - a^2 ] 3. To guarantee no real roots for this quadratic function, the term ((x + a)^2 + b - a^2 neq 0). For it to be consistent: [ b - a^2 > 0 ] Since (a) and (b) are integers, the smallest positive integer that (b - a^2) can take is (1). Thus: [ b - a^2 geq 1 ] 4. Consequently, (f(x) geq 1). Now, consider: [ leftlfloor x^2 rightrfloor + 2ax + b = 0 ] 5. The floor function (leftlfloor x^2 rightrfloor) rounds (x^2) down to the greatest integer less than or equal to (x^2), which implies: [ leftlfloor x^2 rightrfloor leq x^2 < leftlfloor x^2 rightrfloor + 1 ] 6.

Specifically, we are looking to determine the number of points on the three left faces labeled A, B, and C. 1. **Understanding the Cube Configuration:** - Each cube has 6 faces. - The number of points on the faces are as follows: - 1 face with 3 points, - 2 faces with 2 points each, - 3 faces with 1 point each. 2. **Determine the Placement of Points:** - Points on the faces must match when two cubes share a face. This means that the number of points on adjacent faces must be equal. 3. **Analyzing the Structure:** - Consider the right middle cube (the cube directly beneath and above which there are other cubes): - The upper and lower faces of this cube cannot have 3 points each (as this would violate the condition that no two adjacent faces have differing numbers of points). - Thus, the face with 3 points must be on either of the remaining two faces (not visible and not touching another cube). - Therefore, on this cube: - One face with 3 points is hidden. - Opposite this face, there is a face with 2 points. - The other remaining sides will have 1 point each. 4. **Investigating the Top Middle Cube:** - The top face has 3 points. - The near face has 2 points. - Hence, the lower face of this cube has 2 points (as it matches with the upper face of the right middle cube). - The left face has 1 point. This configuration follows by exploring directions and adjacent cube conditions that being the same. 5. **Matching Left Middle Cube with Top Middle Cube:** - Left middle cube must be identical to the middle cube. - This implies its configuration must match spatially. - By analyzing the direction of diagonals marked and without overlapping conflicting marks (3 point face in the visible area and one adjoining side having 2 points faces): - Cube faces that equally share and match neighbors must match without contradiction. 6. **Determine Values on A, B, C:** - On critically analyzing the lower cubes diagonally: - If we assume the cumulative analysis again restates the adjacent aligning/mismatching ensuring non-redundant: - Upper face shouldn't have scores conflicting neighbor cube face hence equal restate aligns face-wise without matching failing conditions. Following this reasoning and analysis gives us the face checks and ensures the 3 left visible side cubes assumptions align. # Conclusion: Thus, based on configuration checks and neighbor alignment conditions: [ boxed{A-2, B-2, C-3} ] This configuration aligns with the visible cubes matching given conditions ensuring task solved."},{"prompt":"Given f(x)= begin{cases} 3e^{x1},x < 3 log_{3}(x^{2}6).xgeqslant 3 end{cases}, find the value of f(f( sqrt {15})).","completion":"Since sqrt {15} > 3, we have f( sqrt {15})=log_{3}(15-6)=2.

Let us provide a detailed step-by-step solution for this problem: 1. **Initial Assumptions and Experimentation**: To start, we assume that there might be specific values for ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( a(a + 1) ) divides ( b^2 + 1 ). Upon initial trials, one might find the smallest ( b ) to be 57 such that ( 25 times 26 ) divides ( 57^2 + 1 ). 2. **Generalization through Boundaries**: Suppose ( d^2 ) divides ( c^2 + 1 ). If we introduce ( b = c(d^2 + 1) + d^3 ), we want to verify that ( b^2 + 1 ) is divisible by both ( d^2 + 1 ) and ( d^2 ). 3. **Verification of divisibility**: By expanding ( b ): [ b = c(d^2 + 1) + d^3 ] Then: [ b^2 + 1 = (c(d^2 + 1) + d^3)^2 + 1 ] [ = c^2(d^2 + 1)^2 + 2cd^3(d^2 + 1) + d^6 + 1 ] Simplifying further: [ b^2 + 1 = c^2(d^4 + 2d^2 + 1) + 2cd^5 + 2cd^3 + d^6 + 1 ] [ = c^2d^4 + 2c^2d^2 + c^2 + 2cd^5 + 2cd^3 + d^6 + 1 ] Notice that ( d^6 + 1 ) can be written as: [ d^6 + 1 = (d^2+1)(d^4 - d^2 + 1) ] This shows that ( d^2+1 ) is a factor of ( d^6 + 1 ). 4. **Confirming Divisibility Using Pell’s Equation**: To systematically find such ( c ) and ( d ) values, consider parameters satisfying the Pell equation ( c^2 + 1 = 2d^2 ). Solutions for Pell's equation ( m^2 + 1 = 2n^2 ) generate more solutions given initial values. 5. **Iterating Solutions from Pell’s Equation**: Given: [ M = 3m + 4n, quad N = 2m + 3n ] Starting with initial small solutions ( (m, n) = (7, 5) ), we get iterative solutions: For instance: [ (M, N) = (3 cdot 7 + 4 cdot 5, 2 cdot 7 + 3 cdot 5) = (41, 29) ] Repeating, next we get: [ (M, N) = (3 cdot 41 + 4 cdot 29, 2 cdot 41 + 3 cdot 29) = (239, 169) ] 6. **Setting Sequences**: Thus, using generated pairs, set ( a_n = d_n^2 ) and ( b_n = c_n(d_n^2 + 1) + d_n^3 ).

The profit can be calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price: Profit = SP - CP Since the profit percentage is 100% of the cost price, the profit is equal to the cost price: Profit = CP Now, we know that Radha bought the watch for Rs. 144, which is the cost price: CP = Rs. 144 Therefore, the cost price of the watch is Rs. boxed{144} ."},{"prompt":"Given a secondorder matrix M= begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}2 & 1 a & bend{matrix}right.end{pmatrix} (where a, b in mathbb{R}), if matrix M has an eigenvector overrightarrow {α_{1}} corresponding to the eigenvalue 1, which is begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}1 3end{matrix}right.end{pmatrix}, and an eigenvector overrightarrow {α_{2}} corresponding to the eigenvalue 3, which is begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}1 1end{matrix}right.end{pmatrix}． (I) Find the values of the real numbers a and b; (II) If vector overrightarrow {β} is begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}3 5end{matrix}right.end{pmatrix}, calculate the value of M^{5} overrightarrow {β}．","completion":"Solution: (I) From begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}2 & 1 a & bend{matrix}right.end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}-1 3end{matrix}right.end{pmatrix}=- begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}-1 3end{matrix}right.end{pmatrix}, and begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}2 & 1 a & bend{matrix}right.end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}1 1end{matrix}right.end{pmatrix}=3 begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}1 1end{matrix}right.end{pmatrix} we have begin{cases} left.begin{matrix}-a+3b=-3 a+b=3end{matrix}right.end{cases}, solving this gives begin{cases} left.begin{matrix}a=3 b=0end{matrix}right.end{cases}； (II) Let begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}-3 5end{matrix}right.end{pmatrix}=m begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}-1 3end{matrix}right.end{pmatrix}+n begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}1 1end{matrix}right.end{pmatrix}, then begin{cases} left.begin{matrix}-m+n=-3 3m+n=5end{matrix}right.end{cases} solving this gives begin{cases} left.begin{matrix}m=2 n=-1end{matrix}right.end{cases}． Therefore, overrightarrow {β}=2 overrightarrow {α_{1}}- overrightarrow {α_{2}}, thus M^{5} overrightarrow {β}=2M^{5} overrightarrow {α_{1}}-M^{5} overrightarrow {α_{2}} = 2(-1)^{5} begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}-1 3end{matrix}right.end{pmatrix}-3^{5} begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}1 1end{matrix}right.end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} left.begin{matrix}-241 -249end{matrix}right.end{pmatrix}． Thus, the final answers are: - For (I), a=3 and b=0, so boxed{a=3, b=0}. - For (II), the value of M^{5} overrightarrow {β} is boxed{begin{pmatrix} -241 -249 end{pmatrix}}."},{"prompt":"Given the square of an integer x is 9801, what is the value of (x+1)(x1)?","completion":"We follow a similar approach as used in the original problem with the modified value for x^2.

This is because the total number of elements (2016) must be divisible by the period of the permutation cycle. 3. **Finding (k)**: We need to find the values of (k) such that (6k) divides 2016. This is because each cycle of length (6k) will cover all elements exactly once. [ 2016 = 2^5 times 3^2 times 7 ] The possible values of (6k) that divide 2016 are the divisors of 2016 that are multiples of 6.

If (6k) divides 2016, then we can partition the set ({1, 2, ldots, 2016}) into blocks of size (6k). Within each block, the permutation must satisfy the condition (|a_i - i| = 3k). - For (k = 1), (6k = 6): [ a_i = begin{cases} i + 3 & text{if } 1 leq i leq 3 i - 3 & text{if } 4 leq i leq 6 end{cases} ] This pattern repeats every 6 elements. - For (k = 2), (6k = 12): [ a_i = begin{cases} i + 6 & text{if } 1 leq i leq 6 i - 6 & text{if } 7 leq i leq 12 end{cases} ] This pattern repeats every 12 elements. - And so on for other values of (k). 5. **Counting the Permutations**: For each valid (k), there is exactly one way to construct the permutation that satisfies the condition. Therefore, the number of such permutations is equal to the number of valid (k). The valid values of (k) are those for which (6k) divides 2016. From the divisors calculated, we have 9 such values.

So the perimeter is: P = 2(90 + 50) = 2(140) = 280 metres Now, if the poles are placed 4 metres apart, we can find the number of poles by dividing the perimeter by the distance between the poles. Number of poles = Perimeter / Distance between poles Number of poles = 280 metres / 4 metres per pole Number of poles = 70 poles However, this calculation assumes that the poles are placed exactly 4 metres apart and that the last pole ends exactly at the corner.

Therefore, (AB), (AC), and (AD) are red edges. 5. **Investigate the edges among (B), (C), and (D):** Now consider the edges (BC), (CD), and (DB) among points (B), (C), and (D). 6. **Determine triad of points forming a monochromatic triangle:** There are two scenarios: - If any of (BC), (CD), or (DB) is red, then you form a red triangle with (A): - For instance, if (BC) is red, then (triangle ABC) is a red triangle since (AB), (AC), and (BC) are all red. - If none of the edges (BC), (CD), or (DB) is red, then they must all be blue: - If (BC), (CD), and (DB) are blue, then (triangle BCD) itself is a blue triangle. # Conclusion: Given the above analysis, in a complete graph (K_6) with each edge colored either red or blue, it is inevitable that you can find 3 points such that all the edges connecting them are of the same color, thus forming a monochromatic triangle.

According to the information given, after the addition, the solution is 12.5% jasmine. This means there are 12.5/100 * 100 = 12.5 liters of jasmine in the 100-liter solution. Now, we know that the initial amount of jasmine water plus the 8 liters added equals the final amount of jasmine in the solution: (P/100) * 90 + 8 = 12.5 Let's solve for P: (P/100) * 90 = 12.5 - 8 (P/100) * 90 = 4.5 Now, we multiply both sides by 100/90 to isolate P: P = (4.5 * 100) / 90 P = 450 / 90 P = 5 So, the initial percentage of jasmine water in the cool-drink solution was boxed{5%} ."},{"prompt":"The quadratic (2x^2 + 5x 12) has two real roots.

The original number is 2200, or equivalently, 2200.0 when considering the decimal point. 1. Move the decimal point 3 places to the left to get 2.2.

B receives 2/3 of the profit. Since profits in a partnership are typically distributed based on the amount of capital contributed and the time for which the capital is used, we can set up a ratio to determine for how long B's money was used. Let's call the time for which B's money was used T months. The ratio of A's capital-time contribution to B's capital-time contribution is equal to the ratio of their profit shares. So, we have: (A's capital contribution * A's time) / (B's capital contribution * B's time) = A's profit share / B's profit share Substituting the values we have: ((1/4)C * 15) / ((3/4)C * T) = (1 - 2/3) / (2/3) Simplifying the profit share ratio: 1/3 / 2/3 = 1/2 Now, we can solve for T: ((1/4) * 15) / ((3/4) * T) = 1/2 Multiplying both sides by (3/4)T to get rid of the denominator on the left side: (1/4) * 15 = (1/2) * (3/4) * T Simplifying: 15/4 = (3/8) * T Now, multiply both sides by 8/3 to solve for T: T = (15/4) * (8/3) T = (15 * 2) / (1 * 3) T = 30 / 3 T = 10 So, B's money was used for boxed{10} months."},{"prompt":"For two given distinct points A and B on the plane, find the geometric locus of points C such that the triangle ABC is acuteangled, and its angle at A is of intermediate size.

From the geometry of the problem, we know that (angle BAC < 90^circ) if and only if points (B) and (C) lie on the same side of this perpendicular line. 2. **Consider Triangle Conditions**: For angles (angle A) and (angle B) to be less than (90^circ), point (C) must lie within the strip defined by the lines passing through points (A) and (B), which are perpendicular to segment (AB). 3. **Construct the Circumcircle**: Construct a circle using segment (AB) as the diameter. According to the properties of the circle, any point (C) on this circle makes (angle ACB = 90^circ). Hence: - If point (C) is on the circle, (angle ACB = 90^circ), - If point (C) is inside the circle, (angle ACB) is obtuse, - If point (C) is outside the circle, (angle ACB) is acute. Therefore, (C) must lie outside this circle for (triangle ABC) to be acute-angled. 4. **Defining ( angle A ) as the Median Angle**: The mid-sized angle property can be described as: [ angle B leq angle A leq angle C quad text{or} quad angle C leq angle A leq angle B ] This can be translated into inequalities of side lengths because the larger angle is opposite the larger side, giving us: [ AC leq BC leq AB ] 5. **Constructing Geometrical Conditions**: - **Half-Plane Condition**: Consider the perpendicular bisector of segment (AB).

Exploring combinations: - 72 = 6 times 6 times 2 - 72 = 6 times 3 times 4 - 72 = 4 times 3 times 6 These combinations cover all possible arrangements considering the outcomes of the dice. Each of the combinations above can occur in several orders: - For 6 times 6 times 2, the permutations are (6,6,2), (6,2,6), (2,6,6). - For 6 times 3 times 4, the permutations are (6,3,4), (6,4,3), (3,6,4), (3,4,6), (4,6,3), (4,3,6).

To begin, we will demonstrate that triangle ADA' sim triangle BCC'.

Specifically: - angle DA'A = angle DCC' (as these correspond to frac{angle C}{2}), - and angle DA'A = angle A'A C' = angle BC'C (as these correspond to frac{angle A}{2}). Hence, triangle ADA' and triangle BCC' each have two pairs of angles that are congruent. By the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity postulate, the triangles are similar.

Since the triangles triangle ADA' and triangle BCC' are similar, it follows that their corresponding angles are equal, leading to angle B = angle D. Therefore, the necessary condition for the bisectors of opposite angles A and C to be parallel is that angle B = angle D. But this condition is also sufficient as shown below. 3. Suppose angle B = angle D, then: [ begin{aligned} angle C & = 360^circ - angle D - angle B - angle A & = 360^circ - 2 cdot angle D - angle A, end{aligned} ] 4. From the above, we can isolate frac{angle C}{2}: [ frac{angle C}{2} = 180^circ - angle D - frac{angle A}{2} ] 5.

If the bisectors of the angles A and C are collinear (i.e., they lie on the same line): - Consider triangle ABC and triangle ADC. - These triangles are congruent since they share a common side AC and have angle A and angle C bisected equally, meaning angle ABC = angle ADC. - Hence, AD = AB and DC = BC which implies the quadrilateral ABCD is a kite. - The sides of this kite are the tangents to two circles: one that touches the sides of the quadrilateral internally and the other externally.

Then, we can write the following equation based on the information given: x / 5 = r + 8 We also know that when x is divided by 34, the remainder r must be less than 34 (since the remainder is always less than the divisor). So, 0 ≤ r < 34.

The smallest value of k for which 34k - 40 is divisible by 4 is k = 3 (since 34*3 - 40 = 62, and 62 is divisible by 4).

In graph theory terms, this means that the complement of the graph (where an edge represents hatred) does not contain a complete subgraph ( K_4 ). 2. **Condition 2: For any positive integer ( m ), if there are ( m ) puddings who like each other, then there exists 3 puddings (from the other ( n-m ) puddings) that hate each other.** This implies that if we have a subset of ( m ) puddings that form a clique (complete subgraph) in the liking graph, then the remaining ( n-m ) puddings must contain a subset of 3 puddings that form a clique in the hatred graph. Let's start by testing small values of ( n ) to see if they satisfy both conditions. # Testing ( n = 3 ): - With 3 puddings, any subset of 4 puddings is not possible, so Condition 1 is trivially satisfied. - For ( m = 2 ), the remaining ( n-m = 1 ) puddings cannot form a subset of 3 puddings that hate each other, so Condition 2 is trivially satisfied. However, ( n = 3 ) is too small to be meaningful in this context since the problem specifies ( n ge 3 ). # Testing ( n = 4 ): - With 4 puddings, any subset of 4 puddings must have at least one pair that likes each other, which is trivially true. - For ( m = 2 ), the remaining ( n-m = 2 ) puddings cannot form a subset of 3 puddings that hate each other, so Condition 2 is trivially satisfied. Again, ( n = 4 ) is too small to be meaningful. # Testing ( n = 5 ): - With 5 puddings, we need to check if any subset of 4 puddings has at least one pair that likes each other. - For ( m = 2 ), the remaining ( n-m = 3 ) puddings must contain a subset of 3 puddings that hate each other. Let's construct a graph with 5 vertices and check the conditions: - Suppose the vertices are ( A, B, C, D, E ). - If we try to construct a graph where every subset of 4 vertices has at least one pair that likes each other, we find that it is not possible to satisfy both conditions simultaneously. # Testing ( n = 13 ): - With 13 puddings, we need to check if any subset of 4 puddings has at least one pair that likes each other. - For ( m = 2 ), the remaining ( n-m = 11 ) puddings must contain a subset of 3 puddings that hate each other. Let's construct a graph with 13 vertices and check the conditions: - Suppose the vertices are ( a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m ). - The graph ( G ) with the following set of edges satisfies both conditions: [ {ab, ac, ad, ae, ah, ak, be, bf, bg, ch, ci, cj, dk, dl, dm, hk, hl, hm, bh, bi, bj, bk, bl, bm, ce, cf, cg, ck, cl, cm, de, df, dg, dh, di, dj, ik, il, im, eh, ei, ej, ek, el, em, fh, fi, fj, fk, fl, fm, gh, gi, gj, gk, gl, gm, jk, jl, jm} ] This graph satisfies both conditions, and thus ( n = 13 ) is a possible solution.

Similarly, we can calculate the number of green marbles as: Number of green marbles = Probability of green marble * Total number of marbles Number of green marbles = 2/7 * 84 Number of green marbles = 24 Now, we can find the probability of drawing either a red or blue marble by subtracting the probabilities of drawing a white or green marble from 1: Probability (Red or Blue) = 1 - (Probability of White + Probability of Green) Probability (Red or Blue) = 1 - (1/4 + 2/7) To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator.

(The apex angle of a cone is defined as the angle between its generatrices in an axial section.)","completion":"1. Let us denote the desired angle at the apex of the fourth cone as (2gamma). 2. Consider identical spheres inscribed within the three identical cones with vertices at point (A) and angles of (frac{pi}{3}) at the apex. Let the centers of these spheres be (O_1), (O_2), and (O_3), and let each sphere have radius (r). These spheres touch each other externally. 3. Suppose the fourth cone, with vertex at point (A), is internally tangent to these three spheres at points (B), (C), and (D) respectively. Thus, (AB = AC = AD), meaning that points (B), (C), and (D) lie on a sphere with center (O) and radius (R), inscribed in the fourth cone. 4. These points of tangency mean that the sphere with center (O) and radius (R) touches the three spheres centered at (O_1), (O_2), and (O_3). Consequently, the distances from (O) to (O_1), (O_2), and (O_3) are all (R-r). 5. Triangles (ABO_1), (ACO_2), and (ADO_3) are right triangles (since the spheres are tangent to the cones at points (B), (C), and (D)). Hence, these triangles are congruent by the two legs, and so (AO_1 = AO_2 = AO_3). The line (AO) passes through the center (H) of the circumscribed circle of triangle (O_1O_2O_3). 6. The triangle (O_1O_2O_3) is equilateral with side length (2r), making (O_1H = frac{2r}{sqrt{3}}) (since (H) is the centroid of the equilateral triangle). 7.

We know that (R = AB cdot tan gamma = r cdot cot frac{pi}{6} cdot tan gamma = r sqrt{3} cdot tan gamma). 9. Therefore, equating both expressions for (O_1H), we have: [ frac{2r}{sqrt{3}} = (R-r) cos gamma. ] Substituting the value of (R): [ frac{2r}{sqrt{3}} = (r sqrt{3} tan gamma - r) cos gamma. ] 10.

The two empty seats can be arranged in 2 ways since they are indistinguishable. The 4 units (the 3 people and the 1 unit of empty seats) can be arranged in 4! ways since they are distinguishable.

Let's denote the lengths of its sides as a, b, and c, and the area of the triangle as Delta. 2. **Transformation of the Sides**: Each side of triangle ABC is extended by its own length. This means: - The side BC of length a is extended by a. - The side CA of length b is extended by b. - The side AB of length c is extended by c. This results in a larger triangle formed by connecting the ends of these extensions. 3. **Formation of New Triangles**: Around the original triangle ABC, three new triangles are formed: - Triangle formed with side BC and its extension by a. - Triangle formed with side CA and its extension by b. - Triangle formed with side AB and its extension by c.

Remaining money after buying 11 new postcards = 95.90 - 88 = 7.90 Bernie then buys another 5 postcards at 6 each using the remaining money. The total cost for these 5 postcards is: 5 * 6 = 30 Since Bernie only has 7.90 left, he cannot afford to buy 5 more postcards at 6 each. Therefore, we need to correct this part of the problem.

What is the minimum speed the airplane could have?","completion":"The problem involves determining the minimum speed of an airplane that is observed from two points (A) and (B) which are (d) kilometers apart. Observers at points (A) and (B) note that the airplane's angle of displacement over 1 second forms angles (alpha) and (beta) with respect to the straight line between (A) and (B). We need to find the smallest possible speed of the airplane. Let's denote the positions of the airplane at the start and end of the observations as (P) and (Q) respectively, and let (PQ = r). The minimum speed (v) will correspond to the minimum (r). Alternatively, we find the maximum of the ratio (frac{d}{r}). 1. Consider the segment (AB = d) remaining constant and the point (P) moving to (Q). The observed angles from (A) and (B) are (alpha) and (beta) respectively. 2. By the geometry of the situation: - Point (A) must lie on a surface generated by rotating a segment with angle (alpha) around the chord (PQ). - Similarly, point (B) lies on a similar surface with angle (beta). When considering their intersection through rotation, these surfaces project to a 2D plane as shown in the figure from the problem. 3. By analyzing the trigonometric properties, we can derive a relation involving the cotangents of the observed angles: [ angle PAQ = alpha ] Thus, (A) lies on the cone with apex angle (alpha), and similarly for (B) and (beta). 4. The distance (d) between (A) and (B) achieves its maximum value when these points are diametrically opposite on their respective conical surfaces. This condition transforms into: [ frac{2d}{r} = cotleft(frac{alpha}{2}right) + cotleft(frac{beta}{2}right) ] From this, solving for (r), we get: [ r = frac{2d}{cotleft(frac{alpha}{2}right) + cotleft(frac{beta}{2}right)} ] Thus, the minimum speed (v) of the airplane, considering that it traveled a distance (r) in (1) second, is: [ v = frac{2d}{cotleft(frac{alpha}{2}right) + cotleft(frac{beta}{2}right)} text{ km/s} ] **Conclusion**: [ boxed{frac{2d}{cotleft(frac{alpha}{2}right) + cotleft(frac{beta}{2}right)}} ]"},{"prompt":"A boat travels 45 miles upstream in 5 hours.

When the boat is traveling upstream, its effective speed is ( b - c ), because the current is working against it. When traveling downstream, its effective speed is ( b + c ), because the current is helping it along. We can set up two equations based on the information given: 1. Upstream: The boat travels 45 miles in 5 hours, so the speed is ( frac{45 text{ miles}}{5 text{ hours}} = 9 text{ mph} ). Therefore, ( b - c = 9 ). 2.

The distance formula for two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), when y_1 = y_2, simplifies to the absolute value of the difference between x_1 and x_2, i.e., |x_1 - x_2|.

Let's denote the points of intersection of the diagonals (AD) and (BC) as (M). Note that since (c < a) and the trapezoid is convex, (M) always exists and lies on the side of the line (AB) containing (CD). Let (AM = d) and (BM = b).

Is it always possible to permute the numbers in the table so that the sums in the columns would still be different and the sums in the rows would also be different? *( 6 points)*","completion":"**(a):** 1. **Initial Assumption:** - We are given a 2 times n table where the sums in all columns are different. - We need to prove that it is possible to permute the numbers in the table so that the sums in the columns remain different and the sums in the rows also become different. 2. **Case 1: Row sums are already distinct:** - If the sums of the two rows are already distinct, then we are done. No further action is needed. 3. **Case 2: Row sums are equal:** - Suppose the sums of the two rows are equal. - If there is a column with two distinct numbers, swapping them would make the row sums different while keeping the column sums different. 4. **Case 3: Each column contains a pair of the same number:** - Suppose each column contains a pair of the same number. The table looks like this: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} hline a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & cdots & a_n hline a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & cdots & a_n hline end{array} ] - Assume without loss of generality (WLOG) that a_1, a_2, a_3 are the largest three elements. Since the column sums 2a_1, 2a_2, ldots, 2a_n are all distinct, these a_i's are all distinct. 5. **Construct a new array:** - Consider the new array: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} hline a_1 & a_3 & a_3 & cdots & cdots hline a_2 & a_2 & a_1 & cdots & cdots hline end{array} ] - The column sums are still different because if we had a_1 + a_2 = a_3 + a_2, then a_1 = a_3, which is false. Also, we can't have a_1 + a_2 = a_i + a_i for some i notin {1, 2, 3} because a_1, a_2 > a_i. 6. **Row sums become distinct:** - Now the row sums must have become distinct, or we would have a_1 + a_3 + a_3 = a_2 + a_2 + a_1 implies a_2 = a_3, which is wrong. Thus, we have shown that it is possible to permute the numbers in the table so that the sums in the columns remain different and the sums in the rows also become different. blacksquare **(b):** 1. **Claim:** - We claim that such a permutation is not always feasible for a 100 times 100 table. 2. **Lemma:** - Suppose n ge 3 is an integer. If x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n are distinct nonnegative integers satisfying [ x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n = frac{n^2 - n + 2}{2}, ] then (x_1, x_2, cdots, x_n) is (0, 1, 2, cdots, n-3, n-2, n) up to permutation. 3. **Proof of Lemma:** - We induct on n. The base case n = 3 is obvious. Let's prove it for general n > 3. - If all x_i's were nonzero, then we would have [ x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n ge 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + n = frac{n^2 + n}{2} > frac{n^2 - n + 2}{2}. ] This is a contradiction. Therefore, one of the x_i's is 0. Suppose WLOG x_1 = 0. Then the n-1-tuple (x_2 - 1, x_3 - 1, cdots, x_n - 1) satisfies the conditions of the induction hypothesis, completing the proof. square 4. **Main Proof:** - Consider the 100 times 100 array defined as follows: fill the second column with 1 one, the third column with 2 ones, the fourth column with 3 ones, and so on, up to the 99-th column with 98 ones. The 100-th column is filled with 100 ones. The remaining cells are all zeros. - The column sums are all different. Suppose there is a way to permute these 4951 ones so that column sums are distinct and the row sums are distinct as well. - Let x_i be the number of ones in the i-th column and y_i be the number of ones in the i-th row. Note that x_1, cdots, x_{100} are distinct nonnegative integers summing to 4951 = frac{100^2 - 100 + 2}{2}, so our lemma says that (x_1, cdots, x_{100}) is a permutation of (0, 1, cdots, 98, 100). - Suppose x_a = 100. Similarly, (y_1, cdots, y_{100}) is a permutation of (0, 1, cdots, 98, 100); say y_b = 0. - Now the a-th column has all 100 cells filled with ones, and the b-th row has no ones at all, leading to a contradiction. Thus, it is not always possible to permute the numbers in the table so that the sums in the columns remain different and the sums in the rows also become different. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The advertising cost x and the sales volume y of a certain product correspond to a set of data (x, y): (4, 49), (2, 26), (3, 39), (5, 54).

To find the maximum value of f(x), let's consider the absolute value properties. The inequality f(x) leq |(x-2)-(x-5)| holds because the difference of two absolute values is less than or equal to the absolute value of their difference. Thus, f(x) leq |x-2-x+5| = |3| = 3. So, f_{text{max}}(x) = 3. Hence, we deduce that k must be less than 3 because if k were equal to or greater than 3, there would be no x that satisfies the inequality |x-2|-|x-5|>k, as the maximum value of the left side is 3.

The points A, M, and N are such that AM and AN are tangents to the circle from the external point A, and P and Q are points where the secant line through A intersects the circle. Let L be the midpoint of PQ. 2. **Orthogonality**: Since L is the midpoint of the chord PQ, it lies on the perpendicular bisector of PQ, which passes through the center of the circle O. Therefore, OL perp PQ. 3. **Angle Relationships**: The tangent segments from a point outside the circle are equal, i.e., AM = AN. As a result, angle OMA = angle ONA = 90^circ because OM perp MA and ON perp NA (tangent-radius property). 4. **Cyclic Quadrilateral**: Since OM perp AM and ON perp AN, the points O, M, A, and N form a cyclic quadrilateral. Also, because OL perp AL and L is the midpoint of PQ on the circle, all these points lie on a common circle. 5. **Verify the Desired Angles**: In cyclic quadrilateral OMAN, opposite angles sum to 180^circ.

It's given that this movement redistributes tokens such that one token ends up in each cell again after one operation. 5.

The length of this route for each cell in the first segment is the number of operations it takes for the token to return to the first segment. By the problem's nature, the entire grid undergoes a bijective transformation with each operation: 1. This transformation maintains a one-to-one correspondence between the grid cells, guaranteeing that each cell can map back to an initial state uniquely. 2. Therefore, every token's movement forms unique routes that do not intersect, ensuring that each route ends without cycles. Introduce the notion of \\"critical cells\\": 1. **Critical Cells:** The leftmost cell of each segment. These critical cells are pivot points for determining the route lengths. Key argument: 1. If a route doesn't contain any critical cell, moving all cells of the route one step to the left results in a new route of the same length. 2.

Thus, analyzing only the routes passing through critical cells suffices: 1. There are exactly 100 such critical cells (one per segment). 2. Consequently, there are at most 100 unique routes for tokens since no route can have the same critical cell twice (no route cycles back onto itself within one operational cycle). Conclusion: 1.

Substituting x = 0 into f'(x) we get: f'(0) = frac {1}{0+1} - frac {a}{(0+1)^{2}} = 0, which simplifies to a = 1. For this value of a, the derivative simplifies to f'(x) = frac {x}{(x+1)^{2}}.

(1) Prove that f(x) is an odd function; (2) Prove that f(x) is a decreasing function on mathbb{R}; (3) Find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval [2, 4].","completion":"(1) To prove f(x) is an odd function, we will show f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. First, let x = y = 0. Then, we have f(0+0) = f(0) + f(0), which simplifies to f(0) = 2f(0). Hence, f(0) = 0 since the only solution to this equation is f(0) = 0. Next, let y = -x. We then have f(x-x) = f(x) + f(-x), which simplifies to f(0) = f(x) + f(-x). Since we have already shown f(0) = 0, it follows that f(x) + f(-x) = 0 and thus f(-x) = -f(x). Therefore, f(x) is an odd function as for all x in mathbb{R}, f(-x) = -f(x). (2) To prove f(x) is a decreasing function on mathbb{R}, we will show that for any two numbers x_1, x_2 in mathbb{R} with x_2 > x_1, we have f(x_2) < f(x_1). Let x_2 > x_1. Then f(x_2) - f(x_1) = f(x_2 + (-x_1)). Since x_2 > x_1, x_2 - x_1 > 0 and from the function properties given, f(x_2 - x_1) < 0. Therefore, f(x_2) - f(x_1) = f(x_2 - x_1) < 0, which implies f(x_2) < f(x_1). As a result, f(x) is a decreasing function on mathbb{R}. (3) Since f(-1) = 2, we can calculate f(-2) by using the additivity property of the function. We find f(-2) = f(-1) + f(-1) = 2 + 2 = 4. Furthermore, since f(x) is an odd function, f(2) = -f(-2) = -4. We then calculate f(4) as follows: f(4) = f(2+2) = f(2) + f(2) = -4 + (-4) = -8. Because f(x) is decreasing over the interval [-2, 4], the maximum value of f(x) on this interval occurs at the left endpoint, -2, and the minimum value occurs at the right endpoint, 4. Thus, the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on [-2, 4] are boxed{f_{text{max}} = f(-2) = 4} and boxed{f_{text{min}} = f(4) = -8}, respectively."},{"prompt":"The remainder when positive integer nn (n > 1) is divided by some number is 1 and the remainder when nn is divided by 7 is also 1.

We know that when ( n ) is divided by ( d ), the remainder is 1, and when ( n ) is divided by 7, the remainder is also 1. This means that ( n ) is 1 more than a multiple of both ( d ) and 7. Since the least value of ( n ) is 175, we can write: ( n = kd + 1 ) for some integer ( k ) ( n = 7m + 1 ) for some integer ( m ) Since ( n ) is the same in both cases and is given as 175, we have: ( 175 = kd + 1 ) ( 175 = 7m + 1 ) From the second equation, we can find ( m ) by subtracting 1 from 175 and then dividing by 7: ( 174 = 7m ) ( m = 174 / 7 ) ( m = 24.8571... ) Since ( m ) must be an integer, we can see that ( m ) is actually 25 (since 175 is 1 more than 174, which is 7 times 24 plus 6). So, we have: ( 175 = 7 times 25 + 1 ) Now, we need to find ( d ) such that ( 175 = kd + 1 ). Since ( n ) is 1 more than a multiple of ( d ), ( d ) must divide 174 (which is ( n - 1 )). The factors of 174 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 29, 58, 87, and 174. We can eliminate 1 because ( n > 1 ), and we can eliminate 2 and 3 because they are not one less than 175. The next smallest factor is 6, but 6 is not one less than a multiple of 175. The next factor is 29, and 174 is indeed a multiple of 29 (174 = 29 * 6).

These four-cell figures can be rotated and flipped. 2. **Divide the Board**: Start by noting that a ( 12 times 12 ) board can be divided into smaller rectangles. Consider dividing it into ( 2 times 3 ) rectangles. This would result in [ frac{12 times 12}{2 times 3} = frac{144}{6} = 24 ] smaller rectangles of size ( 2 times 3 ). 3. **Analyzing the Subdivision**: Within each ( 2 times 3 ) rectangle, a four-cell figure in any possible configuration (including rotations and reflections) will always cover at least two cells. Hence, if we can ensure that each ( 2 times 3 ) rectangle contains at least two marked cells, then any four-cell figure will necessarily touch a marked cell. 4. **Counting the Minimum Marks**: Since there are 24 such ( 2 times 3 ) rectangles on the board and each must contain at least two marked cells, it implies we need at least [ 24 times 2 = 48 ] marked cells. 5. **Constructing an Example with Minimum Marks**: To achieve the required marking, one strategy is to mark cells in such a way that every ( 2 times 3 ) rectangle gets exactly two marks. For an explicit construction, consider cells where the sum of their coordinates (row + column index) is divisible by 4.

Let ( a_i ) represent the number of coins pirate ( i ) has initially, arranged from the youngest to the oldest. Given that each pirate (except the youngest one) has one coin more than the next younger pirate, we can express the number of coins as: [ a_i = a_1 + (i-1) ] for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ). 2.

For our polynomial, the constant term is 9, and the leading coefficient is 1 (implied for x^3). Thus, any rational root of the polynomial must be among the divisors of 9.

Expanding each paired term: [ = (a^2 - b^2)^2 + 2ab(a^2 - b^2) + b^2(a^2 - b^2) + (2ab)^2 + 4abb^2 + b^4 ] [ = (a^2 - b^2)^2 + 2a^3b - 2ab^3 + a^2b^2 - b^4 + 4a^2b^2 + 2ab^3 + b^4 ] 9. Notice cancellations and combine escape terms carefully: [ = a^4 - 2a^2b^2 + b^4 + 2a^3b - 2ab^3 + 5a^2b^2 + 2ab^3 + b^4 - b^4 ] 10.

Does this proposition remain true if we do not require the polygons M to be convex?","completion":"1. Consider arranging a tiling with convex n-gons that fully covers a plane without gaps and overlaps. To prove that n leq 6, analyze the conditions required for such tiling. 2. Let the polygon M have area S and fit entirely within a circle of diameter d = 2r. We place this circle inside a sufficiently large square with side length l, which will be explained at the end. 3. Denote by N_1 and N_2 the number of vertices of the first and second types, respectively, in the tiling (as described in Problem 81). 4. Denote by L the count of polygons that have at least one vertex inside the square. 5. We start with the inequality: [ 3N_1 + 2N_2 leq Ln ] because at each vertex of the first type, at least three polygons meet, and at each vertex of the second type, at least two polygons meet. Here, Ln is the total number of vertices of all polygons intersecting the square. 6. For clarity, the terms 3N_1 and 2N_2 are due to the polygons' vertices at each node, relative to their vertex types considered. 7. Next, sum the interior angles of nodes within the square: [ 4dN_1 + 2dN_2 leq 2d(n-2)L ] since each angle's sum in these nodes can't exceed the sum of all internal angles of the polygons intersecting the square. Thus, this expression relates vertex angles to the total internal angles of these polygons. 8. Simplifying the amount of overlap area covered: [ frac{(l+2r)^2 - (l-2r)^2}{S} = frac{8lr}{S} ] provides the area between concentric squares of sides l-2r and l+2r. 9. Thus, the total area estimate calculation relates the above area to the polygon area S within the tiling, showing the inequality: [ 2d(n-2)L - (4dN_1 + 2dN_2) < frac{8lr}{S} cdot 2d(n-2) ] leading to: [ 4dN_1 + 2dN_2 > 2d(n-2)L left(1 - frac{8r}{l} right) ] 10. Simplifying, divide both sides of the inequality by d and compare to earlier estimations: [ N1 > Ln - 4L - 2(n-2)L frac{8r}{l} ] 11. Combining the results: [ 3N_1 leq Ln ] thus: [ frac{n}{3} > n - 4 - 2(n-2)frac{8r}{l} ] 12.

Concluding, since these derivations hold without requiring polygons M inside be equal, but simply all being n-gons fitting within the radius r, tiling works efficiently only up to n=6. Conclusion: [ boxed{n le 6} ] This completes the proof that a convex n-gon with n geq 7 cannot tile the plane without gaps or overlaps. Beyond this, non-convex shapes or other types beyond standard tiling configurations were implied not effectively covering as needed under the rules specified without intersection or misalignment.

Show that there exists a square with side length L and sides parallel to the coordinate axes, such that all points in the square are invisible.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to show that there exists a square of side length ( L ) such that all lattice points within this square are invisible. A lattice point ( A ) is invisible if the line segment ( OA ) contains another lattice point other than ( O ) and ( A ). 2. **Choosing Primes:** Select distinct prime numbers ( p_0, p_1, ldots, p_{(L+1)^2 - 1} ). The number of primes chosen is ((L+1)^2) because we need to cover all points in the square of side length ( L ). 3. **Setting Up Congruences:** Define ( x ) and ( y ) such that they satisfy the following system of congruences: [ x equiv -i pmod{p_{i + (L+1)j}} ] [ y equiv -j pmod{p_{i + (L+1)j}} ] where ( i ) and ( j ) vary from ( 0 ) to ( L ). 4. **Existence of Solutions:** By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since the moduli ( p_{i + (L+1)j} ) are pairwise coprime (being distinct primes), there exists a unique solution modulo the product of these primes. Thus, we can find integers ( x ) and ( y ) that satisfy all the congruences simultaneously. 5. **Constructing the Square:** Consider the square with side length ( L ) whose bottom-left corner is at ( (x, y) ). This square will have vertices at: [ (x, y), (x+L, y), (x, y+L), (x+L, y+L) ] 6. **Verifying Invisibility:** For any lattice point ( (x+i, y+j) ) within this square, where ( 0 leq i, j leq L ): - The point ( (x+i, y+j) ) satisfies: [ x+i equiv -i + i equiv 0 pmod{p_{i + (L+1)j}} ] [ y+j equiv -j + j equiv 0 pmod{p_{i + (L+1)j}} ] - This implies that ( (x+i, y+j) ) is a multiple of ( p_{i + (L+1)j} ), meaning the line segment from the origin to ( (x+i, y+j) ) will pass through other lattice points (multiples of ( p_{i + (L+1)j} )). 7. **Conclusion:** Since every point in the square is a multiple of some prime ( p_{i + (L+1)j} ), all points in the square are invisible.

Thus, Basil writes down: [ text{lcm}(x, y), text{lcm}(y, z), text{lcm}(z, x) ] Given that both Peter and Basil write down the same three numbers, we have: [ {gcd(a, b), gcd(b, c), gcd(c, a)} = {text{lcm}(x, y), text{lcm}(y, z), text{lcm}(z, x)} ] We need to prove that (a = b = c). 1. **Prime Factorization**: Consider the prime factorizations of (a), (b), and (c): [ a = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ] [ b = p_1^{f_1} p_2^{f_2} cdots p_k^{f_k} ] [ c = p_1^{g_1} p_2^{g_2} cdots p_k^{g_k} ] 2. **GCD and LCM in Terms of Prime Factors**: For each prime (p_i), the GCD and LCM can be expressed as: [ gcd(a, b) = p_1^{min(e_1, f_1)} p_2^{min(e_2, f_2)} cdots p_k^{min(e_k, f_k)} ] [ text{lcm}(x, y) = p_1^{max(e_1, f_1)} p_2^{max(e_2, f_2)} cdots p_k^{max(e_k, f_k)} ] 3. **Equality of GCD and LCM Sets**: Since the sets of GCDs and LCMs are equal, for each prime (p_i), the minimum exponents from Peter's numbers must match the maximum exponents from Basil's numbers. This implies: [ min(e_i, f_i) = max(e_i, f_i) ] [ min(f_i, g_i) = max(f_i, g_i) ] [ min(g_i, e_i) = max(g_i, e_i) ] 4. **Implication of Equality**: The only way for the minimum and maximum of a set of numbers to be equal is if all the numbers are the same. Therefore: [ e_i = f_i = g_i ] 5. **Conclusion**: Since this holds for all primes (p_i), we have: [ a = b = c ] Thus, the three numbers must be equal to each other. (blacksquare) (b) For four positive integers, consider the following counterexample: Let Peter's four numbers be (2, 4, 8, 16). The GCDs are: [ gcd(2, 4) = 2, gcd(2, 8) = 2, gcd(2, 16) = 2 ] [ gcd(4, 8) = 4, gcd(4, 16) = 4, gcd(8, 16) = 8 ] So, Peter writes down (2, 4, 8). Let Basil's four numbers be (4, 8, 16, 32). The LCMs are: [ text{lcm}(4, 8) = 8, text{lcm}(4, 16) = 16, text{lcm}(4, 32) = 32 ] [ text{lcm}(8, 16) = 16, text{lcm}(8, 32) = 32, text{lcm}(16, 32) = 32 ] So, Basil writes down (8, 16, 32). Clearly, the sets of GCDs and LCMs are not equal, showing that the analogous result does not hold for four numbers."},{"prompt":"Given that {a_{n}} is an arithmetic sequence, b_{n}=left{begin{array}{l}{a}_{n}6, text{ for odd } n} 2{a}_{n}, text{ for even } nend{array}right., let S_{n} and T_{n} be the sums of the first n terms of {a_{n}} and {b_{n}}, respectively, with S_{4}=32 and T_{3}=16.

Objective: Prove that the equation ( P(P(x)) = 0 ) has at least as many distinct real roots as the equation ( P(x) = 0 ). 1. **Identify the roots of ( P(x) = 0 )**: - Let ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) be the ( n ) distinct real roots of the equation ( P(x) = 0 ). 2. **Consider the auxiliary equations**: - Since ( P(x) ) is a polynomial of odd degree, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, ( P(x) ) must have at least one real root. Therefore, we consider the equations: [ P(x) = x_1, quad P(x) = x_2, quad ldots, quad P(x) = x_n ] 3. **Existence of solutions**: - Each of the auxiliary equations ( P(x) = x_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ) must have at least one solution, say ( a_i ), because ( P(x) ) is a polynomial of odd degree and thus it has at least one real root for any real number value. 4. **Distinctness of solutions ( a_i )**: - For ( i neq j ), ( a_i neq a_j ). This is because if ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) were the same, then it would imply ( P(a_i) = x_i ) and ( P(a_j) = x_j ), giving ( x_i = x_j ) which contradicts the fact that ( x_i ) and ( x_j ) are distinct. 5. **Conclusion: Roots of ( P(P(x)) = 0 )**: - Each ( a_i ) is a root of ( P(P(x)) = 0 ) since ( P(a_i) = x_i ) which is a root of ( P(x) = 0 ). Therefore: [ P(P(a_i)) = P(x_i) = 0 ] - Hence, ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) are distinct roots of the equation ( P(P(x)) = 0 ).

Since it is 60% longer than her previous 2-hour movie, we calculate the additional length as 60% of 2 hours. 60% of 2 hours is 0.6 * 2 hours = 1.2 hours. So, the new movie is 2 hours + 1.2 hours = 3.2 hours long. To convert the length of the new movie into minutes, we multiply 3.2 hours by 60 minutes per hour: 3.2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 192 minutes. The cost per minute to film the new movie is twice as much as the previous movie, which was 50 per minute. Therefore, the cost per minute for the new movie is: 2 * 50/minute = 100/minute.

First, let's analyze the properties of f(x) based on the given information: 1. **Periodicity and Symmetry**: - Since f(x) is an even function and satisfies f(4+x)=f(4-x), we can deduce that f(x+4)=f(4-x)=f(x-4). This implies that the function f(x) has a period of 8 and its graph is symmetric about the line x=4. 2. **Number of Periods in the Given Interval**: - The interval [-200,200] spans 400 units in length. Given the period of f(x) is 8, the interval contains 400/8=50 periods of f(x). 3. **Solutions in a Single Period**: - Due to the symmetry and periodicity of f(x), we can focus on the interval (0,4] to determine the number of integer solutions for the inequality f^{2}(x)+af(x) gt 0. Given the symmetry, the number of solutions in this interval will be the same for each period. The problem states there are exactly 300 integer solutions in the interval [-200,200], which implies there are 300/50=6 solutions per period. However, considering the symmetry, there should be 3 integer solutions in the interval (0,4]. 4. **Behavior of f(x) in (0,4]**: - The derivative f'(x)=dfrac{1-ln(2x)}{x^{2}} indicates that f(x) is increasing on (0,dfrac{e}{2}) and decreasing on (dfrac{e}{2},4). This behavior, along with the values of f(x) at specific points, helps us understand the function's trend within this interval. 5. **Determining the Range of a**: - Given a lt 0, we analyze the inequality f^{2}(x)+af(x) gt 0 to find that f(x) gt -a must hold for 3 integer solutions in (0,4], which are x=1, 2, 3. This leads to the conditions -ageqslant f(4)=dfrac{3}{4}ln 2, -a lt f(3)=dfrac{ln 6}{3}, and -a lt f(1)=ln 2. Simplifying these conditions gives us the range for a.

Thus, [ S_{triangle BEF} = frac{BE}{AB} cdot frac{BF}{BC} cdot S ] Since (E) lies on (AB), (BE = AB - AE = AB - frac{1}{3}AB = frac{2}{3}AB). Therefore, [ S_{triangle BEF} = frac{2}{3} cdot frac{1}{6} cdot S = frac{2}{18}S = frac{1}{9}S ] 3. Calculate the area of triangle (AEM): - Similarly, since (E) is located on (AB) and (M) on (AC), [ S_{triangle AEM} = frac{AE}{AB} cdot frac{AM}{AC} cdot S ] Given ( frac{AE}{AB} = frac{1}{3} ) and ( frac{AM}{AC} = frac{2}{5} ), [ S_{triangle AEM} = frac{1}{3} cdot frac{2}{5} cdot S = frac{2}{15}S ] 4. Calculate the area of triangle (CMF): - Since (C) is on side (AC) and (F) is on side (BC), [ S_{triangle CMF} = frac{CM}{AC} cdot frac{CF}{BC} cdot S ] Note that (M) divides (AC) in the ratio (2:3) (since ( frac{AM}{AC} = frac{2}{5} )); hence (CM = AC - AM = frac{3}{5}AC), and (F) divides (BC) in the ratio (1:5); hence (CF = BC - BF = BC - frac{1}{6}BC = frac{5}{6}BC). Therefore, [ S_{triangle CMF} = frac{3}{5} cdot frac{5}{6} cdot S = frac{15}{30}S = frac{1}{2}S ] 5. Subtract the areas of triangles (BEF), (AEM), and (CMF) from the area of (ABC) to find the area of triangle (EFM): [ S_{triangle EFM} = S - S_{triangle BEF} - S_{triangle AEM} - S_{triangle CMF} ] Substitute the areas: [ S_{triangle EFM} = S - frac{1}{9}S - frac{2}{15}S - frac{1}{2}S ] To subtract ( frac{1}{9}S ), ( frac{2}{15}S ), and ( frac{1}{2}S ), we need a common denominator. Here, 90: [ frac{1}{2}S = frac{45}{90}S, quad frac{2}{15}S = frac{12}{90}S, quad frac{1}{9}S = frac{10}{90}S ] [ S_{triangle EFM} = S - left(frac{10}{90}S + frac{12}{90}S + frac{45}{90}Sright) ] [ S_{triangle EFM} = S - frac{67}{90}S = frac{90}{90}S - frac{67}{90}S = frac{23}{90}S ] # Conclusion: The ratio of the area of triangle (EFM) to the area of triangle (ABC) is: [ boxed{frac{23}{90}} ]"},{"prompt":"the geometric sequence {a_n}, a_n > 0 (n in mathbb{N}^*), the common ratio q in (0, 1), and a_1a_5 + 2a_3a_5 + a_2a_8 = 25, the geometric mean of a_3 and a_5 is 2. 1.

In this scenario, the sides of the triangle would be 5cm, 5cm, and 11cm. To determine if a triangle can be formed, we apply the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Thus, we check if 5cm + 5cm > 11cm. Calculating the sum, we get 10cm lt 11cm. Since 10cm is not greater than 11cm, a triangle cannot be formed in this case. **Case 2:** The sides of length 11cm are equal. In this scenario, the sides of the triangle would be 5cm, 11cm, and 11cm. According to the triangle inequality theorem, we need to check if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the remaining side. For this case, it's evident that 5cm + 11cm = 16cm, which is greater than the other side of 11cm, and similarly, 11cm + 11cm = 22cm, which is greater than 5cm. Therefore, a triangle can indeed be formed. The perimeter of this triangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all sides: 5cm + 11cm + 11cm. Performing the addition, we get 27cm.

The sequence is then defined as: [ F_0 = 0, quad F_1 = 1, quad F_2 = 1, quad F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} text{ for } n geq 3. ] 2. **Lemma I:** (exists) (m > 0) such that (k mid F_m). **Proof:** There are only finitely many pairs ((a, b)) of integers modulo (k). By the Pigeonhole Principle, (exists) (x, y) with (x < y) such that: [ F_x equiv F_y pmod{k} quad text{and} quad F_{x+1} equiv F_{y+1} pmod{k}. ] Assume that for all (n > a geq 0), we have: [ F_{x-a} equiv F_{y-a} pmod{k} quad text{and} quad F_{x-a+1} equiv F_{y-a+1} pmod{k}. ] We will prove this must be true for (a = n) as well. Since: [ F_{x-(n-1)} equiv F_{y-(n-1)} pmod{k} quad text{and} quad F_{x-(n-1)+1} equiv F_{y-(n-1)+1} pmod{k}, ] we have: [ F_{x-n} equiv F_{x-(n-1)+1} - F_{x-(n-1)} equiv F_{y-(n-1)+1} - F_{y-(n-1)} equiv F_{y-n} pmod{k}. ] Hence, by induction, we have: [ F_{x-(x-1)} equiv F_1 equiv F_{y-(x-1)} pmod{k} quad text{and} quad F_{x-(x-1)+1} equiv F_2 equiv F_{y-(x-1)+1} pmod{k}. ] Then: [ F_{y-x} equiv F_{y-(x-1)+1} - F_{y-(x-1)} equiv F_2 - F_1 equiv 0 pmod{k}, ] so (k mid F_{y-x}), as desired. (blacksquare) 3. **Lemma II:** (gcd(F_n, F_{n-1}) = 1). **Proof:** Assume for the sake of contradiction, (exists) (x > 1) such that (F_n equiv F_{n-1} equiv 0 pmod{x}). Assume that for all (b > a > 0), we have: [ F_{n-a} equiv 0 pmod{x}. ] Then: [ F_{n-b+1} equiv F_{n-b+2} equiv 0 pmod{x}, ] so: [ F_{n-b} equiv F_{n-b+2} - F_{n-b+1} equiv 0 pmod{x}. ] Hence, by induction: [ F_{n-(n-1)} = F_1 = 1 equiv 0 pmod{x}, ] which is a contradiction. Therefore, (gcd(F_n, F_{n-1}) = 1). (blacksquare) 4. **Lemma III:** Let (c) be the least positive integer such that (x mid F_c). Then, (x mid F_n) iff (c mid n). **Proof:** If (x mid F_c): [ F_{c+1} equiv F_c + F_{c-1} equiv F_{c-1} pmod{x}, ] and: [ F_{c+2} equiv F_{c+1} + F_c equiv F_{c-1} pmod{x}. ] Then, because of the recursive definition of the Fibonacci sequence: [ F_{n+c} equiv F_n cdot F_{c-1} pmod{x}, ] and since (gcd(F_{c-1}, F_c) = 1), (F_{c-1}) and (x) must be relatively prime, so (x mid F_{n+c}) iff (x mid F_n), or in other words, (x mid F_n) iff (x mid F_{(n mod c)}). Since (c notmid F_1, F_2, cdots, F_{c-1}), this means (x mid F_n) iff (c mid n). (blacksquare) 5. **Main Proof:** Assume, for the sake of contradiction, (exists) (n in mathbb{Z}^+) such that (F_n equiv k pmod{F_b}), where (b) is the least positive integer such that (k mid F_b), and (k) is not a Fibonacci number. Then, (k mid F_n), and by Lemma III, (b mid n). However, if (k) is not a Fibonacci number, then (F_b = kx), where (x > 1 in mathbb{Z}^+), so by Lemma III, we have (kx mid F_n) as well. Finally, if (F_n equiv k pmod{F_b}), then (F_b mid F_n - k), and this gives us: [ frac{F_b}{k} mid frac{F_n}{k} + 1, ] so: [ frac{F_n}{k} equiv 1 pmod{frac{F_b}{k}}. ] This implies (frac{F_n}{k}) and (frac{F_b}{k}) are relatively prime, which is a contradiction, since we know that (x mid frac{F_n}{k}, frac{F_b}{k}). Thus, if (exists) (n in mathbb{Z}^+) such that (F_n equiv k pmod{m}) (forall) (m in mathbb{Z}^+), we must have that (k) is a Fibonacci number, as desired.

Since point M lies on the line frac{x}{m} + frac{y}{n} = 1 (m > 0, n > 0), we can say that frac{2}{m} + frac{1}{n} = 1.

Given that f(0)=0, we have c=0. So, f(x)=3x+sin x, which is an odd function and is strictly increasing in the entire interval, because f′(x)=3+cos x is always greater than 0 when x∈(-1,1). Due to the properties of odd functions, it is also strictly increasing in the corresponding interval. From f(1-x)+f(1-x^{2}) < 0, we obtain f(1-x) < -f(1-x^{2}), that is: f(1-x) < f(x^{2}-1). Thus, we have the system of inequalities: begin{cases} -1 < 1-x < 1 -1 < x^{2}-1 < 1 1-x < x^{2}-1 end{cases}. Solving it yields: x∈(1, sqrt {2}). Therefore, the answer is: (boxed{1, sqrt{2}}). To solve this problem, we first find the original function f(x) using the derivative. Then, we determine the monotonicity and odd/even properties of the function f(x). By utilizing the odd/even properties, we can transform the inequality f(1-x)+f(1-x^{2}) < 0 into an equivalent form f(1-x) < f(x^{2}-1). Finally, using the monotonicity, we can solve for the desired range of x. Be cautious about the domain of the independent variable itself.

For our parabola, comparing y=x^{2} to y=4px, we find that 4p=1, which leads us to calculate p as follows: [4p = 1 implies p = dfrac{1}{4}] However, since the parabola opens upwards and is centered at the origin, the focus will be located at a distance p above the vertex. The vertex of our parabola is at (0,0), so the focus, being p units above the vertex, will have coordinates: [left(0, pright) = left(0, dfrac{1}{4}right)] Therefore, the coordinates of the focus of the parabola y=x^{2} are left(0, dfrac{1}{4}right).

Additionally, the relative frequency that a randomly chosen monolith is marine clay loam is frac{11}{18}. How many monoliths with lakeglacial genesis does the object contain if none of the sand loams are marine?","completion":"To determine the exact number of monoliths, let ( N ) represent the total number of monoliths. We are given two pieces of information: 1. The relative frequency (statistical probability) that a randomly chosen monolith is loam (frac{1}{9}). 2. The relative frequency that a randomly chosen monolith is a marine loam ( frac{11}{18} ). First, let's denote: - ( N ) as the total number of monoliths, - ( N_{text{supes}} ) as the number of monoliths that are loam, - ( N_{text{marine loam}} ) as the number of monoliths that are marine loam. From the problem statement, we know: 1. ( frac{N_{text{supes}}}{N} = frac{1}{9} ). 2. ( frac{N_{text{marine loam}}}{N} = frac{11}{18} ). Since ( N_{text{supes}} = frac{1}{9}N ), we calculate ( N_{text{supes}} ): [ N_{text{supes}} = frac{1}{9}N. ] We can approximate ( N ) to the nearest multiple of 9 that is closest to 200 because the container is nearly fully filled: [ N = 198. ] Since ( N_{text{supes}} = frac{1}{9} times 198 ): [ N_{text{supes}} = frac{198}{9} = 22. ] We note that there are 22 loams. Now, we need to find the number of marine loams. The given problem reveals: [ N_{text{marine loam}} = frac{11}{18} times 198. ] Calculate ( N_{text{marine loam}} ): [ N_{text{marine loam}} = frac{11}{18} times 198 = frac{11 times 198}{18} = frac{11 times 11 times 18}{18} = 11 times 11 = 121. ] Among the total monoliths, the rest would represent the non-marine loam deposits. We also know that none of these loams are marine: [ N_{text{lake-glacier loam}} = N_{text{supes}} + text{non-marine loam}. ] The total number of sand monoliths/loams that are non-marine equals total loams minus marine loams: [ N_{text{non-marine loam}} = N_{text{soil loam}} - N_{text{marine loam}} = 176 - 121 = 55. ] Therefore, the number of total monoliths of lake-glacier origin is: [ text{Total lake-glacier genesis monoliths} = N_{text{supes}} + N_{text{non-marine loam}} = 22 + 55 = 77. ] # Conclusion: [boxed{77}]"},{"prompt":"Let's call a natural number good if its decimal representation contains only zeros and ones. Suppose the product of two good numbers turns out to be a good number. Is it true that in this case, the sum of the digits of the product equals the product of the sums of the digits of the multipliers?","completion":"1. Let us define what constitutes a \\"good\\" number. A natural number is considered \\"good\\" if its decimal representation consists only of the digits 0 and 1. 2. Suppose we have two good numbers ( A ) and ( B ). Consider their product ( A cdot B ). For the product to also be a good number, each term in the expansion of this product must be a power of 10. This is because each digit in the product must be 0 or 1, and terms from the expansion should not interfere with each other. 3. Let's take specific good numbers for ( A ) and ( B ): [ A = 10^2 + 10^4 + 10^8 + cdots + 10^{1024} ] [ B = 10^{N-2} + 10^{N-4} + 10^{N-8} + cdots + 10^{N-1024} ] where ( N ) is a large even number (e.g., one million). 4. Expanding the product ( A cdot B ), we get terms of the form: [ left(10^aright) cdot left(10^{N-b}right) = 10^{a + N - b} ] 5. For the product ( A cdot B ) to result in another good number, each term ( 10^{a + N - b} ) in the expansion should be distinct. If there were any repeated terms, they would sum and potentially result in non-good numbers (values other than digits 0 and 1). 6. To ensure that ( a + N - b ) is distinct for different pairs of terms ( (a, b) ): [ a + N - b = x + N - y implies a + y = b + x ] Since ( a, b, x, ) and ( y ) are powers of 2, this equation holds only if ( a = b ) and ( x = y ). 7. If the terms are distinct, the sum of the digits of the resulting product should also adhere properly to the good number property. However, if any terms repeat, the resulting number can have combined digits violating the 0 and 1 rule, making our product not wholly good in some cases. 8. Therefore, given the nature of our specific example with powers of 10, the resulting product can, indeed, fail to maintain the sum of digits requirement as equal to the product of the sums of individual digits of the factors. When multiple terms align correctly as ( 10^N ), the addition provides us with a number whose digits' sum might not match exactly a single digit.

For this ellipse, a=2 and b=1, so c=sqrt{2^2-1^2}=sqrt{3}. Thus, the foci are F_{1}(-sqrt{3}, 0) and F_{2}(sqrt{3}, 0). Given that the midpoint of segment PF_{1} lies on the y-axis, and knowing the geometry of the ellipse, it implies that PF_{1} is perpendicular to the major axis (the x-axis for this ellipse), and thus perpendicular to the line segment F_{1}F_{2}. To find |PF_{2}|, we use the property that the distance from any point on the ellipse to a focus is related to the ellipse's semi-minor axis b and semi-major axis a. Specifically, since the midpoint of PF_{1} is on the y-axis and PF_{1} perp F_{1}F_{2}, we can infer that |PF_{2}| is half the length of the major axis minus the distance from the center to F_{1}, which simplifies to dfrac{b^{2}}{a} = dfrac{1^2}{2} = dfrac{1}{2}. To find |PF_{1}|, we use the Pythagorean theorem, considering the right triangle formed by PF_{1}, PF_{2}, and F_{1}F_{2}. The length of F_{1}F_{2} is 2sqrt{3} (the distance between the two foci), so we have: [ |PF_{1}| = sqrt{|PF_{2}|^{2} + |F_{1}F_{2}|^{2}} = sqrt{left(dfrac{1}{2}right)^{2} + (2sqrt{3})^{2}} = sqrt{dfrac{1}{4} + 12} = sqrt{dfrac{49}{4}} = dfrac{7}{2}. ] Therefore, the ratio dfrac{|PF_{2}|}{|PF_{1}|} is calculated as follows: [ dfrac{|PF_{2}|}{|PF_{1}|} = dfrac{dfrac{1}{2}}{dfrac{7}{2}} = dfrac{1}{7}. ] So, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"prompt":"A bug starts at position 3 on a number line.

The key to this problem is to ensure that these sides and diagonals, when derived from the 13-gon, are all distinct. Step 1: Identifying the edges and diagonals lengths First, note that a regular 13-gon S has 13 vertices, and from any given vertex there are 12 segments (sides or diagonals) connected to it. Because of the rotational symmetry of the 13-gon, these 12 segments have 6 different lengths, as each segment and its rotational equivalent will have the same length. Let's denote these lengths as d_1, d_2, ldots, d_6, ordered such that d_1 is the shortest (a side) and d_6 is the longest. Step 2: Proving there are 6 unique lengths By symmetry, there are exactly 6 unique segment lengths from any vertex because connecting a vertex to each of the other vertices creates 13 segments, divided symmetrically by the center of the polygon. Step 3: Selecting four vertices to form a quadrilateral: When picking any four vertices of the 13-gon, we aim to ensure that the resulting four sides and diagonals (totaling 6 segments) are of distinct lengths d_i. Step 4: Ensuring sides are all different lengths: Choose the first segment of the quadrilateral to be d_1, the shortest length, which is an edge. Next, select d_2, the second shortest length, for the second side of the quadrilateral. \`\`\`markdown - d_1: first side (the smallest side). - d_2: second side (the second smallest). For the other two sides, note there should be 10/13 of the length of the circumcircle for other vertices left. Thus, any valid combination must avoid repeating lengths already used. \`\`\` Step 5: Ensuring all sides and diagonals are different: 1. If d_1 and d_2 are adjacent sides, denote the non-common vertex of d_1 as v, and choose it connected to a vertex, say w of the same polygon such that wv is d_3: - This will avoid repetition, as d_1, d_2, and now d_3 are different. 2. If d_1 and d_2 are opposite, ensuring the additional segments are different: - We can choose combinations d_4 and juxtapose it with d_3, ensuring uniqueness. If we continue this approach and examining lengths step-by-step for segment lengths differing, we derive only two configurations ensuring all sides and diagonals of the quadrilateral formed in the 13-gon are distinct. # Conclusion: The method ensures we strip down potential solutions by ensuring at each step selected sides are unique and avoid visible repeat lengths geometrically, ultimately ensuring only two possible distinct 4-vertex selections form valid consistently longer sides.

Substituting H in the equation, we get: 0.70T + (P/100)(3/7)T = 58 Now, we can factor out T: T(0.70 + (3P/700)) = 58 Let's solve for T: T = 58 / (0.70 + (3P/700)) We know that T is 70% of the total Toyota vehicles, so the total number of Toyota vehicles is T/0.70. Similarly, the total number of Honda vehicles is H/((P/100)). Since T : H = 7 : 3, we can also write: (T/0.70) / (H/(P/100)) = 7/3 Substituting H = (3/7)T, we get: (T/0.70) / ((3/7)T/(P/100)) = 7/3 Simplifying, we get: (100/P) / (3/7) = 7/3 Cross-multiplying, we get: 100/P = 7/3 * 7/3 100/P = 49/9 P = 100 / (49/9) P = 100 * 9/49 P = 900/49 P ≈ 18.37% So, approximately boxed{18.37%} of the Honda vehicles bought were SUVs."},{"prompt":"Given an angle with vertex (O) and a circle touching its sides at points (A) and (B).

Consider the ( n times n ) board. - Reflect the board over the diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right corner. This reflection maps each tiling to a unique different tiling. - Since each tiling has a unique mapping, the number of tilings must be even. - Therefore, if ( n ) is even, ( f(n, n) ) is even, contradicting the requirement that ( f(n, 2k) ) is odd for all ( k ). - Hence, ( n ) must be odd.
