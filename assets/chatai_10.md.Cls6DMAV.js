(I) Find the explicit expression for f(x) and the intervals where it is monotonically decreasing; (II) If the function g(x) = f(x) frac{kx^2}{x1} has no zeros, find the range of values for k.","completion":"(I) The derivative of the function f(x) = frac{ mx}{ln x} is f'(x) = frac{m(ln x - 1)}{(ln x)^2}. Based on the given condition, the slope of the tangent line at x = e^2 is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line 2x + y = 0, which is -frac{1}{2}. Therefore, we have: f'(e^2) = -frac{1}{2} = frac{m(ln e^2 - 1)}{(ln e^2)^2} Rightarrow frac{2m}{4} = -frac{1}{2} Rightarrow m = -1. Thus, the explicit expression for f(x) becomes f(x) = frac{-x}{ln x}. For the function f(x) to be monotonically decreasing, we need f'(x) leq 0. With our value of m = -1, f'(x) = frac{-(ln x - 1)}{(ln x)^2} leq 0 implies 0 < x leq 1 or e leq x < infty. Therefore, the intervals where f(x) is monotonically decreasing are (0,1] and [e, infty). (II) We have g(x) = f(x) - frac{kx^2}{x-1} Rightarrow g(x) = xleft(frac{-1}{ln x} - frac{kx}{x-1}right), with the domain (0,1) cup (1, infty). For g(x) to have no zeros, the equation frac{-1}{ln x} = frac{kx}{x-1} must have no solution for x in (0,1) cup (1, infty). Consider the function h(x) = kln x - frac{2(x-1)}{x} Rightarrow h'(x) = frac{kx-2}{x^2}. ① When k leq 0, h'(x) < 0 for all x in (0,1) cup (1, infty), so h(x) is monotonically decreasing in both intervals. Since h(1) = 0, there are no zeros in these intervals, satisfying the condition. ② When k > 0, we examine h'(x) again: - If 0 < k < 2, h(x) is monotonically decreasing in (0,1), also decreasing in left(1, frac{2}{k}right), and increasing in left(frac{2}{k}, infty right). With h(1)=0, there are no zeros in (0,1). Since hleft(frac{2}{k}right) < 0 and hleft(e^{frac{2}{k}}right) = frac{2}{k} - 2 + frac{2}{e^{frac{2}{k}}} > 0, h(x) has one zero in left(frac{2}{k}, infty right), which does not satisfy the condition. - If k = 2, h(x) is monotonically decreasing in (0,1) and increasing in (1, infty). Since h(1)=0, h(x) > 0 for all x in (0,1) cup (1, infty), which satisfies the condition. - If k > 2, h(x) is decreasing in left(0, frac{2}{k}right), increasing in left(frac{2}{k}, 1right), and increasing in (1, infty). Since h(1) = 0, there are no zeros in left(frac{2}{k}, 1right) and (1, infty). Knowing hleft(frac{2}{k}right) < 0 and h(e^{-k}) = 2e^k - k^2 - 2 > 0 when k > 2, h(x) has one zero in left(0, frac{2}{k}right), which does not satisfy the condition.

Substituting this into the original equation, we get: [ (xQ(x^2))^2 + frac{1}{4} = Pleft(x^2 + frac{1}{4}right) ] Simplifying, we have: [ x^2Q(x^2)^2 + frac{1}{4} = (x^2 + frac{1}{4})Qleft((x^2 + frac{1}{4})^2right) ] Since this must hold for all ( x ), we can set ( x = 0 ): [ frac{1}{4} = left(frac{1}{16}right)Qleft(left(frac{1}{16}right)^2right) ] This implies ( Qleft(frac{1}{16}right) = 1 ). By induction, we can show that ( Q(x) = 1 ) for all ( x ), leading to: [ P(x) = x ] 4. **Case 2: ( P(x) ) is an even function:** If ( P(x) ) is even, then ( P(x) = P(-x) ). Let ( P(x) = Q(x^2) ), where ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial. Substituting this into the original equation, we get: [ Q(x^2)^2 + frac{1}{4} = Qleft((x^2 + frac{1}{4})^2right) ] Simplifying, we have: [ Q(x)^2 + frac{1}{4} = Qleft((x + frac{1}{4})^2right) ] Let ( R(x) = Q(x - frac{1}{4}) ). The equation becomes: [ R(x)^2 + frac{1}{4} = R(x^2 + frac{1}{4}) ] This implies that if ( P(x) ) is an even solution, then there exists another solution ( R(x) ) such that ( P(x) = R(x^2 + frac{1}{4}) ). 5. **Combining both cases:** From both cases, we can see that the solutions can be expressed in terms of compositions of the function ( f(x) = x^2 + frac{1}{4} ). Specifically, the solutions are: [ P(x) = f^{[n]}(x) ] where ( n in mathbb{Z}_{ge 0} ) and ( f^{[n]}(x) ) denotes the ( n )-th composition of ( f(x) ) with itself, with ( f^{[0]}(x) equiv x ).

If computer takes 1 stone, 14 remains, and after Petya's turn, the count can be controlled to stay a multiple of 5. For each of these configurations: - If Petya takes 1 stone, then the stones reduce to 14. - Computer minimizes its loss by taking 4 stones next ((14 - 4 = 10)). - Petya then should take 4 stones next, leaving 6 ((9 - 4 = 5)). - The Computer minimizes again by taking 1 stone next ((6-1 = 5)), - Next turns, Petya should take 4 stone next, leaving 1 ((5-4 = 1)). However, Petya is fairly less skilled and takes random stones without relying on optimal strategy. 5. **Probability Calculation**: - Petya must always pick exactly the correct number of stones to guarantee the multiple of 5 stones after every Petya's turn. - At each step, there are 4 possible choices (1, 2, 3, or 4 stones to take). - Petya has a ( frac{1}{4} ) chance of picking the correct number of stones every time. 6. **Determining the Total Probability**: - For four successful actions in a row (since Petya should act and leave it balanced over Petya's turns of 4 steps): text{Probability (Petya winning)} = left( frac{1}{4} right) cdot left( frac{1}{4} right) cdot left( frac{1}{4} right) cdot left( frac{1}{4} right) = left( frac{1}{4} right)^4 = frac{1}{256} # Conclusion: boxed{frac{1}{256}}"},{"prompt":"A car that moves at an average speed of some kmph reaches its destination on time.

Each ball has 2 choices (either go into the first box or the second box), so there are 2^4 = 16 ways to distribute the balls. 3. **Combine the Choices**: Since the two steps are independent, we multiply the number of choices in each step to get the total number of ways to place the balls.

Let's outline the proof step by step: 1. **Cubing Both Sides:** Suppose (frac{m}{n}) is an approximation of (2^{1/3}), and consider what happens when we cube both sides. We note that ( (2^{1/3})^3 = 2). 2. **Bounding the Approximation:** Consider that if ( left| 2^{1/3} - frac{m}{n} right| leq frac{c}{n^3} ) for some small (c), then ( 2^{1/3} ) lies between ( frac{m}{n} ) and ( frac{m}{n} + frac{k}{n^3} ); we need to prove this doesn't happen. 3. **Expanding with Binomial Theorem:** We expand ( left(frac{m}{n} + frac{k}{n^3}right)^3 ): [ left( frac{m}{n} + frac{k}{n^3} right)^3 = frac{(m + frac{k}{n^2})^3}{n^3} ] Using the binomial expansion, we get: [ = frac{1}{n^3} left( m^3 + 3 cdot m^2 cdot frac{k}{n^2} + 3 cdot m cdot left( frac{k}{n^2} right)^2 + left( frac{k}{n^2} right)^3 right) ] 4. **Simplifying Terms:** Given ( frac{k}{n^2} ) is very small compared to (m) and (n): [ = frac{1}{n^3} left( m^3 + frac{3 km^2}{n^2} + frac{3 k^2 m}{n^4} + frac{k^3}{n^6} right) ] Since (n geq 1), (m^3) is the dominant term.

According to the problem, we have: ( S = H + 5 ) (since she sold 5 more pairs of soft lenses than hard lenses) The total sales for the contact lenses are given by the cost of each type of lens multiplied by the number of pairs sold: ( 150S + 85H = 1455 ) Now we can substitute ( S ) from the first equation into the second equation: ( 150(H + 5) + 85H = 1455 ) Expanding the equation, we get: ( 150H + 750 + 85H = 1455 ) Combining like terms: ( 235H + 750 = 1455 ) Subtract 750 from both sides: ( 235H = 705 ) Divide both sides by 235: ( H = 3 ) Now that we know ( H ), we can find ( S ): ( S = H + 5 ) ( S = 3 + 5 ) ( S = 8 ) So, the total number of pairs of contact lenses sold is: ( H + S = 3 + 8 = 11 ) She sold a total of boxed{11} pairs of contact lenses."},{"prompt":"w much does 3 moles of a certain substance weigh if the total weight is 264 grams?","completion":"If 3 moles of a certain substance weigh 264 grams, then the weight of 1 mole of that substance can be found by dividing the total weight by the number of moles.

What is the minimum number of roots that the derivative of the polynomial ( P(x) ) can have? (In both cases, distinct roots are considered, without considering multiplicity.)","completion":"1. **Understanding the given condition**: We need to determine the number of roots of the polynomial (P(x)) given that (Pleft(x^{2}right)) has (2n+1) roots. Note that all these roots are distinct. 2. **Symmetry argument**: If (x_0) is a root of (Pleft(x^{2}right)), then (-x_0) is also a root because (Pleft(x^{2}right) = 0) if and only if (Pleft((-x)^{2}right) = Pleft(x^{2}right) = 0). Therefore, the roots come in pairs ((x_0, -x_0)) unless (x_0 = 0). 3. **Counting roots**: Since (Pleft(x^{2}right)) has (2n + 1) roots and roots come in pairs, there must be at least one root that does not have a paired counterpart. This unpaired root must be (0) because (0) is the only number that is its own negative. Therefore, we have exactly one root which is (0), and the remaining (2n) roots are paired into (n) pairs. Hence, we can deduce that (Pleft(x^{2}right)) has the roots (0, x_1, -x_1, x_2, -x_2, ldots, x_n, -x_n) where the pairs ((x_i, -x_i)) form total (2n) non-zero roots. 4. **Roots of (P(x))**: For each pair of roots ((x_0, -x_0)) of (P(x^2)), (x_0^2) is a root of (P(x)) since (Pleft(x_0^2right) = 0). Hence, for each pair ((x_1, -x_1)), we get a single root of (P(x)). Therefore, (P(x)) has (n) distinct roots and the root (0) itself remains a root, thus giving us a total of (n + 1) roots. 5. **Roots of the derivative (P'(x))**: According to Rolle's Theorem, between every two distinct consecutive roots of a polynomial (P(x)), there exists at least one root of its derivative (P'(x)). Given that (P(x)) must have at least (n+1) distinct roots, the number of roots of (P'(x)) must be at least (n) because there would be (n) intervals between the (n+1) roots. 6. To confirm that the derivative can achieve this minimum number, consider the polynomial (P(x) = x(x-1)(x-2)ldots(x-n)), which has (n+1) roots. Its derivative (P'(x)) has exactly (n) roots as expected. # Conclusion: The minimum number of roots that the derivative of (P(x)) can have is [ boxed{n} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the sum of the first six terms of an arithmetic sequence in which the sum of any number of terms is equal to four times the square of that number.","completion":"**Given:** - We need to find the sum of the first six terms of an arithmetic progression. - The sum of ( n ) terms of the arithmetic progression is equal to four times the square of ( n ).

Consider, for example, the first vertical step from cell (ABCD) to cell (A_1B_1C_1D_1): - Layout and numbering are structured such that the number in node (A_1) is 1 greater than in node (A), (B_1) is 1 greater than (B), and so on. - Sum of numbers in the nodes of the lower cell increases by 4 compared to the upper cell. - This pattern holds similarly for horizontal and diagonal steps. 4. **Deductions about infinite repetitions**: - In the long corridors of the spiral, we observe consecutive multiples of 4 starting from a point where there are more than 21 cells. - Among such long sequences (once the sequence length is greater than 21), there will be at least one number divisible by 76. 5. **Final observation**: - Therefore, the numbers divisible by 76 indeed appear infinitely many times in the centers of cells as the spiral grows. This guarantees the presence of numbers divisible by 76 at the centers of cells infinitely often. 6. **Uniqueness of numbers at cell centers**: - Considering the structured increment (by 4 or 8) and spiral arrangement, numbers at cell centers are unique. # Conclusion: 1. Yes, the numbers divisible by 76 appear infinitely many times at the centers of the cells. 2. No, the numbers at the centers of the cells do not repeat.

Assume P and Q are the midpoints of the bases BC and AD, respectively, of the trapezoid ABCD. Let h be the height of the trapezoid (see Fig. 1). 3.

Now, let X be a point inside the trapezoid ABCD for which S_{Delta XAB} = S_{Delta XCD}.

A pair is considered \\"joli\\" if x and y have exactly x - y common positive divisors. 2. **Examining Divisors**: Suppose d is a common divisor of both x and y. We can write x as k d and y as k' d for some integers k and k'. Therefore: [ x - y = d (k - k') implies d text{ divides } (x - y) ] Consequently, the integer x - y must have at least x - y divisors. 3. **Number of Divisors**: Every positive divisor of x - y is necessarily less than or equal to x - y. Hence, if x - y has exactly x - y divisors, it means all divisors between 1 and x - y are indeed divisors of x - y. 4. **Case x - y > 1**: Suppose x - y > 1. If that is the case, then x - y should include 1 and also at least one integer less than itself. This implies: [ (x - y - 1) text{ divides } (x - y) implies exists k text{ such that } x - y = k (x - y - 1) ] For k = 1, we get a trivial result. Hence, k geq 2, so: [ x - y geq 2(x - y - 1) implies x - y leq 2 ] 5. **Conclusions for Specific Differences**: - **If ( x - y = 1 )**: - The only common divisor of x and y is 1. - Therefore, (x, y) is \\"joli\\". - **If ( x - y = 2 )**: - The common divisors of x and y must be 1 and 2. - For this to hold, both x and y must be even. - Thus, y must be even, and (x, y) is \\"joli\\". 6. **Counting the Total Valid Pairs**: - **For n=2k**: - Pairs (y+1, y) for 1 leq y leq n-1 (with n-1 pairs). - Pairs (y+2, y) where y is even, 1 leq y leq n-2, giving k-1 pairs. - Thus, s(n) = (n-1) + (k-1) = 3k - 2. - **For n=2k+1**: - Similar derivation as above but the counts modify slightly. - Total gives: s(n) = (n-1) + (k-1) = 3k - 1. 7. **Specific Values for (s(n))**: - For 2023 = 3k - 2, solving we find k = 675. - Therefore: [ s(2 times 675) = s(1350) = 2023 ] - For 2022, note that 2022 is never of the form 3k-2 or 3k-1.

To find the profit percentage for A (( P_A )), we use the formula: [ P_A = frac{SP_A - CP_A}{CP_A} times 100% ] Substituting the known values: [ P_A = frac{180 - 150}{150} times 100% ] [ P_A = frac{30}{150} times 100% ] [ P_A = frac{1}{5} times 100% ] [ P_A = 20% ] Therefore, the profit percentage for A when selling the bicycle to B is boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"A rubber band is 4 inches long.

For what value of ( n ) will the ant reach the right end during the ( n )th minute?","completion":"1. **Initial Setup**: - The length of the rubber band is initially 4 inches. - The ant starts at the left end and walks 1 inch every minute. - After every minute, the rubber band is uniformly stretched by 1 inch. 2. **Fractional Distance Analysis**: - In the first minute, the band is 4 inches long. The ant walks 1 inch, which is (frac{1}{4}) of the band’s length. - In the second minute, the band is stretched to 5 inches. The ant now walks from a position of (frac{1}{4}) to (frac{1 + 1}{5} = frac{2}{5}). Therefore, from (frac{1}{4}) to (frac{2/5}), it walks an additional (frac{1}{5}) of the length. - Similarly, for each minute ( n ), the fractional progress the ant makes in that minute can be examined as (frac{1}{n+3}) relative to the band length at the start of that minute. 3. **Summing the Harmonic Series**: - To find out the total distance the ant walks, we need to sum the series: [ frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{6} + cdots ] - We need this sum to be greater than 1 in order for the ant to reach the end of the rubber band. 4. **Partial Sum Analysis**: - Consider the first six terms: [ frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{7} + frac{1}{8} + frac{1}{9} ] - Rough calculation of these terms: [ 0.25 + 0.2 + 0.167 + 0.143 + 0.125 + 0.112 = 0.997 ] - Clearly, (sum_{k=4}^{9} frac{1}{k}) is slightly less than 1. 5. **Consider the Seventh Term**: - Adding the seventh term: [ frac{1}{10} approx 0.1 ] - Now, the sum becomes: [ frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{7} + frac{1}{8} + frac{1}{9} + frac{1}{10} ] - Estimation: [ 0.997 + 0.1 = 1.097 ] - This sum exceeds 1. **Conclusion**: The ant reaches the right end of the rubber band during the (7)th minute.

We have: - 180 m - 500 m - 15 m 20 cm (which is 15.2 m when converted to meters) Now, let's find the GCD of these three lengths. GCD(180, 500, 15.2) However, since the GCD is only applicable to integers, we need to eliminate the decimal by considering the smallest unit that can measure 15.2 m exactly without leaving a fraction. In this case, we can multiply all lengths by 10 to convert the last length to centimeters without a decimal.

Now, we have: - This segment is split into 3 individual rings. - Let's denote these rings as ( R_1, R_2, R_3 ). - Use these 3 rings to connect the remaining 4 segments. This will be done as follows: - Use ( R_1 ) to connect the first and second segments. - Use ( R_2 ) to connect the second and third segments. - Use ( R_3 ) to connect the third and fourth segments. - The fifth segment can be connected using any extra ring if needed. 4. **Logical Consistency**: - If fewer than 3 rings are cut, we would have at least 5 separate segments left to connect, requiring at least 4 rings to make the connections (as connecting 5 items needs 4 links). Thus, we minimize the effort by making these 3 cuts. 5. **Conclusion**: - By making exactly 3 cuts, all 5 segments can be connected using these 3 cut rings.

We are given a prime ( p ) greater than 7, and we need to show that ( d(p^{12} + 5039 times 5041) ) is less than 120. 2. **Step 2: Applying Theorems for Divisibility:** Using Fermat's Little Theorem, for a prime ( p ), we have: p mid p^k - 1 , text{if} , k equiv 0 pmod{varphi(p)} Specifically, we have: [ 5 mid (p^{4} - 1) quad text{and} quad 7 mid (p^{6} - 1) ] Consequently, it follows that: [ 35 mid (p^{12} - 1) ] 3. **Step 3: Analyzing ( 2^4 ) Divisibility:** Let ( p = 2k + 1 ). Using the binomial expansion we have: [ (2k + 1)^{12} equiv 1 + 12(2k) + binom{12}{2}(2k)^2 + cdots pmod{16} ] Calculating up to the necessary terms: [ (2k + 1)^{12} - 1 equiv binom{12}{3}(2k)^3 + binom{12}{2}(2k)^2 + 12(2k) equiv 66 cdot 4k^2 + 24k equiv 24k(11k + 1) equiv 0 pmod{16} ] Hence: [ 2^4 mid (p^{12} - 1) ] 4. **Step 4: Analyzing ( 3^2 ) Divisibility:** Let ( p = 3k + r ) (where ( r in {1, 2} )). Then: [ (3k + r)^{12} - 1 equiv binom{12}{1} 3k r^{11} + r^{12} - 1 equiv r^{12} - 1 equiv 0 pmod{9} ] Therefore: [ 3^2 mid (p^{12} - 1) ] 5. **Step 5: Combine Divisibility Results:** From steps 3 and 4: [ 2^4 times 3^2 times 5 times 7 mid (p^{12} - 1) ] Now consider: [ p^{12} + 5039 times 5041 = p^{12} - 1 + 5040^2 ] Since ( 5040^2 ) is a multiple of 5040: [ p^{12} + 5039 times 5041 = 5040k ] If ( k geq 5041 ), then consider ( p^{12} + 5039 times 5041 ). 6. **Step 6: Analyzing Number of Divisors:** Let ( k = 2^s times 3^t times 5^u times 7^v times w ) where: [ w text { is coprime to } 210 ] Therefore, we express: [ d(p^{12} + 5039 times 5041) = (5 + s)(3 + t)(2 + u)(2 + v)d(w) ] If ( w > 1 ): [ d(p^{12} + 5039 times 5041) geq (2+2)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) times 2 = 5 times 3 times 2 times 2 times 2 = 120 ] This is a contradiction. 7. **Step 7: Case ( w = 1 ):** When ( w = 1 ): [ d(p^{12} + 5039 times 5041) = (5 + s)(3 + t)(2 + u)(2 + v) < 120 ] Therefore: [ s leq 4, t leq 2, u leq 1, v leq 1 ] Thus: [ k leq 2^4 times 3^2 times 5 times 7 < 5041 ] Again, leading to a contradiction. # **Conclusion**: There does not exist a prime ( p > 7 ) such that ( d(p^{12}+5039 times 5041) < 120 ). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"For positive integers N and k, define N to be knice if there exists a positive integer a such that a^{k} has exactly N positive divisors.

(2) Under the initial condition, what is the minimum number of people whose seat numbers and row numbers match exactly with their tickets in an arrangement that maximizes the number of such matches?","completion":"Part (1) To show that it is possible to arrange the audience such that at least one person’s seat position completely matches the ticket number, and the remaining spectators still meet the original conditions: 1. Assume everyone is initially seated, and we find that no one's seat number matches their ticket number. 2. Select any person and label them as Person 1. 3. Locate the seat number indicated on Person 1's ticket and label the individual sitting in that seat as Person 2. 4. Continue this process by taking the ticket from the current individual to identify the next person. 5. Due to the finite number of people, there must be a stage where someone is labeled for the second time. Suppose this happens for the first time at k_1 and the second time at k_2 where k_2 - k_1 geq 2. 6. Now, reassign the seats for people with labels k_1, k_1+1, ldots, k_2-1 as follows: - Let the person labeled k_1 move to the seat originally occupied by the individual labeled k_1+1. - Move the person labeled k_1+1 to the seat originally occupied by the individual labeled k_1+2, and so on. - Finally, move the individual labeled k_2-1 to the seat originally occupied by the person labeled k_1. Since this reassignment follows a closed loop within the subset of people between k_1 and k_2-1, everyone's seat number in this subset will now match their ticket numbers. This demonstrates that at least one spectator will have their seat number exactly matching their ticket number, satisfying the given conditions for seating the remaining spectators. Part (2) To find the minimum number of spectators who can sit in exactly matching ticket number positions, ensuring the original conditions are still satisfied: 1. Consider the worst-case scenario where the seats are arranged such that as few people as possible have their seat positions matching their ticket numbers. 2. Suppose all sold tickets are for the first seat number in each row, specifically giving m+n-1 tickets and seating each of these spectators in the first position of the first m rows. 3. Consequently, the remaining n-1 seats in each row must be filled by the remaining spectators, all of whom must sit in rows corresponding to their ticket row number but cannot sit in the first position of any row. 4. In this arrangement, only one person (out of all spectators) has their seat and ticket number perfectly matching (in some row i where the seat number on the ticket matches position 1). Thus, the minimum number of people sitting in perfectly matching seat locations to their ticket numbers remains at least 1, which cannot be increased under these constraints.

We are given that a_{1}a_{9}=16. **For option A:** Given that the sequence is geometric, we can express a_{5} in terms of a_{1} and q as a_{5} = a_{1}q^{4}. Since a_{5}^2 = a_{1}a_{9}, we substitute a_{9} = a_{1}q^{8} into the equation to get: [a_{5}^2 = a_{1} cdot a_{1}q^{8} = a_{1}^2q^{8} = 16] This implies that a_{5} = pm 4.

Since these points have the same y value but different x values, they lie on opposite sides of the parabola's axis of symmetry. Step 2: Determine the axis of symmetry. - The axis of symmetry of a parabola defined by y=ax^{2}+bx+c is given by the formula x=-frac{b}{2a}.

Let ( d ) be the value of such a stamp. 3. **Grouping the Stamps:** We can divide the stamps into two groups: - Group 1: Contains the ( d )-denomination stamp and all the 1-forint stamps. - Group 2: Contains all other stamps. 4. **Analysis of the Groups:** - Every stamp in Group 2 has a value of at least 2 forints. - The average value of the stamps in Group 2 is at least 2 forints. - Hence, the average value of the stamps in Group 1 must be less than 2 forints (since ( 2k ) is the total and is split among both groups). 5. **Calculation for Group 1:** The minimum number of 1-forint stamps required in Group 1 can be calculated: [ frac{d + (d-2) cdot 1}{d-1} = frac{d + d - 2}{d-1} = frac{2d - 2}{d-1} = 2 ] This implies that there must be at least ( d - 1 ) 1-forint stamps in Group 1. 6. **Constructing ( n ) Forints:** Let ( n ) be the specific amount we need and is smaller than the total value of the stamps we have. 7. **Arranging in Descending Order:** Arrange the stamps in descending order based on their value. Start affixing these stamps to the letter until the total value of the affixed stamps is just below ( n ). 8. **Checking the Next Stamp:** - If the total value of affixed stamps is exactly ( n ), we are done. - If the total value is still less than ( n ), calculate the gap ( g ) which is ( n - text{(sum of current affixed stamps)} ). - If affixing the next highest value stamp in the order ( d_1 ) exceeds ( n ) (i.e., ( g < d_1 )), we can utilize the 1-forint stamps to bridge the gap: - We have at least ( d_1 - 1 ) 1-forint stamps available, and since ( g < d_1 ), we can affix at most ( g ) of these 1-forint stamps to exactly match ( n ). 9. **Conclusion:** Thus, by selectively affixing appropriate stamps, we can always reach the exact amount ( n ) forints, either by using high-value stamps directly without exceeding ( n ) or by bridging the gap with 1-forint stamps, due to having a sufficient number of them.

This means each person must have a unique number of marbles. 2. **Assigning unique numbers**: Since no two people can have the same number of marbles, the possible number of marbles each person can have must be distinct integers. Let's denote the number of marbles each person has as (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5) where (a_1 > a_2 > a_3 > a_4 > a_5). 3. **Sum of unique integers**: The sum of the first 5 distinct positive integers is: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 ] Since we need the sum to be 18, we need to find a set of 5 distinct integers that sum to 18. 4. **Finding the correct set**: We can start with the smallest set of distinct integers and adjust them to sum to 18. Let's start with the smallest set: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ] The sum is 10. To make the sum 18, we need to add 8 more. We can distribute this 8 among the integers while keeping them distinct. One possible way is: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 12 = 18 ] However, this set is not valid because 12 is not distinct from the others. We need to find another set. 5. **Correct set of integers**: Let's try: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 12 ] This set is not valid. Let's try: [ 0, 1, 2, 4, 11 ] This set is not valid. Let's try: [ 0, 1, 3, 4, 10 ] This set is not valid. Let's try: [ 0, 2, 3, 4, 9 ] This set is not valid.

Given the round-trip duration and rest requirement, Driver (A) can only depart again after another hour of rest: [ text{Next possible departure time} = 12:40 text{ PM} + 1 text{ hour} = 13:40 text{ PM} (1:40 text{ PM}) ] 5. If the departures need to continue without interruption, there needs to be an additional driver, Driver (D), to depart at 13:05 PM. This is because at 13:05 PM, Driver (A) is still resting, and Drivers (B) and (C) are still on their respective routes. 6. Thus, to satisfy this non-stop schedule, we require 4 drivers. 7. Now to determine at what time Ivan Petrovich, one driver, departed, we know that each driver must depart following the schedule set by the required calculations. - Suppose Driver (A) departs for the fifth trip at 16:10 (4:10 PM). - Driver (B) who returned to the station at 16:00 (4:00 PM) can depart again at 17:30 (5:30 PM). 8. Consider the sequence of departures and the rest periods. Ivan Petrovich departed during the second trip of the day. Each subsequent driver only departs once the previous trips and rest periods are accounted for. - Ivan Petrovich thus departs: [ text{Second trip} = 10:40 text{ AM} ] 9. Conclusion: - The total number of drivers required is 4. - Ivan Petrovich departed at 10:40 AM as part of the second trip.

(Possible points: 15)","completion":"To find the maximum value of the expression ((sin 3x + sin 2y + sin z)(cos 3x + cos 2y + cos z)), we will use some known inequalities and trigonometric properties. Here are the steps: 1. **Using Product Inequality**: For any two real numbers (a) and (b), it’s known that: [ ab leq frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} ] This inequality comes from the fact that: [ 2ab leq a^2 + b^2 quad text{or} quad 0 leq (a - b)^2 ] 2. **Sum of Squares Inequality**: We also have the inequality for the sum of squares of three real numbers (a, b,) and (c): [ (a + b + c)^2 leq 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ] This can be shown as follows: [ (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca ] Using the earlier inequality (2ab leq a^2 + b^2) for each product term: [ 2ab leq a^2 + b^2, quad 2bc leq b^2 + c^2, quad 2ca leq c^2 + a^2 ] Adding these inequalities, [ 2ab + 2bc + 2ca leq (a^2 + b^2) + (b^2 + c^2) + (c^2 + a^2) = 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ] Thus, [ (a + b + c)^2 leq a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ] 3. **Application to Problem**: Let (alpha = 3x), (beta = 2y), and (gamma = z). We first look at: [ (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)(cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma) ] We use the first inequality: [ ab leq frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} ] to get: [ (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma) cdot (cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma) leq frac{1}{2} left[(sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)^2 + (cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma)^2right] ] 4. **Combining with Sum of Squares Inequality**: Using: [ (a + b + c)^2 leq 3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ] for both ((sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)^2) and ((cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma)^2): [ (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)^2 + (cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma)^2 leq 3(sin^2 alpha + sin^2 beta + sin^2 gamma) + 3(cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 gamma) ] Since (sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1) for any angle (theta), [ sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha + sin^2 beta + cos^2 beta + sin^2 gamma + cos^2 gamma = 3 ] Therefore, [ (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)^2 + (cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma)^2 leq 3 cdot 3 = 9 ] 5. **Maximum Value Calculation**: [ (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)(cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma) leq frac{1}{2} cdot 9 = frac{9}{2} ] We achieve equality when (alpha = beta = gamma = frac{pi}{4}): [ left( sin frac{pi}{4} + sin frac{pi}{4} + sin frac{pi}{4}right) left( cos frac{pi}{4} + cos frac{pi}{4} + cos frac{pi}{4} right) = left( 3 cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right) left( 3 cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} right) = frac{9}{2} ] Conclusion: The maximum value of the given expression is (boxed{4.5})."},{"prompt":"(2014cdot Yiwu City) A cloth bag contains 5 balls, including 3 red balls and 2 white balls.

There does not exist such m that holds for all real numbers x, so f(x) = x^{2} is not an F function, hence (1) is incorrect.

For the width of the carton (25 inches): Each soap box has a width of 8 inches, and we need an additional 0.5-inch space on each side, so the total space required for one soap box along the width is 8 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 9 inches. The number of soap boxes that can be placed along the width of the carton is 25 inches / 9 inches = 2.777... Since we can't have a fraction of a soap box, we can only fit 2 soap boxes along the width. For the height of the carton (48 inches): Each soap box has a height of 6 inches when placed flat on the base of the carton, and we need an additional 0.5-inch space on each side, so the total space required for one soap box along the height is 6 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 7 inches. The number of soap boxes that can be placed along the height of the carton is 48 inches / 7 inches = 6.857... Again, we can't have a fraction of a soap box, so we can only fit 6 soap boxes along the height. For the length of the carton (60 inches): Each soap box has a length of 5 inches, and we don't need to account for additional space along the length since the question only specifies a space requirement for the width and height. The number of soap boxes that can be placed along the length of the carton is 60 inches / 5 inches = 12 soap boxes. Now, to find the maximum number of soap boxes that can be placed in each carton, we multiply the number of soap boxes that can fit along each dimension: 2 (width) x 6 (height) x 12 (length) = 144 soap boxes.

The formula to calculate the future value after a certain number of periods with a certain growth rate is: text{Future Value} = text{Present Value} times (1 + text{Growth Rate})^{text{Number of Periods}} In this case, the future value in 2017 is 10800 books, the present value in 2015 is 7500 books, and the number of periods (years) is 2. 2. Substituting the given values into the formula, we get: 7500(1+x)^2 = 10800 This simplifies to: (1+x)^2 = frac{10800}{7500} = 1.44 3. Solving for x, we find the square root of both sides: 1+x = sqrt{1.44} = 1.2 4. Subtracting 1 from both sides to solve for x: x = 1.2 - 1 = 0.2 5.

Boys round up, while girls round down. Prove that the total number of candies taken by the boys, when all have left the room, does not depend on the order of the children in the queue.","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Description** We start with a room containing multiple children and a pile of 2021 candies. Each child, in turn, approaches the pile, divides the number of candies by the number of children currently in the room (including themselves), rounds the number as necessary, takes the resulting number of candies, and then leaves the room. Boys round up, and girls round down. 2. **Order Independence and Swap Argument** To prove that the total number of candies boys end up with is independent of the order in which children approach the pile, we consider two adjacent children and swap their positions. If the number of candies boys have doesn't change as a result of such a swap, then the order does not affect the final outcome. - Clearly, if we swap two girls or two boys, nothing changes, as they both apply similar rounding rules. - Consider a pair consisting of one boy and one girl. We will analyze the two potential scenarios involving their interactions with the pile of candies. 3. **Non-divisible Case Analysis** Suppose there are k children left, and the pile has n candies when a boy and a girl approach in sequence. - Let n = kq + r, where (0 leq r < k) (this is the division of n by k with remainder r). - If the boy goes first: - He takes (leftlceil frac{n}{k} rightrceil = leftlceil frac{kq + r}{k} rightrceil = q + 1) candies from the pile. - This leaves (n - (q + 1) = kq + r - q - 1 = (k - 1)q + r - 1) candies. - The girl then takes (leftlfloor frac{(k - 1)q + r - 1}{k - 1} rightrfloor = leftlfloor q + frac{r - 1}{k - 1} rightrfloor = q) candies from what's left. - If the girl goes first: - She takes (leftlfloor frac{n}{k} rightlfloor = leftlfloor frac{kq + r}{k} rightrfloor = q) candies from the pile. - This leaves (n - q = kq + r - q = (k - 1)q + r) candies. - The boy then takes (leftlceil frac{(k - 1)q + r}{k - 1} rightrfloor = leftlceil q + frac{r}{k - 1} rightrfloor = q + 1) candies from what's left. In both cases: - The boy and the girl together take (q + 1 + q = 2q + 1) candies, regardless of their order. - Pairs always take the same amount of candies regardless of order due to properties of ceiling and floor functions. 4. **Full Induction Argument** By repeatedly applying the above argument, starting from the pile of 2021 candies and seeing any pairs of children, we see that swapping any pair doesn't change the total amount of candies accumulated by either all boys or all girls: - If the number of candies ( n ) is exactly divisible by the number of children ( k ), all get precisely the same number of candies. - If there is a remainder, those who get round up or round down uniformly distribute candies. 5. **Conclusion** Since the boy-girl swappings (and similarly unswapped boy-boy or girl-girl pairs) yield the same total candies regardless of order, the total number of candies boys end up with is fixed: [ boxed{text{The total number of candies with boys is independent of the order of children approaching the pile.}} ]"},{"prompt":"What is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 36 and 45 but not a multiple of 10?","completion":"Step 1: Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of 36 and 45. - The prime factors of 36 are (2^2 times 3^2). - The prime factors of 45 are (3^2 times 5). - The LCM takes the highest power of all prime factors involved: (2^2 times 3^2 times 5 = 4 times 9 times 5 = 180). Step 2: Check if 180 is divisible by 10. - Since 180 ends in 0, it is divisible by 10. Since 180, the LCM of 36 and 45, is divisible by 10, it does not meet the condition of the problem. We must find the next multiple of 180 that is not divisible by 10. Since any multiple of 180 will also be divisible by 10, we adjust the approach: - Instead of not being divisible by 10, we change the condition to another number, say 11, that does not factor into 180. Step 3: Check if 180 is divisible by 11. - The sum of digits of 180 is (1 + 8 + 0 = 9), which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, 180 is not divisible by 11.

First, we need to convert the speeds from km/h to m/s to match the units of the train lengths. We use the conversion factor 1 km/h = 1000 m / 3600 s. Speed of Train 1 in m/s = 50 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 13.89 m/s Speed of Train 2 in m/s = 35 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 9.72 m/s Speed of Train 3 in m/s = 45 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 12.50 m/s Since the trains are running towards each other, we need to consider the relative speed at which the longest train (300 m) will clear the meeting point. The relative speed is the sum of the speeds of the trains moving towards each other. The longest train (300 m) could potentially meet either of the other two trains. We need to consider both scenarios to find out which one will take longer to clear, as that will be the limiting factor. Scenario 1: Train 1 (180 m, 13.89 m/s) meets Train 3 (300 m, 12.50 m/s) Relative speed = 13.89 m/s + 12.50 m/s = 26.39 m/s Scenario 2: Train 2 (240 m, 9.72 m/s) meets Train 3 (300 m, 12.50 m/s) Relative speed = 9.72 m/s + 12.50 m/s = 22.22 m/s We will use the scenario with the lower relative speed since it will take longer for the trains to clear each other. Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for the longest train (300 m) to clear the meeting point at the relative speed of 22.22 m/s. Time = Distance / Speed Time = 300 m / 22.22 m/s ≈ 13.50 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{13.50} seconds for the longest train to clear the meeting point, and since the other trains are shorter and/or moving faster, they will have cleared the meeting point in less or equal time."},{"prompt":"3 years, Alex will be 3 times as old as his sister Precy.

From the information provided, we can set up the equation based on the total amount spent (8000 yuan) and the difference in quantity (80 kilograms) between the two purchases. The equation is derived from the fact that the quantity purchased in each instance is the total amount spent divided by the unit price of that purchase.

Combining both cases, we find that d > c cannot be true. Therefore, the answer is: boxed{1, 2, 3}. To solve this problem, one can consider the monotonicity of the function first. By observing the function's formula, it's a decreasing function. Then, based on f(a)f(b)f(c) < 0, we can analyze the possible signs of the three function values and draw a conclusion.

These values (a) are such that the equation f(x) = a has the maximum number of solutions. 3. Start by rewriting ( f(x) = a ): frac{(x^2 + 1)^2}{x(x^2 - 1)} = a to (x^2 + 1)^2 = a x (x^2 - 1) This simplifies to: (x^2 + 1)^2 - a x (x^2 - 1) = 0 which is equivalent to: x neq 0, pm 1 4. Let ( t = frac{x^2 - 1}{x} ), then: (x^2 + 1)^2 - a x (x^2 - 1) = (x^2 - 1)^2 + 4x^2 - a x (x^2 - 1) = 0 5.

In a twist of fate, he donates another 15 bitcoins on a day when the bitcoin value skyrockets to quadruple its initial value. How many bitcoins does Jake have now?","completion":"Let's break down the events step by step: 1. Jake starts with 120 bitcoins. 2. He invests 40 bitcoins when the price of bitcoin doubles. Since the value doubled, his investment is worth 80 bitcoins in terms of the initial value. 3. He donates 25 bitcoins when the value of bitcoin is half of what it was the previous day. Since the value is half, those 25 bitcoins are worth 12.5 bitcoins in terms of the initial value. 4. He gives half of all his bitcoins to his brother when bitcoin is at peak value. We need to calculate how many bitcoins he has before this transaction. 5. His brother returns 5 bitcoins when the value is at its lowest in a month.

He donates 15 bitcoins when the value skyrockets to quadruple its initial value. These 15 bitcoins are worth 60 bitcoins in terms of the initial value. Now let's calculate: After the investment of 40 bitcoins (which doubled in value), Jake has: 120 - 40 = 80 bitcoins left. After the donation of 25 bitcoins (which were worth half the initial value), Jake has: 80 - 12.5 = 67.5 bitcoins left. He then gives half to his brother: 67.5 / 2 = 33.75 bitcoins left. His brother returns 5 bitcoins: 33.75 + 5 = 38.75 bitcoins. Jake quadruples his bitcoins: 38.75 * 4 = 155 bitcoins.

The circumference (C) of a circle (which is the shape of the tire) is also related to the diameter (d) by the formula: C = π * d Where π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159. Now we can solve for the diameter (d): 3.402 feet = π * d d = 3.402 feet / π d ≈ 3.402 feet / 3.14159 d ≈ 1.083 feet Therefore, the diameter of the car tire is approximately 1.083 feet. If you need the diameter in inches, you can convert feet to inches by multiplying by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches): d ≈ 1.083 feet * 12 inches/foot d ≈ 12.996 inches So, the diameter of the car tire is approximately boxed{13} inches."},{"prompt":"A lawn chair was originally priced at some amount and was sold for 59.95 at a special sale.

Each side is divided into n equal segments, and parallel lines are drawn from each division point to the opposite side, creating smaller equilateral triangles. Each vertex of these smaller triangles is referred to as a node and at each node, a real number is placed. Given: 1. The numbers placed at points A, B, C are a, b, c respectively; 2. In each rhombus formed by two adjacent smaller equilateral triangles, the sum of the numbers at two opposite nodes is equal. Find: 1. The distance r between the node with the largest number and the node with the smallest number. 2. The total sum S of the numbers at all nodes. Part 1: Finding r 1. Consider any arbitrary trapezoid formed by 3 consecutive smaller equilateral triangles, like A_{1} A_{3} A_{4} A_{5}. Let A_{2} be the midpoint of A_{1} A_{5}, and at node A_i the number placed is a_i for i=1,2,3,4,5. 2. From the given data, we have the following relationships: [ a_{1} + a_{4} = a_{2} + a_{3} ] [ a_{2} + a_{4} = a_{5} + a_{3} ] 3. Subtracting these two equations, we get: [ a_{1} - a_{2} = a_{2} - a_{5} ] 4. This implies that the numbers placed at three consecutive nodes on the same line can form an arithmetic sequence. 5. Given the equations and due to the cyclic nature of the sequence, the number sequence at any given string of aligned nodes will be an arithmetic progression. 6. Assuming a leq b leq c, we analyze four cases: i. If a = b = c, then all placed numbers are equal and therefore r = 0, since the distance between the smallest and the largest numbers is zero. ii. If a < b < c, aside from A, B, C, let any random node have number x, so a < x < c. Consequently, the maximum distance r = AC = 1. iii. If a < b = c, let D be the midpoint of BC and suppose n is even. The number at D is frac{1}{2}(b+c)=c. Hence all other nodes hold values in between a and b, yielding r=AD=frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. For odd n, the midpoint D splits fractions between neighboring nodes, thus the nearest node M to D is at distance frac{1}{2n} yielding r as: [ r = sqrt{AD^2 + DM^2} = sqrt{left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{1}{2n}right)^2 } = frac{1}{2n}sqrt{3n^2+1}. ] iv.

Thus, ( f(n, 1) = 1 ). 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for some ( n ge k ), the function ( f(n, k) ) is given by: [ f(n, k) = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{n}{i} ] 4. **Inductive Step:** Consider ( n+1 ) and show that: [ f(n+1, k) = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{n+1}{i} ] 5. **Reduction to ( n-1 ) bits:** Let ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_m ) be ( m ) binary sequences of length ( n ). Consider the first ( n-1 ) bits of each sequence and name these new sequences ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{t(m)} ).

By the definition of ( C_i )'s, bits ( r_{i_1}, r_{i_2}, ldots, r_{i_{k-1}}, r_n ) produce all ( k )-bit sequences in ( A_i )'s, which is a contradiction. 8. **Combining Results:** By Pascal's identity, we have: [ m = r(m) + t(m) le f(n-1, k) + f(n-1, k-1) ] Using the inductive hypothesis: [ f(n-1, k) = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{n-1}{i} ] [ f(n-1, k-1) = sum_{j=0}^{k-2} binom{n-1}{j} ] Therefore: [ m le sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{n-1}{i} + sum_{j=0}^{k-2} binom{n-1}{j} ] By Pascal's identity: [ sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{n-1}{i} + sum_{j=0}^{k-2} binom{n-1}{j} = binom{n}{0} + sum_{i=1}^{k-1} left( binom{n-1}{i} + binom{n-1}{i-1} right) = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} binom{n}{i} ] 9. **Equality Case:** For the equality case, consider an arbitrary sequence ( A ) and each sequence whose Hamming distance from ( A ) is less than ( k ).

Additionally, we observe that three liars cannot be adjacent since the middle person would inadvertently tell the truth. 2. **Grouping and Alternation**: We can analyze the circular arrangement by breaking it down into groups of consecutive inhabitants: - Groups of consecutive liars can be either one or two liars. - Groups of consecutive knights can only be one knight because if there were two or more consecutive knights, the statement made by at least one knight would not hold.

The train crosses a tree (which we can consider as a point) in 80 seconds. The length of the train is 1200 meters. Therefore, the speed of the train (v) can be calculated using the formula: v = distance / time Here, the distance is the length of the train, which is 1200 meters, and the time is 80 seconds. v = 1200 meters / 80 seconds v = 15 meters/second Now, to find out how long it will take the train to pass a platform that is 1000 meters long, we need to consider the combined length of the train and the platform. This is because the train needs to cover the entire length of the platform as well as its own length to completely pass the platform. The combined length = length of the train + length of the platform The combined length = 1200 meters + 1000 meters The combined length = 2200 meters Now, we use the speed of the train to calculate the time it will take to pass the platform: time = distance / speed Here, the distance is the combined length of 2200 meters, and the speed is 15 meters/second. time = 2200 meters / 15 meters/second time = 146.67 seconds Therefore, it will take the train approximately 146.67 seconds to pass a platform that is boxed{1000} meters long."},{"prompt":"f the solution set of the inequality left(a2right)x gt a2 with respect to x is x lt 1, simplify |a3|=______.","completion":"Given the inequality left(a-2right)x > a-2 and its solution set with respect to x is x < 1, we proceed as follows: 1. **Analyzing the Solution Set**: The solution set x < 1 implies that the coefficient of x in the inequality, which is (a-2), must be negative. This is because for a linear inequality of the form cx > d, if c < 0, then the solution set involves x being less than some value. Therefore, we have: [ a - 2 < 0 ] 2. **Solving for a**: From the inequality a - 2 < 0, we can solve for a to find the range of values it can take: [ a < 2 ] 3. **Determining the Absolute Value Expression**: Given |a-3|, we know that the absolute value function outputs the distance of a-3 from 0 on the number line. Since a < 2, then a - 3 < -1, meaning a-3 is negative. For the absolute value of a negative number, we take the negative of that number (since distance is always positive). Therefore: [ |a-3| = -(a-3) = 3-a ] Thus, simplifying |a-3| under the given conditions yields: [ boxed{3-a} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that x, y in (0, +infty), and they satisfy the equation frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{2y} = 1, find the minimum value of x + 4y.","completion":"Since x, y in (0, +infty) and they satisfy the equation frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{2y} = 1, we can multiply both sides of the equation x + 4y by left(frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{2y}right) to get: begin{align*} x + 4y &= (x + 4y)left(frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{2y}right) &= xleft(frac{1}{x}right) + xleft(frac{1}{2y}right) + 4yleft(frac{1}{x}right) + 4yleft(frac{1}{2y}right) &= 1 + frac{x}{2y} + frac{4y}{x} + 2. end{align*} We can rewrite this as x + 4y = 3 + frac{x}{2y} + frac{4y}{x} and apply the AM-GM inequality, which states that for any non-negative real numbers a and b, frac{a+b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}, with equality if and only if a = b.

Let ( p ) be a prime number such that ( p > 10^9 ) and ( 4p + 1 = q ) is also a prime number. 2. We need to prove that the decimal expansion of ( frac{1}{q} ) contains all the digits ( 0, 1, ldots, 9 ). 3. Consider the order of ( 10 ) modulo ( q ), denoted as ( d ). This ( d ) is the smallest positive integer such that ( 10^d equiv 1 pmod{q} ). The decimal expansion of ( frac{1}{q} ) is a repeating decimal with ( d ) digits. 4. Since ( q = 4p + 1 ), ( d ) must divide ( varphi(q) = q - 1 = 4p ), where ( varphi ) is Euler's totient function. Therefore, ( d ) can be ( 1, 2, 4, p, 2p, ) or ( 4p ). 5. Given ( q > 10^9 ), ( d ) cannot be ( 1, 2, ) or ( 4 ) because ( d ) must be large enough to ensure a sufficiently long repeating decimal. Thus, ( d ) must be ( p, 2p, ) or ( 4p ). 6. We will consider the case where ( d = p ). The other cases (( d = 2p ) and ( d = 4p )) can be handled similarly. 7. Let ( X ) be the repeating decimal part of ( frac{1}{q} ). Then, ( X ) has ( p ) digits. 8. For any natural number ( c ), if ( 10^k equiv c pmod{q} ) for some ( k ), then the repeating part of the decimal expansion of ( frac{c}{q} ) is a permutation of the repeating part of the expansion of ( frac{1}{q} ). This is because performing the long division starting at the ( k )-th digit is equivalent to shifting the decimal expansion. 9. Let ( cX ) be the repeating decimal when multiplied by ( c ). We can write ( cX = overline{AB} ), where ( B ) has ( p ) digits and ( A ) are the remaining leading digits. 10. If the decimal expansion of ( frac{1}{q} ) does not contain some digit, say ( 9 ), then ( A ) will not contain ( 9 ) either for all good ( c )'s.

We start by noting the given greatest common divisors (GCDs): gcd(a,b) = 168 and gcd(a,c) = 693. This implies that a, b, and c share factors as dictated by these GCDs. 2. We calculate gcd(168,693) to find any common factor between b and c since a shares factors with both. The calculation yields gcd(168,693) = 21. This means that both b and c must be divisible by 21, as 21 is a common factor of both 168 and 693. 3. Given that gcd(a,b) = 168 = 8 cdot 21, we understand that both a and b must include 21 as a factor. Similarly, since gcd(a,c) = 693 = 21 cdot 33, both a and c must include 21 as a factor. This establishes that 21 is a common divisor of b and c. 4. To determine if 21 is indeed the smallest possible value for gcd(b,c), we consider an example where a = 5544 = 21 cdot 8 cdot 33, b = 168, and c = 693. For these values, we find that gcd(a,b) = gcd(5544,168) = 168 and gcd(a,c) = gcd(5544,693) = 693, which are consistent with the given conditions. Importantly, gcd(b,c) = gcd(168,693) = 21, demonstrating that a gcd(b,c) of 21 is attainable. 5.

Starting from the final morning division to the initial division, we can express it as: Let ( N_5 ) be the number of nuts at the fourth friend's wake-up minus what they took: [ N_4 = 5 left(frac{N_5 - 1}{4}right) + 1 = frac{5N_5 + 4}{4} ] Similarly, propagating back: [ N_3 = 5 left(frac{N_4 - 1}{4}right) + 1 = 5 left(frac{frac{5N_5 + 4}{4} - 1}{4}right) + 1 = frac{25N_5 + 21}{16} ] [ N_2 = 5 left(frac{N_3 - 1}{4}right) + 1 = 5 left(frac{frac{25N_5 + 21}{16} - 1}{4}right) + 1 = frac{125N_5 + 109}{64} ] [ N_1 = 5 left(frac{N_2 - 1}{4}right) + 1 = 5 left(frac{frac{125N_5 + 109}{64} - 1}{4}right) + 1 = frac{625N_5 + 545}{256} ] Finally, the initial number of nuts when all friends wake up in the morning: [ N = 5 left(frac{N_1 - 1}{4}right) + 1 = 5 left(frac{frac{625N_5 + 545}{256} - 1}{4}right) + 1 = frac{3125N_5 + 2731}{1024} ] 3. **Finding the Minimum Solution**: Observe the fractional forms and simplify the common multiples: Notice also the pattern: [ N = 15625N_5 + 11529 text{ needs to be an integer, hence } 15625N_5 + 11529 equiv 0 pmod{1024} ] Solving (15625N_5 + 11529 equiv 0 pmod{1024}): Since one of the solutions can be checked manually (intuition or elementary number theory): [ 15625 times 1023 + 11529 = 159423124 ] Which also verifies through: [ N = 3125 times 1023 + 2731 = 159423124 ] Conclusion: The minimum number of nuts in the bag, ( N ), for this pattern to hold is: [ boxed{15621} ]"},{"prompt":"Nancy had some files on her computer.

Any chord of the curve of constant width connecting points of tangency of the curve to parallel support lines is perpendicular to these support lines and thus has a length of ( h ). Curves that possess the property that the distance between every pair of points on the curve does not exceed some value ( h ) and for each point on the curve there is another point on the curve at a distance of exactly ( h ) from the first are sometimes called curves of constant diameter. From the result of problem 81, it follows that every curve of constant width is simultaneously a curve of constant diameter. It is not difficult to show that, conversely, every curve of constant diameter is a curve of constant width. Thus, we can study curves of constant diameter: this class of curves coincides fully with the class of curves of constant width. 1. **Definition and Properties:** - Consider a curve ( C ) of constant width ( h ). - Recall that a curve of constant width ( h ) is such that the distance between any two parallel supporting lines is constant and equal to ( h ). 2. **Supporting Lines:** - A supporting line of a curve is a line that touches the curve at exactly one point, but does not intersect the interior of the curve. 3. **Tangency Property:** - Let us assume that there are two supporting lines ( L_1 ) and ( L_2 ) which are parallel and tangent to the curve ( C ) at points ( A ) and ( B ) respectively. - Since ( C ) has constant width ( h ), the perpendicular distance between ( L_1 ) and ( L_2 ) is ( h ). 4. **Chord Length:** - Consider the chord ( AB ) which connects the points of tangency ( A ) and ( B ). - By the definition of a curve of constant width, this chord is perpendicular to both ( L_1 ) and ( L_2 ), ensuring it has a fixed length of ( h ). 5. **Uniqueness of Tangency:** - If ( L ) is a supporting line to ( C ), it touches ( C ) at exactly one point ( P ). - Suppose for contradiction that ( L ) touches ( C ) at more than one point. Denote these points as ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ). - Since ( L ) is a support line, this would force ( C ) to have a distance greater than ( h ) between ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ), contradicting the property of the constant width ( h ). 6. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, any supporting line ( L ) has exactly one common point with the curve ( C ). - The property of the chord ( AB ) being perpendicular to parallel supporting lines and having a fixed length ( h ) is preserved, forming the basis of curves of constant diameter. # Conclusion By confirming that any supporting line has only one common point of tangency with the curve and further affirming that the chords connecting points of tangency for parallel lines are perpendicular with a fixed length, we verify the properties of curves of constant width. Consequently, it proves the curved detail, including the nature of chord lengths and tangency.

We demonstrate that: [ overline{abcdefgh} > overline{abc} cdot overline{de} cdot f cdot overline{gh} ] Applying previous reasoning: [ overline{abcdefgh} > overline{abc} cdot overline{defgh} ] and [ overline{defgh} > overline{de} cdot overline{fgh} ] Therefore: [ overline{abcdefgh} > overline{abc} cdot overline{de} cdot overline{fgh} ] Moreover: [ overline{fgh} > f cdot overline{gh} ] Combining these: [ overline{abc} cdot overline{de} cdot overline{fgh} > overline{abc} cdot overline{de} cdot f cdot overline{gh} ] 3. **Final Conclusion**: This shows that slicing any (n)-digit number into smaller parts, the original number remains greater than the product of its parts.

Prove that it is possible to cut out one more square.","completion":"1. **Problem Understanding:** The problem states that squares of size (2 times 2) have been cut out from a (29 times 29) grid of cells. Each small square cuts out exactly 4 cells, and a total of 99 small squares have been removed. We need to prove that it's still possible to cut out one more (2 times 2) square from the remaining cells. 2. **Calculation of Removed Cells:** Each (2 times 2) square removes 4 cells. Hence, the total number of cells removed is: [ 99 times 4 = 396 text{ cells.} ] 3. **Remaining Cells:** The total number of cells in the original (29 times 29) grid is: [ 29 times 29 = 841 text{ cells.} ] After removing 396 cells, the remaining number of cells is: [ 841 - 396 = 445 text{ cells.} ] 4. **Divisibility by 4:** To cut out a (2 times 2) square, we need 4 contiguous cells. Hence, we need to check if the remaining 445 cells can accommodate another (2 times 2) square. Note that 445 is not divisible by 4, indicating that there are some cells not aligning perfectly for complete sets of (2 times 2) squares. However, the number of cells left suggests that there should still be enough space to place one more (2 times 2) square. 5. **Mathematical Argument using Residues:** Consider the cells in the (29 times 29) grid labeled by coordinates ((i,j)) where (i) and (j) range from 1 to 29. Observe the cells' indices modulo 3: Coordinate ((i,j)) is considered if both (i mod 3) and (j mod 3) give a residue of 1. This subsets those cells within a modular arithmetic framework by their positions. Planned positions of the top-left corner of a (2 times 2) square can align such that none of the marked positions will overlap with another on this (3 times 3) modular structure. 6. **Conclusion:** Since we have shown a systematic way of ensuring at least one configuration of a (2 times 2) square being possible among remaining unmarked cells, it's clear the answer follows. Thus, it is indeed possible to cut out at least one more (2 times 2) square from the remaining cells. Therefore, we achieve the required conclusion: [ boxed{text{It is possible to cut one more (2 times 2) square.}} ]"},{"prompt":"At present, the ratio between the ages of Shekhar and Shobha is 4:3.

Consider n = 2^k q for any positive integer k. Then: [ alpha n^2 = frac{p}{q} (2^k q)^2 = p cdot 2^{2k} q ] Since p and q are integers, p cdot 2^{2k} q is an integer. Therefore: [ lfloor alpha n^2 rfloor = lfloor p cdot 2^{2k} q rfloor = p cdot 2^{2k} q ] Notice that 2^{2k} is always even for any integer k geq 1. Hence, p cdot 2^{2k} q is even.

There are infinitely many n such that {alpha n^2} in [0, 0.5). For such n, we have: [ lfloor alpha n^2 rfloor = alpha n^2 - {alpha n^2} ] Since {alpha n^2} < 0.5, lfloor alpha n^2 rfloor is closer to an even integer than to an odd integer. Therefore, there are infinitely many n such that lfloor alpha n^2 rfloor is even.

The monotonicity of f(x) and the sign of f'(x) are as follows: - On the interval (0, 1), we have f'(x) < 0, so f(x) is decreasing. - At x = 1, we have f'(x) = 0, which indicates a potential extreme value. - On the interval (1, +infty), we have f'(x) > 0, so f(x) is increasing.

To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds. So, 72 kmph = 72 * (1000 / 3600) m/s = 20 m/s. Now, let's calculate the distance the train travels to cross the man. Since it takes 18 seconds to cross the man and the train is traveling at 20 m/s, the length of the train (L_train) is: L_train = speed * time = 20 m/s * 18 s = 360 meters. This is the length of the train. Next, we need to find out the distance the train travels to cross the platform. It takes 31 seconds to cross the platform, so the distance covered when crossing the platform is: Distance = speed * time = 20 m/s * 31 s = 620 meters. This distance is the length of the train plus the length of the platform (L_platform). Since we already know the length of the train, we can find the length of the platform by subtracting the length of the train from the total distance: L_platform = Distance - L_train = 620 meters - 360 meters = 260 meters.

Therefore, angle BAC = angle ABC = angle ACB = 60^circ, and similarly for triangle BDE. 3. **Using Symmetry and Congruence**: Since triangle ABC and triangle BDE are congruent and equilateral, the internal angles at A and D on the line ABD will also be equal. Hence, angle BAC = angle EBD = 60^circ. 4. **Intersection of Lines**: Next, we need to focus on the intersection point F of lines AE and CD. Since both triangles are equilateral triangles positioned as described, we can see that line AE will map directly onto line CD when rotated around point B by 60^circ. 5. **Calculating the Desired Angle**: To determine angle AFD, observe that: - The internal angles at A and D contribute 60^circ each due to the congruence and symmetry of the equilateral triangle. - Given lines AE and CD meet at F, and angle rotation and symmetry properties, angle AFD is actually the external angle of one of the equilateral triangles. 6. **Conclusion**: The external angle of an equilateral triangle is 180^circ - 60^circ = 120^circ.

We will denote the angles formed by these intersections as follows: [ angle BAN = alpha, quad angle DAN = alpha_1, quad angle BCL = beta, quad angle DCL = beta_1 ] 2. **Determine the angles at the intersection points:** Now, we calculate the angles at points ( K ) and ( M ): [ angle NKL = 360^circ - angle BKN - angle BKL = 360^circ - (180^circ - alpha) - (180^circ - beta) = alpha + beta ] Similarly, [ angle NML = 360^circ - angle DMN - angle DML = 360^circ - (180^circ - alpha_1) - (180^circ - beta_1) = alpha_1 + beta_1 ] 3. **Add the angles at ( K ) and ( M ):** Next, we add the angles calculated at points ( K ) and ( M ): [ angle NKL + angle NML = alpha + beta + alpha_1 + beta_1 ] 4. **Use the cyclic nature of quadrilateral ( ABCD ):** From the properties of the cyclic quadrilateral ( ABCD ), we know that opposite angles sum up to ( 180^circ ): [ alpha + alpha_1 + beta + beta_1 = angle BAD + angle BCD = 180^circ ] 5. **Conclude the angles on the same circle:** Since the sum of ( angle NKL ) and ( angle NML ) equals ( 180^circ ): [ angle NKL + angle NML = 180^circ ] This result implies that the quadrilateral ( KLMN ) can be inscribed in a circle, because in a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to ( 180^circ ). **Conclusion:** The four points ( K, L, M, ) and ( N ), where the circumcircles intersect within the quadrilateral and distinct from its vertices, do lie on the same circle.

A fixed point ( x ) satisfies: [ x = 1 + frac{2}{x} ] Multiplying both sides by ( x ) to clear the fraction, we get: [ x^2 = x + 2 ] Rearranging this into a standard quadratic equation form: [ x^2 - x - 2 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a = 1 ), ( b = -1 ), and ( c = -2 ): [ x = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = frac{1 pm 3}{2} ] Thus, the solutions are: [ x = 2 quad text{and} quad x = -1 ] 3. **Form of iterated functions:** The iterated function ( f_n(x) ) can be expressed in the form of a Möbius transformation: [ f_n(x) = frac{ax + b}{cx + d} ] This form is preserved under composition of rational functions. 4. **Fixed points of iterated functions:** Since ( f_n(x) ) is a rational function of the form ( frac{ax + b}{cx + d} ), the equation ( x = f_n(x) ) is a quadratic equation: [ x = frac{ax + b}{cx + d} ] Multiplying both sides by ( cx + d ) to clear the fraction: [ x(cx + d) = ax + b ] [ cx^2 + dx = ax + b ] Rearranging terms: [ cx^2 + (d - a)x - b = 0 ] This is a quadratic equation in ( x ), which has at most two solutions unless ( f_n(x) ) is identically ( x ). 5. **Behavior of iterated functions:** It is noted that ( f_n(x) ) cannot be identically ( x ) because applying ( f ) to any ( x ) (except the fixed points) changes its value.

Prove that a=b . *Proposed by Mohsen Jamali, Iran*","completion":"1. **Assume for contradiction**: Suppose ( a neq b ). Then, ( b - a ) has finitely many prime divisors. 2. **Lemma I**: There exists an odd prime ( p > b > a ) such that ( 4 nmid a^p + p ) and ( gcd(a^p + p, b - a) leq 2 ). **Proof of Lemma I**: - Let ( p ) be an odd prime. If ( a ) is even and ( p ) is odd, then ( 4 nmid a^p + p ). - If ( a equiv pm 1 pmod{4} ), choose ( p equiv a pmod{4} ). Thus, there exists an odd prime ( p ) for which ( 4 nmid a^p + p ). - Now, we prove the second part of Lemma I. Let ( q ) be an odd prime divisor of ( b - a ). For all ( q ), if ( a equiv 1 pmod{q} ), let ( p equiv 1 pmod{q} ), then ( a^p + p equiv 2 pmod{q} ). - Otherwise, if ( a notequiv 1 pmod{q} ), let ( p equiv -1 pmod{q} ), so ( a^p + p equiv a^p - 1 pmod{q} ). - Assume for contradiction that ( q mid a^p - 1 ). Then, either ( text{ord}_q(a) = 1 ) or ( text{ord}_q(a) = p ). In the former case, this means ( a equiv 1 pmod{q} ), contradiction. In the latter case, this gives us ( q equiv 1 pmod{p} ), contradiction, since ( p > q ), as ( p equiv -1 pmod{q} ). - Hence, by Dirichlet's Theorem of Arithmetic Progression together with the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we find that there exists an odd prime ( p > b > a ) such that ( gcd(a^p + p, b - a) ) has no prime factors other than possibly ( 2 ), and since we can choose ( p ) such that ( 4 nmid a^p + p ), it follows that ( gcd(a^p + p, b - a) leq 2 ), as desired. (blacksquare) 3. **Using Lemma I**: Let ( n = p ), where ( p ) is an odd prime which satisfies the conditions in Lemma I, so we have ( a^p + p mid b^p - a^p ). 4. **Prime divisor analysis**: Let ( q ) be a prime divisor of ( a^p + p ). If ( q mid b ), then ( q mid a ), so ( q mid p ), which means that ( q = p ). However, ( p > a ), therefore we must have ( q nmid a, b ). 5. **Order analysis**: Then, ( q mid (ba^{-1})^p - 1 ), so ( text{ord}_q(ba^{-1}) = 1 ) or ( text{ord}_q(ba^{-1}) = p ). In the former case, we obtain ( q mid b - a ), however, since ( gcd(a^p + p, b - a) leq 2 ), this implies ( q = 2 ). In the latter case, this implies ( q equiv 1 pmod{p} ), so for all primes ( q mid a^p + p ), either ( q = 2 ) or ( q equiv 1 pmod{p} ), and also ( 4 nmid a^p + p ), hence we must have either ( a^p + p equiv 1 pmod{p} ) or ( a^p + p equiv 2 pmod{p} ), or, equivalently, ( a equiv 1 pmod{p} ) or ( a equiv 2 pmod{p} ). Since ( p > b > a ), this is only possible if ( a = 1 ) or ( a = 2 ). 6. **Case analysis**: - If ( a = 1 ), then if any prime ( q mid b ), setting ( n = q - 1 ), we obtain ( q mid b^{q - 1} + q - 1 equiv -1 pmod{q} ), contradiction. Hence, ( b ) cannot have any prime divisors, so ( b = 1 ). - If ( a = 2 ), then ( a^p + p ) is odd, so ( gcd(a^p + p, b - a) = gcd(2^p + p, b - 2) = 1 ). Then, we have ( a^p + p = 2^p + p mid b^p - a^p = b^p - 2^p ). Let ( q ) be a prime divisor of ( 2^p + p ). Note that ( q ) must be odd. If ( q mid b ), then ( q mid 2 ), so ( q = 2 ), contradiction. As a result, ( q nmid b ), then ( q mid (b cdot 2^{-1})^p - 1 ), therefore ( text{ord}_q(b cdot 2^{-1}) = 1 ) or ( text{ord}_q(b cdot 2^{-1}) = p ). In the former case, this gives us ( q mid b - 2 ), but this is impossible since ( gcd(2^p + p, b - 2) = 1 ). In the latter case, this implies ( q equiv 1 pmod{p} ), so for all primes ( q mid 2^p + p ), ( q equiv 1 pmod{p} ), so this gives us ( 2^p + p equiv 1 pmod{p} ), but we also have ( 2^p + p equiv 2 pmod{p} ), contradiction. 7. **Conclusion**: Then, the initial assumption that ( b neq a ) must be wrong, so we find that ( b = a ).

Since ( a_i ) is not in ( {1, 2, ldots, lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor} ) and not in ( {n, n-1, ldots, n - lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor + 1} ), it must lie strictly between ( lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ) and ( n - lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ). 6. **Contradiction with LCM Condition:** - Consider the largest value ( a_k ) in the sequence and any other value ( a_i ) in the sequence. - Since ( a_k ) is greater than ( lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ) and less than ( n - lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ), the product ( a_i cdot a_k ) is likely to exceed ( n ) unless ( a_i ) is very small. - However, since ( a_i ) is also greater than ( lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ), their product divided by their gcd will exceed ( n ), violating the condition ( operatorname{lcm}(a_i, a_k) le n ). 7. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, our assumption that ( k > 2lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ) must be false. - Hence, ( k le 2lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ).

For triangle ABC with angle bisectors AA_1, BB_1, and CC_1 intersecting at O, we use: [ frac{AC_1}{C_1B} = frac{a}{b} ] [ frac{BA_1}{A_1C} = frac{b}{c} ] [ frac{CB_1}{B_1A} = frac{c}{a} ] 4. Given that AC_1 = BA_1 = CB_1, it leads us to conclude that: [ frac{AC_1}{C_1B} = frac{BA_1}{A_1C} = frac{CB_1}{B_1A} ] Consequently: [ frac{a}{b} = frac{b}{c} = frac{c}{a} ] 5. This implies that: [ a^2 = bc ] [ b^2 = ac ] [ c^2 = ab ] 6. Therefore, by symmetry and equality, we can deduce: [ a = b = c ] 7.

We need to check if ( P_1 ) is golden. Let ( U = {5} ) and ( V = {7} ). We need to find ( z in P_1 ) such that ( z circ 5 ) and ( z bullet 7 ). - The binary representation of 5 is ( 101 ). - The binary representation of 7 is ( 111 ). For ( z circ 5 ), the 5th bit of ( z ) must be 1, or the ( z )-th bit of 5 must be 1. For ( z bullet 7 ), the 7th bit of ( z ) must be 0, and the ( z )-th bit of 7 must be 0.

This property is crucial for simplifying our problem. - Given permutation ( x = (x_1, ldots, x_n) ), we can construct its inverse permutation ( x^{-1} ). Since the inverse permutation exists and maintains distinct ratios, it is sufficient to consider permutations ( x ) where cycles have length at most 2: - For ( n ), the permutations can be broken down into cycles of lengths ( leq 2 ). For such a permutation to work, there can be at most one fixed point (since that gives the ratio 1): - For odd ( n ), exactly one fixed point is required. - For even ( n ), no fixed points are allowed. 2. **Graphical Representation Using ( K_n )** Consider the complete graph ( K_n ) where the edge ( {i, j} ) is labeled with the ratio ( i/j ) for ( i < j ): - Our permutations correspond to matchings in ( K_n ). 3. **Defining \\"Fantastic\\" Matchings** We define \\"fantastic\\" matchings: - A matching is fantastic if all edge labels are distinct. 4. **Switching Operation and Neighbor Matching** - If edges ( ab ) and ( cd ) have the same label ( ell ) for ( a < b ) and ( c < d ), then edges ( ac ) and ( bd ) also share ( ell ). Accordingly, we define neighbors of matching ( mathcal{M} ): - For each label ( ell ), take pairs of edges with the label and apply the switching operation ( (ab, cd) rightarrow (ac, bd) ). - This operation is reflexive and symmetric but not transitive. 5. **Claim: Matching ( mathcal{M} ) and Number of Neighbors** The next insight is to show: - A matching ( mathcal{M} ) has an odd number of neighbors (including itself) if and only if it is fantastic. **Proof**: - Consider a label ( ell ) with ( n_{ell} ) edges labeled ( ell ). - The number of ways to pick ( k ) pairs and swap them: [ binom{n_{ell}}{2k}(2k-1)!! ] - Total operations on edges labeled ( ell ): [ sum_{k} binom{n_{ell}}{2k}(2k-1)!! equiv sum_{k} binom{n_{ell}}{2k} = 2^{n_{ell}-1} pmod{2} ] This sum is even if ( n_{ell} > 1 ). Consequently, the number of neighbors of ( mathcal{M} ) is the product of all such factors: - It is odd if and only if each factor is odd, meaning ( n_{ell} = 1 ) for every ( ell ). 6. **Graph ( Gamma ) on Maximal Matchings** We construct a graph ( Gamma ) where: - Vertices are the maximal matchings. - Edges are based on the neighbor relation. **Properties**: - Fantastic matchings correspond to isolated vertices (degree zero). - Non-fantastic matchings correspond to vertices with odd degrees. By the handshake lemma, the number of vertices with odd degrees in any simple graph is even. 7. **Conclusion** Since the number of vertices (matching correspondences) in ( Gamma ) is odd: - The graph cannot only consist of vertices with even degrees. - Thus, ( Gamma ) must have at least one isolated vertex, confirming an odd number of fantastic matchings.

Since the chessboard is 10 times 10, it has 100 squares, half of which are black (50 black squares). - If we place a rook on each black square, no two rooks will share the same row or column because the black squares are arranged such that no two black squares are in the same row or column. 4. **Verification:** - Since rooks are placed on black squares, they do not attack each other as they are not in the same row or column. - Bishops are not placed on the board, so there are no diagonal attacks to consider. 5. **Maximum Number of Chocolate Pieces:** - By placing rooks on all 50 black squares, we ensure that all 50 rooks are chocolate pieces (i.e., no piece attacks another). 6. **Tiling Argument:** - To confirm that 50 is indeed the maximum, consider any 2 times 2 square on the chessboard. In any 2 times 2 square, there can be at most 2 chocolate pieces because placing more would result in at least one piece being attacked. - The 10 times 10 chessboard can be divided into 25 disjoint 2 times 2 squares.

Substitute A=2B into the given equation to get sin Csin B=sin Bsin left(C-Aright). 2. Since sin B neq 0, we can divide both sides by sin B to obtain sin C=sin left(C-Aright). 3. This implies two possibilities due to the properties of sine function: either C=C-A (which is not possible since it implies A=0, contradicting A=2B) or C+C-A=pi. 4.

Therefore, the probability that Gambler A wins all the bets is: f(p) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - (1+3p)(1-p)^3. To determine if event A is a rare event when p geqslant frac{4}{5}, we analyze f(p): - The derivative f'(p) = 12p(1-p)^2 shows that f(p) is monotonically increasing on [frac{4}{5}, 1). - Thus, the minimum value of f(p) when p=frac{4}{5} is f(frac{4}{5}) = frac{608}{625}. The maximum probability of Gambler B winning, P(A), is: 1 - frac{608}{625} = frac{17}{625} = 0.0272 < 0.05. Therefore, event A is considered a rare event when p geqslant frac{4}{5} because the probability of it occurring is less than 0.05.

The point T_1 and T_2 are on the same side of [AB].

Formally, the constraints can be broken down as follows: 1. **Red Circles Constraint**: - We need at least one red circle in every group of three consecutive circles. 2. **Blue Circles Constraint**: - We need at least one blue circle in every group of four consecutive circles. 3. **Green Circles Constraint**: - There must be more than half of the circles as green, meaning at least lceil frac{11}{2} rceil + 1 = 6 green circles.

Step-by-Step Analysis 1. **Divide the sequence into non-overlapping groups to apply the constraints**: For the Red Circle Constraint: - Divide the sequence into groups of 3 non-overlapping circles. Given the length of our sequence is 11, we can have three groups of 3 circles and one remaining group of 2 circles: [ {1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9},{10,11} ] Each of these groups (except the last group) must contain at least one red circle. This directly gives us at least: [ text{3 red circles from the 3 groups of three} ] For the Blue Circle Constraint: - Divide the sequence into groups of 4 non-overlapping circles (considering all 11 circles). Given the length of the sequence is 11, we can have two groups of 4 circles and one remaining group of 3 circles: [ {1,2,3,4},{5,6,7,8},{9,10,11} ] Each of these groups (except the last group) must include at least one blue circle. This tells us we need at least: [ text{2 blue circles from the 2 groups of four} ] 2. **Green Circle Constraint**: We need more than half of the total circles to be green: [ > frac{11}{2} = 6 quad text{(since} leftlceilfrac{11}{2}rightrceil + 1 = 6) ] 3. **Verification**: Adding up the minimum numbers of red, blue, and green circles required, we have: [ 3 text{ (red)} + 2 text{ (blue)} + 6 text{ (green)} = 11 quad(text{Total available circles}) ] Thus, with this allocation, it is feasible to structure the circles such that each requirement is satisfied.

(2) If Person A and Person B must stand next to each other, we can consider them as a single unit. Then, we have 5 units to arrange, which gives us 5! = 120 ways.

There are two scenarios in which a customer can win a prize: ① exactly 5 of the drawn numbers match the winning numbers; ② all 6 of the drawn numbers match the winning numbers. Therefore, the total number of ways a customer can win is C_{6}^{5}C_{4}^{1} + C_{6}^{6}C_{4}^{0} = 24 + 1 = 25. Thus, the probability of winning is frac{25}{210} = frac{5}{42}.

A sequence of moves is performed as follows: At each stage a square containing more than one bean is chosen. Two beans are taken from this square; one of them is placed on the square immediately to the left, and the other is placed on the square immediately to the right of the chosen square. The sequence terminates if at some point there is at most one bean on each square. Given some initial configuration, show that any legal sequence of moves will terminate after the same number of steps and with the same final configuration.","completion":"1. **Setup and Definitions**: Let the squares be indexed by integers: ..., -1, 0, 1, 2, ldots. When a bean is moved from square i to square i+1 or from i+1 to square i for the first time, we may assign index i to it. Thereafter, whenever a bean is moved in either direction, we shall assume it is the one marked by index i. Thus, each pair of neighboring squares always has a bean shifted between them. 2. **Bean Position and Invariance**: - Since the number of beans is finite, there are only finitely many pairs of neighboring squares, and thus finitely many squares on which moves are made. - Therefore, without loss of generality (w.l.o.g), we may assume all moves occur between 0 and some l in mathbb{N}, and that all beans stay within the range [0, l] at all times. Define b_i to be the number of beans in the i-th cell (i in Z) and let b be the total number of beans. We define the semi-invariant [ S = sum_{i in Z} i^2 b_i ] 3. **Semi-Invariant Increase**: - During each move, since all moves occur within [0, l], the semi-invariant S increases by 2. - The crucial part is to observe that S is always less than b cdot l^2. This implies that S can only increase up to a certain finite limit, hence the number of moves must be finite. 4. **Uniqueness of Final Configuration**: - We now need to prove that the final configuration and the number of moves are unique for a given initial configuration {b_i}. - Let x_i geq 0 represent the number of moves made in cell i during the game. Since the game is finite, only finitely many x_i are nonzero. - The number of beans in cell i at the end, denoted e_i, satisfies: [ (forall i in Z) quad e_i = b_i + x_{i-1} + x_{i+1} - 2 x_i in {0, 1} ] 5. **Uniqueness of Move Counts**: - We need to show that given b_i geq 0, the sequence {x_i}_{i in Z} of nonnegative integers satisfying the above condition is unique. - Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists at least one sequence {b_i} for which there are distinct sequences {x_i} and {x_i'} satisfying the condition. - Among these configurations, choose one for which min left{sum_{i in Z} x_i, sum_{i in Z} x_i'right} is minimal (since sum_{i in Z} x_i is finite). 6. **Contradiction in Configuration**: - Choose any index j such that b_j > 1. Such an index j must exist because if there were no such index, the game would already be over. - This implies at least one move must be made in cell j, meaning x_j, x_j' geq 1. - However, the sequences {x_i} and {x_i'}, with x_j and x_j' decreased by 1, would still satisfy the condition for a sequence {b_i} where b_{j-1}, b_{j}, b_{j+1} are replaced by b_{j-1}+1, b_{j}-2, b_{j+1}+1. This contradicts the assumption of the minimality of min left{sum_{i in Z} x_i, sum_{i in Z} x_i'right} for the initial configuration {b_i}.

Observe that it can be factored as follows: [ n^5 - n = n(n^4 - 1) ] Notice that ( n^4 - 1 ) can be further factored into difference of squares: [ n^4 - 1 = (n^2 + 1)(n^2 - 1) = (n^2 + 1)(n-1)(n+1) ] Therefore: [ n^5 - n = n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2 + 1) ] 2. Consider the product ( n(n-1)(n+1) ). These three terms are three consecutive integers. Among any three consecutive integers, there is always: - At least one multiple of 2 (since every second number is even), - At least one multiple of 3 (since every third number is divisible by 3). Thus, the product ( n(n-1)(n+1) ) is divisible by 6. 3. Next, show that ( n^5 - n ) is divisible by 5 as well. Consider ( n mod 5 ): - If ( n equiv 0 pmod{5} ): Then ( n^5 - n = 0 - 0 = 0 equiv 0 pmod{5} ), - If ( n equiv 1 pmod{5} ): Then ( n^5 - n = 1^5 - 1 = 0 equiv 0 pmod{5} ), - If ( n equiv 2 pmod{5} ): Then ( n = 5m + 2 ). Hence ( (5m + 2)^2 + 1 ) calculation: [ (5m + 2)^2 + 1 = 25m^2 + 20m + 4 + 1 = 25m^2 + 20m + 5 equiv 0 pmod{5} ] - If ( n equiv 3 pmod{5} ): Then ( n = 5m - 2 ). A similar calculation: [ (5m - 2)^2 + 1 = 25m^2 - 20m + 4 + 1 = 25m^2 - 20m + 5 equiv 0 pmod{5} ] - If ( n equiv 4 pmod{5} ): Then ( n^5 - n = 4^5 - 4 = 1024 - 4 = 1020 equiv 0 pmod{5} ). Therefore, in all cases, ( n^2 + 1 equiv 0 pmod{5} ). 4. Combining our results from steps 2 and 3, we note that ( n^5 - n ) contains the factors 2, 3, and 5. Hence, ( n^5 - n ) is divisible by: [ 2 times 3 times 5 = 30 ] 5. Finally, verifying that 30 is indeed the greatest integer that always divides every term in the sequence. For instance: [ 2^5 - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30 ] Thus, any term in the series ( n^5 - n ) is divisible by 30. Conclusion: [ boxed{30} ]"},{"prompt":"The number N is between 11 and 19.

The possible pairs (A, B) that satisfy this condition are (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 5), and (9, 4). Next, we need to check which of these pairs form a two-digit number that is divisible by 4. We test each pair: - 49: Not divisible by 4. - 58: Not divisible by 4. - 67: Not divisible by 4. - 76: Divisible by 4. - 85: Not divisible by 4. - 94: Not divisible by 4. Therefore, the only pair that satisfies both conditions (sum of digits is 13 and the number formed is divisible by 4) is (7, 6). To find the product of the last two digits, we calculate A cdot B = 7 cdot 6. This gives us: [A cdot B = 7 cdot 6 = 42] Thus, the product of the last two digits is boxed{42}."},{"prompt":"Factor completely over the set of polynomials with integer coefficients: [9(x + 4)(x + 5)(x + 11)(x + 13) 7x^2.]","completion":"First, we multiply the factors (x + 4) and (x + 13) to get: [(x + 4)(x + 13) = x^2 + 17x + 52.] Next, we multiply the factors (x + 5) and (x + 11) to get: [(x + 5)(x + 11) = x^2 + 16x + 55.] Let (u = x^2 + 16x + 55).

The pyramid consists of a base which is an n-sided polygon, and n triangular lateral faces (sides). We need to determine the maximum number of these lateral faces that can be perpendicular to the base. 2. **Initial Observation:** Notice that if we have a face of the pyramid perpendicular to the base, it implies the plane containing that triangle is perpendicular to the plane of the base. Consequently, the line of intersection of this face with any adjacent face must also be perpendicular to the base. 3. **Perpendicularity Condition:** Consider if two adjacent plane faces are both perpendicular to the base. The line of intersection of these two planes, which is a lateral edge of the pyramid, must also be perpendicular to the base. This lateral edge will act as the height of the pyramid, as it is perpendicular to the base. 4. **Implications of the Above Condition:** Given that each edge belongs to exactly two faces, the perpendicularity cannot be extended beyond one pair of adjacent faces without violating this condition. Each edge shared by two perpendicular faces is already the height of the pyramid, so only one pair can satisfy the condition. 5. **Case Analysis Based on Even and Odd n:** - **When n is Even:** If n is even, we can systematically analyze the arrangement. Assume we try to have more than n/2 faces perpendicular to the base. Given that each perpendicular face must result in its adjacent sides also attempting to be perpendicular, we end up with a configuration that either loops or repeats itself, making it impossible to achieve more than n/2 perpendicular faces without one edge being shared inappropriately (not possible due to each edge only belonging to 2 faces). Hence, the maximum number of perpendicular faces, if n is even, is n/2. - **When n is Odd:** In the case where n is odd, a similar argument shows that one cannot have more than (n + 1)/2 perpendicular faces, following the logic that the odd count doesn't perfectly allow every face to share perpendicular edges without violating edge use limits. Thus, the maximum number of perpendicular faces, if n is odd, is (n + 1)/2. 6. **Conclusion:** The maximum number of lateral faces that can be perpendicular to the base of an n-sided pyramid are: - frac{n}{2} if n is even. - frac{(n + 1)}{2} if n is odd. boxed{begin{cases} frac{n}{2} & text{if } n text{ is even} frac{(n + 1)}{2} & text{if } n text{ is odd} end{cases}}"},{"prompt":"A tendigit integer is formed by repeating a positive fivedigit integer thrice.

Hence, the statement is trivially true. 2. **Step 1: Choosing an Edge and Defining Δ:** Assume k geq 1. Let (a, b) be an edge of G, and let Delta be the number of vertices of G connected to both a and b. 3. **Step 2: Contracting the Edge ( (a, b) ):** Let G' be the graph obtained by contracting the edge (a, b), i.e., identifying vertices a and b into a single vertex, leading to a graph with k - (Delta + 1) edges. 4. **Step 3: Applying the Induction Hypothesis:** By the induction hypothesis, G' has at least k - (Delta + 1) partitions into connected sets. Each partition in G' can be extended to a partition of G by replacing the identified vertex with a and b. 5. **Step 4: Constructing Additional Partitions:** Independently, we can construct 2^{Delta} partitions of G by separating a and b into different parts and distributing their common neighbors (Delta vertices) between the two parts. 6. **Step 5: Counting Partitions:** We have k - (Delta + 1) partitions from the contraction step and 2^{Delta} additional partitions from separating a and b: [ k - (Delta + 1) + 2^{Delta} ] 7. **Step 6: Verifying the Count:** [ k - (Delta + 1) + 2^{Delta} geq k ] We need to show: [ 2^{Delta} geq Delta + 1 ] Note that the base case Delta = 0, 2^0 = 1 and 0 + 1 = 1, thus it holds.

Prove that after some time, it will be impossible to perform such an operation again.","completion":"We start by considering the scenario in which numbers are written on cards arranged in a row. The robot chooses a pair of consecutive numbers, and if the left number is larger than the right number, it swaps their positions and doubles both numbers. We will demonstrate that eventually making such a swap operation will become impossible. 1. **Initial Assumption**: Let us denote the numbers as a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_n. Suppose that each number is written on a card, and these cards are laid out in a sequence. 2. **Robot's Operation**: The robot performs the following operation: it selects a pair of consecutive numbers (a_i, a_{i+1}) such that a_i > a_{i+1}, swaps them, and doubles both. Hence, the numbers become (2a_{i+1}, 2a_i). 3. **Number of Inversions**: An **inversion** in the sequence is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and a_i > a_j. 4. **Impact of Swapping on Inversions**: Swapping a_i and a_{i+1} reduces the count of inversions in the array, as the inversion involving a_i and a_{i+1} is resolved. 5. **Length of Non-decreasing Sequences**: Consider the number of pairs or inversions resolved on each operation representing the state or order of the cards. The total number of possible swaps is finite and strictly reduces every operation. 6. **Convergence to Fully Non-decreasing Order**: Since each swap strictly decreases the number of inversions, we conclude that the sequence will eventually reach a state where no further swaps are possible. 7. **Formal Argument on Non-reappearance**: - Suppose the contrary. Let a pair (a_i, a_{i+1}) somehow swap back to their original order after certain operations. - When a_i and a_{i+1} swap, they are doubled to 2a_{i+1} and 2a_i, respectively. - Any intermediate operation involves incorporating other numbers into these swaps. - If C intervenes between A and B, changes further disrupt the returning of the reverse state because each swap made with other elements shifts the pairs and reduces potential reversals of swaps. 8. **Contradiction**: - A back-and-forth swap implies that there must be an equivalent series of swaps that restores both numbers to their precise pre-doubled state leading again to comparative A unstably lesser than B, contradictory since one resolution turns order non-decreasing and thus terminates the process eventually. **Conclusion**: Hence, the sequence cannot have any more swaps made at some point as it naturally resolves conflicting larger-left-pair swaps transforming every sequence into a fully non-decreasing sequence — validating no further operational swaps by the robot will be feasible: Thus, we have shown the finite and completing aspect of the robot's task outlined. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The diameter ( AB ) and the chord ( CD ) intersect at point ( M ).

Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation of the given solution: 1. **Coordinate Representation:** - We start by representing the voting process on a coordinate plane. - Let (O(0, 0)) be the origin. - Each vote for 甲 can be represented as a step to the right and up, increasing both coordinates by 1 (i.e., a move to ((1, 1))). - Each vote for 乙 is represented as a step to the right and down, where the x-coordinate increases by 1, but the y-coordinate decreases by 1 (i.e., a move to ((1, -1))). 2. **Path Description:** - The total number of votes is (m+n) (where (m > n)), and the final position of the path is (P(m+n, m-n)). - We need to find out the number of paths from the origin (O) to the point (P), such that at no point does candidate 甲 have fewer votes than candidate 乙. 3. **Strictly Leading Condition:** - For candidate 甲 to always be leading, any intermediate path's y-coordinate should never fall to zero or become negative after voting starts. This means that we must avoid any point that intersects with or goes below the x-axis. 4. **Reflection Principle and Count Adjustment:** - To avoid paths falling below the (x)-axis, we use the reflection principle in combinatorics. 5. Listen intersection above X-axis: - Considering this condition, the valid paths from ((0,0)) to ( (m+n, m-n)) must form a 1-1 injection (bijection) with valid paths reaching from ((0,0)) to ((m+n, m-n)) without intersecting the (x)-axis except at ((0,0)). 6. **Catalan Path Calculation:** - These paths can be counted using the Catalan number combinatory which counts dyck paths or strictly positive paths: [ C_k = frac{1}{k+1} binom{2k}{k} ] 7. **Final Solution:** - However, given that we need ( P(m+n, m-n) ): - We use the solution form provided: [ text{Number of Valid Paths} = frac{m - n }{m + n } binom{m+n}{m}. ] 8. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{frac{m-n}{m+n} binom{m+n}{m}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a square with a side length of 10.

The second drain removes water at a rate of 1 kiloliter every 6 minutes, which is equivalent to approximately 0.1667 kiloliters per minute.

Therefore, the increasing interval of the function f(x) is [frac{1}{2},+infty), and the decreasing interval is (0,frac{1}{2}).

Let's break down the calculation into steps, multiplying i by each term inside the parentheses: z = i cdot 1 + i cdot i = i + i^2. Recalling that i^2 = -1, we substitute this into the equation: z = -1 + i. Therefore, the point corresponding to z has coordinates (-1, 1). Since the point is to the left of the y-axis (negative x-coordinate) and above the x-axis (positive y-coordinate), the point lies in the second quadrant. Hence, the correct option is: boxed{B}.

We will color the edges using two colors: black and white. 2. **Inductive Step:** Consider any edge a in the graph G connecting vertices v_1 and v_2. By the induction hypothesis, we assume that the graph G setminus {a} (the graph obtained by removing the edge a but not the vertices v_1 and v_2) can be colored in two colors such that each cycle contains edges of both colors. 3. **Coloring the Edge a:** Color the edge a black. Now, the graph G has no white cycles and exactly one black cycle (if any). 4. **Definitions:** Let E^{circ}(G) denote the number of white edges in G and E^{bullet}(G) denote the number of black edges in G. Denote by G^{circ} and G^{bullet} the subgraphs induced by the white and black edges, respectively. 5. **Procedure textbf{Proc}:** - **Step 1:** Identify a black cycle mathbf{C} := mathbf{C}_0 and consider any edge e_0 in mathbf{C}. - **Step 2:** Recolor the edge e_0 white. Now, there are no black cycles in G. If there is no white cycle passing through e_0, the problem is solved, and the algorithm stops. - **Step 3:** If there is a white cycle mathbf{C}_1 passing through e_0, consider any edge e_1 in mathbf{C}_1. - **Step 4:** Recolor the edge e_1 black.

Consider the subgraph G^* of G consisting of all edges considered by the procedure textbf{Proc}. After a large number of steps, we obtain a coloring mathcal{C} of G^* in black and white. The lemma states that the induced subgraphs G_{mathcal{C}}^{bullet} and G_{mathcal{C}}^{circ} are connected. 7. **Contradiction:** If the main problem is not true for G, then there exists a subgraph G^* of G and its two connected subgraphs G_{mathcal{C}}^{bullet} and G_{mathcal{C}}^{circ} such that E(G^*) = E(G_{mathcal{C}}^{bullet}) + E(G_{mathcal{C}}^{circ}) and |G_{mathcal{C}}^{bullet}| = |G_{mathcal{C}}^{circ}| = |G|. From the construction of G_{mathcal{C}}^{bullet} and G_{mathcal{C}}^{circ}, one of these graphs must contain a cycle.

Since each vertex is connected by 3 edges, removing these vertices will also remove at least 3 edges. - Therefore, ( k ge 3 ge ell ), which implies ( ell le k ). 4. **Considering the case ( k = 1 ):** - If ( k = 1 ), removing one vertex disconnects the graph.
