D: P(AB)=frac{1}{3}","completion":"To analyze the relationship between events A and B, we need to consider the definition of each type of event mentioned. 1. **Complementary Events**: Two events are complementary if the occurrence of one event means the other cannot occur. Since event A (the first coin is heads up) and event B (the second coin is tails up) can both occur simultaneously (for example, if the outcome is heads for the first coin and tails for the second), they are not complementary. 2. **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time. Given that both A and B can occur together (as illustrated in the scenario where the first coin shows heads and the second shows tails), they are not mutually exclusive. 3. **Independent Events**: Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other. In this case, the result of the first coin flip does not influence the result of the second coin flip, making A and B independent events. This aligns with option C. 4. **Calculation of P(AB)**: To further confirm our understanding, we calculate the probability of both A and B occurring. Since A and B are independent, P(AB) = P(A) cdot P(B). Given that the probability of heads or tails for a fair coin is frac{1}{2}, [P(AB) = P(A) cdot P(B) = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{4}] This calculation disproves option D, which incorrectly states P(AB) = frac{1}{3}. Therefore, the correct answer based on our analysis is C, indicating that events A and B are independent events.

First, let's find the remainder when 113^113 is divided by 137. Since 113 and 137 are both prime numbers and 113 < 137, we know that 113 is not a multiple of 137. Therefore, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p). In our case, p = 137 and a = 113. So we have: 113^(137-1) ≡ 1 (mod 137) Now, 113^113 is not exactly in the form of Fermat's Little Theorem, but we can break it down as follows: 113^113 = (113^(136)) * 113 Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that: 113^(136) ≡ 1 (mod 137) Therefore: 113^113 ≡ 1 * 113 (mod 137) 113^113 ≡ 113 (mod 137) Now, let's add 113 to both sides: 113^113 + 113 ≡ 113 + 113 (mod 137) 113^113 + 113 ≡ 226 (mod 137) Now we need to find the remainder when 226 is divided by 137: 226 = 137 * 1 + 89 So the remainder is 89.

Differentiating f(x) with respect to x yields: f'(x) = -2x + 3 - frac{1}{x} = -frac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{x}. From f'(x) > 0, we get that frac{1}{2} < x < 1. From f'(x) < 0, we deduce that 1 < x < 2. Hence, the function f(x) is increasing on the interval left(frac{1}{2}, 1right) and decreasing on the interval (1, 2). Since the function has only one critical point at x=1, this point must be the maximum on the interval. Therefore, the maximum value on the interval left[frac{1}{2}, 2right] is f(1) = 2. To find the minimum value, we compare fleft(frac{1}{2}right) and f(2): f(2) - fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = frac{3}{4} - ln 4 < 0 Thus, f(2) < fleft(frac{1}{2}right), and the minimum value of the function on the interval left[frac{1}{2}, 2right] is f(2) = 2 - ln 2. (2) Given f(x) = ax^2 + bx - ln x and taking the derivative, we get: f'(x) = 2ax + b - frac{1}{x}. For a > 0, setting f'(x) = 0 gives us the quadratic equation 2ax^2 + bx - 1 = 0.

On the interval left(frac{-b + sqrt{b^2 + 8a}}{4a}, +inftyright), the derivative is positive, and the function is increasing. Since the function reaches its minimum at x=1, it follows that x_2, the only point of local minimum, must be equal to 1: frac{-b + sqrt{b^2 + 8a}}{4a} = 1. Rearranging this, we obtain 2a + b = 1, or equivalently b = 1 - 2a. Let g(x) = 2 - 4x + ln x. Differentiating g(x), we get: g'(x) = frac{1 - 4x}{x}.

However, this contradicts the original functional equation unless ( f(x) = pm 1 ), which is not a general solution. 6. **Assume ( f(x) ) is not constant:** If ( f(x) ) is not constant, we need to find a non-trivial solution.

Therefore, we can write: [ (m+n)(m+n-1)cdots(m-n+1) geq n(n-1)cdots1 = n! ] To show that this product is at least ( 2^n n! ), we note that: [ (m+n)(m+n-1)cdots(m-n+1) geq 2^n n! ] This can be seen by induction or by noting that each term ( m+k ) (where ( k ) ranges from ( -n ) to ( n )) is at least 2.

The function ( f(x) ) is continuous in its domain because it is a sum of continuous functions in each interval ( I_i ). 4. Since ( f(x) ) involves sums of strictly decreasing functions ( left(frac{1}{x-1}, frac{2}{x-2}, ldots, frac{70}{x-70}right) ), ( f(x) ) is strictly monotonically decreasing in each interval ( I_i ). 5. In the interval ( I_0 ), the function ( f(x) ) takes only negative values because each term ( frac{k}{x-k} ) is negative for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 70 ). 6.

Thus, each interval ( I_i ) contains exactly one value ( x_i ) such that ( f(x_i) = frac{5}{4} ). 9. Consider the interval ( I_{70} ). As ( x rightarrow +infty ), [ lim_{x rightarrow +infty} f(x) = sum_{k=1}^{70} lim_{x rightarrow +infty} frac{k}{x-k} = 0 ] Therefore, ( f(x) ) in ( I_{70} ) takes all positive values. 10.

We need to find the number of distinct strings that can be formed by reversing some contiguous substring of ( S ). First, let's count the number of ways we can choose a contiguous substring from ( S ). 3. To select a contiguous substring, we choose two positions in the sequence to indicate the start and end of the substring. There are 50 positions (digits) in total. Selecting two positions out of 52 (including the boundaries) to form a substring can be calculated by: [ binom{52}{2} = frac{52 times 51}{2} = 1326 ] Here, (binom{52}{2}) represents the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of the 52 possible positions. 4. Next, we account for overcounting in two scenarios: - **Substrings of length 0 or 1**: These substrings, when reversed, remain the same as the original string, contributing no new variations. - There are 51 possible substrings of length 0 (by choosing two adjacent positions), and 50 possible substrings of length 1. - So, total non-contributing substrings are ( 51 + 50 = 101 ). 5. We should also consider the overcount for other substrings which, when reversed, do not change the sequence. - **Palindromic substrings**: A substring that is the same forward and backward contributes repeated counting. This is complicated to count generally but necessary for complete accuracy. Let us illustrate an overcounting scenario for digit repetitions. Consider every starting and ending digit to be the same, this leads us to repeating the same central digits, hence we look for combinations where: - The ends (digit repeated) contribute ( 10 times binom{5}{2} = 10 times 10 = 100 ) substrings. 6.

Suppose there exists an integer k such that a_{k} < a_{k-1}. This implies that a_{k-1} leq a_{k} - a_{k+1} + a_{k-2} < a_{k+2}. Therefore, starting from a_k, the sequence {a_{n}} would become monotonically increasing.

To start with, let's recall some properties of the parallelogram and the relationships created by the intersections: Step-by-Step Approach: 1. **Observe Similar Triangles**: In parallelograms, the diagonals bisect each other. Hence, the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) of the parallelogram intersect at ( O ), their midpoint. Therefore, ( AK ) intersects ( BC ) and ( CD ) at points ( L ) and ( M ) respectively. 2. **Proportional Relationships**: By observing line segment intersections and the properties of similar triangles formed, we can take into account the intercept theorem (also known as Thales' theorem): [ frac{AK}{KM} = frac{BK}{KD} ] This is due to the fact that ( AK ) is a straight line intersecting ( BC ) and ( CD ). 3. **Interchange and Equality**: Reflecting the proportion from the similar triangles, we also have: [ frac{LK}{AK} = frac{AK}{KM} ] 4. **Solving for (AK)**: Combining the two proportional relationships, we square the ratio to achieve the desired relationship: [ left( frac{AK}{KM} right)^2 = left( frac{LK}{AK} right)^2 ] By transitive property of equality, [ AK^2 = LK cdot KM ] 5. **Conclusion**: Combining these steps and aligning with the properties of parallelogram diagonals and intercept theorem definitions, we arrive at the required proof.

We need to prove that we can always draw a circle with radius (frac{A}{P}) inside this polygon. 2. **Concept**: We will use the idea that each side of a convex polygon can be associated with a rectangle of certain dimensions and show that the overlapping of these rectangles guarantees a distance greater than (frac{A}{P}) from the sides of the polygon. 3. **Step 1**: Construct a series of rectangles. - Consider a convex polygon with vertices (P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n). - For each side of the polygon (P_i P_{i+1}), draw a rectangle of width (frac{A}{P}) inward from the side, where the length of the rectangle is the length of (P_i P_{i+1}). 4. **Step 2**: Analyze the overlap of the rectangles at each vertex. - In a convex polygon, the angle at each vertex is less than 180 degrees. - Therefore, the rectangles drawn from adjacent sides must overlap at the vertex. 5. **Step 3**: Calculate the total area of these rectangles. - Each rectangle has width (frac{A}{P}) and its length is the length of the corresponding side of the polygon. - If the side (P_i P_{i+1}) has length (L_i), the area of the rectangle will be (L_i cdot frac{A}{P}). - Summing the area of all such rectangles for all sides of the polygon: [ sum_{i=1}^n L_i cdot frac{A}{P} = frac{A}{P} sum_{i=1}^n L_i = frac{A}{P} cdot P = A ] - Thus, the total area of all rectangles is (A). 6. **Step 4**: Identify a point inside the polygon that is not covered by the rectangles. - The total area of the convex polygon is (A). - The total area of the rectangles is also (A). - Since the rectangles must overlap at the vertices, the actual total area covered by the rectangles will be less than (A) due to the overlapping regions being counted multiple times. - Consequently, there exists at least one point inside the polygon that is not covered by any of these rectangles. 7. **Conclusion**: - This point, which is not covered by any rectangle, must be at a distance greater than (frac{A}{P}) from each side of the polygon. - Hence, we can use this point as the center of a circle with radius (frac{A}{P}), ensuring the circle fits entirely within the polygon.

Start with the base case: at x = 44 yuan, y = 300 books. 2. For each 1 yuan increase in x, y decreases by 10 books. This gives us the equation: [y = 300 - 10(x - 44)] Simplifying this equation: [y = 300 - 10x + 440] [y = -10x + 740] The cost price of each book is 40 yuan, and the maximum profit margin allowed is 30%.

This means there are consecutive numbers from overline{xyzabc} to overline{xy(z+1)aaa}. - Suppose abc leq xyz, then the ticket overline{xyzxyz} is in the purchased set, automatically making it a lucky ticket since xyzxyz trivially satisfies the condition xyz = xyz. - If abc > xyz, the ticket overline{xy(z+1)xy(z+1)} will be included as there is one increment in z. This ticket will also satisfy xy(z+1) = xy(z+1) and thus is a lucky ticket. - **Case 2: z = 9** - Here, the smallest number would still be overline{xyzabc}, while the largest will cover up to overline{x(y+1)0abc}. - Analogous to the previous case, considering abc leq xyz, the ticket overline{x99x99} will be within the 1001 tickets purchased. - When we have abc > xyz in this scenario, overline{x(y+1)0x(y+1)0} will be a part of those 1001 tickets. 6.

Let the focus be (c,0), and the equation of the asymptote be y = dfrac{b}{a} x, then d = dfrac{|bc|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = b = 1, and b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 1, solving for c gives c = dfrac{sqrt{5}}{2} or sqrt{5}.

First, let's examine if f(x) is an odd function. For any function to be odd, it must satisfy the condition f(-x) = -f(x). For our function, we have: [ f(-x) = sin(-xcos(-x)) = sin(-xcos x) = -sin(xcos x) = -f(x). ] This confirms that f(x) is indeed an odd function, which means conclusion ① is correct. Next, we consider the behavior of f(x) when x is in the interval (0,frac{pi}{2}). In this interval, cos x ranges from 0 to 1, making xcos x also in the interval (0,frac{pi}{2}). Since the sine function is positive in this interval, we have: [ 0 < xcos x < frac{pi}{2} implies sin(xcos x) > 0 implies f(x) > 0. ] Therefore, conclusion ② is correct. To determine if f(x) is a periodic function, we need to check if there exists a period T such that f(x+T) = f(x) for all x. Assuming g(x) = xcos x has a period T, we get: [ (x+T)cos(x+T) = xcos x. ] Setting x=0, we find Tcos T = 0, which leads to T = frac{pi}{2} + n_1pi, where n_1 in mathbb{Z}.

Given that angle BDC is obtuse or right, the result obtained is [ BD = A_1B + A_1C < AB + AC, ] indicating [ AB + BC + CA > 2R. ] 7. **Conclusion:** The perimeter of acute-angled triangle ABC is larger than 2R. Hence, p > 2R. Here, we observe that 2p = 4R Rightarrow p approx 2R, proving the requirement that in an acute-angled triangle ABC, ( p > 2R ).

By symmetry, if the coins were fair, the probabilities of more heads than tails and more tails than heads would be equal; however, the coins are biased towards heads, so we expect the probability of getting more heads than tails to be higher than getting more tails than heads. Let p = dfrac{3}{5} be the probability of flipping heads. We can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probabilities for different counts of heads. The probability of getting exactly k heads out of n flips is given by binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}, where, in this case, n = 10. First, calculate the probability of getting exactly 5 heads (equal heads and tails): [ P(X = 5) = binom{10}{5} (3/5)^5 (2/5)^5 = 252 times left(dfrac{3}{5}right)^5 times left(dfrac{2}{5}right)^5 ] Now we need the summed probabilities for getting 6 to 10 heads (more heads than tails): [ P(text{more heads than tails}) = sum_{k=6}^{10} binom{10}{k} left(dfrac{3}{5}right)^k left(frac{2}{5}right)^{10-k} ] Calculating those: [ begin{align*} P(X = 5) & = 252 cdot (3/5)^5 cdot (2/5)^5 P(X geq 6) & = left[binom{10}{6}(3/5)^6(2/5)^4 + binom{10}{7}(3/5)^7(2/5)^3 + binom{10}{8}(3/5)^8(2/5)^2 & + binom{10}{9}(3/5)^9(2/5)^1 + binom{10}{10}(3/5)^10(2/5)^0right] end{align*} ] Verify and compute exact probabilities, sum them up and use these to solve for x: [ x = 1 - P(X = 5) - P(X < 5) ] Since P(X < 5) = P(X > 5) due to symmetry in a fair coin setup, however as coins are biased, we will sum all instances where heads exceed 5.

This means that if the candidate had scored 35 more marks, he would have just passed the examination. Therefore, the passing mark is also equal to the marks the candidate scored plus the marks he fell short by, which is 65 + 35.

However, ( 2b^2 ) is even, leading to a contradiction. 7. **Case 4: ( gcd(p + a, p - a) = 2 )** - If ( gcd(p + a, p - a) = 2 ), then we can write ( p + a = 2m ) and ( p - a = 2n ) for some integers ( m ) and ( n ) such that ( gcd(m, n) = 1 ). Substituting these into the equation: [ 2b^2 = (2m)(2n) implies b^2 = 2mn ] Since ( b^2 ) is a perfect square, ( mn ) must be twice a perfect square. We consider two subcases: - ( m = x^2 ) and ( n = 2y^2 ) for some integers ( x ) and ( y ): [ p + a = 2x^2 quad text{and} quad p - a = 4y^2 implies p = x^2 + 2y^2 ] - ( m = 2x^2 ) and ( n = y^2 ) for some integers ( x ) and ( y ): [ p + a = 4x^2 quad text{and} quad p - a = 2y^2 implies p = 2x^2 + y^2 ] In both subcases, ( p ) can be expressed as ( p = x^2 + 2y^2 ) or ( p = 2x^2 + y^2 ), which means ( p in A ).

The third attribute, by the condition, must be different for each card, which naturally happens since we are choosing cards with all combinations represented. Thus, the number of ways for this case is calculated as: {3choose 2} cdot 3 cdot 3 = 3 cdot 3 cdot 3 = 27. **Case 3: One of the three attributes is the same.** Here, we choose which one of the three attributes will be the same across all three cards.

The hypotenuse of the triangle will then be a chord of the circle. 2. **Properties of Right Triangles in a Circle**: According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, if a triangle is inscribed in a circle and one of its angles is a right angle, then the hypotenuse of the triangle is the diameter of the circle. This follows from the fact that the angle subtended by a semicircle is always a right angle. Therefore, if ( angle ACB = 90^circ ), where ( C ) is the right angle vertex, point ( C ) must lie on the circumference of the circle. 3. **Constructing the Right Triangle**: - Identify ( A ) and ( B ) as the points through which the legs of the triangle pass. - Draw the diameter of the circle that passes through points ( A ) and ( B ). Let this diameter be the chord of the circle. - Since ( angle ACB = 90^circ ), point ( C ) must lie on the circumference of the circle such that the triangle ( ACB ) has point ( C ) being perpendicular to the line segment ( AB ). 4. **Finding the Intersection Point**: - Describe a circle ( S ) with ( A ) and ( B ) lying on its diameter. - The point ( C ), where ( angle ACB = 90^circ ), must be located at either point of intersection of the circumference of the original circle and the circle ( S ) with diameter ( AB ). - Thus, by identifying these intersection points, we can determine point ( C ). 5. **Final Construction**: - With point ( C ) identified on the circumference of the initial circle, draw lines ( CA ) and ( CB ). - These lines will form the legs of the right triangle passing through points ( A ) and ( B ). 6. **Conclusion**: - The right triangle inscribed in the circle has its vertex at ( C ), satisfying the condition that the legs pass through points ( A ) and ( B ).

Pages 10 through 99 each use 2 digits, so there are 90 pages using 180 digits in total (90 pages * 2 digits/page). 3. The remaining digits are used for pages with 3 digits (100 and above). We've used 9 + 180 = 189 digits so far for pages 1 through 99. The remaining number of digits to be used is 972 - 189 = 783 digits. Since pages 100 and above use 3 digits each, we divide the remaining number of digits by 3 to find the number of pages: 783 digits / 3 digits/page = 261 pages. These 261 pages are the ones from 100 to 360 (since we've already counted up to page 99).

Since the workforce was 60% female, the number of female employees was 0.60E. The company then hired 30 additional male workers, so the total number of employees became E + 30.

This means that the number of female employees, which is still 0.60E, now constitutes 55% of the total workforce.

Finally, look at ( P(5, -3, -2) ): [ f(5) + f(3) + f(2) = frac{f(8) + f(1) + f(7)}{k}. ] This gives a degree four equation in ( k ).

Analyzing Modulo 3: Prime numbers greater than 3 are either of the form (3k + 1) or (3k + 2) for some integer (k), because any integer (n) can be written as (3k), (3k+1), or (3k+2). However, if (n = 3k), then (n) is divisible by 3 and hence, not a prime unless (n = 3). 3. Considering the Forms: - If we have a trio of primes (p, p+2, p+4), their possible forms mod 3 can be analyzed: - Suppose ( p equiv 1 pmod{3} ): - then ( p+2 equiv 1+2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ) which is not a prime unless it is 3 which cannot happen for ( p > 3 ). - Suppose ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ): - then ( p+2 equiv 2+2 equiv 1 pmod{3} ) - and ( p+4 equiv 2+4 equiv 0 pmod{3} ) which is not a prime unless it is 3 which cannot happen for ( p > 3 ). 4.

Therefore, there is no guarantee that there will always be an ( x ) satisfying both inequalities. The answer to part (a) is: [ boxed{text{No}} ] Part (b): Is there always an ( x ) that satisfies the second inequality but does not satisfy the first inequality? To find such an ( x ), we need ( x ) values where: [ a < 2x < a^2 ] but: [ 2 < 2x < 2a ] does not hold. This requires at least one point ( 2x ) to belong to the interval ( (a, a^2) ) and lie outside the interval ( (2, 2a) ). To satisfy these conditions, we consider two cases: 1. **Case a < 2:** - If ( a < 2 ), then the interval ( (a, a^2) ) begins below the lower bound of the interval ( (2, 2a) ). 2. **Case 2a < a^2:** - For this to hold, we rewrite it as ( 2 < a ) since ( a > 1 ). Since ( a neq 2 ) by assumption, one of these conditions will always be satisfied. Therefore, there will always exist some ( x ) that satisfies the second inequality but does not satisfy the first.

Apply the distances to examine which sum is shorter. Without loss of generality, let's assume all segments are of distance equal to 1 for simplicity. So for both distances: [ S_1 = 8 times text{unit distance} ] [ S_2 = 3 times 4 times text{unit distance} = 12 times text{unit distance} ] 8.

We note that (x = 0) is an obvious solution to the equation since (frac{0}{100} = 0 = sin 0). 3.

The points are colored either red or blue. By the pigeonhole principle, since there are at least 5 points and two colors, there must be at least 3 points of the same color. 2. **Existence of a Same-Color Triangle:** Since at least 3 points are of the same color, consider these points forming a set of same-colored points. Denote this set of points of the same color as ( R = { A, B, C, ldots } ). 3. **Non-Collinear Condition:** The problem states that any three points of the same color do not lie on a single line.

Let ( X ), ( Y ), and ( Z ) be points such that: - ( X ) lies on ( AB ) - ( Y ) lies on ( BC ) - ( Z ) lies on ( CA ) - These points ( X, Y, Z ) must exist by our assumption. 6. **Contradiction:** If such points ( X, Y, Z ) exist on the sides of ( triangle ABC ), consider the triangles formed by these points and the vertices of ( triangle ABC ): - Triangles ( triangle AXC ), ( triangle BYA ), and ( triangle CZB ) One of these smaller triangles must be of the same color as ( triangle ABC ), strictly forming a smaller triangle of the same color ( R ). This contradicts our earlier selection of ( triangle ABC ) as being the smallest area triangle with vertices of the same color. 7. **Conclusion:** Due to the contradiction, it must be the case that not all sides of ( triangle ABC ) contain points of the other color.

Assume ((x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n, y_1, ldots, y_n)) is the minimal case. Since it is minimal, any perturbation should not decrease (sum_{i=1}^n (x_i y_i - x_i y_{n+1-i})). 2. **Perturbation Analysis**: Consider perturbing three values (x_a > x_b > x_c) while maintaining the conditions: [ x_a + x_b + x_c = text{constant} quad text{and} quad x_a^2 + x_b^2 + x_c^2 = text{constant}. ] This is the intersection of a plane and a sphere, which forms a circle or a point. Since (x_a > x_b > x_c), the intersection is a circle. The endpoints of the arc on this circle are the points where (x_a) is maximal and (x_c) is minimal. 3. **Behavior on the Circle**: On the circle, any permutation of ((x_a, x_b, x_c)) is also on the circle. For any non-zero coefficients (p, q, r, s), the expression (p x_a + q x_b + r x_c ge s) forms an arc of the circle. Let (z_i = y_i - y_{n+1-i}). Since (z_a ge z_b ge z_c), unless (z_a = z_b = z_c), we have: [ z_a x_a + z_b x_b + z_c x_c > z_a x_c + z_b x_b + z_c x_a. ] Therefore, the minimum is obtained on the boundary of the arc of possible ((x_a, x_b, x_c)). 4. **Reduction to Two Values**: Assume there are more than three distinct values for (x_i). Let (x_1 = ldots = x_a > x_{a+1} = ldots = x_{a+b} > ldots > x_{n-c+1} = ldots = x_n).

The boundary points are where (alpha = beta) and (beta = gamma). 5. **Minimization on the Boundary**: To minimize (palpha + qbeta + rgamma) with (p/a ge q/b ge r/c), consider the tangent vector on the boundary. The tangent vector is perpendicular to ((a, b, c)) and ((aalpha, bbeta, cgamma)). The tangent vector is parallel to ((frac{beta - gamma}{a}, frac{gamma - alpha}{b}, frac{alpha - beta}{c})). At the boundary points, the tangent vector pointing outside the arc has a positive component, leading to a decrease in (palpha + qbeta + rgamma). 6. **Conclusion for Two Values**: For the minimal case, (x_1 = ldots = x_i > x_{i+1} = ldots = x_n) and similarly for (y_i). Then: [ x_1 = frac{n-i}{sqrt{ni(n-i)}}, quad x_n = -frac{i}{sqrt{ni(n-i)}}. ] The value is: [ frac{ni}{sqrt{ij(n-i)(n-j)}}. ] Since (sqrt{frac{i}{n-i}} ge sqrt{frac{1}{n-1}}) and (frac{n}{sqrt{j(n-j)}} ge 2), the minimum is at least (frac{2}{sqrt{n-1}}).

The LCM of 6, 9, 12, and 18 is the smallest number that is divisible by all of these numbers. Let's find the LCM: - The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. - The prime factors of 9 are 3 and 3 (or 3^2). - The prime factors of 12 are 2, 2 (or 2^2), and 3. - The prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3^2.

So, the LCM is 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36. Now, we want the number to leave a remainder of 4 when divided by any of these divisors.

Prove that it is also divisible by 49 .","completion":"To prove that a perfect number greater than 28 and divisible by 7 is also divisible by 49, we will use the properties of perfect numbers and the theorems provided. 1. **Even Perfect Numbers:** According to the Euclid-Euler theorem, if ( n ) is an even perfect number, then ( n = 2^{q-1}(2^q - 1) ), where ( q ) and ( 2^q - 1 ) are prime. - Suppose ( n ) is an even perfect number greater than 28 and divisible by 7. - Since ( n = 2^{q-1}(2^q - 1) ) and ( n ) is divisible by 7, either ( 2^{q-1} ) or ( 2^q - 1 ) must be divisible by 7. - ( 2^{q-1} ) is a power of 2 and cannot be divisible by 7, so ( 2^q - 1 ) must be divisible by 7. - For ( 2^q - 1 equiv 0 pmod{7} ), we need ( 2^q equiv 1 pmod{7} ). The order of 2 modulo 7 is 3, so ( q ) must be a multiple of 3. - Let ( q = 3k ). Then ( 2^q - 1 = 2^{3k} - 1 = (2^3)^k - 1 = 8^k - 1 ). - For ( k geq 1 ), ( 8^k - 1 ) is divisible by 7. For ( k geq 2 ), ( 8^k - 1 ) is also divisible by ( 7^2 = 49 ). - Therefore, if ( n ) is an even perfect number greater than 28 and divisible by 7, it must also be divisible by 49. 2. **Odd Perfect Numbers:** According to Theorem 2, if ( n ) is an odd perfect number, then it is of the form ( p^alpha m^2 ), where ( p equiv alpha equiv 1 pmod{4} ) and ( m, p ) are coprime. - Suppose ( n ) is an odd perfect number greater than 28 and divisible by 7. - Since ( n = p^alpha m^2 ) and ( n ) is divisible by 7, either ( p ) or ( m ) must be divisible by 7. - If ( p = 7 ), then ( alpha ) must be odd and ( 7 equiv 3 pmod{4} ), which contradicts ( p equiv 1 pmod{4} ). - Therefore, ( m ) must be divisible by 7. Let ( m = 7k ). - Then ( n = p^alpha (7k)^2 = p^alpha 49k^2 ), which is divisible by 49. - Therefore, if ( n ) is an odd perfect number greater than 28 and divisible by 7, it must also be divisible by 49.

The book costs 25 and has a 10% discount, so the discount amount is: 25 * 10% = 25 * 0.10 = 2.50 The discounted price of the book is: 25 - 2.50 = 22.50 The pen costs 4 and has a 5% discount, so the discount amount is: 4 * 5% = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 The discounted price of the pen is: 4 - 0.20 = 3.80 Now, let's calculate the total cost of all items after the discounts: Book: 22.50 Pen: 3.80 Ruler: 1 Notebook: 8 Pencil case: 6 Total cost after discounts = 22.50 + 3.80 + 1 + 8 + 6 = 41.30 Next, we apply the 6% sales tax to the total amount after discounts: Sales tax = 41.30 * 6% = 41.30 * 0.06 = 2.478 Since we generally round to the nearest cent, the sales tax is: 2.48 Now, let's add the sales tax to the total cost after discounts to get the final amount Jay has to pay: Final amount = 41.30 + 2.48 = 43.78 Jay paid with a hundred-dollar bill, so the change he should get back is: Change = 100 - 43.78 = 56.22 Therefore, Jay got boxed{56.22} in change."},{"prompt":"Let a_1, a_2, dots, a_{2020} be the roots of the polynomial [x^{2020} + x^{2019} + dots + x^2 + x 2023 = 0.]Compute [sum_{n = 1}^{2020} frac{1}{1 a_n}.]","completion":"Let b_n = frac{1}{1 - a_n}.

Show that the diagonals ( A_{1} A_{3}, A_{3} A_{5}, A_{5} A_{1} ) and ( A_{2} A_{4}, A_{4} A_{6}, A_{6} A_{2} ) define a regular hexagon. How does the area of this smaller hexagon compare to the area of the given hexagon?","completion":"1. **Illustrating the Regular Hexagon and Its Diagonals:** Let's begin by considering a regular hexagon A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5A_6. In this hexagon, A_{1}A_{3}, A_{3}A_{5}, A_{5}A_{1} are diagonals, and similarly, A_{2}A_{4}, A_{4}A_{6}, A_{6}A_{2} are other diagonals of the hexagon. 2. **Recognizing Equilateral Triangles:** Notice that the triangles A_{1}A_{3}A_{5} and A_{2}A_{4}A_{6} are equilateral triangles because they span three vertices of the regular hexagon, where every internal angle of the hexagon is 120^circ. So each side within these triangles is a diagonal that skips one vertex of the hexagon, hence forming equilateral triangles. 3. **Defining Points of Intersection:** Let's denote the points of intersection of these diagonals as B_{1}, B_{2}, dots, B_{6}, occurring in cyclic order around the center of the hexagon. 4. **Considering Pairwise Equilateral Triangles:** We will now show that each intersection forms an equilateral triangle with its adjacent intersections: A_1B_1B_6, A_2B_2B_1, A_{3}B_{3}B_{2}, A_{4}B_{4}B_{3}, A_{5}B_{5}B_{4}, and A_{6}B_{6}B_{5}. Each of these triangles is also equilateral: - For A_1B_1B_6: B_{1} and B_{6} are formed by the intersections of diagonals passing through A_{1}. Due to symmetry and the equal lengths between vertices in the regular hexagon, A_1B_1 = B_1 B_6 = A_1 B_6. Repeating this logic for all other points, we can similarly show that all such triangles are equilateral. 5. **Measuring Equal Lengths:** Since all adjacent intersection points are equidistant from each other and the same proportionate distance from the originating vertices, we conclude: [ B_{1} B_{2} = B_{2} B_{3} = B_{3} B_{4} = B_{4} B_{5} = B_{5} B_{6} = B_{6} B_{1} ] 6. **Measuring Angles and Formation of Regular Hexagon:** The angle between any two adjacent lines from B_i's intersection forms an inner angle of 120^circ for a regular hexagon: [ angle B_{2} B_{3} B_{4} = 180^circ - angle B_{3} A_{3} A_{4} - angle B_{3} A_{4} A_{3} = 180^circ - 30^circ - 30^circ = 120^circ ] This similar property will hold for all internal angles, confirming that B_{1} B_{2} B_{3} B_{4} B_{5} B_{6} forms a regular hexagon. 7. **Area Ratio Calculation:** To find the ratio of the areas of these two hexagons, let's consider the area of one smaller triangle to that of the larger triangle formed in the original hexagon: [ frac{text{Area of smaller hexagon}}{text{Area of larger hexagon}} = left(frac{text{Side of smaller hexagon}}{text{Side of larger hexagon}}right)^2 ] 8. **Measuring Sides Using Sine Functions:** Using trigonometric ratios related to the formed angles: [ sin(30^circ) = frac{1}{2}, quad sin(60^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] The smaller triangle side B_1B_2: [ frac{B_1B_2}{A_{1}A_{2}} = frac{sin(30^circ)}{sin(60^circ)} = frac{frac{1}{2}}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ] Hence, [ left(frac{B_1B_2}{A_1A_2}right)^2 = left(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)^2 = frac{1}{3} ] So the ratio of areas is: [ frac{text{Area of smaller hexagon}}{text{Area of original hexagon}} = left(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)^2 = frac{1}{3} ] [ boxed{frac{1}{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let A_1C_2B_1A_2C_1B_2 be an equilateral hexagon.

In this case, triangle A_1B_1C_1 and triangle A_2B_2C_2 share the same nine-point center, so clearly overline{O_1O_2} parallel overline{H_1H_2}. 3. **Homothety and Perpendicularity**: Otherwise, let K = overline{X_1X_2} cap overline{Y_1Y_2} cap overline{Z_1Z_2}, and denote omega_1 = (X_1Y_1Z_1) and omega_2 = (X_2Y_2Z_2).

Thus, the perspectrix of triangle X_1Y_1Z_1 and triangle X_2Y_2Z_2 is the radical axis of omega_1 and omega_2, which is perpendicular to overline{N_1N_2}. **Claim**: N_1, N_2, S_1, and S_2 are collinear. **Proof**: By Sondat's theorem on triangle X_1Y_1Z_1 and triangle X_2Y_2Z_2, K, S_1, and S_2 are collinear on a line perpendicular to the radical axis of omega_1 and omega_2; in other words, overline{KS_1S_2} parallel overline{N_1N_2}.

Solving this inequality gives m geq -frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the range of real numbers m for which the given condition holds is [-frac{1}{2}, +infty).

Thus, the age of Jean is given by: [ text{Age of Jean} = 1979 - (1000m + 100c + 10d + u) ] 3. The age of Jacques, born in the same year, is: [ text{Age of Jacques} = 1979 - (1000m' + 100c' + 10d' + u') ] 4.

Using this relation, rewrite the difference formula: [ text{Difference} = 999(m - m') + 99(c - c') + 9(d - d') ] 8. This expression is clearly divisible by 9. Since the ages of Jean and Jacques, starting with the same digit, imply the difference in their ages must be less than 10, the only possible value divisible by 9 is: [ text{Difference} = 9 ] # Conclusion: The difference in their ages is 9 years.

A 6×6 square has been tiled by 18 dominoes.

Each vertex ( v_i ) corresponds to row ( i ) of the square. An edge between vertices ( v_i ) and ( v_j ) represents a vertical domino that spans rows ( i ) and ( j ). 2. **Degree of Vertices:** Note that each vertex ( v_i ) in this graph has an even degree because each row must be completely covered by dominoes, and each domino covers exactly two squares. Therefore, the number of vertical dominoes touching any row must be even. 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume for contradiction that there is no line that divides the square into two parts, each of which is tiled by dominoes. This implies that the degrees of the vertices must satisfy certain conditions: - (deg v_1 geq 2) - By induction, (deg v_j geq 4) for (2 leq j leq 5) - (deg v_6 geq 2) 4. **Counting Vertically Aligned Dominoes:** Summing the degrees of all vertices, we get: [ deg v_1 + deg v_2 + deg v_3 + deg v_4 + deg v_5 + deg v_6 geq 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 20 ] Since each edge is counted twice (once for each vertex it connects), the total number of vertical dominoes is at least: [ frac{20}{2} = 10 ] 5. **Counting Horizontally Aligned Dominoes:** By symmetry, the same argument applies to the columns of the square. Therefore, there must also be at least 10 horizontally aligned dominoes. 6. **Contradiction:** Adding the minimum number of vertical and horizontal dominoes, we get: [ 10 + 10 = 20 ] However, the problem states that there are only 18 dominoes in total. This contradiction implies that our initial assumption (that there is no line dividing the square into two parts each tiled by dominoes) must be false. 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, there must exist a line that divides the 6×6 square into two parts, each of which is also tiled by dominoes.

We are allowed to change the state of any three successive switches that all point in different directions to a new direction. 2. **Height Function Definition:** For each given configuration of switches, define the \\"height\\" of a configuration as the product of all indices ( n ) where switches ( n ) and ( n - 1 ) point in the same direction. If no such pairs exist, the height is defined as 1. This height is represented as a positive integer. 3. **Height Function Behavior:** We claim that with every valid operation (turning three successive switches that all point in different directions), the \\"height\\" always increases. 4. **Analyzing the Impact of an Operation:** Consider operating on switches ( n, n + 1, n + 2 ). Initially, switches ( n - 1 ) and ( n ) might point in the same direction, as might ( n + 2 ) and ( n + 3 ). Performing the operation does not affect any other pairs except potentially these nearby pairs. 5. **Impact on Height Calculation:** Let ( h ) be the current height before the operation and ( h' ) the height after the operation. Before the operation, - If switches ( n - 1 ) and ( n ) point in the same direction, and switches ( n + 2 ) and ( n + 3 ) also point in the same direction, then these pairs contribute to the height. After the operation, - The pairs ( (n, n + 1) ) and ( (n + 1, n + 2) ) now point in the same direction and will contribute to the height. - Therefore, we need to compare the change in contribution from the pairs ( (n - 1, n) ), ( (n + 2, n + 3) ) and the new pairs ( (n, n + 1) ), ( (n + 1, n + 2) ). 6. **Height Comparison Formula:** [ h' geq h cdot frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{n(n+3)} ] This simplifies to: [ h' geq h cdot frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{n^2 + 3n} ] 7. **Confirmation of Increase:** Notice that: [ frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{n^2 + 3n} = 1 + frac{2}{n^2 + 3n} > 1 ] Thus: [ h' > h ] implying that the height, ( h ), increases with every operation. 8. **Conclusion:** Since the height ( h ) increases with each operation and is bounded by the factorial ( 1 times 2 times cdots times k ), the number of possible increases is finite.

We'll analyze the two possible cases for the angles of the isosceles triangle: --- Case 1: (alpha = beta) 1. Since the triangle is isosceles with (alpha = beta), the remaining angle (gamma) is (180^circ - 2alpha): [ gamma = 180^circ - 2alpha. ] 2. Substitute these values into the given equation: [ 2 sin^2 alpha = sin gamma = sin(180^circ - 2 alpha). ] 3. Using the trigonometric identity for sine of a supplementary angle ((sin(180^circ - x) = sin x)), we have: [ sin(180^circ - 2alpha) = sin 2alpha. ] 4. Therefore, the equation becomes: [ 2 sin^2 alpha = sin 2alpha. ] 5. Using the double-angle identity for sine ((sin 2alpha = 2 sin alpha cos alpha)), we get: [ 2 sin^2 alpha = 2 sin alpha cos alpha. ] 6. Dividing both sides by 2 and assuming (sin alpha neq 0), we find: [ sin alpha = cos alpha. ] 7. This equality holds if and only if (alpha = 45^circ) (since (sin 45^circ = cos 45^circ = frac{sqrt{2}}{2})). So we get: [ alpha = beta = 45^circ. ] 8. The remaining angle (gamma) will be: [ gamma = 180^circ - 2 times 45^circ = 90^circ. ] Therefore, in this case, the angles of the triangle are: [ alpha = beta = 45^circ, quad gamma = 90^circ. ] --- Case 2: (alpha = gamma) 1. In an isosceles triangle, if (alpha = gamma), then: [ beta = 180^circ - 2alpha. ] 2. Substituting these values into the given equation: [ sin^2 alpha + sin^2 beta = sin alpha. ] 3. Substitute (beta = 180^circ - 2alpha) and use the identity (sin(180^circ - x) = sin x): [ beta = sin^2 alpha + sin^2 (2alpha) = sin alpha. ] 4. Using the double-angle identity (sin 2alpha = 2 sin alpha cos alpha), we get: [ sin^2 alpha + (2 sin alpha cos alpha)^2 = sin alpha. ] 5. Simplifying further: [ sin^2 alpha + 4 sin^2 alpha cos^2 alpha = sin alpha. ] 6. Use the Pythagorean identity (cos^2 alpha = 1 - sin^2 alpha): [ sin^2 alpha + 4 sin^2 alpha (1 - sin^2 alpha) = sin alpha. ] 7.

These counts are ensured to be even to satisfy the problem condition. 3. **Summing Up Birds Between the First and the Last of the Same Species**: - The total number of birds between (A_1) and (A_3) would be: [ 2x + 2y + 1 ] Here, the (+1) accounts for the bird (A_2) sitting between (A_1) and (A_3). - This sum (2x + 2y + 1) is clearly an *odd number*. 4. **Contradiction**: - Since we have derived that there would be an odd number of birds between (A_1) and (A_3), this contradicts the given condition that between any two birds of the same species, there must be an *even* number of birds. - Therefore, it is impossible to have three or more birds of the same species. 5. **Determining the Minimum Number of Species**: - Given the above condition, each species can only have up to 2 birds. - To find the minimum number of species required, we set (s) as the total number of species. Each species can at most have 2 birds. 6. **Calculation**: - Let (s) be the number of species, then the maximum number of birds for (s) species is (2s). - We need these (2s) birds to be equal to or greater than 2021 to cover the total number of birds. [ 2s geq 2021 implies s geq frac{2021}{2} = 1010.5 ] - Since (s) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number: [ s = 1011 ] 7. **Conclusion**: - The minimum number of species required so that no two birds of the same species have an odd number of birds between them is: [ boxed{1011} ]"},{"prompt":"Two junior high school students were allowed to participate in a chess competition held by high school students.

Let's define F(x) = f'(x) = a(e^{x}-1)-frac{1}{x+1}+1. Then, we find the second derivative of F(x): F'(x) = ae^{x}+frac{1}{(x+1)^2}. Given that a geqslant 0, we can see that F'(x) > 0 for all x > -1. This implies that F(x) = f'(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (-1, +infty). Since f'(0) = a(1-1)-frac{1}{1}+1 = 0, we know that f'(x) < 0 for x in (-1,0) and f'(x) > 0 for x in (0, +infty). This means f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (-1,0) and monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). Given that f(0) = a(1-0-1)-ln(1)+0 = 0, we conclude that f(x) has a unique zero at x=0. **Part (2):** From the given condition f(x_{1}) = g(x_{1}) - g(x_{2}), we have: ln(x_{1}+1) + a(x_{1}+1) = ae^{x_{2}} + x_{2}. If x_{1} satisfies the equation ln(x+1) + a(x+1) = b, then ln(x_{1}+1) satisfies the equation ae^{x} + x = b. Since both m(x) = ln(x+1) + a(x+1) and n(x) = ae^{x} + x are monotonically increasing functions, it follows that x_{2} = ln(x_{1}+1). Thus, we have: x_{1} - 2x_{2} = x_{1} - 2ln(x_{1}+1).

The standard form of a horizontal hyperbola is frac{{x}^{2}}{a^{2}}-frac{{y}^{2}}{b^{2}}=1, where 2a is the distance between the foci. For our hyperbola, a^2 = 4, so a = 2. 2. **Calculate the Coordinates of the Right Focus (F_1)**: The distance between the center of the hyperbola and each focus is a, and since our hyperbola is centered at the origin, the right focus F_1 is at (a, 0). Substituting a = 2 gives us the coordinates of the right focus as F_1(4, 0). 3. **Analyze the Distance Relationship**: For any point P on the right branch of the hyperbola, the sum of the distances from P to the left focus (F) and from P to point A(1, 4) is given by |PF| + |PA|. According to the properties of a hyperbola, the difference in distances from any point on the hyperbola to the foci is constant and equal to 2a. Therefore, we can express the sum of distances as |PF| + |PA| = 2a - |PF_1| + |PA|. 4. **Apply the Triangle Inequality**: The Triangle Inequality theorem states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side. Applying this to the distances |PF_1| and |PA|, we get |PF_1| + |PA| geqslant |AF_1|. Rearranging this inequality gives us -|PF_1| + |PA| leqslant |AF_1|. 5. **Calculate the Maximum Value**: Substituting 2a = 4 (since a = 2) into our expression and applying the inequality from step 4, we get |PF| + |PA| leqslant 4 + |AF_1|.

Therefore, |PF| + |PA| leqslant 4 + 5 = 9. 6. **Determine the Minimum Value**: The minimum value of |PF| + |PA| is achieved when A, P, and F are collinear, which corresponds to the maximum value we calculated as 9.

Let's also denote the number of boxes loaded by each worker in the day crew as B. The total number of boxes loaded by the day crew is then D * B. Since each worker on the night crew loaded 3/4 as many boxes as each worker on the day crew, each night crew worker loaded (3/4)B boxes. The total number of boxes loaded by the night crew is then N * (3/4)B. The total number of boxes loaded by both crews is the sum of the boxes loaded by the day crew and the night crew: Total boxes = D * B + N * (3/4)B According to the information given, the day crew loaded 0.7 of all the boxes. This means that the night crew loaded 0.3 of all the boxes (since 1 - 0.7 = 0.3). So we can write two equations based on the proportions: 1. D * B = 0.7 * Total boxes 2. N * (3/4)B = 0.3 * Total boxes We can substitute the expression for Total boxes from the first equation into the second equation: N * (3/4)B = 0.3 * (D * B + N * (3/4)B) Now, let's solve for N/D, the fraction of workers the night crew has compared to the day crew: N * (3/4)B = 0.3 * (D * B) + 0.3 * N * (3/4)B Divide both sides by (3/4)B to isolate N: N = 0.3 * (D * B) / (3/4)B + 0.3 * N N = 0.3 * 4/3 * D + 0.3 * N N = 0.4 * D + 0.3 * N Now, let's isolate N on one side: N - 0.3 * N = 0.4 * D 0.7 * N = 0.4 * D Now, divide both sides by D: (0.7 * N) / D = 0.4 N/D = 0.4 / 0.7 N/D = 4/7 So the fraction of workers the night crew has compared to the day crew is boxed{4/7} ."},{"prompt":"Given that the random variable X follows a normal distribution N(1,2), the values of E(3X+4) and D(3X+4) are respectively ( ).

Let's denote the height of the tower by H. Step-by-step solution: 1. **Express the height in terms of the tangent function**: The height H of the tower can be determined using the tangent of the angle 46^circ: [ H = 100 cdot tan(46^circ) ] 2. **Use the tangent addition formula**: Since 46^circ = 45^circ + 1^circ, we can use the tangent addition formula: [ tan(a + b) = frac{tan(a) + tan(b)}{1 - tan(a) cdot tan(b)} ] Applying this to a = 45^circ and b = 1^circ: [ tan(46^circ) = tan(45^circ + 1^circ) = frac{tan(45^circ) + tan(1^circ)}{1 - tan(45^circ) cdot tan(1^circ)} ] 3. **Substitute known values**: We know that: [ tan(45^circ) = 1 ] Hence, [ tan(46^circ) = frac{1 + tan(1^circ)}{1 - tan(1^circ)} ] 4. **Approximate tan(1^circ)**: For small angles, tan(x) approx x in radians.

Compute ( PI^2 ) and ( QI^2 ): - For point ( P ), we use the distances ( PD ) and ( ID ). Since ( PD = AB - BE ) and ( BE = z ), it follows that ( PD = BC - z ). Therefore: [ PI^2 = PD^2 + ID^2 = (BC - BE)^2 + r^2 = z^2 + r^2 ] - For point ( Q ), we similarly find: [ QI^2 = QD^2 + ID^2 = y^2 + r^2 ] Consequently, the difference is: [ PI^2 - QI^2 = z^2 + r^2 - (y^2 + r^2) = z^2 - y^2 ] 3. Next, consider the powers of ( P ) and ( Q ) relative to the circumscribed circle: - The power of ( P ) with respect to the circumscribed circle, using the relation ( PO^2 - R^2 = PA times PB ), can be written as: [ PO^2 - R^2 = PA times PB = BC times (BC - AB) = (y + z)(z - x) ] - Similarly, the power of ( Q ) gives: [ QO^2 - R^2 = QA times QB = (BC times (BC - AB)) = (y + z)(y - x) ] Therefore, the difference becomes: [ PO^2 - QO^2 = [(y+z)(z-x)] - [(y+z)(y-x)] = (y+z)(z - y) = z^2 - y^2 ] 4. Since both ( PI^2 - QI^2 ) and ( PO^2 - QO^2 ) resulted in the same expression ( z^2 - y^2 ), we conclude that: [ PI^2 - QI^2 = PO^2 - QO^2 ] Thus, it follows that ( (PQ) perp (OI) ).

We need to identify permutations such that: - There is no increasing subsequence of length 3. - There is no decreasing subsequence of length 4. 2. **Defining Increasing and Decreasing Subsequences**: - An increasing subsequence ( w_{i_1}, w_{i_2}, ldots, w_{i_m} ) satisfies ( i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_m ) and ( w_{i_1} < w_{i_2} < cdots < w_{i_m} ). - A decreasing subsequence ( w_{j_1}, w_{j_2}, ldots, w_{j_n} ) satisfies ( j_1 < j_2 < cdots < j_n ) and ( w_{j_1} > w_{j_2} > cdots > w_{j_n} ). 3. **Stating Erdos-Szekeres Theorem**: According to the Erdos-Szekeres theorem, for any permutation of ( w ) of ( {1, 2, ldots, pq + 1} ), either: - The length of the longest increasing subsequence is greater than ( p ), or - The length of the longest decreasing subsequence is greater than ( q ). 4. **Applying to Our Problem**: From the Erdos-Szekeres theorem: - If we want the length of the longest increasing subsequence ( leq 2) (i.e., ( p = 2 )), - And the length of the longest decreasing subsequence ( leq 3) (i.e., ( q = 3 )), Then we need permutations of ( {1, 2, ldots, pq} ), meaning ( 2 times 3 = 6 ), and ( 6 = 2 times 3). 5. **Relating to Young Tableaux**: According to Schensted's proof tied with Young Tableaux and permutations, - The number of exquisite permutations corresponds to the number of ways to fill a ( 2 times 3 ) rectangle with the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, 6 ) such that each row and column is in increasing order. 6. **Calculating Permutations**: - The number of ways to fill the ( 2 times 3 ) rectangle in this manner is the number of standard Young Tableaux for this shape, - The number of such tableaux is 5 (for each shape, using combinatorial arguments or direct enumeration).

We start by considering the concept of self-symmetries of a regular polyhedron. A self-symmetry or isometry is a transformation that maps the polyhedron onto itself preserving the distances and angles between points. 2. For regular polyhedra, each face is identical, and any face can be mapped to any other face by some rotation or reflection. 3. Let us analyze the scenario where the faces of the polyhedron are (n)-sided polygons: - There exist (n) possible rotations that map one face onto itself (rotations by (0^circ, frac{360^circ}{n}, frac{2 cdot 360^circ}{n}, ldots, frac{(n-1) cdot 360^circ}{n})). - Similarly, there exist (n) possible reflections (symmetries relative to (n) planes that pass through the center of the face). 4. Consequently, for each face, we thus have (2n) different symmetries (including the identical transformation). 5. The number (2n) is for each individual face. However, in a polyhedron, every face can be mapped onto any other face by some isometry. 6. Mathematically, we define the total number of self-symmetries or isometries (S) of the polyhedron as: [ S = 2 times n times Gamma ] where (Gamma) represents the group of possible mappings of one face to another.

Consider the possibility of these being short diagonals. Each short diagonal forms a triangle with two sides of the heptagon. For example, a short diagonal spanning from vertex A_i to vertex A_{i+2} will form a triangle with sides A_iA_{i+1} and A_{i+1}A_{i+2}. As shown in Figure 1 (not provided in Markdown), a short diagonal only intersects with diagonals originating from the vertex opposite the triangle's base side in this configuration. This implies that not all three short diagonals can intersect at a single interior point without originating from these specific vertices, leading us to an inner contradiction. 3. **Long Diagonals Intersection:** Now, consider the case where three long diagonals intersect at some interior point. Each heptagon has binom{7}{2} - 7 = 14 diagonals, and altogether in our heptagon, there are three long diagonals which need to be considered. 4. **Labelling and Analysis:** Label the vertices of heptagon A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Consider the intersection of three long diagonals BF, CG, and AD. Each connects non-adjacent vertices divided by a specific span pattern. - The diagonal BF includes vertices B and F. - The diagonal CG includes vertices C and G. - We can observe diagonal AD and how it spans across opposite vertices. 5. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** As illustrated in Figure 2 (not provided in Markdown), any such intersection between BF and CG leverages symmetry aspects where they effectively intersect above perpendicular bisectors of shorter spans (sides). This configuration signifies that with BF and CG reflecting across perpendicular lines, the diagonal AE (as another long diagonal example) would not intersect at the same symmetrical internal point as BF and CG, enforcing our primary assumption to fail. Hence, considering both cases of short and long diagonals for symmetry and geometrical alignment, we deduce the impossibility showcased by our proven contradiction. **Conclusion:** No single internal point in a regular heptagon exists through which at least three diagonals can simultaneously pass. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Compute the product of the roots of the equation [2x^3 5x^2 + 4x 35 = 0.]","completion":"Using Vieta's formulas, for a cubic equation ( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 ), the product of the roots (p, q,) and (r) of the polynomial is given by (-d/a).

One of the properties of the regression line is that it always passes through the mean of the x and y values, which are overline{x} and overline{y} respectively. Therefore, by substituting overline{x} into the regression equation, we get overline{y} as a result, which means overline{y}=hat{b}overline{x}+hat{a}. This confirms that choice **A** is correct. **B: The variables x and y have a strong correlation.** - The correlation coefficient r measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The value of r ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 means a perfect positive linear correlation, -1 means a perfect negative linear correlation, and 0 means no linear correlation. A correlation coefficient of -0.8 indicates a strong negative linear correlation because |r| = |-0.8| = 0.8 > 0.75. Therefore, choice **B** is correct due to the strong correlation indicated by the magnitude of r. **C: When x=x_{1}, it is necessary that hat{y}=y_{1}.** - The regression equation hat{y}=hat{b}x+hat{a} provides an estimate of y based on x. However, for any specific value of x, such as x_1, the corresponding hat{y} is an estimate of the average y value for that x value, not necessarily the exact y_1 value. The actual y value can differ from the estimated hat{y} due to the variability of the data. Therefore, it is not necessary that hat{y}=y_{1} when x=x_{1}, making choice **C** incorrect. **D: hat{b} lt 0** - The sign of the correlation coefficient r indicates the direction of the relationship between x and y. A negative r value, such as -0.8, indicates a negative correlation, meaning that as x increases, y tends to decrease. This implies that the slope of the regression line hat{b} is negative, hence hat{b} lt 0. Therefore, choice **D** is correct. Given the analysis above, the correct choices are A, B, and D.

Continue with more prime numbers until a suitable gap is found: [ 53, 59, 61, 67, ldots ] Differences: [ 6, 2, 6, ldots ] From 47 to 53, the difference is 6, not enough for 8. Therefore, we need to include more primes: [ 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, ldots ] Differences: [ 6, 2, 6, 4, 6, 8, ldots ] The difference of 8 occurs between 89 and 97, indicating a sequence of seven consecutive nonprime numbers starting from 90 to 96, inclusive.

This means f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. As f(x) is periodic with a period of 3, we have f(x + 3k) = f(x) for any integer k. Particularly, for x = 1 and k = -1, which is within one period from x = 1, f(1 - 3) = f(1). Since 1 - 3 = -2, we get f(-2) = f(1). Using the property of odd functions: f(-2) = -f(2) f(1) = -f(2) Given that f(2) = a, we thus have f(1) = -a. From the inequality f(1) < 1, substituting in -a for f(1), we get: -a < 1 Rightarrow a > -1 Since f(x) is an odd function and f(2) = a, the value at -2 should be f(-2) = -a by symmetry, thus f(1) = -a. We already have that a > -1, but since the function is odd and has a defined value at f(2) which is equal to a, the value at -2 cannot be equal to 1 because this would imply that f(-2) = 1 and, since the function is odd, it would then imply that f(2) = -1. But since f(2) = a, this would mean a would have to be -1, which contradicts the original statement f(1) < 1. So, we must have a < 0 and not equal to -1.

This implies that both tan A and tan C must be positive, as they are part of a geometric sequence and tan B is squared, indicating it is positive or negative. From the identity tan B = -tan(A+C), we can use the tangent addition formula to get tan B = -frac{tan A + tan C}{1 - tan A tan C}. Given the geometric sequence relationship, this simplifies to tan B = frac{tan A + tan C}{tan^2 B - 1}. Rearranging this equation yields tan^3 B - tan B = tan A + tan C. We know that tan A + tan C geq 2sqrt{tan A tan C} = 2|tan B|, by the AM-GM inequality. - When tan B > 0, we have tan^3 B - tan B geq 2tan B, which simplifies to tan^3 B geq 3tan B. This inequality implies tan B geq sqrt{3}, since tan B > 0. - When tan B < 0, the inequality tan^3 B - tan B geq -2tan B simplifies to tan^3 B geq -tan B. However, given that tan B < 0, this condition does not provide a valid solution for the range of tan B we are interested in.

Scene 4: A Glittering Resolution - Finally, after what seemed like hours of wandering, Gloopy and Glitter caught sight of each other in the distance, their joyful reunion a beacon of hope amidst the confusing corridors of the mall. - With a few clever twists and turns, Gloopy and Glitter managed to lead the lost children back to their relieved parents, reuniting families and bringing a sense of peace to the mall maze. - As they prepared to leave the mall, the tentacled alien approached Gloopy and Glitter, a gleam in its eyes. Alien: “You have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.” - With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows.

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right! Write a follow up where 1 new bumper is added to the set (normally the comic bumpers feature characters from Squish, TTG and Johnny Test), state which 3 shows this bumper has Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Bumper Update – A New Addition Joins the Mix!” User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:00 AM Hey, fellow cartoon connoisseurs! Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up. Plus, seeing “Gloopy and Glitter” featured tells us they’re betting on the blobby duo. Exciting times ahead!

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup Promo – Reactions?” User1: ToonMasterJay Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:15 AM Just saw the promo for the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! I’m all hyped up for “Pokémon” and “Sonic X”! And did you guys catch “Ultimate Muscle”? I thought that show was gone forever! What are your thoughts on the shows? User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra! Extra!/The Magic Trick/Treasure Hunt/The Forgotten Memory (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:00 Ultimate Muscle: Making The Cut (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:30 Code Lyoko: Guided Missile - 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown: Finding Omi - 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: The Barren Planet of Shadows/Lost in Gloopiter - 10:00 Sonic X: Satellite Swindle (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya: Un-Reality TV (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 11:00 Johnny Test: Johnny To The Centre of the Earth/Phat Johnny - 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man: Why I Hate Gym Forum Thread Title: “The Shift to CW4KIDS.tv - Observing Website Updates & Pokémon Episode Airings” User1: WebWizKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:47 AM Have you all checked out cw4kids.com lately? Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn't confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn't World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn't premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation. And yes, “The Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” hosted by Gloopy aims to celebrate our new chapter in style! Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu's Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are!

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history. Meanwhile, let’s celebrate our top-rated shows—they’re shaping the new legacy of CW4Kids. Keep the conversations and your passion for the toons flowing! User6: AnimationAnalyst Posted on May 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM I’m all for the new wave of shows, but it’s nice to see how ‘Code Lyoko’ continues to capture hearts—even amidst all the flashy newcomers. As the rebrand becomes the norm, I wonder if it’ll maintain its place in the top five. But yes, definitely a moment of silence for our pal Johnny.

We’re getting “GoGoRiki,” “Kirby: Right Back At Ya,” and “Ultimate Muscle” making their debuts! 🎉 And here’s a bit you’ll REALLY find interesting, especially if you were a Kids WB regular late last year: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are coming back!

Shows there’s a commitment to reviving beloved series alongside introducing new ones. User3: RetroToonRetro Posted on February 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back is a major win for fans of the original run. “GoGoRiki” sounds like it could add some quirky humor to the mix.

Balancing nostalgia with new content could be the key to keeping both old fans and enticing new ones. User5: DigitalDawn Posted on February 1, 2024, at 11:15 AM Honestly, it’s smart of CW4Kids to sprinkle in some modern-nostalgia with “Gloopy and Glitter.” Brings a sense of continuity. “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” are classics that deserve more love, and “GoGoRiki” could be the dark horse that surprises us all. This lineup feels like a rebirth while tipping its hat to its roots. Can’t wait! Moderator: CW4KidsCaretaker Posted on February 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for our upcoming late-winter lineup and the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”!

Also, here's the Kids WB ratings from early December Final K6-11 Ratings for Saturday, December 2, 2023 Broadcast Networks only (Live + SD Data): CW (Kids' WB!) (7a-12p) Squish 0.7, Teen Titans Go 1.6, Xiaolin Showdown 1.0, Ultimate Spider-Man 0.9, Code Lyoko 2.0, Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated 1.2, Batman: The Brave and the Bold 1.6, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 1.2, Johnny Test 1.8, The Hollow 0.9 Forum Thread Title: “From Kids’ WB to CW4Kids – A Ratings Comparison” User1: ToonDataDiver Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:15 AM I’ve been tracking the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids closely, particularly in terms of ratings. Interestingly, some shows remain strong, like “Johnny Test” (still with us until April) showing consistent appeal. Here’s a quick comparison with early March data after the transition: CW4Kids (March 2, 2024) (Live + SD Data): - Pokémon: Indigo League: 1.9 - GoGoRiki: 1.4 - Ultimate Muscle: 1.3 - Code Lyoko: 2.3 - Xiaolin Showdown: 1.2 - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: 1.8 - Sonic X: 2.0 - Kirby: Right Back At Ya!: 1.5 - Johnny Test: 1.7 - Ultimate Spider-Man: 1.1 User2: RetroToonNostalgia Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:45 AM Fascinating to see how the ratings have evolved! Looks like “Code Lyoko” is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And “Sonic X” stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame “Johnny Test” is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM I’m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. “Code Lyoko’s” jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It’s bittersweet, though, regarding “Johnny Test” - it’s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal. User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM The transition strategy from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like “Pokémon: Indigo League” gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” is filling in the comedic gap left by “Johnny Test” pretty well, judging by their ratings. User5: TooniverseTrekker Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s intriguing to contrast these ratings. “Johnny Test” has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It’s a shame we’re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially “Code Lyoko” and newcomers like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X,” suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons. User6: ModernToonMaster Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM True, the increase in ratings for “Code Lyoko” and the successful introduction of refreshes like “Pokémon: Indigo League” speak volumes. While it’s a fond farewell to “Johnny Test,” the data hints at CW4Kids’ potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids’ WB enjoyed. Here’s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving. Moderator: CW4KidsForumMod Posted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM Appreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It’s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we’re indeed saying goodbye to “Johnny Test,” the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Final Days & The CW4Kids Transition: What to Expect” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM So, looks like the Jan 6 schedule for our beloved Kids’ WB isn’t changing at all from what we have now. Seems a bit too quiet for a transition, don’t you think? However, don’t be fooled folks! Word on the street is “GoGoRiki” will make its grand entrance in just a few weeks under the new CW4Kids banner. Any thoughts? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:30 AM Yeah, I was a bit surprised to see the Jan 6 schedule looking so…familiar. But knowing that “GoGoRiki” is on the horizon has me intrigued. It feels like CW4Kids is giving us a soft start before they fully unveil what’s really coming. It’s interesting to see how they’re balancing the old with the new during this transition. User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM I noticed that too! Keeping the schedule unchanged for Jan 6 seems to be a strategic move to ease us into the transition phase. “GoGoRiki” feels like it’ll be the first big test of whether CW4Kids can carry on the Saturday morning tradition we all love. Can’t wait to see how it plays out! User4: AnimationInsider Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 AM This gradual shift strategy is interesting. By not shaking up the Jan 6 schedule too much, they’re likely trying to not rock the boat for viewers who are still adjusting to the CW4Kids idea. But really, I’m looking forward to seeing what “GoGoRiki” brings to the table. It’s going to set the tone for what’s to come under CW4Kids. User5: ModernToonMaster Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 AM I get why they’re doing it, but part of me wishes they’d just rip off the band-aid and bring in the new lineup immediately. That said, introducing “GoGoRiki” is a smart move to start off with, considering its appeal. I’m curious how they’ll balance new shows with the legacy of Kids’ WB. User6: CuriousCartoonist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:30 AM Quick question for @CW4KidsForumMod - With this soft transition and Warner still seemingly having some control for now, are you currently operating under Warner or 4Kids? And when can we expect to see this handover of control reflected in the programming and overall direction of CW4Kids? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 12:00 PM Great question, @CuriousCartoonist. For the moment, Warner Bros is indeed overseeing the transitional period of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids alongside 4Kids Entertainment. This partnership ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday mornings special for our audience. Rest assured, as we move deeper into 2024, you’ll start to see more of 4Kids’ influence in the programming, ushering in new and exciting changes. And yes, “GoGoRiki” is just the beginning! Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience during this exciting time. Write a follow up on January 9 where users are speculating on when GoGoRiki will premiere, and what show it will replace on the lineup, Also by the end of this thread, the Jan 27 schedule is revealed, with Pokemon and Sonic X replacing Squish and Adrenalini, No GoGoRiki yet, but it’s definitely coming on Feb 17, when 4Kids start programming the block, but the presentation (idents, promos) will remain the same till after Easter Forum Thread Title: “GoGoRiki Premiere Speculations & CW4Kids Programming Changes” User1: ToonWatcher101 Posted on January 9, 2024, at 8:57 AM Hey gang! With the buzz around “GoGoRiki” joining CW4Kids, any guesses on when it’ll premiere and which show it might end up replacing? Given the transition, it’s hard to pin down exactly when and what changes will come. Thoughts? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on January 9, 2024, at 9:34 AM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” swooping in sometime mid-February. As for which show it’ll replace, my money’s on something less popular or maybe a show that’s already seen its completion. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” or “Squish” might be on the chopping block. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 9, 2024, at 10:15 AM There’s chatter that “GoGoRiki” will premiere February 17, right when 4Kids begins programming the block. Makes sense for a smooth transition, introducing a fresh face while maintaining the current essence of the lineup. Plus, I heard “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are joining soon, which is super exciting! User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on January 9, 2024, at 11:05 AM Just saw the announcement for the January 27 schedule! “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are replacing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” No sign of “GoGoRiki” yet, but February 17 looks like a solid bet for its debut. Seems like 4Kids is keen on keeping things interesting! User5: AnimationAdmirer Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:00 PM Fascinating developments! “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are classics, and their addition could hint at the direction CW4Kids is headed under 4Kids’ influence. “GoGoRiki” not premiering until February 17 suggests 4Kids is slowly molding the block with its signature. I’m here for it! User6: RetroToonRanger Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:45 PM A little sad to see “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” go, but the inclusion of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” on January 27 is a welcome surprise! As for “GoGoRiki,” waiting until February 17 seems strategic, allowing viewers to adjust. Eager to see how this shapes the CW4Kids landscape. User7: DigitalCartoonist Posted on January 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM Speculating about “GoGoRiki” has been quite the pastime! Mid-February gives CW4Kids a moment to breathe and integrate “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” seamlessly. Really optimistic about the direction we’re heading. Plus, keeping presentations consistent post-Easter shows they’re prioritizing a smooth viewer transition. Smart move! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 9, 2024, at 2:00 PM Appreciate all the speculation and feedback, folks! The decision to bring in “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” on January 27, then debut “GoGoRiki” on February 17, is part of our broader strategy to gradually introduce changes and new content, ensuring the audience gets the best of both worlds—nostalgia and novelty. Rest assured, presentations such as idents and promos will retain their familiar feel until after Easter to help ease the transition. Stay tuned, and thanks for your engagement and excitement during this transformative period for CW4Kids! Write a tweet on Dec 30 during the final broadcast of KWB, where the promos say the name change is coming next week, there’s now a longer 1 minute promo showing clips of all the current shows saying “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name” Also, something peculiar at the end, more specifically a clip 🎉✨ As we bid a fond farewell to #KidsWB this Dec 30, don’t miss our heartwarming 1-minute promo during the final broadcast! 📺 Celebrating our current shows & the memories we’ve shared - “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name.” 🔄💫 Plus, keep an eye out for a peculiar clip at the end… what could it mean? 🤔🚀 #CW4Kids ComingNextWeek 🌈 Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Final Promo Teaser – A Glimpse into CW4Kids’ Future” User1: ToonArchivist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:10 PM Did everyone catch that final promo during “Johnny Test” on Kids’ WB today? It was a nostalgic trip seeing all the current shows celebrated one last time under the Kids’ WB banner. But that ending – they gave us a peek at a new show! Looked exciting but they only teased “Coming Soon” under CW4Kids. Any guesses on what it could be? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:25 PM Caught it! That teaser at the end has my mind racing. Could be the rumored “GoGoRiki” finally making its debut? The clip was too brief to make out much, but the excitement is real. It’s a clever way to keep us hooked for the CW4Kids rebrand. User3: NostalgiaNerd Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:40 PM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” too, given the chatter. But leaving us with just a “Coming Soon” cliffhanger? Classic move to keep us on our toes. The transition feels like the end of an era, yet that teaser has me hopeful for what CW4Kids is cooking up. User4: SaturdaySleuth Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:05 PM That final promo was a mixed bag of emotions – a goodbye paired with a hint of new beginnings. Agree on the “GoGoRiki” speculation; it fits with what’s been floating around. Either way, CW4Kids is setting the stage for some fresh content while paying homage to Kids’ WB’s legacy. User5: ToonTimeTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 PM It really hit me when they said, “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name.” But that sneak peek at the end? Genius way to transition. Whether it’s “GoGoRiki” or something else, CW4Kids seems committed to keeping us entertained and intrigued. User6: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:45 PM Absolutely loved the promo and how they’re handling the transition – respectful yet forward-looking. The teaser has definitely piqued my curiosity. Hoping “GoGoRiki” delivers and becomes a worthy successor to the Kids’ WB lineup we’ve grown to love. CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 PM We’re thrilled you all caught the promo and are excited about the transition! While we can’t reveal much just yet, rest assured that CW4Kids is dedicated to bringing you quality animation and exciting new shows. “Coming Soon” means new adventures are on the horizon, so stay tuned for more updates and thank you for sticking with us through this new chapter!

After slowing it down frame by frame, it’s confirmed—the peculiar clip at the end is none other than Pogoriki, the Rabbit, playing around! “GoGoRiki” fans, rejoice! Looks like our speculations about the new show were spot on. How’s that for a new year surprise? User2: FutureAnimator Posted on January 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM Wow, DetectiveToon, nice catch! Pogoriki making an appearance is a solid confirmation that “GoGoRiki” is indeed joining CW4Kids. This playful rabbit hopping into the new lineup feels like a fresh beginning. Can’t wait to see what kind of adventures Pogoriki and pals bring to Saturday mornings! User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on January 2, 2024, at 9:30 AM This totally amps up my excitement for the CW4Kids launch! I’ve always found Pogoriki to be one of the most entertaining characters. Seeing him in action in the promo, even if just for a second, assures me that “GoGoRiki” is going to inject some serious fun into the lineup. CW4Kids is pulling out all the stops! User4: RetroRewind Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:00 AM Pogoriki? That’s fantastic news! Such a clever way to announce “GoGoRiki” without explicitly saying it. I’ve missed the humor and vibrant animation style of the show. Looks like CW4Kids isn’t just holding onto legacies; they’re really embracing new tales and characters. Kudos to the team for the smart reveal! User5: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:30 AM DetectiveToon, your investigative skills are top-notch! A cameo by Pogoriki is a promising nod to the humor and whimsy we can expect from CW4Kids. It’s comforting to see a blend of nostalgia with new introductions. “GoGoRiki” fans, prepare for laughter and escapades with the rabbit that has charmed so many! User6: AnimationAficionado Posted on January 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM Absolutely thrilling detective work! “GoGoRiki” entering CW4Kids could signify a stronger focus on family-friendly comedy and adventures.

User1: DetectiveToon Posted on January 2, 2024, at 11:45 AM Hey @CW4KidsForumMod, out of curiosity and just for clarity, which company do you officially represent here in the forum? Is it Warner Bros, still overseeing some parts of CW4Kids during this transitional period, or are you directly with 4Kids Entertainment now? The blend of old and new has been fascinating, and I’m just trying to understand from whose perspective we’re seeing these exciting updates! 🙂 CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 2, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hi @DetectiveToon, great question! I’m here representing 4Kids Entertainment. While we’re currently in the midst of this transitional period and working closely with Warner Bros to ensure a smooth handover for CW4Kids, my role is to directly engage with and update our amazing community on behalf of 4Kids Entertainment. We’re committed to maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday morning cartoons special while infusing the lineup with fresh and exciting content. Thanks for your keen interest, and don’t hesitate to reach out with more questions! Forum Thread Title: “The Fate of ‘Squish’ on CW4Kids – Any Hope for a Comeback?” User1: SquishSuperFan Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:05 AM Hey everyone, I’ve been holding onto hope that we might see ‘Squish’ make a grand return to CW4Kids. It had such a unique charm and humor that set it apart. With all the new shows and changes happening, has anyone heard anything about ‘Squish’ coming back? User2: ToonTrackerTina Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:30 AM I totally get where you’re coming from, @SquishSuperFan. ‘Squish’ was a refreshing show, but from what I’ve gathered, there are no plans to bring it back to CW4Kids. The lineup seems pretty set, especially with the new shows they’ve introduced and the direction the network is heading in. It looks like ‘Squish’ won’t fit into their current or future programming slate, unfortunately. User3: AnimationAdmirer Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing. ‘Squish’ offered something different that you don’t see in every cartoon. But CW4Kids seems to be focusing on a specific vibe with their current lineup, leaning more towards action-packed and adventure-driven content with shows like ‘Pokemon Horizons’ and ‘TMNT: Back to the Sewers’. It’s likely ‘Squish’ doesn’t align with their new thematic focus. User4: RetroToonLover Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:45 AM I was holding out hope too, but it makes sense with the direction CW4Kids is taking. The network is probably looking to establish a strong identity post-transition, and unfortunately, ‘Squish’ might not fit into that vision. It’s a shame though; diversity in content is always refreshing. User5: NewEraNick Posted on July 15, 2024, at 11:30 AM While I understand the disappointment, CW4Kids’ lineup has been pretty solid, even without ‘Squish’. They’ve done a good job balancing nostalgia with introducing new and engaging content. Maybe it’s time for us to discover our next favorite show among their offerings? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hey, @SquishSuperFan and everyone else feeling the ‘Squish’ blues! We appreciate your passion for the show and understand your disappointment. Our goal at CW4Kids is to create a diverse and dynamic viewing experience that resonates with our audience’s evolving tastes. While there are no current plans to bring back ‘Squish’, we’re always evaluating our lineup to ensure it delivers the best in animated entertainment. Thank you for your understanding and continued support as we navigate this exciting chapter for CW4Kids! Write a reply from the mod suggesting some alternatives, and saying while the show won’t return anytime soon, here’s some other great stuff CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:30 PM Hey @SquishSuperFan and all our dedicated viewers, I totally hear you on missing ‘Squish’ and the unique flavor it brought to our lineup. While it’s true that ‘Squish’ won’t be returning anytime soon, we’re committed to ensuring our lineup remains filled with shows that capture the imagination, humor, and adventure you loved in ‘Squish’. For those of you looking for something a bit different yet equally captivating, I’d highly recommend giving “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a shot. It’s filled with whimsical stories and vibrant characters that bring a similar charm and creativity to the table. Another show that’s been a hit among our audience is “GoGoRiki.” Its quirky humor and engaging plots offer something for everyone, blending comedy, friendship, and life lessons in a unique way that has resonated with many of our viewers. And, for those who enjoy exploring new worlds and embarking on exciting quests, “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” has been making waves. It introduces fresh adventures and characters that continue to expand the beloved Pokemon universe. We understand that while these alternatives may not replace ‘Squish’, they represent the diverse and entertaining content CW4Kids strives to deliver. Our goal is to fill your Saturday mornings with stories that make you laugh, think, and dream. Thank you again for your understanding, enthusiasm, and support. CW4Kids is here to bring you the very best in animation, and we’re excited to have you with us on this journey!

It was a touching send-off, acknowledging the show’s end on the network. They also suggested four alternatives to fill the Johnny-shaped hole in our hearts. The whole ad had that new CW4Kids tech-themed presentation style, really driving home the transition. Did anyone else catch this? User2: ToonAdventurer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM I saw it too! Really felt the end of an era vibe with that “The lab is now closing” message. The alternatives suggested were “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic,” right? Styled in that sleek, new CW4Kids presentation, it somehow made the farewell a little less bittersweet. I’ll miss “Johnny Test,” but it’s a good nudge to explore the new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:45 PM Certainly a creative way to say goodbye to “Johnny Test” and transition fans to other shows. The CW4Kids presentational style they used was spot on—futuristic and vibrant, fitting the channel’s new direction perfectly. I’ve been a fan of “Johnny Test” for years, but the alternatives they suggested sound promising. Might give “GoGoRiki” a shot next Saturday! User4: NewEraToonGoer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:00 PM It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids handling the transition with such care. “Johnny Test” has been a staple, but the ad’s tech-themed presentation style made the alternatives seem appealing. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” caught my eye; it has that quirky charm “Johnny Test” fans might enjoy. Good on CW4Kids for guiding viewers towards new favorites. User5: DigitalCartoonDiva Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM That “The lab is now closing” ad had me feeling all sorts of emotions. But the way they presented the alternatives, all snazzy and tech-styled, showcased CW4Kids’ commitment to its new era. “Viva Pinata” and “Chaotic” seem like they’ll fill the action-comedy void left by “Johnny Test.” Excited to see what these shows have to offer! User6: RetroToonLover Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:30 PM The farewell ad for “Johnny Test” was a classy move by CW4Kids. Using their new presentation style to introduce alternatives shows they’re serious about keeping viewers hooked with engaging content. “Johnny Test” will be missed, but the network’s new lineup seems ready to take up the mantle. Here’s to new adventures! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:45 PM It’s heartwarming to see the community come together to bid farewell to “Johnny Test.” The “lab is now closing” ad was our way of softly transitioning fans towards our exciting new lineup, rendered in our fresh presentational style. We’re eager for you to dive into the adventures that “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic” have in store.

Gloopy did a fantastic job hosting, giving us insights and laughter throughout. I loved how they acknowledged the journey since “just after Christmas,” making it clear they value the past few months of transition. What did everyone think of the sneak peeks and the overall direction CW4Kids is taking? User2: DigitalDawn Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:15 PM The preview show was nothing short of spectacular! The acknowledgment of the transition period really hit home, showing they care about the seamless shift from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids. Every sneak peek, especially “Pokemon Horizons” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds,” has me hyped for April 13th. Gloopy mentioning the network’s journey since Christmas warmed my heart - a nod to the fans who’ve been here through it all. User3: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:30 PM I appreciated the nod to the transition period—it felt respectful. Gloopy hosting was a stroke of genius; it brought a familiar face to the forefront, bridging old and new. The previews for “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” and “Chaotic” looked promising. CW4Kids seems dedicated to leveraging both nostalgia and innovation, which is exciting! User4: RetroRewind Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:45 PM The whole event was a classy way to introduce us to the future of CW4Kids. It’s like they’re carefully curating this blend of past favorites and new adventures for us. I was particularly impressed with the sneak peek of “Sonic X” starting from Episode 1 - smart move to draw in a wider audience. Acknowledging the transition gave a sense of continuity and respect for the audience’s journey. User5: AnimationAficionado Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:00 PM There was something very comforting about tonight’s show. Recognizing the time “just after Christmas” until now as a significant period of CW4Kids’ evolution shows they’re thoughtful about this rebranding process. The mix of upcoming shows has me convinced CW4Kids is setting a new standard for Saturday morning lineups. Can’t wait to see where they take us next! User6: NewEraNick Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:15 PM Truly an energizing preview event! Gloopy mentioning the network’s journey “just after Christmas” subtly reassured us that while we’re moving forward, the past months were just as valuable in shaping what CW4Kids is about to become. The diverse range of shows previewed tonight paints a bright future ahead. Excitement is an understatement! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:30 PM Thrilled to see all the positive feedback from tonight’s Spring Preview Extravaganza! Our aim was to celebrate both the journey we’ve embarked on since “just after Christmas” and the exciting path ahead. Every show, be it a returning favorite or a new addition, is a piece of the CW4Kids puzzle we’re carefully putting together for our audience.

Forum Thread Title: “4KidsTV Schedule Shake-Up: ‘GoGoRiki’ Gains More Ground & Farewell to ‘Tomodachi Life’ & ‘One Piece’” User1: EternalToonFan Posted on April 21, 2024, at 9:45 AM Heads up! Starting next week, “GoGoRiki” is snagging an additional slot on the 4KidsTV channel, this time taking over “Shaman King” at 11 AM. With its growing popularity on CW4Kids, it seems “GoGoRiki” is set to become even more of a mainstay. But there’s more—“Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” are bidding us farewell come May 1st, replaced by two shows currently exclusive to CW4Kids. The winds of change are certainly blowing through 4KidsTV. Thoughts? User2: RetroAnimeWatcher Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:00 AM Wow, “GoGoRiki” really is taking over! Surprised to see “Shaman King” getting the boot, but “GoGoRiki” has been a hit, so it makes sense. As for “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” leaving, it’s a shame. “One Piece” especially has been a long-standing favorite. Curious to find out which CW4Kids shows will fill in their slots. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:15 AM It’s bittersweet seeing “Tomodachi Life” go; those Miis brought unique charm and humor. “One Piece” had its epic journey too. The removal didn’t come as a surprise, though, considering they stopped streaming on 4kids.tv early March. Now I’m intrigued about which CW4Kids shows will transition over to the 24/7 channel. Any guesses? User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:30 AM “I’ll miss the Miis” from “Tomodachi Life,” too. That show had such a quirky, fun vibe. Exciting to hear that “GoGoRiki” is expanding its presence, though! I’m betting “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and possibly “Code Lyoko” could be the ones to make the jump to 4KidsTV. Both have been stellar on CW4Kids and seem like natural fits to broaden their audience. User5: AnimationAficionado Posted on April 21, 2024, at 10:45 AM The departure of “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” surely marks the end of an era, but it’s also thrilling to see CW4Kids shows stepping up. “GoGoRiki” nabbing another slot is impressive. It kind of reflects 4KidsTV’s adaptation to viewer preferences. Eagerly awaiting the announcement of which CW4Kids shows will fill those vacancies come May. User6: NostalgicNick Posted on April 21, 2024, at 11:00 AM “GoGoRiki” really is on a roll! I understand the logistics behind the changes, especially with streaming limitations signaling “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” were on their way out. It’s a smart play to bring more CW4Kids content into the 4KidsTV fold – keeps the brand cohesive and capitalizes on what’s working. Can’t wait to see what’s next! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 21, 2024, at 11:15 AM We appreciate all your feedback and understanding regarding the recent schedule changes at 4KidsTV. “GoGoRiki’s” additional timeslot is a testament to its success, and while we say goodbye to “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece,” we’re excited about bringing more of the CW4Kids experience to our 24/7 channel.

Instead of the usual Nintendo, TV Asahi, and Gallop logos during the Split Screen Credits, we got an S4C and Inovism logo.

It hints at the direction 4KidsTV is taking after “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” say their farewells. Swapping the logos early must've been a mistake, but it gives us a glimpse into what’s coming. Animation Studio Petersburg and S4C/Inovism involvement sounds promising for the new content! User5: AnimationAfficionado Posted on April 19, 2024, at 9:00 PM Certainly, an unexpected sneak peek into the future! Mixing up the credits does spoil the surprise a bit, but I’m intrigued by what S4C, Inovism, and Animation Studio Petersburg will bring to the table. This mishap aside, it seems like 4KidsTV is prepping for a refreshed lineup with some serious creative power behind it.

Thoughts on these swaps? User2: RetroGamer Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I’m going to miss the quirky stories of “Tomodachi Life.” The island’s always been a bit of a virtual getaway for me. Swapping it with “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is intriguing, though. Alien slimes could bring a whole new dimension of comedy we haven’t seen before on the network. User3: PirateFan101 Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:15 AM As much as I love “One Piece,” its ratings have been trailing behind “Pokémon” for the last 6 months. It seems like a strategic move by 4KidsTV to refresh their lineup with shows that have the potential to attract a broader audience. “GoGoRiki” does have its charm, and it’ll be interesting to see how it fills the action-packed void left by our beloved pirates. User4: ToonAnalyst Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:30 AM To shed a bit more light on why “Tomodachi Life” is leaving, it primarily comes down to Nintendo moving away from 3DS support. The show, being based on a game for a platform that’s no longer actively supported, makes it a bit outdated for 4KidsTV’s dynamic and evolving lineup. As for “One Piece,” it’s really about the numbers. “Pokémon” has consistently outperformed it in ratings, making it a challenging environment for our pirate crew. In the entertainment business, especially in children’s programming, staying relevant and competitive is key. User5: NewEraNick Posted on April 30, 2024, at 9:45 AM It’s sad to see two such unique shows go, but change is part of the TV landscape. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki” sound like they’ll bring a lot of fresh energy and humor to the channel. Plus, considering the evolving interests of the audience, it seems like a natural progression. Here’s hoping they capture our imagination just as much! User6: AnimationAfficionado Posted on April 30, 2024, at 10:00 AM Farewell to the Miis and pirates. While “Tomodachi Life” offered an unparalleled slice-of-life experience and “One Piece” took us on countless high seas adventures, it’s exciting to think about the new narratives and laughter “Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki” will bring. The realm of children’s animation is all about evolution and innovation. Let’s embrace the change! 4KidsTVForumMod Posted on April 30, 2024, at 10:15 AM We appreciate your thoughts and feelings on the transition from “Tomodachi Life” and “One Piece” to “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and “GoGoRiki.” Our goal at 4KidsTV is always to deliver engaging, diverse, and high-quality content that resonates with our viewers.

Suppose we have a table named \`employees\` and we want to select two columns: \`department_id\` and \`location\`. We want to list each department along with its location but remove any duplicates in the \`department_id\` so that each department is listed only once, even if it appears in multiple locations. To achieve this, we can use the \`GROUP BY\` clause along with an aggregate function for the column that can have multiple entries (in this case, \`location\`). However, note that using \`GROUP BY\` will group the rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows and won't exactly \\"remove duplicates\\" in the sense of getting unique pairs. For truly unique department-location pairs, you'd often use \`DISTINCT\`. I'll show both approaches for clarification. # Using \`GROUP BY\` \`\`\`sql SELECT department_id, MAX(location) AS location FROM employees GROUP BY department_id; \`\`\` In this example, for each \`department_id\`, we're getting only one location. We use the \`MAX()\` aggregate function to ensure we get a single location per department. This method might not be ideal if you want to list all unique department-location pairs because it only shows one location per department even if a department spans multiple locations. If your goal is truly removing rows where only the \`department_id\` is a duplicate but keeping all unique department-location combinations, \`DISTINCT\` is more suitable. # Using \`DISTINCT\` for Unique Pairs \`\`\`sql SELECT DISTINCT department_id, location FROM employees; \`\`\` This \`DISTINCT\` query will list all unique department-location pairs, effectively removing duplicates where both \`department_id\` and \`location\` are the same but showing each unique combination once. # Summary - Use \`GROUP BY\` when you need to aggregate data (e.g., count, max, min, sum) for grouped records. - Use \`DISTINCT\` when you want to remove duplicate rows from the result set. Each serves different purposes, so the choice between \`GROUP BY\` and \`DISTINCT\` depends on your specific needs regarding duplicity and aggregation in SQL queries."},{"prompt":"“Yeah they are-you’ve been in labour for 17 hours now, and you’re doing such beautiful work .” As he splayed a palm across her tight skin, she rocked her hips against his hand , moaning through the pressure as a trickle of fluid escaped her opening. “One step closer , baby” Liam whispered as he rotated a finger around her hip, helping the waters to flow as her contraction seized her abdomen and she cried out , channeling the immense pressure into a sweet moan . “It’s , I’m almost there , I feel her head grinding on my pelvis “ she breathed, the room close with the anticipation, and quiet with only her laboured pants filling the air .

It strikes at the heart of the labor process—balancing the threshold of pain, the anticipation of new life, and the inherent support system woven through the experience. Lara's endurance is showcased through several key moments: 1. **Long Duration of Labor**: The mention that Lara has been in labor for 17 hours, and later nearly 20, sets the stage for understanding her physical endurance. Labor is a taxing, exhaustive process, and the prolonged duration emphasizes her strength and resilience. 2. **Natural Birth Choice**: The decision to go through labor without pharmacological pain relief reflects a commitment to experiencing childbirth fully.

This aspect of endurance is not just physical but also a matter of principle and preference for Lara. 3. **Active Participation**: Lara's active role in managing her labor pain by guiding Liam's hand for comfort, rocking her hips against his hand, and focusing on breathing through the contractions demonstrates her agency and engagement in the birthing process. It's a portrayal of harnessing inner strength to work through the pain.

This passage skillfully interweaves the physicality of childbirth with the emotional tapestry that supports it, from the intensity of contractions to the anticipation of meeting their child, and the shared journey of Lara and Liam through one of life's most challenging yet rewarding experiences."},{"prompt":"What does the nurse do that is realistic","completion":"The nurse in the passage performs several actions that align closely with typical responsibilities and behaviors of nurses in a labor and delivery setting. These realistic actions contribute to the authenticity of the narrative and offer insight into the supportive role of healthcare professionals during childbirth. Here are some highlighted actions of the nurse and their realistic basis: 1. **Monitoring Labor Progress:** The nurse checks Lara's progress by examining her dilation, announcing she is eight centimeters dilated. This is a common practice in labor and delivery, as monitoring dilation helps healthcare providers assess how labor is progressing and estimate how close the individual is to delivering. It's crucial for making informed decisions about the care and interventions that might be necessary. 2. **Providing Reassurance and Guidance:** The nurse advises Lara to try to relax between contractions and suggests Liam take some time outside to clear his head, indicating an understanding of the physical and emotional intensity of labor. Nurses often provide emotional support and guidance to both the birthing individual and their partner, helping them navigate the experience with reassurance and practical advice. 3. **Placing a Monitor:** The nurse places a monitor below Lara's navel to track the baby's heartbeat. The use of fetal monitoring during labor is standard practice to ensure the baby's health remains steady throughout the process. It allows healthcare providers to quickly respond if there are any signs of distress or abnormalities in the baby's heart rate. 4. **Offering Comfort and Instruction:** Telling Lara that things are looking good at this stage and reassuring her that the baby's heart is steady offers comfort and support. Additionally, nurses often instruct birthing individuals to focus on deep breathing to manage contractions and reduce stress, as seen when the nurse handles Lara's next contraction and the moments of anticipation. 5. **Communicating with Concerned Family Members:** When Liam expresses his concerns about Lara's pain and the duration of labor, the nurse provides comfort and reassurance, acknowledging Lara's strength and affirming that she is in good hands. Nurses act as a bridge between medical understanding and the family's emotional needs, offering support, clarifying information, and sometimes just being there to listen. These actions by the nurse are integral to the labor and delivery care team, emphasizing the multifaceted role nurses play in providing medical care, emotional support, and information to families during one of the most significant moments of their lives. These realistic details enhance the narrative's authenticity, illustrating the complex and compassionate care involved in welcoming new life."},{"prompt":"What does Lara moan out","completion":"In the passage you provided, Lara moans out several things that articulate her pain, her progress in labor, and her reactions to the support she's receiving: 1. **During a Contraction:** Lara moans through the pressure of a contraction, an expression of the intense sensation and discomfort she's experiencing. The moan serves as a visceral reaction to the peak of a contraction's intensity. 2. **Feeling the Baby's Position:** \\"I feel her head grinding on my pelvis,\\" Lara breathes out. This statement indicates she can physically sense the progress of the baby moving lower into the birth canal, an intense sensation that signifies she is getting closer to the moment of delivery. 3. **During Nurse's Examination:** As the nurse checks Lara's dilation, she moans against the nurse's hand. This reaction likely combines discomfort from the physical examination with the continuous pressure and pain from contractions. 4. **Expressing Near-Overwhelming Sensation:** Lara, biting her lip, gasped out \\"I feel -mmmm-oooh-boy-\\". This fragmented expression conveys a mix of pain, effort, and perhaps the overwhelming sensation of nearing the end of her labor. Each of these moments reflects the physical and emotional intensity of labor, using Lara's vocalizations to communicate her experience to the reader and to those around her in the narrative. Moans and other vocal reactions are common during labor, serving as both a release of pain and a non-verbal communication of what the birthing person is going through at each stage."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Este proceso es fundamental para el funcionamiento eficiente de un computador, permitiendo que el sistema operativo maneje adecuadamente las solicitudes de hardware y coordine las tareas de manera efectiva. Las interrupciones permiten al hardware notificar al procesador sobre varios eventos, como la finalización de una tarea, la llegada de nuevos datos de un dispositivo de entrada, o la necesidad de realizar más procesamiento en relación con una operación de salida. Sin el mecanismo de interrupciones, el CPU necesitaría sondear constantemente cada dispositivo para determinar su estado, lo cual sería una operación altamente ineficiente y consumiría una cantidad significativa de recursos del procesador. En el Administrador de Tareas de Windows, \\"Interrupciones del sistema\\" puede aparecer como un proceso o una carga de CPU. Generalmente, se espera que este valor sea bajo. Sin embargo, un valor alto de uso de CPU asociado a \\"Interrupciones del sistema\\" puede indicar problemas, como: - Conflictos de hardware o drivers mal configurados. - Dispositivos defectuosos. - Problemas de compatibilidad entre el hardware y el sistema operativo. Resolver problemas elevados de \\"Interrupciones del sistema\\" puede implicar actualizar drivers, reemplazar hardware defectuoso o modificar la configuración del sistema para resolver conflictos. En resumen, el concepto de \\"Interrupciones del sistema\\" es esencial para la comunicación entre el hardware y el sistema operativo, facilitando la eficiencia y el rendimiento global de un sistema. Un seguimiento adecuado y la resolución de problemas elevados relacionados con las interrupciones son importantes para mantener la salud y el rendimiento óptimo de un computador."},{"prompt":"cuál sería la métrica de una pieza musical que en cada compás tiene dos tresillos","completion":"Si una pieza musical tiene dos tresillos en cada compás, la métrica o el tiempo del compás dependerá de cómo se conforman esos tresillos en relación con la subdivisión del pulso. Generalmente, un tresillo consiste en tres notas que se tocan en el espacio de dos notas iguales regulares. Por lo tanto, si hay dos tresillos en un compás, usualmente implica que las seis notas se ajustan en el espacio donde normalmente cabrían cuatro notas del valor tomado como referencia para el tresillo. Para determinar la métrica específica de la pieza musical basada en esta descripción, consideramos lo siguiente: 1. **Si los tresillos están compuestos por corcheas**: Cada tresillo de corcheas ocuparía el espacio de una negra. Entonces, si hay dos tresillos de corcheas en un compás, esto significaría que hay el espacio equivalente a dos negras en ese compás. La métrica más común para acomodar esto sería un compás de 2/4, donde hay dos pulsos (representados por negras) en cada compás. 2. **Adaptabilidad a otras métricas**: La descripción de \\"dos tresillos en cada compás\\" podría adaptarse a otras métricas, dependiendo de la interpretación y el contexto. Por ejemplo, si consideramos que cada tresillo consiste en figuras más largas (como tresillos de negras en vez de corcheas), la métrica variaría. Sin embargo, bajo el supuesto más común y directo, hablando de tresillos formados por corcheas, el 2/4 es una interpretación razonable. Sin embargo, siempre es importante considerar el contexto musical y las indicaciones específicas que el compositor pueda haber proporcionado en la partitura, ya que la notación de tresillos puede ser utilizada de formas creativas y variadas en distintos tipos de música. La métrica podría variar si, por ejemplo, el compositor quiere que los tresillos sean interpretados de una manera que no se ajuste al esquema estándar de subdivisión del tiempo."},{"prompt":"Cuáles son las diez ideas que definen a Kant?","completion":"Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) es uno de los filósofos más influyentes de la era moderna, cuyo trabajo abarca áreas como la epistemología, la ética, la metafísica y la estética. Su pensamiento es complejo y multifacético, pero aquí destacaré diez ideas fundamentales que lo definen: 1. **Imperativo Categórico**: En ética, Kant es famoso por su formulación del \\"Imperativo Categórico\\", una regla moral universal que prescribe actuar solo según aquella máxima que querríamos se convirtiera en ley universal. Esto significa actuar de manera que los principios detrás de nuestras acciones sean aplicables a todos los seres racionales de manera consistente. 2. **Crítica de la Razón Pura**: Kant argumenta que aunque todo nuestro conocimiento empieza con la experiencia, no todo proviene de ella. Distingue entre el conocimiento \\"a priori\\" (independiente de la experiencia) y \\"a posteriori\\" (dependiente de la experiencia), y sostiene que nuestra comprensión de la estructura del mundo también se basa en la intuición y las categorías inherentes a nuestro aparato cognitivo. 3. **Fenómenos vs. Noúmenos**: Kant distingue entre el mundo tal como lo experimentamos (fenómenos) y el mundo en sí mismo (noúmenos). Aunque podemos conocer los fenómenos a través de nuestros sentidos y estructura cognitiva, los noúmenos se mantienen inaccesibles para nosotros. 4. **Autonomía de la Voluntad**: Kant valora la autonomía de la voluntad como la capacidad de los individuos de guiarse por principios racionales, en lugar de ser gobernados por impulsos o deseos externos. La autonomía está en el corazón de su concepción de la moralidad y la dignidad humana. 5. **El Deber por el Deber**: Para Kant, las acciones no son moralmente buenas debido a sus consecuencias sino debido a la motivación detrás de ellas. Actuar moralmente significa actuar según el deber por respeto a la ley moral, no por interés propio. 6. **Crítica de la Razón Práctica**: En esta obra, Kant desarrolla su teoría ética basada en la autonomía, el imperativo categórico y la universalidad. Argumenta que la moralidad requiere creer en la existencia de la libertad, la inmortalidad del alma y la existencia de Dios como postulados prácticos necesarios. 7. **Teoría del Conocimiento**: Kant propone que nuestro entendimiento contribuye activamente a la experiencia al aplicar conceptos y categorías a priori. Esto contradice la visión empírica de que la mente es una tabla rasa. 8. **Estética Transcendental**: En la \\"Crítica del Juicio\\", Kant explora la naturaleza de la belleza y el arte. Argumenta que el juicio estético es desinteresado y universal, y explora la idea del \\"genio\\" en la creación artística. 9. **Dignidad Humana**: Según Kant, los seres humanos tienen un valor intrínseco, o \\"dignidad\\", que los distingue de las cosas. Esto se debe a su capacidad para actuar según leyes morales determinadas racionalmente. 10. **Paz Perpetua**: En su obra política, Kant esbozó la idea de una \\"paz perpetua\\" basada en la formación de una federación de estados libres y republicanos, anticipando ideas modernas sobre el derecho internacional y la cooperación entre los estados para asegurar la paz mundial. Estas ideas constituyen solo la superficie del profundo y amplio legado de Kant. Su trabajo ha influenciado prácticamente a todas las áreas de la filosofía que le siguieron, desde la ética hasta la metafísica, epistemología, política y estética."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this sentence to be less awkward. \\"So it was the same as is under market-orientated economics just the lender is the state?\\"","completion":"\\"So it's essentially like market-oriented economics, but with the state acting as the lender?\\""},{"prompt":"|a|=1,|b|=3,|a+b|+|a-b|的取值范围是多少，a,b是向量","completion":"给定的条件是：|a| = 1, |b| = 3, 其中a和b是向量。要找出表达式|a+b| + |a-b|的取值范围。 首先，我们可以使用三角不等式，这给我们一些关键的不等式来工作。三角不等式告诉我们对于任意的向量x和y，有|x+y|≤|x|+|y|，同时也有|x-y|≤|x|+|y|。使用这个，我们可以得到以下结论： [|a+b| + |a-b| ≤ |a|+|b| + |a|+|b| = 2(|a|+|b|) = 2(1+3) = 8。] 同时，我们也知道另一个与三角不等式相关的属性，那就是|a+b|≥||a|-|b||，这意味着： [|a+b|+|a-b| geq ||a|+|b|| + ||a|-|b|| = |1+3| + |1-3| = 4+2= 6。] 因此，综上得出，|a+b| + |a-b|的取值范围是[6 leq |a+b| + |a-b| leq 8。]"},{"prompt":"给出构造","completion":"为了具体地构造出满足条件的向量a和b，使得表达式|a+b| + |a-b|的值覆盖上述推导出的取值范围（6到8），我们可以考虑不同的向量方向关系，并给出相应的例子。 # 极值情况 1. **取值为8时**： 当a和b方向完全相反时，我们可以构造出使表达式取最大值8的例子。设向量a为长度为1的向量，向量b为长度为3的向量，但方向与a完全相反。 - 假设a = langle 1, 0 rangle（即，在xy-平面的x轴上，长度为1的向量）, - 让b = langle -3, 0 rangle（即，指向相反方向，长度为3的向量）。 这样，我们有： [|a+b| = |(-2, 0)| = 2, quad |a-b| = |(4, 0)| = 4。] 因而， [|a+b| + |a-b| = 2 + 4 = 6.] 但这个例子实际上给出了取值为6的情形，意味着对于极值8，我们需要找到满足条件的情况。让a和b在同一直线上但指向相同方向可以得到。 - 如果b = 3a且方向相同，例如a = langle 1, 0 rangle，b = langle 3, 0 rangle。 则 [|a+b| = |(4, 0)| = 4, quad |a-b|=(2, 0)=2.] 因此， [|a+b| + |a-b| = 4 + 2 = 6.] 显然，我在这里犯了一个解释错误，要实现极大值的情况，应该这样构造：a 和 b 方向相同且线性相关。但是，通过这种方式实现的取值为6，表明了极小值的情况。现在来纠正关于极大值的正确构造。 # 正确的最大值构造（取值为8） 为达到值8，可以这样考虑：同时取a和b，使它们垂直。 - 假设 a = langle 1, 0 rangle，b = langle 0, 3 rangle。 这样， [|a+b| = |langle 1, 3 rangle| = sqrt{1^2 + 3^2} = sqrt{10},] [|a-b| = |langle 1, -3 rangle| = sqrt{1^2 + (-3)^2} = sqrt{10}.] 因此， [|a+b| + |a-b| = 2sqrt{10}.] 注意，这个计算并不直接对应到值8，但它展示了a和b垂直时值会有所增加。对于完全垂直的向量，这个解释演示了考虑方向变化对取值的影响，但实际上想要准确达到6到8的界限，需要考虑不同向量间的相对角度变化。 # 纠正并澄清 为确实覆盖取值范围6到8，我之前的例子和解释误导了关于如何精确构造来达到这一点的理解。正确的角度是，考虑a和b的相对方向和长度： - **取值为6**需要a和b方向相反，我之前关于取值6的构造实例是正确的概念方向。 - **取值接近8**可以通过调整a和b的角度（使其垂直或近似垂直）来尽可能提升值，但精确地达到6或8的具体数值需要更周密的构造方法和解释。垂直的情况提供了一个更高的结果，但不直接对应于简单的整数值。 正确理解这个问题的关键在于，根据向量a和b的相对方向，你可以从最小值6（当两向量完全反向时）移动到一个更大的值。但是，要准确地通过具体例子达到极大值8，我们必须考虑向量的组合方式，以及这些向量如何通过在它们之间的角度调整来增加或减少|a+b| + |a-b|的值。"},{"prompt":"Écris-moi une courte réponse de 5 lignes maxi à la suite de ce courriel reçu par un éditeur. \\"Chère Mxxx Je prends connaissance de vos deux derniers messages après quelques jours de congés.

В самом коде нет явной команды на двойной вывод, но стоит учитывать, как работает среда, в которой вы запускаете этот код. Если вы сталкиваетесь с двойным выводом в интерактивной среде типа Jupyter Notebook или другой подобной среде, это может быть вызвано самой механикой выполнения ячеек кода: последнее вычисленное выражение в ячейке автоматически выводится под ячейкой. Это означает, что если последняя строка в ячейке кода является вызовом функции или выражением, результат которого не присваивается переменной, этот результат будет автоматически отображаться. Следовательно, если последней строкой будет вызов \`print()\`, который уже выводит значение, а затем среда выполнения автоматически отображает возвращаемое значение функции (которое для \`print()\` является \`None\`, но \`print\` уже выполнит свою задачу вывода), вы можете визуально увидеть двойной вывод только если \`print()\` вызывается с результатом функции, который также может возвращать вывод. Однако, в вашем случае причиной двойного вывода, вероятно, является особенность окружения или платформы, на которой запущен код. В обычных условиях (как, например, при выполнении Python скрипта из командной строки) код, который вы предоставили, должен привести к однократному выводу значения. Если у вас по-прежнему дважды выводится значение, удостоверьтесь, что вы точно запускаете только этот кусок кода, и нечего больше нет в ячейке (если это Jupyter Notebook) или в скрипте, что могло бы привести к дополнительному выводу."},{"prompt":"Диалог:USER: Запомни, ты очень хороший юрист, всегда рад помочьASSISTANT:","completion":"Спасибо за добрые слова!

It represents a major advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, and has the potential to have a significant impact on society and how we use technology."},{"prompt":"Type of generative AI technques","completion":"There are several techniques used in generative AI to create new content. Some of the most common techniques include: 1. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): VAEs are a type of generative model that learns to encode and decode data. They work by mapping input data to a latent space, where new data points can be generated. VAEs are often used in generating images and other complex data types. 2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs consist of two neural networks – a generator and a discriminator – that work together to produce realistic data. The generator creates new data samples, while the discriminator evaluates how realistic they are. GANs are commonly used in generating images, videos, and other media. 3. Transformer Models: Transformer models, such as the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, are powerful language models that are capable of generating text. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate coherent and contextually relevant text. 4. Autoencoders: Autoencoders are neural networks that can learn to reconstruct input data. They work by compressing the input data into a latent representation and then reconstructing the original input from this representation. Autoencoders can be used in generating images, music, and other types of content. 5. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): MCMC methods are used to sample from complex probability distributions. In the context of generative AI, MCMC can be used to generate new data points by sampling from a learned distribution. These are just a few examples of the techniques used in generative AI. Each technique has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of technique depends on the specific task and type of content being generated.

Some of the most common techniques include: 1. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): VAEs, as mentioned earlier, are a type of generative model that can be used to create new images. They work by learning a latent representation of the input data and then generating new images from this representation. VAEs are popular for generating realistic and diverse images. 2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs are widely used in generating images and have been very successful in creating high-quality and realistic images. The generator in a GAN learns to create new images, while the discriminator evaluates how realistic these images are. This adversarial training process helps the generator improve its ability to generate realistic images. 3. StyleGAN: StyleGAN is a type of GAN architecture that specifically focuses on generating high-quality images with control over various aspects such as style, color, and texture. StyleGAN has been used in generating photorealistic images of faces, animals, and other objects. 4. Progressive Growing GAN: Progressive Growing GAN is a GAN variant that starts with low-resolution images and gradually increases the resolution as the training progresses. This technique allows for the generation of high-resolution images with fine details. 5. CycleGAN: CycleGAN is a type of GAN that focuses on image-to-image translation. It can learn mappings between two different image domains, allowing for style transfer, image manipulation, and other image transformation tasks. These are just a few of the techniques commonly used in generative image AI.

The party consists of 6 level 2 characters for reference.","completion":"# Revised Encounters and Assignments in Voonlar **Trouble at the Throat** moves to **Bounty of The Goddess** as an encounter where the party can defend a local merchant from the Zhentarim thugs. This location could be a market area that is under the protective gaze of a local deity, emphasizing the \\"bounty\\" aspect through provision and protection. To improve the encounter, the merchant could specifically be selling holy or blessed items, making the assault not just a criminal act but a blasphemous one, deepening the thematic elements of the location. **The Locktower Breakout** is naturally situated in **The Lock Tower**, where the Harper agent's breakout needs to happen. To flesh this out further, The Lock Tower can serve not just as a prison, but as a storied location with a mix of magical and mundane locks, some holding secrets or treasures beyond the prisoners. Adding a layer of mystery or a side quest involving the magical locks could provide an enriching side activity for the characters. **Gormstadd’s Oddities** finds its place in **The Dark God Reformed**. The shadowy dealings of Gormstadd align well with the themes of transformation and hidden secrets. Perhaps the shop is subtly assisting in the temple's reformation, offering items that aid in battling against the shadows of the past or helping individuals hide from malevolent forces seeking to drag them back to darkness. It could be interesting to have an encounter where the players must track down an item from Gormstadd’s that is crucial in a ritual to cleanse or consecrate part of the temple. **Holman’s Humor** is a great fit for **The Frosted Glade**, possibly as a clearing where Holman hosts gatherings to lighten the spirits of those battling the encroaching cold or darkness of the wilderness. This place can serve as a much-needed respite for adventurers and travelers, where laughter and joy contrast against the backdrop of their perilous journeys. Adding an annual festival centered around humor, with contests of wit and skill, could provide a colorful and memorable event for players to participate in or even save if threatened. **Shield Trading Company** remains in its original place but could be expanded to include a questline where the players are tasked with ensuring the safe arrival of a rare shipment. This shipment could be targeted by various factions, leading to multiple encounters protecting it from bandits, corrupt officials, or rival companies. This would not only bring more attention to the Shield Trading Company but also immerse the players in the intrigue and competition of Voonlar's trading scene. **The Sign of the Shield**, not specifically matched to one of the requested locations, could be an establishment within the **Shield Trading Company** premises, offering a social space where merchants, adventurers, and locals mingle. The gambling night could be a major event that draws in people from across the town and beyond, potentially attracting scoundrels or sparking rivalries that the players must navigate or resolve. By integrating these notable places and encounters within specific locations, the campaign's setting becomes more vivid and interconnected, offering players a rich tapestry of experiences and adventures in Voonlar."},{"prompt":"Can you please give all of the npcs in the following actual stats and not just references to books, so ac, hp, to hit and dmg and weapon type, any other special abilities they have, spell casting and spells, special items if any, race, level, class, age.

Let’s correctly integrate the details with the updated location names and NPC stat blocks turned into sentence form as requested: --- # Encounters in Voonlar Trouble at Bounty of The Goddess In the bustling market area known as Bounty of The Goddess, a group of Zhentarim thugs is causing trouble by shaking down a local merchant. One such Zhentarim Thug is armored in leather, boasting an armor class (AC) of 12, health points (HP) of 11, and a speed of 30 ft. They are proficient with their scimitar, making attacks at +4 to hit, delivering 5 slashing damage on impact. Their training grants them increased charisma, allowing for more effective intimidation attempts, and they operate best in groups, utilizing pack tactics to gain an advantage when allies are nearby. The targeted Merchant, trying to make an honest living, finds himself in peril. He lacks any form of armor, contributing to his AC of 10, and possesses a modest HP of 4. Though not a fighter, indicated by his simple unarmed strike attack at +2 to hit for 1 bludgeoning damage, his years of haggling have honed his persuasion skills, standing strong with a charisma significantly higher than most commoners. A rescue could turn him into a valuable ally or open up opportunities for discounts at his market stall within Bounty of The Goddess. The Lock Tower Breakout In a dire situation at The Lock Tower, a Harper agent, wrongfully accused and facing execution at dawn, urgently needs a breakout. This agent, clad in leather armor enhancing their AC to 15, boasts an HP of 27, and showcases agility with a speed of 30 ft. With a shortsword in hand, they strike at +4 to hit, dealing 6 piercing damage. Notably skilled in stealth and deception, the agent carries a unique magical item, a Ring of Message, facilitating stealth communication. Their keen ability to deliver a powerful sneak attack, dealing an extra 7 damage under the right circumstances, proves them a formidable ally if rescued. Guarding the keys to every cell, the Jailor stands watch over the Lock Tower. His chain shirt and shield result in a robust AC of 16, and he maintains an HP of 11. Despite his average speed, his proficiency with a club allows him to deal 4 bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit. His role is critical, carrying not just the physical keys to the cells but potentially the fate of those within. # Points of Interest, Adventures, and Quests The bustling market of Bounty of The Goddess features a merchant with rare goods and occasional gambling nights, where adventurers could win treasures beyond gold. Meanwhile, the Shield Trading Company offers everything from magical item appraisals to the sale of wondrous items like the Cloak of Billowing, Potion of Healing, and an Everburning Torch. Adventures such as stopping raiders in Forbidden Harvest or uncovering a Banite Conspiracy beneath the Dark God Reformed temple can lead to rewards both monetary and mystical. Training opportunities, such as Secret Archery Lessons, and unique services from Gormstadd’s Oddities and Holman’s Humor in The Frosted Glade, provide adventurers various ways to spend their downtime in Voonlar. # Services and Role-Playing Opportunities Unique services like item identification and lore discovery are available for those curious or brave enough to venture into Gormstadd’s Oddities, whereas Holman’s Humor offers a lighter side of adventure with items designed for pranks but also utility. The local politics, festivals, and opportunity to strengthen alliances with Voonlar’s various factions offer a depth of role-playing potential, building a rich narrative stage for adventurers ready to immerse themselves in the town’s vibrant life. These detailed encounters, descriptions, and stat blocks in narrative form are designed for direct use in your campaign, hoping to enrich the experiences within the town of Voonlar and provide your players with memorable adventures."},{"prompt":"Ok make the changes to all of this text: Remember to update the names, update the statblocks and change them to sentence form: \\" # Encounters in Voonlar 1.

They brandish a scimitar, attacking with a +4 to hit, dealing 5 slashing damage to their target. These thugs have been trained by the Zhentarim, making them particularly persuasive with a Charisma of 12, allowing for more effective intimidation, and they excel in coordinated attacks, using pack tactics for an advantage when an ally is nearby. The Merchant, caught in this dire situation, is not equipped for combat, reflected in his AC of 10 and HP of 4, moving at a standard speed of 30 feet. In his desperation, he can attempt to fend off aggressors, managing a clumsy unarmed strike with +2 to hit for a mere 1 bludgeoning damage. However, his years of experience haggling in the market have sharpened his tongue, granting him a persuasive edge with a Charisma of 14. Rescue actions towards the merchant can secure a valuable alliance or discounts at his establishment within the market grounds of Bounty of The Goddess. The Lock Tower Breakout The quiet before dawn at The Lock Tower is disrupted as a Harper agent, wrongfully accused, awaits their grim fate. This agent, opting for stealth over confrontation, wears leather armor providing an AC of 15, maintains HP of 27, and navigates with a speed of 30 feet. Their weapon of choice, a shortsword, is swung with precision, hitting at +4 and injuring targets with 5 piercing damage. A master of subterfuge, the agent is well-equipped with a Ring of Message for silent communication, boosting their espionage capabilities. Their expertise allows them to unleash a devastating sneak attack, adding 7 damage when the conditions align. Guarding the holdings, the Jailor is armored better than most with an AC of 16, thanks to his chain shirt and shield. He keeps vigilant with HP of 11 and can swing his club with a modest attempt, hitting at +3 to inflict 4 bludgeoning damage on those who would disrupt the peace of The Lock Tower. His keyring jangles with the weight of responsibility, holding the power to free or condemn with each turn of a key. Liberating the Harper Agent not only presents the party with a new ally but could also unlock magical rewards, courtesy of their grateful savior. # Expanding Voonlar's Rich Tapestry From the gamble-filled nights courtesy of local merchants at Bounty of The Goddess to the mystical wares at Shield Trading Company, Voonlar brims with opportunities for trade, intrigue, and adventure. Whether defending the land in Forbidden Harvest, uncovering deep-buried truths beneath the Dark God Reformed temple, or seeking improvement through Secret Archery Lessons, heroes have ample chance to prove their valor, wit, and spirit.

track name having index# and track name mention here[E}","completion":"To append an explicit tag \\"[E]\\" to the track name if the track is marked as explicit, you can modify the section of your code that handles track names, particularly when you're setting or outputting the filename for the track. This typically involves checking an attribute from the track metadata that indicates whether the track is explicit and then modifying the track name string accordingly before using it for the filename or any output. Firstly, ensure the data structure to capture the explicit information from the API response exists. Based on the structures you provided, it's not clear if there's an explicit field coming in from the API. If such a field does not exist, you would need to add it or confirm how explicit tracks are identified from the API response. Assuming there's an \`IsExplicit\` field or similar in your \`SongAttributes\` struct (or wherever appropriate based on the actual API response), the modification could look something like this in the part of your code where you're handling track names for filenames: 1. **Add an \`IsExplicit\` field to \`SongAttributes\` struct** (This step assumes the API returns such data. If the API documentation confirms the presence of an explicit tag in the response, include it accordingly.) \`\`\`go type SongAttributes struct { ... IsExplicit bool \`json:\\"isExplicit\\"\` // Assuming this exists in the API response } \`\`\` 2. **Modify the track name processing logic** to append \\"[E]\\" if \`IsExplicit\` is \`true\`. Locate the part of your code where you're setting the filename or displaying the track name. You should see something like this in your \`rip\` function or similar: \`\`\`go filename := fmt.Sprintf(\\"%02d. %s.m4a\\", trackNum, forbiddenNames.ReplaceAllString(track.Attributes.Name, \\"\\")) \`\`\` You would modify it to append \\"[E]\\" based on the \`IsExplicit\` field. Here's an example modification: \`\`\`go // Determine if the track is explicit. explicitTag := \\"\\" if track.Attributes.IsExplicit { explicitTag = \\" [E]\\" } // Append explicitTag to the filename if the track is marked explicit. filename := fmt.Sprintf(\\"%02d. %s%s.m4a\\", trackNum, forbiddenNames.ReplaceAllString(track.Attributes.Name, \\"\\"), explicitTag) \`\`\` Make sure to adjust the pseudocode according to the actual data structure and field names provided by your music data API. Also, ensure that every place in your code that outputs or relies on the track name should consider this explicit tag as part of the formatting logic. Remember to test these changes thoroughly, especially if you're making assumptions about the data structure of the API response (like the presence of an \`IsExplicit\` field), which might not have been explicitly covered in your question's code or structures."},{"prompt":"# command-line-arguments .main.go:1007:12: no new variables on left side of :=","completion":"The error you're encountering, \`no new variables on left side of :=\`, suggests that you're using the short variable declaration \`:=\` in a scope where the variable(s) on the left side have already been declared. The \`:=\` operator is used for declaring new variables and simultaneously assigning them values. However, if a variable has already been declared in the same scope, you should use just the \`=\` operator for assignment. Let's correct this with a focus on a generalized example based on the pattern of error and context you provided, such as working within a function or loop where variables may be reassigned new values: **Example Scenario:** Suppose you have a loop or section of code where you're first declaring a variable and then, within the same scope, trying to declare it again with a new value using \`:=\`. \`\`\`go func someFunction() { var a int a = 5 // First declaration and assignment // Later in the same scope, attempting to re-declare and assign a new value a, err := someOtherFunction() // This line can cause the \\"no new variables on left side of :=\\" error if \`err\` was also declared before. } \`\`\` **Correction Steps:** - **If both variables are already declared:** Use \`=\` for assignment instead of \`:=\`. - **If one of the variables is new:** Ensure only new variables are on the left side of \`:=\`. **Corrected Example:** 1. **If \`err\` is not declared before:** \`\`\`go func someFunction() { var a int a = 5 // First declaration and assignment // If \\"err\\" hasn't been declared previously var err error a, err = someOtherFunction() // This is correct. \\"a\\" is assigned a new value, and \\"err\\" is declared then assigned. } \`\`\` 2. **If both \`a\` and \`err\` are already declared:** \`\`\`go func someFunction() { var a int var err error a = 5 // Assignment to \\"a\\" // If both \\"a\\" and \\"err\\" are already declared previously in this scope a, err = someOtherFunction() // Just assign new values to already-declared variables \\"a\\" and \\"err\\". } \`\`\` In your case, find the spot around line 1007 in your \`main.go\` where this issue is occurring. Identify which variables on the left-hand side of \`:=\` are already declared. Depending on your scenario (as illustrated above), either change \`:=\` to \`=\` if all variables are already declared or make sure new variables are correctly introduced or existing ones are reassigned appropriately."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

When moving up stairs, rather than snapping the player downwards, you'll be looking to adjust the player's position upwards smoothly to climb the stair steps. There isn't a built-in Godot function specifically for stair climbing, so you'll typically handle this by adjusting the collision detection and movement logic. Here's a basic approach to consider for climbing stairs: 1. **Slope Adjustment**: Ensure your CharacterBody3D or KinematicBody3D is set to handle slopes correctly. This way, when the character moves towards an incline (like stairs), it naturally follows the slope up. 2. **Collision Shape and Stairs Setup**: Adjust the collision shape of your player and stairs. Often, stairs are made climbable by either using a series of small steps (that the engine naturally allows the player to \\"climb\\") or by adding an invisible ramp collision shape over the stairs that the character can smoothly walk up on. 3. **Adjust Physics**: For more complex stair climbing mechanics (like for larger steps the engine doesn't automatically handle), you might need to adjust the character's vertical position when detecting a step in front. This would be a similar concept to your stair-snapping code but in reverse—moving the player slightly upwards. Detect a step using a RayCast3D pointing forward at the base of the character, and when it detects a stair, move the character upwards. Here's a hypothetical modification to your \`_physics_process\` to incorporate an upward step mechanic: \`\`\`gd func _physics_process(delta): # Existing gravity and jump handling var input_dir = Input.get_vector(\\"left\\", \\"right\\", \\"forward\\", \\"backward\\") var direction = (transform.basis * Vector3(input_dir.x, 0, input_dir.y)).normalized() ... # Before or after moving, check for stairs climbing _climb_stairs_check(direction) ... func _climb_stairs_check(direction): # This function would need to cast a ray from the player's feet forward to detect stairs # If a stair is detected, adjust the player's position upward just enough to \\"climb\\" the step. # This method is a starting point, you should customize it for your game's needs. if is_on_floor() and StairsInFrontRayCast3D.is_colliding(): var stair_height = StairsInFrontRayCast3D.get_collision_point().y - global_transform.origin.y # Adjust the Y position if the stair is within a climbable height range if stair_height > 0 and stair_height < MAX_CLIMBABLE_HEIGHT: position.y += stair_height # Apply additional logic as needed, e.g., a small forward adjustment \`\`\` Remember, you'll have to adjust this logic to match your game's specific mechanics, including the setup of your RayCasts, the maximum climbable stair height (\`MAX_CLIMBABLE_HEIGHT\`), and so on. Additionally, consider the player experience when climbing—adjusting the speed, ensuring the animation looks natural, and testing with different stair sizes are all crucial aspects to refine."},{"prompt":"What does this mean? Break it down INDUSTRIAL IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED Permission to pass may be withheld subject to discretion of Combine Civil Authority or its authorized agents.","completion":"The phrase \\"INDUSTRIAL IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED\\" suggests that in order to gain access to a certain area, which is likely to be an industrial zone or facility, individuals must present some form of identification specific to that industry. This could include badges, access cards, or other forms of ID that prove the individual has authorization to be in the area due to their employment status or professional role within the industry. The latter part of the message, \\"Permission to pass may be withheld subject to discretion of Combine Civil Authority or its authorized agents,\\" implies that even with the proper industrial identification, the final decision to allow entry rests with the security or governing body known as the Combine Civil Authority, or its designated representatives. This authority has the discretion to deny entry to anyone, even if they possess the required identification, based on their own criteria or judgment. This might include security concerns, the individual's history with the facility, or any current restrictions in place within the industrial area or zone. In summary, this statement is a warning or guideline regarding access control to a specified area, emphasizing the need for specific identification and the discretionary power of the authority overseeing access."},{"prompt":"What does \\"counterfactual\\" mean?","completion":"The term \\"counterfactual\\" refers to something that is contrary to the facts or that explores what might have happened if the facts were different. It is often used in various contexts such as history, philosophy, and social science to analyze and discuss hypothetical scenarios and their potential outcomes based on altering some elements of reality. In essence, counterfactual thinking involves imagining alternatives to what has actually occurred, asking \\"what if\\" questions that propose alternative historical events, outcomes, or decisions that did not happen but could be conceived as possibilities. For example, in history, a counterfactual analysis might explore what the world would be like if a significant event, such as a major war, had ended differently. In philosophy and logic, counterfactuals are used to examine the consequences of hypothetical situations and their implications for understanding causality and the nature of truth. Counterfactual thinking can also apply to personal and psychological contexts, where individuals might reflect on alternative outcomes based on different choices made in their own lives, thinking about how things might have turned out differently with different decisions."},{"prompt":"What is a commissariat?","completion":"A commissariat is a department or branch within an army that is responsible for the provision and distribution of supplies, including food, equipment, and transport to the troops. Originating from the term \\"commissary,\\" which refers to an official charged with the management of supplies, the commissariat plays a crucial role in military logistics and operations, ensuring that soldiers have the necessary provisions to maintain their effectiveness in the field. The functionality and scope of a commissariat can vary depending on the country and its military structure, but its primary objective remains the same: to manage the supply chain, including procurement, storage, and distribution of all materials needed by the military, apart from armaments which are usually handled by a separate department. In addition to logistical support, commissariats may also be involved in financial management tasks related to military provisions and expenditures. In historical contexts, especially during the times of large-scale wars, the efficiency and effectiveness of a military's commissariat were vital to the success of campaigns, as logistical failures could lead to shortages, affecting the troops' morale and combat capability. Furthermore, the concept of a commissariat is not limited to military applications; it can also be found in civilian contexts where an organization requires a dedicated department to manage the distribution of supplies and resources efficiently."},{"prompt":"Translate トランプ2.0に備える世界の動き～貿易・投資・経済安保・温暖化対策の行方は～【Bizスクエア】","completion":"Global Moves in Preparation for Trump 2.0: The Future of Trade, Investment, Economic Security, and Climate Change Measures 【Biz Square】"},{"prompt":"What is the Austrian German word for \\"neighbor\\"?","completion":"The Austrian German word for \\"neighbor\\" is \\"Nachbar.\\""},{"prompt":"What is credit in banking? When did credit become a thing? Keep it under a paragraph.","completion":"In banking, credit refers to the trust given to a borrower by a lender, allowing the borrower to receive something of value (money, goods, or services) now with the agreement to repay the lender later, often with interest. Credit can take various forms, including loans, credit cards, and lines of credit. The concept of credit has ancient roots, dating back to at least the Sumerians in 3000 BC, who used agricultural loans. Over time, the practice evolved and became more sophisticated, with the modern banking system and formal credit instruments developing significantly during the Renaissance in medieval Europe, particularly in the 14th and 15th centuries, leading to the widespread credit systems we see today."},{"prompt":"Did credit banking exist in the Soviet Union and contemporary socialist states?","completion":"In the Soviet Union and other socialist states, the concept and practice of credit did exist, but it functioned quite differently from credit systems in capitalist economies. The Soviet banking system was state-owned and operated under the principles of a planned economy, where credit was primarily used as a tool for state planning and economic management rather than as a market-based instrument for consumer or business lending in the way it is commonly seen in capitalist systems. Credit was extended to enterprises and organizations to fulfill the state's economic plans, focusing on the production and distribution of goods and services as determined by the government. Consumer credit was very limited and not widely used until the later stages of the Soviet Union. It was not aimed at stimulating consumer spending in the same way as in capitalist economies, but rather at facilitating the acquisition of particular goods or services within the plan's framework. In contemporary socialist states or those with significant state control over the economy, similar principles may apply, where credit and banking are used primarily as tools for implementing state economic policies rather than as mechanisms for profit maximization or market-driven financial activities. However, the specifics can vary significantly based on the country's approach to economic management and the degree of market liberalization. Some modern socialist or socialist-oriented states have incorporated elements of market economies, including more traditional forms of banking and credit, while still maintaining significant state oversight and involvement in the economy."},{"prompt":"So it’s essentially like market-oriented economics, but with the state acting as the lender?","completion":"Yes, in a simplified way, you could view the credit system in socialist economies or those with significant state control as resembling market-oriented economics but with the state acting as the primary lender. In these systems, the state controls the banking sector and provides credit according to economic plans and policies, rather than credit being driven by market demand or profit motives as it is in capitalist economies. The key difference is in the purpose and direction of lending. In market economies, credit is extended based on the expected profitability of the investment and the borrower's ability to repay, with numerous private banks and financial institutions participating in a competitive market. In contrast, in state-controlled or socialist economies, credit allocation is guided by the state's economic objectives, such as supporting certain industries, fulfilling social goals, or achieving specific outcomes laid out in the national economic plan. Therefore, while the mechanism of extending credit (lending money that borrowers will later repay) may appear similar, the underlying goals, decision-making processes, and the overall context in which credit is provided differ significantly between market-oriented and state-controlled economic systems."},{"prompt":"Who are the Principalities in the Angelic hierarchy?","completion":"In Christian angelology, particularly within the hierarchy of angels as outlined by medieval theologians like Dionysius the Areopagite and later expanded by scholars such as Thomas Aquinas, the Principalities are ranked as one of the nine choirs of angels. They are typically placed in the third tier, which is the lowest triad of the celestial hierarchy, alongside Archangels and Angels. The Principalities are understood to be the guardians of nations and leaders of the world, overseeing groups of people and institutions such as the church. They are thought to be responsible for carrying out the divine orders concerning the material world and the cosmos, guiding the governance of space and time. They also have the role of executing the divine will concerning the material world, including the distribution of power, grace, and blessing to earth's realms. Their main purpose is often seen as linking the material world to the spiritual, ensuring the cosmic order reflects divine will. Unlike Archangels and Angels, who serve more as messengers and guides for individuals, Principalities oversee larger groups and structures, managing how heavenly directives impact the world's physical and spiritual planes."},{"prompt":"What are Powers?","completion":"In the hierarchy of angels as described by Christian angelology, Powers (also known as Potentates) occupy a significant role and are considered one of the nine choirs or orders of angels. Typically, they are situated in the second triad of this celestial hierarchy, along with Virtues and Dominions. This triad is primarily concerned with the orderly operation of the universe under God's direction, with each choir performing specific duties. The Powers are envisioned as the warriors and defenders of the cosmos against evil forces and as the keepers of cosmic order and balance. They are believed to oversee the distribution of power among humanity, guarding against any demonic attempts to overthrow the world's order. Their role involves not just battling the forces of evil but also empowering humans to resist spiritual corruption. Theologically, the Powers are seen as angelic beings endowed with great strength and authority to execute God's will concerning the maintenance of both the spiritual and physical realms. They act as guardians of the spiritual paths between heaven and earth, ensuring the cosmos remains aligned with divine order. Their duties highlight the theme of cosmic and spiritual warfare within Christian theology, emphasizing the ongoing battle between good and evil forces within the universe."},{"prompt":"What is the role of Dominions?","completion":"In Christian angelology, Dominions, also known as \\"Dominations,\\" form one of the nine choirs of angels within the celestial hierarchy. They are placed in the second triad of this hierarchy, which focuses on the governance and harmonious order of the cosmos, along with Virtues and Powers. The Dominions hold a place of authority among the angelic beings, serving as the leaders who implement God's will and ensure the universe remains in order. The primary role of the Dominions is to regulate the duties of lower angels, making sure that the cosmic order and divine commands are carried out. They act as a bridge between the higher celestial beings and the angels who directly interact with the human world. Unlike angels of the lowest triad, who are more involved in personal guidance and protection for individuals, Dominions are concerned with the bigger picture of divine governance and the laws that maintain harmony in the cosmos. Dominions are depicted as delivering the commands of God to the angels below them, ensuring that the universe operates according to divine decree. They are thought to oversee the very order of creation, coordinating the efforts of all angels to fulfill the divine will without direct interaction with humans. Through their guidance, the Dominions help maintain the balance and perfect order of the cosmos, reflecting the structure and discipline of heavenly authority in the material and spiritual worlds."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},F={key:0,class:"empty-state"},W=["disabled"],G={key:0},N={key:1};function L(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",I,[(a(!0),i(w,null,x(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",F,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
