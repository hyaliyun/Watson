Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \\"regnal\\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \\"name\\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously. For example, the same person was both King James I of England (along with Ireland) and King James VI of Scotland.

Article: \\"It hurts me more than you\\", and \\"This is for your own good\\" --these are the statements my mother used to make years ago when I had to learn Latin, clean my room, stay home and do homework. That was before we entered the permissive period in education in which we decided it was all right not to push our children to achieve their best in school. The schools and the educators made it easy for us. They taught that it was all right to be parents who take a let-alone policy. We stopped making our children do homework. We gave them calculators, turned on the television, left the teaching to the teachers and went on vacation. Now teachers, faced with children who have been developing at their own pace for the past 15 years, are realizing we've made a terrible mistake. One such teacher is Sharon Clomps who says of her students--\\"so passive\\" --and wonders what has happened. Nothing is demanded of them, she believes. Television, says Clomps, contributes to children's passivity. \\"We're talking about a generation of kids who' vet never been hurt or hungry. They have learned somebody will always do it for them, instead of saying 'go and look it up', you tell them the answer. It takes greater energy to say no to a kid.\\" Yes, it does. It takes energy and it takes work. It's time for parents to end their vacation and come back to work. It' s time to take the car away, to turn the TV off, to tell them it hurts you more than them but it' s for their own good. It's s time to start telling them no again.

Hypothesis: Bray is the first stop on the DART. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To evaluate whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's first clarify the concepts involved: 1. Premise: The last stop on the DART is Bray, a seaside resort with a beach and amusement arcades. 2. Hypothesis: Bray is the first stop on the DART. The Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) is a rapid transit railway network serving the coastline and city center of Dublin, the capital city of Ireland. The train system runs from Howth and Malahide in the north to Greystones in the south, and Bray is one of the stations located near the southern end of the line. Now, let's break down the premise and hypothesis and analyze their relationship: Premise: The statement in the premise explains that Bray is the last stop on the DART and describes it as a seaside resort with a beach and amusement arcades. This gives us information about the location of Bray in the context of the DART train system and shares some characteristics of the town. Hypothesis: The hypothesis suggests that Bray is the first stop on the DART. This statement contradicts the information provided in the premise, as it positions Bray on a completely different end of the DART train system. To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must examine if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise, meaning that it must be true if the premise is true. In this case, the premise and hypothesis present opposing information regarding Bray's position on the DART line. Since the premise states that Bray is the last stop on the DART, it cannot also be the first stop, as stated in the hypothesis. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The two statements are conflicting, and accepting the premise as true would disprove the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them. The main difference is that Norlon is inhabited by a species very similar to humans that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bothar, however, has no such species on its planet. But I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. What is an answer for this question: Which new planet has a cooler atmosphere? The answer is:","completion":"Bothar has a cooler atmosphere. Step 1: Analyze the information given about the two planets, Norlon and Bothar. It is mentioned that the main difference between the two planets is the presence of a species on Norlon that emits a lot of carbon dioxide, while Bothar has no such species. Step 2: Consider the background information on the dangers of global warming and its causes. The greenhouse effect, primarily caused by the release of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, traps heat inside the Earth's atmosphere and contributes to global warming. Step 3: Apply the background information to the planets in question. Since Norlon's inhabitants emit a lot of carbon dioxide, which contributes to the greenhouse effect, it can be inferred that Norlon's atmosphere is warmer due to the presence of this greenhouse gas. Step 4: Compare the atmospheres of the two planets based on their greenhouse gas emissions. As Bothar has no species emitting carbon dioxide, its atmosphere is less affected by the greenhouse effect and is therefore cooler compared to Norlon's atmosphere. Conclusion: Bothar has a cooler atmosphere due to the absence of species emitting carbon dioxide, which contributes to the greenhouse effect and global warming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After back-to-back losses, Dallas returned home to face the undefeated NFL Champion New England Patriots. Stout early defensive efforts kept the game close including five sacks of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, but Dallas' offense could never steadily produce results. Dallas QB Brandon Weeden (1 INT) and the offensive line were ineffectual, gaining only 264 yards total offense and making 18 1st downs. The offense could manage only two Dan Bailey field goals. During the first quarter, the Cowboys held the Patriots to a field goal.

Again TMZ has learned Charlie Sheen's car went over a cliff in the Hollywood Hills -- but Charlie was not in the car ... he was at home, when police called to report the accident. Law enforcement sources say the theft of the car -- the second such heist in 4 months -- was made easy because Charlie didn't learn his lesson. We're told Charlie left his keys in the car, which was parked in his driveway in a gated community. He did the exact same thing 4 months ago when his car was stolen and ditched on Mulholland Drive -- about a mile from where his car was ditched today. Cops have already been to Sheen's home today. Charlie told them the last time he noticed his vehicle sitting in the driveway was at around 4 p.m. He said he had no idea the car was stolen until cops showed up. Law enforcement sources say cops actually joked when they got the call early this morning that it was Charlie's car, never really believing lightning would strike twice. One law enforcement source calls the most recent incident \\"suspicious.\\" We're told detectives are going back to Charlie's neighborhood later today, to see if surveillance tape at the guard shack shows the car leaving the property. The guard shack exit is the only way out, but for some reason there was no video of the first heist. The culprits in the first theft were never caught.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: \\"The Stains\\", for the following movie plot: Corinne Burns is a seventeen-year-old girl whose mother has recently died from lung cancer. Working in a fast food restaurant to help support herself and her younger sister, Corinne is interviewed by a local television station for a story about her town's dwindling economy. During the interview, Corinne becomes angry and belligerent towards the reporter, eventually lashing out at her boss and getting fired. The segment resonates with the station's teenage viewers, who see Corinne as a kindred spirit. The station does a follow-up interview, which primarily consists of Corinne acting flippant and making sarcastic remarks to the journalist. However, she does manage to slip in a plug for her garage band \\"The Stains\\", which consists of her, her sister Tracy, and their cousin Jessica. Emboldened by appearing on television, Corinne attends a concert put on by small-time promoter Lawnboy, featuring the washed-up metal band the Metal Corpses and their opening act, an up-and-coming punk band called the Looters. Eager to end hostilities between the jaded Metal Corpses and the hedonistic Looters, Lawnboy signs the Stains without having heard them perform. Corinne and the Stains join the bands on tour, witnessing firsthand the bands' animosity towards one another, largely the result of the conflict between the aging Lou, the frontman for the Metal Corpses, and Billy, the Looters' volatile lead singer. At their first show, the Stains prove to be completely inept as a band: Neither Jessica nor Tracy can play instruments, and Corinne sings in an off-key monotone. The audience reacts angrily, prompting Corinne to lash out at them for a variety of real and perceived faults. After the show, the Metal Corpses' guitar player is found dead in the bathroom; the Metal Corpses decide to leave the tour, with Lawnboy making the Looters the new headliners with the Stains as their opening act.

The Patriots re-signed last season's star LeGarrette Blount who had been released by the Steelers earlier that week after leaving a game early. On the opening possession of the game Matthew Stafford hit Golden Tate for gains of 24 and 17 yards en route to the Patriots 34, but could only settle for a Matt Prater 48-yard field goal. Later, midway through the first quarter, the Patriots raced 64 yards in 9 plays scoring on Brady's 4-yard touchdown pass to Tim Wright. The Lions replied on their very next possession, driving 78 yards to the Patriots 2-yard line, but the Patriots and their elite red zone defense did their thing and Prater added a 20-yard field goal. It was all Patriots for the rest of the half. Danny Amendola returned the ensuing kickoff 81 yards to the Detroit 22. A 16-yard pass to LaFell and a 3-yard encroachment penalty to Ndamukong Suh moved the ball to the 3-yard line. On the very next play Blount added a 3-yard rushing touchdown, increasing the lead to 14-6. The Lions were able to drive to the Patriots 39, but were forced to punt. Taking over at their own 7, the Patriots methodically moved 93 yards in 13 plays, culminating with Brady find Wright again, for an 8-yard touchdown pass, increasing their lead to 21-6. The Lions drove to the Patriots 35 on the ensuing possession, but Prater missed a 53-yard field goal. Taking over at their own 43, the Patriots needed just four plays to reach the Lions 17 and Gostkowski closed out the half with a 35-yard field goal as they went into the locker room up 24-6. The Patriots took the opening kickoff of the half 70 yards down to the Lions 10-yard line trying to bury Detroit, but on 1st down Tom Brady was intercepted by James Ihedigbo. Like almost every possession on the day, the Lions did nothing and punted after five plays. The Patriots proceeded to march 50 yards to the Lions 25 and Gostkowski added a 43-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 27-6. After both teams swapped three-and-outs the Lions advanced to the Patriots 31, but once again settled for a Matt Prater field goal, making the score 27-9 early in the fourth quarter. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Lions reached the Patriots 25, but turned the ball over on downs after Stafford slid short 1-yard short of the first down on 4th-and-10. After making the Patriots punt, Stafford was intercepted by Logan Ryan. Starting at their own 34, the Patriots marched 66 yards in 9 plays, with LeGarrette Blount finished off the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. The Lions looked liked a team that was mentally unprepared and lackluster early on with their offense struggling to score in the red zone and made horrific mistakes. At the end of the game, controversy brewed when a defensive lineman slapped the head of Patriots long snapper Danny Aiken, who ended up missing the Chargers game with a concussion, in the head that led to a personal foul penalty and a first down. The Patriots promptly scored on the next play with a 3-yard Blount touchdown, which angered Lions center Dominic Raiola. Raiola later took out his frustration on Patriots defensive lineman Zach Moore by punching him in the back of the helmet. Tom Brady was 38 of 53 for 349 yards 2 TDs (both to Tim Wright) and 1 INTs. LeGarrette Blount added 78 yard on 12 carries and two TDs in his return. Matthew Stafford struggled going only 18 of 46 for 264 yards 0 TDs and 1 INTs. Joique Bell added only 48 yards on 19 carries. Another reason the Lions couldn't get going, Darrelle Revis locked down vaunted receiver Calvin Johson holding him to just 4 catches for 58 yards and 0 TDs. With the win, the Patriots improved to 9-2, not only running their winning streak to 7 games, but also making it the 14th straight winning season for the Patriots.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Is world’s largest indoor farm the way of the future? By Tuan C. Nguyen July 28 A worker at the indoor lettuce farm in Japan. General Electric photo. The old SONY factory located in eastern Japan’s Miyagi Prefecture is up and running again. This time around, however, it’s been resurrected as something else entirely: an indoor farm that, at 25,000 square feet, is the largest of its kind. As is the case with other indoor farms, crops are grown in conditions that hardly resemble conventional agriculture. Here, farm workers, dressed in white lab coats and face masks, take great care in maintaining a sterile environment to ensure that the vast majority of produce are harvested in a state of optimal freshness. The humid climate inside is managed with precision and rather than using soil, the plants are raised hydroponically, a method where nutrients and fertilizer is drip-fed and absorbed through recycled water in a measured, controlled manner. But the sprawling Mirai lettuce farm has a significant edge over the rest. In interviews, Shigeharu Shimamura, a botanist who serves as the company’s president, touts that, with just 1 percent of the water that’s used for irrigation, his lettuce grows more than twice as fast as lettuce grown outdoors. This translates to an average of 10,000 heads shipped out each day. The trick, he says, is in the lighting. Designed by General Electric, the LED fixtures sitting atop each stacked row of lettuce are programmed to automatically adjust their illumination in a cycle that maximizes photosynthesis during the day and breathing at night. Compared to outdoor farms, it’s estimated that artificially accelerating the maturation process can boost crop yields by as much as 50 percent. And while indoor farms typically use florescent lighting, LEDs are much more efficient, consuming 40 percent less energy. Shimamura also says that lettuce grown on the site are healthier. Having the capability to meticulously engineer how each head is produced, allows his team to produce a variation of romaine lettuce that contains eight to 10 times more beta-carotene and two times the vitamin C, Calcium and Magnesium. “The process for growing Mirai lettuce is leaf type, and not head type, so 95 percent of the portion is edible and can used conveniently at restaurants for salads and sandwiches,” Shimamura says. “In terms of quality, since Mirai leaf lettuce is fresh and soft, they are praised by children and the elderly as easy to eat.” They also are quite tasty, he says. In a way, the company’s newest facility may serve as a working vision of things to come. Researchers have warned that, as access to arable land and fresh water supplies dwindles, commercial agricultural systems will no longer be sufficient enough to feed a rapidly rising global population that’s expected to exceed 10 billion by 2050. To remedy the situation, these experts have said, would require moving away from industry practices that have long been wasteful. For instance, while farming accounts for 70 percent of water usage, most of it is lost because of inefficient irrigation methods, according to a report by the World Water Forum. A separate report, compiled by Britain’s Institution of Mechanical Engineers, also found that roughly half of the world’s produce is discarded, partly due to an abundance of crops failing to meet market standards. Japan, on the other hand, is already home to 380 enclosed farms dedicated to raising not only high-quality lettuce, but also spinach, strawberries and other produce. Local electronics giants Fujitsu, Toshiba and Panasonic have all gotten into the game, converting some of their old factories into high-tech farms. Aiding the nationwide overhaul is the country’s current administration, which recently expanded its subsidy and assistance program for those working on “advanced agriculture” projects, like the one undertaken by Mirai. “Early tests showed that using LED for growing vegetables works, but the kinds of challenges we would face for using it in a large scale factory was still unknown,” Shimamura says. “The Japanese government (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) supported us, trusting the proven test data.” One drawback is that fruits and vegetables grown at high-tech facilities tend to be significantly more expensive. A comparison by the Wall Street Journal found that a head of lettuce from a factory can retail for three times as much as other options. But now, with a system that results in higher yields and better overall efficiency, Shimamura says the company is able to sell lettuce at a price point that’s competitive with offerings from traditional farms. Mirai, which runs 25 plant factories, plans to expand its operations overseas and open facilities in Mongolia, Hong Kong, Russia and China. Shimamura and his team are also exploring ways to adapt their indoor farming system to grow a wider range of crops. “I’d like to try some business that combines factory techniques and traditional agriculture, but mostly I’d like people to know that factory-grown vegetables are ultimately safe,” he says. “So far people have had little opportunity to taste them but I expected that to change in the future.” SECTION: {section=national/on-innovations, subsection=null}!!!

Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B. Which zone is a result of algae overgrowth, zone A or zone B? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, zone A is a result of algae overgrowth. Step 1: Identify the dead zone - Zone A is described as a dead zone, located near agricultural lands. Step 2: Understand the cause of dead zones - As per the hint, rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, and runoff carries it away to bodies of water. The fertilizer contains nitrogen, which stimulates algae growth. In turn, the algae consume carbon dioxide in the water. Step 3: Analyze the algae's role in creating dead zones - Once the algae die, decomposers break down their dead tissue. This process uses up the oxygen in the water, leading to dead zones, where there's too little oxygen for anything to grow. Step 4: Relate the given information to the zones - Since zone A is declared as a dead zone, it exhibits the characteristics mentioned above, including algae overgrowth and low oxygen levels. Therefore, zone A is the result of algae overgrowth, while zone B, near a national park, is not a dead zone and hence not affected by the same issue."},{"prompt":"Given the question: The answer to the question: Who asks the family servant to kill the high-born drunken cad? is inside the article: Sire Alain de Maletroit, plots revenge on his younger brother Edmond for stealing Alain's childhood sweetheart, who died giving birth to Edmond's daughter Blanche.

Fact 2: Sunlight Green plants require sunlight in order to grow. Given the two facts above, what are parts of the ecosystem? A:","completion":"An ecosystem refers to all the living organisms and the non-living environment interacting and functioning together within a specific area. Given the facts stated, we can focus on two primary components of an ecosystem: 1. Biotic components: These are the living components of an ecosystem. They can be categorized on the basis of their life forms or their functional roles in the ecosystem. a. Producers (autotrophs): These are green plants which contain chlorophyll and can produce their own food through a process known as photosynthesis. Producers serve as the basic food source for all other life forms in an ecosystem. They take in energy from the sun, water from the soil, and carbon dioxide from the air to generate glucose, a basic energy source for many organisms. b. Consumers (heterotrophs): These organisms cannot make their own food and hence depend on producers or other consumers for their sustenance. They can be further categorized into primary consumers (herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivores and omnivores), and tertiary consumers (top predators). c. Decomposers: These are organisms such as fungi and bacteria that break down dead plants and animals into simpler substances, returning essential minerals to the soil and water bodies, effectively recycling them within the ecosystem. 2. Abiotic components: These are the non-living physical and chemical components in an ecosystem which influence the living organisms. This includes elements such as: a. Sunlight: This is the primary energy source for an ecosystem. It drives photosynthesis in plants, enabling them to produce food and energy. b. Soil: It provides essential nutrients, water, and physical support for plants to grow. c. Water: All living things require water. It also serves as a habitat for many organisms. d. Air: Provides oxygen for respiration and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. e. Temperature: Influences the physiological functioning of organisms. f. Humidity: Impacts evaporation and transpiration in plants. g. Wind: Affects the dispersal of seeds, spores, etc. Therefore, it can be concluded that parts of an ecosystem would include sunlight given it is a primary source of energy, and green plants, which are an example of producers and essential for life in the ecosystem. But we should also consider biotic components, such as other producers, consumers, and decomposers, as well as abiotic components like soil, water, air, temperature, wind, and humidity.

During a discussion over dinner in late 2000, the band members decided they wanted to explore dancehall-style rhythms for their next album. Drawing inspiration from artists such as Bounty Killer, Cutty Ranks, and Mr. Vegas, the band began work on the album in January 2001 by creating beats on Pro Tools at guitarist Tom Dumont's apartment. The group often tried recreating beats from other song files on the computer, which resulted in modified versions of the original rhythms. They worked with producer Philip Steir at Toast Studios in San Francisco during this time, where the beginnings of \\"Hey Baby\\" emerged. When writing lyrics for previous albums, Stefani typically read works by Sylvia Plath that would make her depressed \\"or find different words that inspire me.\\" In contrast, for Rock Steady she wrote the lyrics quicker and on the spot to meet the goal of writing a song a day. Many of the demos recorded during these early sessions were used in the final tracks, rather than completely reworking the songs. The band saw this as a way to preserve the \\"initial spark\\" from when the songs were conceived.The next month, Stefani left Los Angeles for London to visit boyfriend Rossdale, and the band traveled with her to finish recording \\"Detective\\". There, they worked with Eurythmics member David A. Stewart and wrote the song \\"Underneath It All\\" in only 10 minutes. In March, No Doubt traveled to Jamaica, staying at the Blue Lagoon in Port Antonio. The band \\"spent most of the time swimming and getting sunburned and drinking and smoking and recording a little music\\", according to Dumont. The group would often have Red Stripe beers or rum and cokes with jerk food for breakfast; on one occasion, Dumont passed out from heavy drinking while recording a track. They began work in the mid-afternoon and worked into the night, with an after-party following the session. The group..., what would be the answer ?

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If the rotor rotates more (faster), it will have a direct effect on generating MORE electricity. This is because the increased spinning speed of the rotor within the core, surrounded by magnets and wire loops, will lead to a greater rate of change in the magnetic field. This, in turn, will induce a stronger electromotive force (EMF) in the wire loops, resulting in a higher electric current and ultimately generating more electricity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I was introduced to the amazing range of handmade products from Okoii back in July and intended to post reviews in early September; however, was struck down with a particularly potent uterine parasite that left me comatosed on the couch each evening by about 8.00pm, so blogging had to take a massive back step. Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!). Yoko assured me that this soap was incredibly gentle and was not at all drying. Lucky for her I am... According to the above context, answer the following question. What product is the author likely to buy next time they need a facial cleanser? Answer:","completion":"The author is likely to buy the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap from Okoii next time they need a facial cleanser. This is because it was their absolute favorite of all the Okoii products they tried and they found it to be incredibly gentle and not at all drying, despite their initial fear of using soap on their face. Additionally, they appreciate the freshness and handmade nature of Okoii products, which further contributes to their preference for this particular facial cleanser."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which film saw Sean Connery's last portrayal of James Bond????","completion":"Sean Connery's last portrayal of James Bond was in the 1983 film \\"Never Say Never Again.\\" The film was not an official part of the long-running Eon Productions Bond series; instead, it was produced under the Warner Bros. banner by TaliaFilm II Productions, with distribution handled by Warner Bros. Pictures. The movie is often called an \\"unofficial\\" Bond film because of its separate production from the main series. \\"Never Say Never Again\\" is essentially a remake of the 1965 official Bond film \\"Thunderball.\\" Kevin McClory, one of \\"Thunderball's\\" co-writers, held the filming rights for the story and produced this version having Sean Connery back as James Bond. The film's title arose from a conversation between Connery and his wife, who jokingly said that he should \\"never say never again\\" about reprising his role as James Bond. In this film, Connery's Bond is called out of retirement to recover two stolen nuclear warheads that are being used by SPECTRE, an international criminal organization led by mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld, played by Max von Sydow. Bond must work alongside his former love interest Domino Petachi (Kim Basinger), who is unknowingly aiding SPECTRE, and confront deadly assassin Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera) to foil the nefarious plot. Although \\"Never Say Never Again\\" fell outside the official Bond series, Connery's return to the role garnered attention and put his portrayal back in the spotlight. His performance was praised by critics, and many fans enjoyed seeing their favorite Bond actor back in action once more. Ultimately, Connery's final appearance as James Bond in the film marked the end of an era, concluding his time as the iconic character."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: who won the english civil war in the end?","completion":"The English Civil War, fought from 1642 to 1651, was a series of armed conflicts and political disputes between the Parliamentarians (also known as \\"Roundheads\\") and the Royalists (also called \\"Cavaliers\\") over the governance of England. In the end, the Parliamentarians emerged as the victorious party in this struggle, and their win marked a significant turning point in British history. It is important to note that the English Civil War was not a single continuous conflict but rather a series of interconnected wars and events spanning nearly a decade. To better understand the outcome, it is helpful to break down the conflict into three main phases: 1. First Civil War (1642-1646): The war began in 1642 when tensions between King Charles I and the English Parliament reached a breaking point. These tensions arose due in part to religious disagreements, political power struggles, and the King's disregard for the Magna Carta and its principles. The First Civil War saw the majority of the fighting between Royalist and Parliamentary forces, with some significant battles taking place at Edgehill, Marston Moor, and Naseby. Parliament's New Model Army, led by Sir Thomas Fairfax and with Oliver Cromwell as a significant military figure, ultimately defeated the Royalist forces in this first phase. 2. Second Civil War (1648-1649): Despite the Royalist defeat in the First Civil War, tensions between the crown and Parliament continued to grow. King Charles I was held captive, and he managed to negotiate a secret treaty with the Scots to reinstate him to power. In response, this provoked another bout of fighting that eventually resulted in the defeat of the Royalist-Scot alliance by the New Model Army. 3. Third Civil War (1649-1651): Following the execution of King Charles I in January 1649, England was declared a republic, known as the Commonwealth of England, under the leadership of the newly-formed Council of State. However, Charles II, the son of Charles I, was proclaimed king in Scotland, which triggered the third phase of the conflict. Several key battles, such as the Battle of Dunbar and the Battle of Worcester, were fought between the New Model Army, now under the command of Oliver Cromwell, and the Scottish Royalist forces. Charles II's forces were decisively defeated and he had to flee into exile, marking the end of the Third Civil War and the English Civil Wars as a whole. In conclusion, the Parliamentarians, led by notable figures such as Sir Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell, emerged victoriously from the English Civil War. After the war, England saw a significant shift in power from the monarchy to the republican government, with the establishment of the Commonwealth of England. The Commonwealth period lasted until 1660 when the monarchy was restored with the return of Charles II to the throne. Nevertheless, the impact of the English Civil War and the Parliamentarians' victory had far-reaching, lasting effects on the constitutional system and political landscape of England for centuries to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we've been talking about. If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority. Can we draw the following conclusion? they believe education should be their main goal.","completion":"Yes, based on the given information, we can conclude that the speaker believes education, particularly early learning and pre-school, should be their main goal. This conclusion is drawn from the following key points: 1. The speaker emphasizes the importance of early learning and pre-school, stressing that more focus should be placed on these areas. Early childhood education is a critical stage in children's development, as it lays the foundation for future learning and success. Prioritizing early education can significantly impact a society, as it helps children to develop crucial social, emotional, and cognitive skills, setting them on a path for future academic and professional achievements. 2. The speaker links their priorities to the larger context of budget allocation and tax policies. They voice concern about squandering the surplus on massive tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthiest individuals. By expressing this concern, the speaker implies that resources should instead be directed towards social programs and investments that benefit a broader range of citizens, such as education. Allocating resources to education, especially early learning and pre-school, showcases the speaker's commitment to investing in the future generation and building a more equitable society. 3. The speaker argues that if the surplus is spent on tax cuts benefiting mostly the wealthy, it restricts the ability to make education the top priority. This statement demonstrates their belief that education should be considered a primary goal that warrants proper funding and resources. By opposing the allocation of funds towards tax cuts, the speaker argues for a more balanced distribution of resources, ensuring that education is not overlooked as a critical area of investment. In conclusion, the speaker believes that education, specifically early learning and pre-school, should be their main goal. They express concerns about the allocation of funds in a manner that might favor the affluent and limit the ability to prioritize education. Redirecting resources and attention towards early learning and pre-school can contribute to building a strong foundation for a more educated and successful society in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In early 1542, Polin successfully negotiated the details of a Franco-Ottoman alliance for the Italian War of 1542-1546, with the Ottoman Empire promising to send 27,500 troops against the territories of the Spanish king Ferdinand, as well as 110 galleys against Charles, while France promised to attack Flanders, harass the coasts of Spain with a naval force, and send 40 galleys to assist the Turks for operations in the Levant. Polin tried to convince Venice to join the alliance, but in vain. The execution of the alliance would most notably lead to the Franco-Ottoman Siege of Nice in 1543. In July 1543, Polin sailed on board the Ottoman fleet of Barbarossa to the Île Saint-Honorat in the Lérins Islands off Cannes on 5 July 1543, only to find very little ready for the offensive on the French side. Polin went to see king Francis I of France to obtain troops, which led to the Siege of Nice in August 1543. Polin supervised the wintering of the Ottomans at Toulon.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Where did the person who is re-making the Sissinghurst garden serve before taking on the project? from the following article ? John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators.

Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 467*j + 56781 + 50819 = 11918*j - 691*j for j.","completion":"Alright little buddy, let's solve this math problem together. We have the equation: 467 * j + 56781 + 50819 = 11918 * j - 691 * j First, let's simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, we can add 56781 and 50819 together: 467 * j + 107600 = 11918 * j - 691 * j Now, on the right side, we have two parts with 'j' in them. We can put them together like this: 467 * j + 107600 = (11918 - 691) * j This simplifies to: 467 * j + 107600 = 11227 * j Now, we want to get all the 'j' parts on one side of the equation and all the numbers on the other side. Let's move 467 * j to the right side by subtracting it from both sides: 107600 = 11227 * j - 467 * j This simplifies to: 107600 = 10760 * j Now, to find the value of 'j', we just divide 107600 by 10760: j = 107600 / 10760 And that simplifies to: j = 10 So, the answer is j = 10.

What is missing in Singapore's social safety net? Why was LOL released in India and Singapore before the U.S.? Do those questions have the same meaning? Pick from: a). no. b). yes.","completion":"a). no. Those two questions do not have the same meaning. They are asking about completely different topics. The first one is about a social issue related to social security or welfare systems in Singapore, and it requires an analysis of the social policies, structure of welfare programs, possible areas of improvement or factors overlooked by the system in this specific country. Singapore has a somewhat different structure compared to Western countries when it comes to social safety nets. Its approach is based on the philosophy of self-reliance and family support, backed up by governmental help as the last resort. Public housing, healthcare insurance, and retirement savings are all compulsory and taken right from the paycheck. However, the 'missing' elements may be categorized into three main domains: 1. Limited Coverage: Some critics argue that the existing safety nets only cater to specific, lower-income categories of the population and omit others. For example, single, unemployed adults without family support may not receive adequate assistance. 2. Insufficient Measures: Some people believe that the current measures might not be enough for those in need. They argue that although the state provides benefits like healthcare insurance and retirement savings programs, the costs of living (especially medical costs) mean that the elderly or individuals with families could still be subjected to financial stress. 3. Individual responsibility emphasis: The major criticism of Singapore's social safety net is that it places heavy emphasis on individual responsibility for one's welfare, which detracts from communal responsibility for vulnerable members of society. The second question is about the release strategy of the movie \\"LOL\\" in different countries, particularly India and Singapore in comparison to the U.S. It seeks to know why the movie was launched in these two countries before it was in the U.S. The release strategy for movies is usually based on a number of factors including the target audience, movie content, potential market performance, strategic marketing decisions, competition in the box office during the release period, or even logistic issues.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How did this impact Ottoman life?\\" is in \\"Over the course of Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts. A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th Century. Sultan Mehmet II ordered Georgios Amiroutzes, a Greek scholar from Trabzon, to translate and make available to Ottoman educational institutions the geography book of Ptolemy. Another example is Ali Qushji -an astronomer, mathematician and physicist originally from Samarkand- who became a professor in two madrasas, and influenced Ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students, even though he only spent two or three years before his death in Istanbul.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"The mentioned text provides valuable insights into the impact of intellectual pursuits and cultural influx on the life in the Ottoman Empire. From a broader perspective, it seems safe to conclude that these effects were quite significant and multifaceted. First, the Ottoman emphasis on building libraries and amassing a large collection of translated and original books signifies a profound interest in knowledge acquisition and preservation. This not only underlines the significance the empire had placed on intellectual activities but also indicates the depth and diversity of the intellectual life. The commitment to building libraries would have contributed to a society where knowledge was highly valued, potentially leading to increased literacy rates, a more educated public, and the emergence of a more informed and thoughtful society. Furthermore, the act of translating valuable texts from other cultures, as exemplified by Sultan Mehmet II's orders to translate Ptolemy's geographic book, imparts a sense of openness to foreign ideas and intellectual diversity within the Ottoman society. Such enlightenment and embrace of multicultural knowledge have likely stimulated intellectual growth, promoted cultural assimilation, and fueled progress and innovation. The transfer and exchange of ideas from other cultures may have helped foster an environment of intellectual curiosity and tolerance for different viewpoints, thereby engendering a dynamic and inclusive society. Lastly, the influence of figures like Ali Qushji, a notable scholar of astronomy, mathematics, and physics, underscores the significance of academic pursuits in Ottoman life. As a professor in madrasas and through his writings, Qushji would have had a considerable impact on the educational system, shaping the minds of students and the academic circles. Such contributions, despite his relatively short stay in Istanbul, highlight the potential role of educators in shaping thought and forwarding scientific and scholarly progress in Ottoman society. Therefore, in summary, the impact of these actions on Ottoman life was profound and enduring. They played vital roles in shaping a society that prized knowledge, was open to diverse intellectual and cultural influences, and appreciated the role of education in guiding its progress and evolution. These inherently would have contributed to the development and sophistication of Ottoman social, cultural, intellectual, and even political life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Santi Cazorla has been a bit hit and miss this season, but he was outstanding against Newcastle United. He scored twice — the perfect present on his 30th birthday — and was at the heart of an Arsenal performance that was a joy to watch. For his first goal he took an excellent touch, rode a challenge and then hit a delightful chip into the corner. It would have been very easy for him to go down in the area, but he stayed on his feet and was rewarded with a goal. Santi Cazorla didn't go down to score the first of his two goals against Newcastle on Saturday. The Spaniard also scored a cheeky 'Paneka' penalty to seal Arsenal's 4-1 victory at the Emirates. Cazorla wheels away to celebrate his goal in a victory that had Gooners singing Arsene Wenger's name. Olivier Giroud (left) is congratulated by Danny Welbeck after also scoring twice against the Magpies. That was good to see on a day where too many players were diving, including West Brom’s Sebastien Pocognoli, who took a theatrical tumble. PS The diving this weekend was bad but another problem is the high foot. Last week Eliaquim Mangala was booked for an ugly high lunge and Cheick Tiote was lucky not to be sent off for catching Alexis Sanchez on Saturday. It’s a worry because it’s the kind of challenge that can cause serious damage. West Brom’s Sebastien Pocognoli (left) was one of several players taking theatrical dives at the weekend. Cheick Tiote's (right) high footed challenge on Alexis Sanchez deserved to be shown a red card. SUPER FRANK IS AT IT AGAIN. Frank Lampard must have an invisibility cloak. That’s the only reason I can think of to explain why so many teams still let him make those late runs into the area to score. Lampard has hit plenty of 30-yard screamers in his time, but if you had to describe his winner for Manchester City at Leicester, you’d have to say: ‘Oh, just the usual.’ Frank Lampard steals in to score Manchester City's match winning goal against Leicester on Saturday. Despite scoring as many Premier League goals as Thierry Henry, opponents still struggle to pick up Lampard. Manchester City's win keeps the pressure up on Lampard's former club Chelsea at the top of the table. Arriving late in the box is his trademark, but still teams let him do it. When he is in the final third you have to mark him because if you don’t, he will punish you. Esteban Cambiasso is so experienced but the way he let Lampard in made me wonder if he’d ever seen him play before. At this level, attention to detail is everything and you cannot afford to let a player like him have five yards of space in a crowded area. He even pointed to where he wanted the ball! It’s such an obvious weapon, but Leicester didn’t do enough to try to stop it. PS It seems Man City will have ‘discussions’ with New York City about extending Lampard’s stay. Considering City own the New York club, it won’t exactly be a tricky conversation... City: Frank’s doing well, isn’t he... mind if we keep him a bit longer? NYC: Well, you do actually own us, so in a way he’s your player... City: Of course he is! Pleasure doing business with you! SZCZESNY ON SONG. Wojciech Szczesny has had his critics in the past but he made an excellent save against Papiss Cisse on Saturday night and is impressing me. He came on to our Sky panel show, A League of Their Own, last week and he struck me as a really nice young man. He was game for a laugh, got stuck in and at 24 is mature beyond his years. Wojciech Szczesny celebrates Arsenal's victory, which included an exceptional save against Papiss Cisse. The Arsenal No 1's skills between the sticks are more impressive than his singing voice. The Pole could go on to rival David Seaman (centre) as arguably Arsenal's greatest ever keeper. David Seaman was nearly 27 by the time he arrived at Arsenal and is arguably the club’s greatest goalkeeper. Szczesny has a long way to go to match that, but he has a bright future. The only downside was his singing. He had to do a duet with Chesney Hawkes. It’s a good job his goalkeeping is better than his singing! BURNLEY HIT BACK. Burnley bounced back from defeat at QPR with an excellent result against Southampton. Ashley Barnes puts his hands behind his ears after scoring the winner for Burnley against Southampton. Burnley have picked up almost a point a game on average, which would ultimately see them earn survival. Ronald Koeman has seen Saints slump after a better than expected start to his Premier League campaign. In the past 10 years, teams have needed an average of around 37 points to stay up — that’s about a point per game. So Burnley will be pleased with 15 points from 16 games, all things considered. For Southampton it was disappointing, but that shows how well they have done under Ronald Koeman. Expectations are perhaps too high because they are doing brilliantly. 1997 - Dusan Tadic was something of a penalty specialist at FC Twente, with 11 scored over two seasons. But the Serb missed the chance to give Southampton the lead from the spot at Burnley on Saturday. The last time Southampton missed a Premier League penalty was way back in April 1997, when Jim Magilton missed against West Ham. 83.3% - Juan Mata has scored five goals from just six efforts on target this season. That puts his conversion rate at an impressive 83.3 per cent. 4th - Santi Cazorla became the fourth Arsenal player to score on his birthday after Yossi Benayoun, Robert Pires and Paul Merson. 92 - It only took Stoke 92 seconds to equalise at Crystal Palace on Saturday. After James McArthur hit the opener for the home side, Peter Crouch replied just over a minute and a half later for the visitors. 3 - Tom Huddlestone's red card at Stamford Bridge means he has now been sent off in three straight seasons. He previously went seven seasons without a red. 63.3% - Crystal Palace completed just 63.3 per cent of their passes against Stoke. Only 10 times this season have teams completed less than 65 per cent — on five occasions it was Palace. 2 - It was not a good day for Aston Villa’s Kieran Richardson. His red card after 22 minutes was the second fastest this season after James Chester’s against Stoke. Also, his two PL red cards have come against his old clubs — West Brom and Man United.

This article: Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that released Off the Wall?, what is it ?

CONTEXT: Recepción El Intempo es visto por muchos analistas como un ejemplo de la crisis económica y financiera en España provocada por el estallido de una burbuja inmobiliaria en 2007. En el momento de inicio del proyecto, la industria de la construcción se encontraba todavía en fase de expansión, marcada por una gran especulación. Entre los años 2006 y 2008, según los promotores, ya se habían vendido sobre plano cien pisos, un 40 % del total, pero desde entonces apenas se han vendido veinte más. En numerosas notas de prensa aparecía siempre este dato, incluso se justificó la posibilidad de que las obras prosiguieran a pesar de la crisis porque se contaban con fondos suficientes al haberse vendido sobre plano un 40 % de las viviendas.

Please answer the following question: - Several types of gases form in the atmosphere - May come from different sources - The gases remain trapped in the atmosphere - Through the suns light the gases hold in heat and energy - Trap them in our atmosphere What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process, following the trapping of gases and heat in the atmosphere, is the intensification of the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change. Various types of gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases, are emitted into the atmosphere from both natural and human-caused sources. These gases, often referred to as greenhouse gases, trap heat and energy from the sun's light in the atmosphere, preventing them from escaping back into space. When the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increases, the capacity to trap heat and energy also increases, resulting in the strengthening of the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a natural process vital for maintaining the Earth's temperature; without it, our planet would be too cold to support life. However, human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial processes have drastically increased greenhouse gas emissions, thereby intensifying the greenhouse effect to unprecedented levels. The last step in this process is when the enhanced greenhouse effect causes the Earth's average temperature to rise, leading to global warming. Global warming, in turn, prompts a series of consequences that affect our climate system, biodiversity, and human societies. Some of these consequences include more frequent and severe weather events (e.g., heatwaves, storms, and floods), melting ice caps and rising sea levels, shifts in climatic zones and habitats, ocean acidification, and negative impacts on agricultural productivity and human health. In conclusion, the last step of the process outlined in the question involves the intensification of the greenhouse effect due to the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which results from both natural and anthropogenic sources. This amplified greenhouse effect leads to global warming and various consequences for the Earth's climate system, ecosystems, and human wellbeing. To mitigate these effects, it is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and develop alternative, sustainable energy sources, as well as adapt to the changing environmental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: houston police chief calls for independent investigator to look into crime lab 's troubles Text:","completion":"Houston Police Chief Calls for Independent Investigator to Look into Crime Lab's Troubles In a recent move highlighting the increasing demand for transparency and accountability within law enforcement establishments, Houston's Police Chief has publicly called for an independent investigator to delve into the issues plaguing the city's crime lab. This has come in response to a growing concern over reports of possible errors, inefficiencies, and biases within the lab, which has subsequently led to questions being raised about the reliability of evidence and, ultimately, the integrity of the criminal justice system in Houston. The decision to call for an independent investigator serves to illustrate the commitment of the city's police force to maintain the highest possible standards and to be accountable for its actions. It demonstrates that the Houston Police Department (HPD) is willing to confront and rectify problems, rather than resorting to denial, cover-ups, or attempts at damage control that may only serve to exacerbate the situation and diminish public trust. For years, Houston's crime lab has been the subject of scrutiny and criticism, with multiple cases illustrating inaccuracies in evidence analyses and processing. Instances of DNA contamination, mislabeling of evidence, inadequate staff training, and poor chain of custody procedures have all become familiar issues. These recurring concerns have cast doubt on the veracity of the evidence and have led to increased calls from the community and advocacy groups for more stringent oversight and investigations into the crime lab's performance. In response to these concerns, the Houston Police Chief has acknowledged the need for an independent investigator to thoroughly review the operations, protocols, and procedures of the crime lab. By seeking a third-party opinion, the HPD aims to restore confidence in the crime lab's ability to provide accurate, unbiased, high-quality results that uphold the values of the criminal justice system. The selected independent investigator would be given unrestricted access to pertinent records, procedures, and personnel within the lab, with the primary objective of identifying potential areas of improvement. Recommendations made by the investigator would then be presented in a formal report, with an emphasis on rectifying any procedural issues, strengthening the crime lab's capabilities, and ensuring transparency moving forward. The Houston Police Department aims to rebuild trust with the local community and show its dedication to continuous improvement and learning. As the city's police force takes these important steps to address the concerns surrounding the crime lab, it is hoped that the willingness to confront these issues head-on will ultimately serve to improve the performance of the lab, bolster public trust, and ensure that the criminal justice system in Houston remains fair, transparent, and effective. By inviting external scrutiny and monitoring, the Houston Police Department is demonstrating the importance of transparency and setting the stage for other law enforcement agencies to follow suit. In conclusion, the request for an independent investigator to look into the issues at Houston's crime lab is a pivotal moment that signals a concerted effort to restore confidence in the city's criminal justice system. By embracing transparency, committing to finding solutions, and accepting responsibility, the Houston Police Department is taking a step forward towards improving the effectiveness, fairness, and integrity of its operations. With this call to action, Houston's crime lab may now have the opportunity to emerge as a model of excellence for other law enforcement agencies around the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you fix that?","completion":"Accessibility has led to a surge of popularity. The growing accessibility of various products, services, and information has significantly contributed to their booming popularity in recent years. This surge can be attributed to several interconnected factors that have transformed how people interact with the world around them and made it easier for individuals to access what they need or want. First and foremost, technological advancements have played a pivotal role in enhancing accessibility. The internet, smartphones, and numerous applications have bridged geographical gaps and connected people from different corners of the world. This increased connectedness has enabled individuals and businesses to reach out to global audiences and opened up new opportunities for knowledge transfer, commerce, and social interaction. Secondly, the democratization of information has facilitated the widespread availability of resources and knowledge. The internet has become an indispensable source of information, providing users with easy access to news, research, educational materials, entertainment, and much more. This has led to a global shift in the power dynamics and contributed to the surge in popularity of various internet-based services like social media, online learning platforms, and e-commerce websites. Thirdly, the growth of the sharing economy has made it more convenient for individuals to access goods and services while also creating new opportunities for businesses. Platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit have revolutionized their respective industries by making transportation, accommodation, and everyday tasks readily available to consumers. This sharing model has significantly improved accessibility and affordability, thereby contributing to the surge in popularity of these services. Moreover, increasing societal awareness about the importance of accessibility has resulted in more inclusive policies, design, and infrastructure. Governments and businesses have begun to recognize the essential nature of accessibility for people with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups. As a result, efforts are being made to create accessible products and services that cater to the unique needs of these individuals, thereby expanding their reach and popularity. Additionally, the rise of accessibility and convenience has also had a knock-on effect on the quality of products and services. As businesses recognize the potential of being more accessible, they have been compelled to improve their offerings to stay competitive and relevant. This focus on quality has raised the bar across numerous industries, leading to higher customer satisfaction and increased popularity. In conclusion, the increased accessibility of products, services, and information has been a major driver in their surge in popularity. Technological advancements, the democratization of information, the sharing economy, greater inclusivity, and an emphasis on quality have all contributed to this trend. These developments have not only transformed how we interact with the world around us but have also created new opportunities for growth and innovation, fostering an environment where accessibility and convenience continue to thrive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

Trivia question: In what country did the Tamil Tigers wage a civil war? And the answer is?","completion":"The Tamil Tigers, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), waged a civil war in Sri Lanka. This island nation is located in the Indian Ocean, near the southeastern tip of India. The civil war, which occurred between 1983 and 2009, was a violent and protracted conflict primarily involving the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE. The root of the conflict can be traced to ethnic and political tensions between the majority Sinhalese population, which is predominantly Buddhist, and the minority Tamil population, which is largely Hindu. The Tamils had long-standing grievances regarding perceived marginalization and discrimination in political, educational, and economic spheres by the Sinhalese-dominated government. The Tamil Tigers, founded in 1976 by Velupillai Prabhakaran, sought an independent Tamil homeland called \\"Tamil Eelam\\" in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. The LTTE initially carried out guerrilla warfare tactics, including assassinations, bombings, and armed assaults. As the conflict escalated, the group gained notoriety for its use of suicide bombings, making them one of the most dangerous and feared insurgent organizations in the world. The Sri Lankan civil war was marked by numerous atrocities and human rights abuses committed by both the LTTE and government forces, leading to a significant loss of life and widespread suffering for the civilian population. The war garnered international attention with several failed attempts at peace negotiations led by regional and global powers, including India and Norway. Finally, after decades of conflict, the Sri Lankan military managed to defeat the Tamil Tigers in 2009, culminating in the death of their leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran. This effectively brought an end to the civil war. The aftermath has seen ongoing tensions and reconciliation efforts to address the root causes of the conflict and the need for equitable political representation, power sharing, and rehabilitation of affected populations in Sri Lanka."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Paragraph: Greg's grandma is a culinary expert. She is also very eager to teach others how to make great foods. One day she taught Greg how to make candied fruit. Greg was so excited about it that he bought two baskets of fruits, basket A and basket B, to make some candied fruits. He used the basket A fruits to make some candied fruits, but was too lazy to use the basket B fruits. He just kept the basket B fruits on his kitchen top. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fruits' moisture would not be absorbed from within, basket A fruits or basket B fruits?

Process: - Bacteria enter the body - Bacteria start to divide and grow - The uncontrolled growth takes away resources from other cells - Other cells cannot function properly - We feel unwell - The growth and division of bacteria produce toxins - Toxins harm the body - The body tries to react to the toxins - The body&#x27;s natural defenses can sometimes cause us to feel unwell. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a sterilized surface is touched happens, how will it affect the disease will progress more slowly. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation in this case refers to the introduction of a sterilized surface being touched, which we can interpret as an attempt to reduce the presence of bacteria and minimize the risk of infection. This proposed change could indeed have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. Direct effects: 1. Reduced bacterial transmission: By touching a sterilized surface instead of a contaminated one, the number of bacteria transferred to the person's hands or skin could be greatly diminished. This would likely result in a reduced bacterial load entering the body, possibly delaying the onset of infection or even preventing it altogether. 2. Slower bacterial growth rate: If there are fewer bacteria to begin with, it may take longer for them to multiply and reach a level where they can cause illness. This delay could provide the body's immune system with more time to recognize and mount a defense against the invading bacteria, potentially making the person less likely to experience symptoms or at least reducing the severity of the illness. Indirect effects: 1. Improved hygiene: The act of sterilizing surfaces on a regular basis encourages better overall hygiene practices. By maintaining a cleaner environment, there is a decreased chance of encountering bacteria that could cause illness. This could indirectly lead to a reduced risk of infection and slowing down or preventing the progression of the disease. 2. Heightened awareness: If people are more vigilant about sterilizing surfaces and practicing good hygiene, they may also become more aware of other potential sources of infection, such as contaminated food or water, sick individuals, or poor personal hygiene habits. This increased awareness could lead to a lower likelihood of coming into contact with bacteria, thus reducing the chances of the disease progressing more slowly or not at all. In conclusion, the perturbation of sterilized surfaces being touched can directly reduce the number and growth rate of bacteria entering the body, and indirectly facilitate overall improved hygiene practices and heightened awareness. Both direct and indirect effects can contribute to a lower probability of the illness occurring or progressing more slowly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Read this: From about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to neoclassicism, the Greek Revival. There was little to no direct knowledge of Greek civilization before the middle of the 18th century in Western Europe, when an expedition funded by the Society of Dilettanti in 1751 and led by James Stuart and Nicholas Revett began serious archaeological enquiry. Stuart was commissioned after his return from Greece by George Lyttelton to produce the first Greek building in England, the garden temple at Hagley Hall (1758–59). A number of British architects in the second half of the century took up the expressive challenge of the Doric from their aristocratic patrons, including Joseph Bonomi and John Soane, but it was to remain the private enthusiasm of connoisseurs up to the first decade of the 19th century.

That's what scientists at Rutgers University-Newark claim in a new genetic study of Pantala flavescens, also known as the wandering glider, per Discovery News. Populations of the dragonfly, which is only 1.5 inches long, have been found on every continent except Antarctica, but all have similar genetic profiles, reports Newsweek. They're actually so similar that researchers say they're likely traveling across huge distances—more than 4,400 miles—and breeding with each other. Monarch butterflies were previously thought to be the longest migrating insects, fluttering 2,500 miles one way across North America. Pantala not only crushes that record, but is in \\"competition with whales and birds for being the longest migrators,\\" says study author Jessica Ware. \\"If North American Pantala only bred with North American Pantala, and Japanese Pantala only bred with Japanese Pantala, we would expect to see that in genetic results that differed from each other,\\" Ware adds in a release. \\"Because we don't see that, it suggests the mixing of genes across vast geographic expanses.\\" The dragonflies seem built for the journey with \\"increased surface areas on their wings that enable them to use the wind to carry them,\\" Ware says. \\"They stroke, stroke, stroke, and then glide for long periods, expending minimal amounts of energy.\\" It is a \\"kind of suicide mission,\\" but the insects make the trek to escape dry seasons because they need freshwater to lay eggs. In fact, when a dragonfly spots freshwater, it will often lay eggs, wait for them to hatch, then resume its journey with its offspring in tow. (This tiny songbird also crosses an ocean.)","completion":"The extraordinary depths of the natural world never cease to amaze, as scientists unravel the astonishing capacity of one of the world's smallest organisms, the dragonfly, to undertake a journey that spans across continents. This minute yet mighty creature, the Pantala flavescens, also known as the wandering glider, has been found to be the world's longest-distance flier, trumping a wide range of birds, whales, and even monarch butterflies according to a study from Rutgers University-Newark. Though a mere 1.5 inches in length, the wandering glider embarces an adventurous streak in its genetic code. Researchers have discovered that this dragonfly species that are scattered across all continents except Antarctica, are unified by very similar genetic profiles. This unyielding genetic similarity across populations of the dragonfly across the globe intrigued the scientific community. The observance of this strong genetic affinity led researchers to deduce that these dragonflies were likely embarking on extensive journeys covering distances of more than 4,400 miles, intermingling and interbreeding along the way. To put this phenomenal feat into perspective, monarch butterflies, which held the previous record for being the longest migrating insects, traverse a distance of 2,500 miles across North America. These wandering gliders don't just overshadow the migration record held by butterflies, but they even rival the prodigious migration patterns of whales and birds. Jessica Ware, the esteemed author of the study, emphasizes the monumental scope of this discovery, contending that if these dragonflies were breeding within their continental populations, their genetic profiles would showcase stark differences. However, the absence of such genetic variation corroborated the theory of their transcontinental journey. Dragonflies are anatomically designed for these extended migratory missions furnished with \\"increased surface areas on their wings that enable them to use the wind to carry them,\\" according to Ware. Not unlike expert glider pilots, they make efficient use of their wing strokes, adopting a rhythmic pattern of accelerated strokes followed by long glides, which minimizes energy expenditure. In a sense, these dragonflies undertake what can be equated to a \\"suicide mission\\", as this journey is precipitated by the dragonfly's survival instincts in order to escape arid seasons. They are heavily dependent on freshwater for reproducing, and when faced with a scarcity of freshwater due to the dry season, they embark on this dangerous transoceanic migration. Upon sighting freshwater, these dragonflies would take a pit stop to lay eggs, allowing them to hatch, and then resume the journey, offspring in tow. Pantala flavescens, unbeknownst to the untrained eye, is teeming with a host of intriguing evolutionary characteristics that challenge our understanding of the limitations of biological beings, reminding us yet again that nature is replete with awe-inspiring phenomena waiting to be discovered."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hunter had many tattoos on her body and Kenneth didnt because","completion":"he believed his unblemished skin was a canvas that should remain untouched. They were an unconventional couple, the kind of people who turned heads when they walked down the street. You see, Hunter, with her wild, unruly hair, the color of a fiery sunset, and Kenneth, with his prim and proper attire, seemed like they were from two entirely different worlds. Hunter was a free spirit, the type who lived life moment by moment, never tied down by any single plan or ambition. Instead, she chose to collect experiences, stories, and everlasting memories that her tattoos so beautifully represented. Each one was symbolic, each one a colorful narration of the ups and downs of her life's journey. Friends and strangers alike were often captivated by her inky chronicles, and she would happily share the tales of her tattoos in solemn whispers or raucous laughter. Kenneth, on the other hand, was a creature of habit and routine. His days were well-ordered and predictable, a stark contrast to the chaotic existence of his significant other. Kenneth was happiest when things were planned and accounted for, when there was a system in place to ensure that nothing went awry. He was a firm believer in living a disciplined, almost ascetic, life, and it was these very qualities that propelled him to success in his career. And yet, for all their differences, the love between Hunter and Kenneth was real, raw, and undeniable. It was the kind of love that most people can only dream of, a connection so deep that it almost seemed to transcend human understanding. They made each other laugh, they made each other cry, and they challenged one another in ways that neither had ever been challenged before. In their quiet hours, they often found themselves entwined on a threadbare rug in their tiny apartment, discussing the world and their place in it. On nights such as these, the moonlight would stream through the cracked windows, clothing the room in a silvery glow that seemed to make time stand still. And it was during these conversations that Hunter would often trace the lines of her tattoos, delicately caressing the inked stories of her life. On one such evening, Kenneth was moved by a sudden, intense curiosity. \\"Hunter,\\" he began, the faintest hint of a tremor in his voice, \\"Why do you have so many tattoos? I understand the importance they hold for you, how they serve as markers of significant events in your life, but what caused you to choose this particular form of self-expression?\\" Hunter paused for a moment, taken aback by the profundity of the question. But then, slowly, deliberately, she began to weave her tale. \\"You know, Kenneth, I first got a tattoo when I was eighteen - barely an adult, really. I had just lost my older brother, the person who meant the world to me. He was my rock, my guiding light, and without him by my side, I felt lost and alone.\\" \\"The tattoo I got back then was a small, simple design - some stars and a crescent moon, hidden just below my collarbone. And as I was branded with that ink, I realized that my tattoos could serve as permanent reminders of the people, experiences, and emotions that shaped me into the person I am today. Tattoos become my voice when I have no words, my strength when I feel weak, and my compass when I have no direction. They are living, breathing stories that I carry with me always.\\" Kenneth listened, rapt, his eyes filled with a newfound understanding and respect for the woman before him. And in that moment, their love for one another seemed to glow with a renewed fervor, a testament to two souls who had discovered a priceless treasure, buried deep beneath their unique tattoos and unblemished skin. As different as they were, they shared a love that could ignite the brightest fire and silence the stormiest seas; a love that endured beyond the surface, beyond their peculiar external dynamic, and tethered them together, like two celestial bodies swept up in the great cosmic dance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pale or yellowish skin: Hemoglobin gives blood its red hue; thus, low levels result in a paler skin complexion. 4. Dizziness or lightheadedness: Decreased blood oxygen levels could lead to dizziness and lightheadedness due to reduced oxygen delivery to the brain. 5. Headaches: Insufficient oxygen supply to the brain might trigger headaches. 6. Cold hands and feet: Inadequate oxygen levels can cause a decrease in blood circulation, leading to cold extremities. 7. Rapid or irregular heartbeat: The heart needs to pump more blood to compensate for the lack of oxygen, which could result in tachycardia or irregular heartbeat. 8. Chest pain: Severe anemia can lead to chest pain due to the strain on the heart muscles. The severity of symptoms is contingent on the reduction of the hemoglobin level and the development rate of anemia. Hence, some people might experience mild symptoms while others would confront more serious manifestations. Testing for Hemoglobin Levels To identify the cause and severity of low hemoglobin levels, medical professionals conduct a combination of tests: 1. Complete Blood Count (CBC): The first and most common test is CBC, measuring the hemoglobin levels along with red and white blood cells, platelet count, and other blood components. Generally, a hemoglobin level below 13.5 g/dL for men and 12 g/dL for women is considered low. 2. Reticulocyte count: This test measures the number of young red blood cells produced by bone marrow to determine the cause of low hemoglobin. 3. Blood iron levels: Iron-rich foods or iron supplements might be necessary for patients with low iron levels causing anemia. 4. Vitamin B12 and folic acid tests: Deficiencies in B12 or folic acid may result in low hemoglobin levels and might require supplementation. 5. Bone marrow tests: In rare cases, patients undergo bone marrow tests to identify the production of red blood cells or other underlying issues. 6. Hemoglobin electrophoresis: This test assesses the types of hemoglobin present in your blood to identify any genetic conditions causing anemia. Other Medical Conditions Causing Low Hemoglobin Several medical conditions can contribute to or cause low hemoglobin levels, including: 1. Nutrient deficiencies: A lack of essential nutrients, like iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid can lead to a reduced production of hemoglobin. 2. Hemolytic anemia: This condition involves the premature destruction of red blood cells, resulting in low hemoglobin levels. 3. Bone marrow disorders: Conditions like myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia, or lymphoma can impact the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. 4. Chronic kidney disease: The kidneys produce erythropoietin hormone, stimulating red blood cell production. Impaired kidney functioning leads to a decrease in erythropoietin levels, causing anemia. 5. Infections or inflammation: Certain infections and inflammations release cytokines, which can negatively affect red blood cell production. 6. Genetic disorders: Conditions such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and hereditary spherocytosis impair red blood cell function and reduce hemoglobin levels. Conclusion Low hemoglobin levels, if left undiagnosed or untreated, can lead to substantial health impacts. Therefore, recognizing the symptoms and seeking timely medical intervention is essential for effective treatment and improved quality of life. Furthermore, understanding the medical conditions associated with low hemoglobin can help tailor the appropriate therapeutic approach and better manage existing health issues."},{"prompt":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: The acting and plot are bad, but what really makes this film bad is one of the worst fight choreographing i have ever seen. The actors look like this is the first time have ever held a sword, and they hold back on their swings so as to not hurt the other actors - which looks totally fake. Some scenes the actors swing the swords and the person they are fighting is not ever on the screen, adn after they swing, they cut to a new camera angle with the swords alredy touching, and just add in the sound effect. And as for the arrows, I don't recall seeing any in flight. Draw the bow(but don't release), and then a new camera angle with the arrow already sticking out of the enemy wiht a sound effect of the impact.

Highlighting the potential for state and non-state actors to commit genocide in the 21st century, for example, in failed states or as non-state actors acquire weapons of mass destruction, Adrian Gallagher defined genocide as 'When a source of collective power (usually a state) intentionally uses its power base to implement a process of destruction in order to destroy a group (as defined by the perpetrator), in whole or in substantial part, dependent upon relative group size'. The definition upholds the centrality of intent, the multidimensional understanding of destroy, broadens the definition of group identity beyond that of the 1948 definition yet argues that a substantial part of a group has to be destroyed before it can be classified as genocide (dependent on relative group size). Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Which writer examined the possession of identity?","completion":"The question about a specific writer who examined the possession of identity is quite broad, as several writers and thinkers in various fields, such as philosophy, sociology, and psychology, have explored the concept of identity. However, one influential writer who delved into the idea of identity and its possession is French philosopher Michel Foucault. Michel Foucault was a prominent 20th-century philosopher and social theorist who deeply examined the construction and possession of an individual's identity from various angles. His works such as \\"Madness and Civilization,\\" \\"The Birth of the Clinic,\\" \\"The Order of Things,\\" \\"Discipline and Punish,\\" and the three volumes of \\"The History of Sexuality\\" investigate power dynamics, institutions, and discourses that contribute to an individual's sense of self. Foucault's works explore how institutions, power relationships, and social norms shape our identity and determine the ways in which we understand and express ourselves. He focused on the concept of \\"technologies of the self,\\" which are techniques individuals use to understand and shape their own identities. Therefore, when discussing the examination of the possession of identity, Michel Foucault is a key writer who contributed to this understanding. However, it is essential to mention that numerous other writers and thinkers have similarly explored the topic of identity, such as Erving Goffman, Judith Butler, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Sigmund Freud."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On a hot summer day in late June, Jaiden Rogers looks like every other 12-year-old boy avoiding the blistering heat. Sitting on a chair in the living room of his Alamosa, Colorado, home, he watches The Twilight Zone and then plays on the computer in his Harry Potter-themed bedroom. But he only wishes that he could actually be like other boys his age, his mother Natalie Rogers tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue. That’s because six years ago, in January 2013, Jaiden was diagnosed with stiff skin syndrome — an extremely rare disease that slowly causes his entire body to harden. “His skin is basically like stone,” says Natalie, 51. “It’s like tapping on a countertop.” The disease first started in his thigh and has quickly made its way though his hips, stomach and back — causing unbearable joint and muscle pain. Now, as it spreads to his chest area, Jaiden is also battling breathing issues. While the hardening of the skin isn’t fatal in itself, doctors say it could restrict his chest and lung cavity, eventually leaving him unable to breathe. Because the damage that has already been done to his body is irreversible, Natalie and her husband, Tim Rogers, are determined to stop the disease from progressing before Jaiden “becomes entombed within himself.” Natalie and Jaiden Rogers Courtesy Rogers Family According to Dr. Margarita Saenza, a clinical geneticist at Children’s Hospital Colorado who treats Jaiden, the first case of the syndrome was reported in 1971. Since then, only a few dozen people around the world have been diagnosed. “What’s happening is almost a scarring — a fibrotic change to the skin itself,” Dr. Saenz tells PEOPLE. Unfortunately, Jaiden’s life has been challenging from the beginning. He was born to a single mom, the older sister of one of the two children — Heather, now 29, and Ilysa, now 27 — that Natalie and Tim adopted years earlier. When the Rogers learned that Heather’s sister was struggling to care for Jaiden, then 2, they became his legal guardians. Jaiden Rogers Courtesy Rogers Family • For much more on the Jaiden Rogers story, pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday. “We spent the first few years teaching him how to speak, playing with him, and just trying to be a family,” says Natalie. At age 5, Jaiden was diagnosed with autism, which limits his ability to have conversations with others. It was just one year later that Tim first felt a hard spot on Jaiden’s right thigh. Biopsy results later revealed his unimaginable diagnosis. “We were so confused at first,” says Tim. “We couldn’t believe there were no answers because it’s so rare. We couldn’t find anyone else who had it.” The family is now in a race against time to find a treatment that could potentially cure their little boy. And with mounting medical bills — which are only getting higher every month — they’ve created a GoFundMe page to help. Their expenses also include making a four-hour drive once a month to Children’s Hospital Colorado in Denver, where they stay for a few days and meet with doctors who are working on Jaiden’s case. Tim and Jaiden Rogers Courtesy Rogers Family “We’ve taken out three mortgages on our home,” says Natalie, “and have spent Tim’s retirement. There is nothing else we can do.” Watch the full episode of People Features: The Little Boy Turning Into Stone, streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device. Jaiden is also undergoing chemotherapy, which has helped slow the progression of his disease and takes strong pain medications throughout the day, which cause him to sleep for up to 18 hours. Adding to their challenges are Natalie’s own health issues. In 2016, she was diagnosed with Friedrich’s Ataxia, a degenerative and potentially fatal neuromuscular disorder that causes a decline in muscle control and coordination. “It gets hard sometimes to care for Jaiden when I’m having to take care of myself,” says Natalie, who is a stay at home mom. “That’s where Tim comes in and takes over.” While Jaiden’s future is filled with unknowns, both Natalie and Tim are still hopeful that he has one. “You do whatever you have to do,” says Tim. “We won’t stop trying. One way or another, we’ll do what’s best for Jaiden.” ||||| The parents of the 12-year-old boy who was diagnosed with stiff skin syndrome — which is causing his entire body to harden— is refusing to give up on finding a cure that could save their little boy’s life. Jaiden Rogers, of Alamosa, Colorado, has lived with the extremely rare condition for half his life. In September 2012, his father, Tim Rogers, felt a hard spot on Jaiden’s right thigh. Biopsy results the following January revealed he has the condition. Only a few other dozen people in the world share his diagnosis. Ultimately, Jaiden could “become entombed within himself,” and become bedridden, according to his mother, Natalie Rogers. And while the disease isn’t fatal in itself, it could restrict his chest and lung cavity, eventually leaving him unable to breathe. “We hit walls all the time,” Natalie, 51, tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue. “Not enough people have this so there’s nobody to talk to.” Because it’s so rare, there has been little research into the condition. But his genetics specialist, Dr. Margarita Saenz at Children’s Hospital Colorado, says she is hopeful. “Even in the last decade of genetic medicine as a whole we’ve seen amazing things that we never thought were possible,” she tells PEOPLE. “Particularly with Stiff Skin Syndrome. We’re not there yet for a cure or gene therapy kind of intervention, but really as fast as technology is moving, it’s within the possible.” • For much more on the Jaiden Rogers story, pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday. She adds: “Technology continues to advance so our diagnostic capabilities get better.” Courtesy Rogers Family Both Tim and Natalie continue to reach out to doctors almost daily to see if they know of any treatment that could save him. “Maybe there is a medication out there that is being used for something else that could be used for Jaiden to try,” says Tim, 53. “We’ve been contacting geneticists both in the United States and in Europe.” There is a stem cell treatment in Europe that focuses on rare skin diseases, according to Natalie. But the cost is over one million dollars. “Money is in the way,” says Natalie. “We just want our boy to live.” Adds Tim: “We just keep plugging away and trying to find something. We do what we have to do.” To help raise money for a possible treatment and to help with the family’s mounting medical bills, they’ve created a GoFundMe page.

Stiff skin syndrome is an ultra-rare condition discovered in the early 1970s where the skin and inner tissues begin to harden, leading to limited joint mobility. Little is known about the condition, including the cause or treatment. It's only been reported 41 times throughout history. \\"Nobody is really looking at it because there’s just not a lot of people that have it in the world,\\" said Tom Rogers, Jaiden's father. \\"So, we reach out to doctors all over the place.

Question: Process: - The consumer throws aluminum cans and foil into a recycle bin - The aluminum is collected - Taken to a treatment plant - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned ready for reprocessing - The aluminum is re-melted - Turned into molten aluminum - The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out - The rolled out product is made into new aluminum products. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more rain that falls happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in rainfall could potentially lead to more aluminum cans being recycled. While rainfall may not have a direct impact on the aluminum recycling process, it could have several indirect effects that may ultimately influence the amount of aluminum cans being recycled. Let's examine some of these potential indirect effects and their implications for the recycling process. 1. Increased public awareness and environmental concerns: With an increase in rainfall, people might be more inclined to think about environmental issues, especially if the increase in rainfall is due to climate change. This could lead to a greater awareness of the importance of recycling, possibly promoting more individuals to recycle their aluminum cans and foil, thus increasing the amount of aluminum being recycled. 2. Influence on waste collection and transportation: Excessive rainfall could lead to disruptions in the waste collection and transportation system. For example, roads may become flooded, or collection services might face difficulties in operating under heavy rain conditions. This could result in delays or disruptions in the transportation of aluminum from the recycle bins to the treatment plants, indirectly affecting the recycling process. However, once the rain subsides, the collection and transportation of aluminum might return to normal, and the overall recycling rate is likely not significantly impacted in the long run. 3. Impact on the treatment plant operations: Treatment plants that handle the sorting and cleaning of aluminum might also be affected by increased rainfall. There may be a need to accommodate excess water in the plants, which could result in modifications to the sorting and cleaning process. However, these changes might not necessarily lead to a reduction in the number of aluminum cans being recycled, as this would depend on the efficiency of the new processes implemented. 4. Changes in consumer behavior: An increase in rainfall could influence consumer behavior, leading people to purchase more beverages in aluminum cans because they are less likely to be outdoors and more likely to consume drinks indoors. This could lead to a greater demand for aluminum cans, and in turn, an increase in the number of cans being recycled. Overall, while the supposed perturbation of increased rainfall might not have a direct effect on the aluminum recycling process, its various indirect effects could influence the amount of aluminum cans being recycled. These indirect effects could either increase or decrease the number of cans being recycled, depending on factors such as public awareness of environmental issues, the efficiency of waste collection and transportation systems, the capability of treatment plants to adapt to changing conditions, and consumers' purchasing habits amidst the increased rainfall."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Drought is major concern in the Midwest.

More generally, \\"Long Island\\" may also refer collectively both to the main Island as well as its nearby, surrounding outer barrier islands. North of the island is the Long Island Sound, across from which lie the states of Connecticut and a small part of Rhode Island across the Block Island Sound.

The new centre is run by Ludovic-Mohamed Zahed, a gay Islamic scholar, married to a gay man, and the founder of Homosexual Muslims of France. Mr Zahed regularly attends the Grand Mosque in Paris, but says he wants to create a more \\"inclusive\\" place for gay, lesbian and transgender Muslims. He says many of them felt uncomfortable praying in established mosques. \\"Many gay men don't go to the mosque because they don't want to be recognised,\\" says Mr Zahed. \\"They don't want to be ostracised because they wear earrings or because they're effeminate or they're transgender, something that's pretty obviously rejected in many mosques in France,\\" he says. Mr Zahed's South African gay husband has encountered similar problems. \\"The first time he came to the mosque he was wearing earrings. After the prayers somebody came up to him and tried to take them off and told him, 'This isn't right, you shouldn't do that here'. It was a kind of soft but very obvious aggression,\\" says Mr Zahed. He cites another recent case of what he describes as discrimination. \\"A transgender from a Muslim background died last summer. It was hard to find an imam to pray for her. Nobody wanted to. In the end, we had to do it. We had to pray for her,\\" says Mr Zahed. For the moment the place of worship is a room in a Buddhist prayer hall. The room holds more than 20 people and is decorated with calligraphy in Chinese characters. London Imam Ajmal Masroor says that Mr Zahed's meeting room does not constitute a mosque as it does not fully adhere to Islamic preaching and practice. Mr Zahed says his \\"mosque\\" is not trying to be specifically gay-friendly, but \\"inclusive\\". He is also trying to integrate the sexes in Islam. He wants men and women to be able to pray together, not just \\"gay and straight\\". Men and women pray together in Mecca, he says, so why can't they in ordinary mosques? So far the reaction from the rest of the Muslim community in France has been mixed. France has the largest Muslim community in Europe outside Russia. The Paris Grand Mosque has issued an unequivocal statement. \\"The fact that he's opening a mosque or a prayer room is something that's outside the Islamic community. The Koran condemns homosexuality. It is banned,\\" said a Grand Mosque spokesman. Other Muslims have been intrigued enough to ask Mr Zahed how he justifies his stance. \\"People are trying to understand who we are, where we come from, what our interpretation of this or that verse of the Koran is, and that's diversity and dialogue and I'm happy with it,\\" says Mr Zahed. He also says he has received messages of support from ordinary Muslims in France. He is, however, concerned enough about the safety of his new congregation to be reticent about revealing exactly where it will be meeting. At the moment Mr Zahed is not getting any special protection from the French police and the French authorities have told him they are not aware of any specific threats from within the Muslim community. But he is still concerned about violence \\"or a simple demonstration\\". Not least because if there are \\"demonstrations [outside] or threats when you are trying to get in, it's not going to be a peaceful context to be connected to each other and to pray\\". Traditionally, Muslim religious authorities have opposed gay sex. They argue that the Koranic authority for this is the story of God's destruction of the city of Sodom because of its citizens' sins. \\"Homosexuality is a choice, it's a desire, it's not something that you are born with,\\" says the London imam Ajmal Masroor. Homosexuality is not acceptable for either Sunni or Shia Muslims, he says, because God intends for sex to occur between men and women only, within marriage, and \\"any sexual relationship outside marriage is a sin\\". However, that does not mean that Muslims should discriminate against homosexuals, says Mr Masroor. Mosques are open to everyone. Rather than trying to separate themselves homosexuals should be attending mosque like other Muslims, argues Mr Masroor. But they should not be trying to change the religion. \\"If you join Islam, you must conform to Islamic teachings.\\" Mr Zahed says that \\"Islam has nothing to do with homosexuality\\". \\"Islam is not a totalitarian fascist identity. You should not use Islam to justify your prejudices and try to control the sexuality and gender of individuals,\\" he says. Ludovic-Mohamed Zahed spoke to Newshour on the BBC World Service. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Ludovic-Mohamed Zahed, a gay Islamic scholar, has established a more inclusive place for gay, lesbian, and transgender Muslims to pray in France.

(CNN) -- Mohammad Idrissou put Cameroon on course for a spot in the African Nations Cup quarterfinals with a late winner in a topsy-turvy 3-2 Group D victory over Zambia. Zambia bossed the first half and went ahead inside 10 minutes through Jacob Mulenga. A terrible mistake from Zambia keeper Kennedy Mweene allowed Geremi to equalise and Samuel Eto'o gave Cameroon the lead in the 72nd minute. Christopher Katongo thought he had earned a point with an 82nd-minute penalty but Idrissou had the last word for Cameroon just four minutes later. The Indomitable Lions were looking to ignite their campaign after a shock 1-0 defeat by Gabon in their opening match, which was also a first loss for manager Paul Le Guen. But it got worse for the four-time champions in only the eighth minute, and it was experienced center-back Rigobert Song who was the architect of his own side's downfall. Felix Katongo swung in a great cross from the left and, in attempting to head behind, Song instead drew a point-blank save from his keeper. Carlos Kameni, though, could only push the ball out to Mulenga, who was left with a simple tap-in. Zambia should have doubled their lead before half-time.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing. Question: Why were the family singing? === The answer to the above question is","completion":"that the family was singing to share the hymns from their former home, Sudan, with the congregation at Tar Wallet Baptist Church in rural Virginia. By sharing their Arabic songs, they were able to participate in the worship service and contribute to the spiritual experience, while also celebrating their cultural heritage and expressing their faith in their new community. As Christians from Sudan, where the government has escalated its persecution of religious minorities like Christians, the family faced challenges in practicing their faith openly. Hassan Abduraheem, a former pastor in Sudan, was even detained under accusations of espionage. After a difficult journey and substantial assistance, his family found refuge in the United States, where they could freely practice their religion and share their faith with others. By joining the Tar Wallet Baptist Church congregation and singing their Sudanese hymns, the family was not only integrating themselves into the American religious community but also demonstrating their resilience and perseverance. In doing so, they served as a testament to the power of faith in overcoming adversity while fostering understanding and unity between different cultures and religious traditions. In this context, their singing symbolized hope, gratitude, and the enduring spirit of human connection through shared spiritual experiences."},{"prompt":"Question: Information: - Enrica Bianchi Colombatto (born 23 July 1942 in Brescia, Lombardy) is an Italian actress, usually known by her stagename of Erika Blanc. - Emmanuelle is the lead character in a series of French soft porn erotic movies based on a character created by Emmanuelle Arsan in the novel \\"Emmanuelle\\" (1959). - A Man for Emmanuelle ( Italian : Io , Emmanuelle ) is a 1969 Italian drama film directed by Cesare Canevari and starring Erika Blanc . - Marayat Rollet-Andriane formerly Marayat Krasaesin or her birthname Marayat Bibidh (born 19 January 1932 12 June 2005), known by the pen name Emmanuelle Arsan, was a French novelist of Eurasian origin, best known for the novel featuring the fictional character Emmanuelle, a woman who sets out on a voyage of sexual self-discovery under varying circumstances.

It was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot.

More than that, I didn't wait to see. The photography and the interplay between the characters were superb, but THERE WAS NOTHING for them to DO.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Researchers have found more evidence that suggests a relationship between races and rates of lung cancer among smokers. A new study shows that black people and Native Hawaiians are more likely to develop lung cancer from smoking. It compared their risk to whites, Japanese-Americans and Latinos. Researchers at the University of Southern California and the University of Hawaii did the new study. The New England Journal of Medicine published the findings. The eight-year research studied more than 180,000 people. They included present and former smokers and people who never smoked. Almost 2,000 people in the study developed lung cancer. Researchers say genetics might help explain the racial and ethnic differences. There could be differences in how people's bodies react to smoke. But environmental influences, including the way people smoke, could also make a difference. African-Americans and Latinos in the study are reported smoking the fewest cigarettes per day. Whites are the heaviest smokers. But the scientists point out that blacks have been reported to breathe cigarette smoke more deeply than white smokers. This could fill their lungs with more of the chemicals in tobacco that cause cancer. Scientists know that some diseases effect different groups differently. And some drug companies have begun to develop racially targeted medicines. Last June, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved a drug designed to treat heart failure in black patients. The name is BiDil.

It is essential to analyze different aspects of the review to better understand the reviewer's perspective and feelings towards the book. The review starts with a mixed tone, as it acknowledges the \\"good story\\" but points out that it was \\"ineffectively told.\\" So, it offers some positive praise for the premise but criticizes the author's narrative approach. The negative aspects of the review focus primarily on the book's style and character development. The reviewer takes issue with the inconsistent point of view (POV), as the book frequently switches between first and third person, making the plot \\"frustrating and confusing.\\" Furthermore, they mention that the characters have \\"very little depth,\\" which suggests dissatisfaction with the characterization and emotional connection.

They have released six studio albums, one video album, four extended plays, thirteen singles and thirteen music videos. The band chose \\"Kittie\\" as their band name because the name \\"seemed contradictory\\". Kittie formed in 1996 when Fallon Bowman and Mercedes Lander met in gym class. Until March 2005, Kittie were signed to Artemis Records but parted ways with the label due to \\"a proposed amendment to the recording budget for the pending fourth Kittie album.\\" Problems between the group and record label had been long speculated. In March 2004, Artemis and Kittie came to an out of court settlement over unpaid royalties and eleven breaches of contract by Artemis. On March 23, 2005, Morgan Lander reported that both Lisa Marx and Jennifer Arroyo had left the band. Jennifer Arroyo's split was amicable while Lisa Marx's came as a surprise. As with Talena Atfield's departure from the band, unjustified rumours about financial reasons were cited; and in the case of Jennifer Arroyo, the desire to work outside of Kittie full-time was an additional factor. Jennifer Arroyo would go on to join Billy Graziadei of Biohazard to form Suicide City. In 2005, Kittie added two new members: Tara McLeod on guitar and Trish Doan on bass. In 2005, Morgan and Mercedes Lander's clothing line, Poisoned Black clothing, started. Morgan and Mercedes also appeared briefly in the documentaries Metal: A Headbanger's Journey and Heavy Metal - Louder than Life. On February 7, 2006, Kittie released their Never Again EP through Rock Ridge Music. Also in 2006, vocalist Morgan Lander provided vocals on the song \\"It Turns to Rust\\", from the album In the Arms of Devastation, by the Canadian death metal band Kataklysm. Kittie created their own record label, Kiss of Infamy Records and used it to release their fourth studio album. The label name was later changed to \\"X of Infamy\\" after a cease-and-desist letter from attorneys representing Kiss Catalog Ltd. (the owner of the intellectual property rights pertaining to the musical group Kiss) alleging that the Kiss of Infamy trademark was \\"confusingly similar\\" to their client's trademark. Kittie's fourth studio album Funeral for Yesterday was released on February 20, 2007 through their record label. Along with the release of Funeral for Yesterday, Morgan Lander announced that Kittie would release a 45-minute-DVD with the CD. In February 2007, Kittie toured as part of the Funeral for Yesterday Tour alongside Walls of Jericho, 36 Crazyfists, Dead To Fall, and In This Moment.

These stories included tales of monsters and other incredible creatures. What type of creature do you know that could inspire such stories? Of course, dinosaur fossils were once mistaken for dragons bones. Two thousand years ago, people discovered fossils in China. At the time, they were thought to be dragon bones. We know now that these were not bones, but fossils. So what is the difference? Question: \\"What did these stories consist of?\\" Answer: \\"humans\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"The given answer, \\"humans,\\" is not the correct answer to the question. The question asks about the content of the stories that were inspired by fossils in ancient times. To provide a more detailed and appropriate answer: The stories inspired by fossils in ancient times often consisted of myths and legends about fantastical creatures, monsters, and events that were used to explain the mysterious origins and characteristics of the fossils. When people discovered dinosaur fossils, they did not have the scientific knowledge to understand them as remnants of ancient, extinct species. Instead, they integrated these discoveries into their existing cultural narratives and belief systems, often attributing them to supernatural or otherworldly beings. For example, in ancient China, dinosaur fossils were mistakenly believed to be the bones of dragons, leading to the incorporation of dragons into various myths and tales as powerful, wise, or fearsome creatures. Similarly, in ancient Greece, people believed that the fossils belonged to heroes and giants from a bygone era. In both cases, the fossils led to the creation of fascinating stories that captured the human imagination and shaped their understanding of their world and its history. As scientists developed the field of paleontology and made ongoing discoveries, it became clearer that these fossils belonged to long-extinct species of animals, like dinosaurs, and not mythical creatures. Thus, the stories and the role of fossils in them serve as a captivating chronicle of humanity's evolving understanding and interpretation of the Earth's past and the lifeforms that have inhabited it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms.

Ebola in Liberia Maternal Health It took more than two years for the massive Ebola outbreak to sputter out, and some countries are still under heightened surveillance. More than 28,600 people were infected with the virus in West Africa, and more than 11,300 of them died. Now, researchers are looking into the toll the epidemic took on the people who survived. In a new report published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine, researchers looked at the results of a survey conducted by the nonprofit Last Mile Health in Rivercess County, Liberia, a rural area where Ebola transmission was limited and where the health facilities stayed open during the outbreak. Because Ebola sparked a widespread fear of health centers—due to worries that the virus could be contracted at hospitals where infected people were being treated—the researchers decided to study whether that fear continued to cause people to stay away from health care centers for their medical needs, like childbirth. The implication of this kind of fear is especially important for pregnant women, because hospital births are considered far safer in this region than home births. The researchers looked at the odds that women gave birth in a health care facility before the outbreak compared to during, and found a 30% drop in health facility births. Since the region the researchers surveyed wasn’t as hard hit by Ebola compared to other places, the researchers argue the drop in births in health care facilities is likely greater in other areas. “Women who didn’t deliver at health facilities were at greater risk that emergencies would lead to dangerous outcomes — including the death of the mother or newborn,” study author John D. Kraemer, an assistant professor of health systems administration at Georgetown University, told TIME in an email. “It is much safer for women to deliver in a health facility because delivery conditions are safer than at home and because, if she has an emergency such as bleeding or obstructed labor, it will be recognized sooner and she can be treated faster.” Based on national survey data, the researchers say the likelihood that a birth happened at a facility was 41% lower among women who held the belief that Ebola was or may be transmitted in health facilities. The economic turmoil caused by the virus could also be partially responsible. For instance, women may not have been able to afford transportation to the facilities. “Our findings are consistent with other research from throughout the countries most affected by Ebola,” says Kraemer. “Using a variety of different approaches, there is evidence that the epidemic harmed everything from malaria prevention and vaccination to childhood disease treatment to HIV care.” In the long run, the researchers argue there’s a need to build more resilient health systems so that epidemics are identified faster without such tragic consequences. “That, of course, requires substantial, continued investment,” says Kraemer. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The Ebola outbreak in West Africa caused a fear of health centers, leading to a 30% drop in women giving birth in healthcare facilities, which made births less safe for mothers and newborns.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... Please answer this question : Which company's potatoes would be more herbicide tolerant, PepsiCo or Kettle Foods? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given situation, PepsiCo is supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers, while Kettle Foods is supplying non-GMO potato seeds. GMO crops, such as the ones being supplied by PepsiCo, are known for increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance, and herbicide tolerance. Since herbicide-resistant seeds have a gene implanted into their genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, it is more likely that the potatoes supplied by PepsiCo would be more herbicide-tolerant than those supplied by Kettle Foods. This is due to the genetic engineering techniques used in creating the GMO potato seeds, which have integrated the desired herbicide tolerance trait. On the other hand, Kettle Foods' non-GMO potatoes may not have the same level of herbicide tolerance since they are not genetically modified for that specific characteristic."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Attaching radio devices to it is difficult and visual sightings are too unreliable to give real insight into its behavior. So biologists were delighted early this year when, with the help of the US Navy, they are able to track a particular blue whale for 43 days recording its sounds. This was possible because of the Navy's former top secret system of underwater listening devices across the oceans. Tracking whales is but one example of an exciting new world just opening to civilian scientists after the cold war as the Navy starts to share and partly uncover its global network of underwater listening system built over the decades to track the ships of potential enemies. Earth scientists announced at a news conference recently that they had used the system for closely observing a deep-sea volcanic eruption for the first time and that they planned similar studies. Other scientists have proposed to use the network for tracking ocean currents and measuring changes in the ocean and global temperatures. Different layers of ocean water can act as channels for sounds focusing them in the same way a stethoscope does when it carries faint noises from a patient's chest to a doctor's ear. This focusing is the main reason that even relatively weak sounds in the ocean, especially low-frequency ones, can often travel thousands of miles. What can we infer from the passage? A) New radio devices are developed for tracking the blue whales. B) Blue whales are no longer endangered with the new system. C) Opinions differ on the use of military technology. D) Military technology has great potential in civilian use. A:","completion":"From the passage, we can infer that \\"Military technology has great potential in civilian use\\" (Option D). Details from the passage explain how a former top-secret Navy system of underwater listening devices, originally designed to track enemy ships, has become a valuable resource for scientists for various non-military purposes like tracking blue whales, studying volcanic eruptions under the sea, and potentially tracking ocean currents and measuring changes in ocean and global temperatures. The passage does not provide any information about new radio devices developed for tracking blue whales (Option A), the end of the endangerment of blue whales due to the new system (Option B), or differing opinions on the use of military technology (Option C)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kelly is a prostitute who shows up in the small town of Grantville, just one more burg in a long string of quick stops on the run after being chased out of the big city by her former pimp. She engages in a quick tryst with local police captain Griff, who then tells her to stay out of his town and refers her to a cat-house just across the state line. Instead, she decides to give up her illicit lifestyle, becoming a nurse at a hospital for handicapped children. Griff doesn't trust reformed prostitutes, however, and continues trying to run her out of town. Kelly falls in love with J.L. Grant, the wealthy scion of the town's founding family, an urbane sophisticate, and Griff's best friend. After a dream-like courtship where even Kelly's admission of her past can't deter Grant, the two decide to marry.

The game started slowly, with just three scores in the first half. Detroit struck first with a 90-yard drive, highlighted by an 87-yard pass from Matthew Stafford to Calvin Johnson and capped when the two connected again on a fourth-down 2-yard TD pass. Dallas got a second quarter field goal of 53 yards by Dan Bailey to make the score 7-3. On the Lions next possession, Sean Lee intercepted Stafford for the second time in the game and returned the ball 74 yards to the Lions 4 yard line. Two plays later, Tony Romo hit Dez Bryant with a 5-yard TD pass, giving Dallas a 10-7 halftime lead. Bailey converted on another 53-yard field goal in the third quarter, putting the Cowboys up 13-7. David Akers narrowed the lead to 13-10 with a 20-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter. But Dallas struck on their next possession when Tony Romo connected with Terrance Williams on a 60-yard TD pass play, putting them up by 10. Detroit's Joique Bell capped an 80-yard drive with a 1-yard TD run to cut the lead to 3 again, at 20-17. Dallas again went up 10, as Romo and Bryant hooked up for their second TD pass play of the day, this one going 50 yards. The Lions came back with a 1-yard TD run by Reggie Bush, on a drive that featured a key 54-yard pass from Stafford to Calvin Johnson, cutting the lead to 27-24. The Lions lost the ball on downs with 1:24 left in the game, but Dallas could only take 22 seconds off the clock before Dan Bailey put them up 30-24 with a 44-yard field goal. The Lions began an improbable 80-yard TD drive with just 1:02 remaining on the clock and no time-outs left. Stafford hit Kris Durham with a key 40-yard pass that put the ball at the Cowboys' 23. Stafford then hit Calvin Johnson with a 22-yard pass on the next play that got the ball to the Dallas 1, but the clock was still running. Instead of spiking the ball to stop the clock after the Lions quickly lined up, Matthew Stafford lunged over a pile of linemen and stretched the ball over the goal line for the tying touchdown, with David Akers' extra point giving the Lions a 31-30 victory. The Lions tallied 623 yards of total offense on the afternoon. Stafford was 33-of-48 for 488 yards and one touchdown. Most of his passing yards were to Calvin Johnson, as the Lions wideout caught 14 balls for 329 yards and one touchdown. Johnson set an NFL record for receiving yards in a regulation game, and was just 7 yards short of the full game record of 336 yards set by Flipper Anderson in a 1989 overtime game. Calvin also tied Lance Alworth's all-time NFL mark with his fifth career game of 200 or more receiving yards.

Take your notes out and compare them to your from-memory draft. If there’s anything major you forgot to include, put it in your second draft. Rather than jumping around to different parts of the story or article, you should explain what happened in the sequence that it happened. This is especially important for summarizing works of fiction. Sometimes in an article or book, the author might make the same point multiple times as a way to underline their main points. In your summary, you don’t need to do this. When you’re rereading your summary, delete any repetitive points – even if the author makes them multiple times, you only need to make them once. If you notice an author has made the same point multiple times, though, it’s a good indicator that this is an important point, and it should definitely be in your summary. If you’re focused on getting all of the main points down, you might not be paying attention to how the paragraphs of your summary fit together. When you revise, make sure that you connect each paragraph to the next, and back to the main point. For example, in a summary of an article about the cause of the American Revolution, you might have a paragraph that summarizes the author's arguments about taxes, and another about religious freedom. You can say something like, \\"Although some colonists believed that taxes should entitle them to representation in Parliament, the author also argues that other colonists supported the Revolution because they believed they were entitled to representation in heaven on their own terms.\\" Once you've finished revising the arguments in your draft, check the little things. Make sure there are no spelling or grammar mistakes. Look for any additional or missing punctuation and correct that as well. Don't use spell-checker for spelling errors. It will catch if you spell something wrong, but not if you use the wrong spelling of a word. For example, it won't catch that you used \\"there\\" when you meant \\"their.\\" Once you’ve added anything you might have forgotten to your summary, check how long it is. If you’re summarizing something for a school assignment, be sure to stick to the parameters or guidelines provided by your instructor. Generally, a summary should be around one quarter the length of the original piece. So if the original piece is 4 pages long, your summary should be no more than 1 page. Another person may see an argument or point in a completely different light than you have, giving you a new feel for the work and yours. Not only should they be comparing your work for accuracy, ask them to read it for flow and summation. They should be able understand what happened in the article or story by reading your summary alone. Don't hesitate to ask for criticism; then weigh those criticisms and make valid changes.

Can you tell me the answer to who played the robot in the day the earth stood still 1951??","completion":"In the 1951 science fiction classic film \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\\" the robot character named Gort was played by actor Lock Martin. Lock Martin, whose real name was Joseph Lockard Martin Jr., was an American actor known for his remarkable height, standing at 7 feet 7 inches (231 cm) tall. Born on October 12, 1916, in Pennsylvania, USA, Martin's towering height made him an obvious choice for the role of Gort, an imposing and silent robotic enforcer. \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" was directed by Robert Wise and based on a short story titled \\"Farewell to the Master\\" by Harry Bates. The film follows an extraterrestrial visitor named Klaatu, portrayed by actor Michael Rennie, and his robot companion, Gort. They arrive on Earth with a message for humanity: cease aggression and conflict, or face dire consequences from a coalition of interstellar civilizations. Gort's iconic and intimidating appearance was designed to capture the imagination of audiences at a time when fears of nuclear war and tensions between nations were growing. The costume worn by Lock Martin was made of foam rubber, which was molded into a one-piece suit painted to resemble a metallic finish. Due to the costume’s rigidity and lack of breathability, Martin could only wear it for a short period of time, and the film required several costume changes. Despite the challenges of playing the role, Lock Martin's portrayal of Gort has become an enduring symbol of the power and potential of technology, as well as a warning against the destructive nature of humanity. The film's themes and messages continue to resonate with audiences today, and Gort remains a memorable character in the long tradition of science fiction cinema. In addition to his role in \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\\" Lock Martin held various jobs throughout his life, including working as a doorman at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, where he attracted much attention for his height. He passed away on January 19, 1959, in Los Angeles, California.

Context: The City of Charleston Police Department, with a total of 458 sworn officers, 117 civilians, and 27 reserve police officers, is South Carolina's largest police department. Their procedures on cracking down on drug use and gang violence in the city are used as models to other cities to do the same. According to the final 2005 FBI Crime Reports, Charleston crime level was worse than the national average in almost every major category. Greg Mullen, the former Deputy Chief of the Virginia Beach, Virginia Police Department, serves as the current Chief of the Charleston Police Department. The former Charleston police chief was Reuben Greenberg, who resigned August 12, 2005. Greenberg was credited with creating a polite police force that kept police brutality well in check, even as it developed a visible presence in community policing and a significant reduction in crime rates.

The tone of the sentence seems to be hopeful, as it mentions that hopefully, the film will provide a human face to the people involved in the preparation and delivery of the food. 2. Identify any negative or positive phrases in the sentence. Negative phrase: \\"most consumers of lo mein and general tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it\\" - This suggests that people generally lack appreciation or consideration for the people behind the scenes. Positive phrase: \\"hopefully, this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons.\\" - This implies the film is expected to bring awareness and empathy to the people involved in food preparation and delivery. 3. Weigh the impact of the negative and positive phrases. In this case, the negative phrase highlights the general lack of appreciation towards the people who prepare and deliver the food. However, the positive phrase indicates that the film can make a positive change by attaching a human face to those involved in the food industry, which can increase appreciation and thought for them.

The film starts with a brief pre-title clip from presenter Greg Palast s aborted interview with Florida Director of Elections Clayton Roberts , who walks out . Palast introduces George W. Bush with particular reference to his popular image as a war hero cemented in the public mind by his landing on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln for the 2003 Mission Accomplished Speech . However Palast alleges that Bush used his father s influence to gain a draft-dodging placement with the Texas Air National Guard Which he subsequently failed to serve . Palast picks up the story with Bush s 2000 US Presidential Election campaign where he claims Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris used their influence to purge and discount the ballots of predominantly Gore-supporting black voters through the fake felons list compiled by private company DBT/ChoicePoint for US 4 million . Palast goes on to examine the corporate donors to Bush s election campaign , such as Enron CEO Ken Lay , who as members of Bush s pioneer network contributed huge sums through family and friends , and who he claims subsequently profited from the Bush presidency with senior government appointments , no-bid contracts , executive orders and deregulation .

Step 4: Build up to the climax Maxie begrudgingly agrees to assist Ronnie and finds herself back in the criminal world she has long abandoned. Over time, the pair manage to retaliate against the rival gang, and Ronnie regains control. However, the events have left Maxie shaken and introspective. She begins to question the morality of her actions and experiences an emotional reckoning, realizing that she can no longer live with the burden of her past.

Here is an article: By ABBY GOODNOUGH, REED ABELSON and ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS Of the 7.3 million people who signed up for private insurance through online exchanges during the first enrollment period, 85 percent qualified for federal subsidies that decreased the cost of their premiums. Though many people have found policies with affordable premiums, high deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs have discouraged some people from using their insurance. Early rate filings by insurers in 21 states suggest that rates will vary widely, but the median premium increases for 2015 for silver plans will be around 4 percent and there will be more insurers in the market. But consumers will need to shop around to keep their costs down. Insurers are expected to continue trying to control costs by restricting consumers from using doctors out of their network. The goal is right there in the name: the Affordable Care Act. When President Obama signed the measure in 2010, he pledged that it would protect Americans from ruinously high medical bills by guaranteeing them access to comprehensive — and affordable — coverage. For millions of people who gained insurance through the law, this has proved true. About 7.3 million people, including many who might otherwise be shut out of the market because of costly medical conditions, remain enrolled in private coverage through the law’s online marketplaces. Eighty-five percent of those who signed up during the enrollment period qualified for federal subsidies to help pay premiums. For those who qualified for subsidies through the federal exchange, the subsidies lowered the cost by 76 percent on average, according to the Obama administration. But the law — by requiring insurers to provide a broader array of benefits and to cover people with pre-existing conditions — caused premiums to rise for some who already had insurance. Many of those people were young and in good health, had plans that offered sharply limited benefits that were canceled because of the law, or were not eligible for subsidies. For now, dire warnings that the law would cause premiums for most people to rise sharply have proved unfounded. The law has spurred competition, with new companies entering the market. And early indications are that premium increases next year will be relatively modest. One analysis of early regulatory filings by the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform found that insurers are proposing a median increase of 4 percent in 21 states for silver plans, although people should consider switching plans to find the lowest price. Another McKinsey analysis found that in 43 states that have released information, there has been a 22 percent increase in the number of insurers for 2015. Many of the new insurers are in markets where competition was already flourishing. But it also appears there will be fewer places with little or no competition: In 21 states, McKinsey found, the number of markets with just one or two carriers fell to 10, from 41. How premiums will change in 21 states For people renewing the cheapest silver plan. States ( ) where rates have been proposed or approved. Increase less than 10 percent in 87 markets. Increase more than 10 percent in 58 markets. How premiums will change in 21 states For people renewing the cheapest silver plan. States () where rates have been proposed or approved. Increase less than 10 percent in 87 markets. Increase more than 10 percent in 58 markets. Note: Premium changes are shown for a 40-year-old, before tax subsidies. Source: McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform But for some consumers who bought plans with affordable premiums, high deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs have discouraged them from seeking care. Another major question is whether insurers, in trying to keep costs down, have been too restrictive about allowing consumers to use doctors outside their company’s network. In New York, New Jersey and Georgia, the vast majority of exchange plans allow only in-network care. Nationally, roughly half of the plans offered through Healthcare.gov, the federal exchange, are either health maintenance organizations or exclusive provider organizations, which do not allow their customers to go out of network, except in emergencies or through an often arduous appeals process. The limited selection has helped keep premiums down, but also made “surprise balance billing” — or high bills that are not covered — more likely, experts say. New York recently passed a law to prevent such billings. There are also wide variations in prices within states, as insurers pursue different strategies and struggle to determine how much they need to charge to cover their costs. Someone in Dalton, Ga., for example, will see the cost of a midlevel silver plan from WellPoint’s Blue Cross Blue Shield decline by 12 percent, according to 2015 rate filings. But in Dublin, Ga., three and a half hours away, a person who bought a silver plan from Humana could see the price rise by nearly a third. With such variability, it is hard to know who will find the plans unaffordable this time around. For now, the evidence suggests that middle-income people who don’t qualify for subsidies, or who qualify only for small ones, are most likely to struggle with the cost. In a Commonwealth Fund survey conducted this spring, 44 percent of adults with incomes above 250 percent of the poverty level, or 29,175 for individuals, found it difficult to pay their premiums for marketplace plans, compared with 33 percent of those with incomes below that level. For that reason, experts say it is critical that consumers shop around when enrollment begins on Nov. 15, since their current insurer may be raising rates even as other companies lower theirs. In places where the law is already achieving its goal of fostering additional competition — Maine, for instance — consumers appear to be less likely to feel “rate shock,” where premiums go up by double digits. But in states where there is less competition, residents appear more likely to have to pay higher prices next year, unless they qualify for a higher subsidy. And those larger rate increases are fodder for political attacks against the law, particularly in states with closely contested Senate races this fall, like Louisiana or Iowa. In one state with minimal competition, Vermont, the biggest insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, will be increasing the price of its lowest-cost silver plan by about 9 percent. For Jessica Porter, a psychiatric nurse practitioner from South Burlington, that is a problem. Her family of six is paying 1,637 a month for a platinum plan, which comes with relatively generous coverage but high premiums. But their income is too high to qualify for a subsidy, she said, so she and her husband have put off saving for retirement to pay their premiums. “Blue Cross is basically the only player in town,” she said.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who finds work as a tramp steamer head for the US?, using the article: Lyon Gaultier is a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved. Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him. Figuring that this would be the best way to earn the money he needs to get to L.A., Lyon fights in a no-holds-barred bare-knuckle fights to finance the trip. Once in L.A.

What if we make all the n's be friends and gather them together? You can do this by subtracting '3*n' from both sides of the equation. So, what's '8*n' - '3*n'? That's '5*n', right? So now the equation is '5*n = 25'. We're very close now! To find the secret identity of 'n', we just have to divide both sides of the equation by '5', because 'n' is being multiplied by '5'. And what is '25' divided by '5'? That's '5'. So, the secret identity of 'n' is '5'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. John was studying about the history of Sahara desert. He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization. Would era B see higher or lower rate of weathering than era A? A:","completion":"Era B would see a lower rate of weathering than Era A due to the decrease in rainfall.

We have an equation that looks like this: 69 * l + 25 * l = 6 * l + 616 Do you remember when you put your toys together? It's kind of like that! We can put together the numbers with the letter \\"l\\" on both sides of the equation. So, on the left side, we have 69 * l and 25 * l.

In sentence 2, the speaker uses the phrase \\"I will make a list\\" which conveys the same intention. Both phrases indicate that the speaker plans on generating a list of desired knowledge once they've allocated an adequate amount of time for reflection. Another similarity between the two sentences lies in the mention of taking time to think. In sentence 1, the speaker states, \\"when I've had time to think,\\" and in sentence 2, the speaker references this same concept with the phrase \\"after I have taken some time to think.\\" Both expressions signify that it is essential for the speaker to allocate a certain amount of time for reflection before they can identify and compile the things they wish to learn.

What is this text about?","completion":"The given text highlights the missed opportunity for Massachusetts businesses concerning international tourism, specifically on shopping tourism from Europe. This comes as a result of the weak US dollar, since it attracts Europeans to visit the United States for affordable shopping experiences during their holidays. However, the main issue in this text is the fact that 2 million designated for promoting international tourism in Massachusetts remains unused, which could have been vital in capitalizing on this trend and boosting the local economy. The unutilized funds earmarked for international tourism marketing implies that Massachusetts is not effectively targeting potential European tourists to come and shop in the state. As a result, businesses might not be able to exploit the benefits of the increased influx of tourists, which would include not just the retail sector but also the hospitality and service sectors. This could lead to lesser revenues and possibly lesser growth for the state's businesses compared to others in the country that are successful in attracting European shoppers. In addition, the missed opportunity might result in local businesses losing out to their competition as more European tourists visit other cities or states with more aggressive marketing campaigns, causing an uneven distribution of the economic benefits that tourism can bring.

James \\"Jim\\" Bowie (pronounced BOO-ee) (c. 1796 - March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American pioneer, who played a prominent role in the Texas Revolution, culminating in his death at the Battle of the Alamo. Stories of him as a fighter and frontiersman, both real and fictitious, have made him a legendary figure in Texas history and a folk hero of American culture. Born in Kentucky, Bowie spent most of his life in Louisiana, where he was raised and where he later worked as a land speculator. His rise to fame began in 1827 on reports of the Sandbar Fight. Shortly before the senior Bowie died circa 1820, he gave ten slaves as well as horses and cattle to both James and Rezin. For the next seven years, the brothers worked together to develop several large estates in Lafourche Parish and Opelousas. Louisiana's population was growing rapidly, and the brothers hoped to take advantage of its rising land prices through speculation. Without the capital required to buy large tracts, they entered into a partnership with pirate Jean Lafitte in 1818 to raise money. By then, the United States had outlawed the importation of slaves, and most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction as a reward. Bowie made three trips to Lafitte's compound on Galveston Island. On each occasion, he bought smuggled slaves and took them directly to a customhouse to inform on his own actions. When the customs officers offered the slaves for auction, Bowie purchased them and received back half the price he had paid, as allowed by the state laws. He then could legally transport the slaves and resell them at a greater market value in New Orleans or areas farther up the Mississippi River. Using this scheme, the brothers collected 65,000 to be used for their land speculation. In 1825, the two brothers joined with their younger brother Stephen to buy Acadia Plantation near Thibodaux. Within two years, they had established the first steam mill in Louisiana to be used for grinding sugar cane. The plantation became known as a model estate, but on February 12, 1831, they sold it and 65 slaves for 90,000. With their profits, James and Rezin bought a plantation in Arkansas. Bowie and his brother John were involved in a major court case in the late 1820s over land speculation. When the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory in 1803, it promised to honor all former land grant claims, and for the next 20 years efforts were made to establish who owned what land. In May 1824, Congress authorized the superior courts of each territory to hear suits from those who claimed they had been overlooked. The Arkansas Superior Court received 126 claims in late 1827 from residents who claimed to have purchased land in former Spanish grants from the Bowie brothers. Although the Superior Court originally confirmed most of those claims, the decisions were reversed in February 1831 after further research showed that the land had never belonged to the Bowies and that the original land grant documentation had been forged. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the reversal in 1833. When the disgruntled purchasers considered suing the Bowies, they discovered that the documents in the case had been removed from the court; left without evidence, they declined to pursue a case. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Who did they sell land they didn't owe to?","completion":"The Bowie brothers, James and John, sold land they didn't own to 126 residents who claimed to have purchased land in former Spanish grants from the Bowie brothers.

Write an email with the following subject: west delivery points","completion":"Subject: Comprehensive Analysis and Suggested Alternatives for West Delivery Points Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. As a result of our recent meeting discussing the need to optimize and improve our distribution network, I have conducted a thorough analysis of our west delivery points and associated logistics. I am delighted to share my findings and recommendations, which are aimed at increasing efficiency, reducing costs, and potentially opening up new opportunities. Overview of Current West Delivery Points: At present, we have a total of six (6) primary delivery points in the western region, namely: 1. West City Hub 2. Riverside Terminal 3. North Gate Distribution Center 4. South Park Express Outlet 5. Central Business District Depot 6. Uptown Warehouse & Fulfilment Center Key Metrics and Observations: Upon examining the performance metrics and operational aspects of our western delivery points, the following key observations have been noted: 1. Load Capacity Utilization: - West City Hub, Riverside Terminal, and Uptown Warehouse are operating near full capacity, causing potential bottlenecks during peak periods. - North Gate, South Park, and Central Business District Depots have excess capacity, which could be better utilized. 2. Transit Times: - Generally, Riverside Terminal and South Park locations experience higher transit times due to limited access to major highways and heavy traffic conditions. - West City Hub and Central Business District locations benefit from close proximity to key strategic routes, thus providing faster transit times. 3. Cost Structure: - Uptown Warehouse and North Gate Distribution Center incur higher overhead costs due to the larger facility sizes and additional specialized equipment. - Riverside and South Park locations offer opportunities for cost reduction by optimizing transportation and facility costs. Strategic Recommendations: 1. Reorganization and Redistribution: - Shifting some of the load from West City Hub, Riverside, and Uptown locations to North Gate, South Park, and Central Business District locations. - This would help to improve capacity utilization across delivery points and potentially minimize bottlenecks during peak periods. 2. Streamlining Transportation Routes: - Assessing opportunities to relocate the Riverside Terminal and South Park locations closer to major highways, thus reducing transit times and increasing overall operational efficiency. - Another alternative would be to improve existing access routes or seek partnerships with local authorities to implement new infrastructure projects. 3. Cost Optimization: - Exploring innovative solutions such as automation, technology integration, and improved inventory management to reduce operational costs at high-cost facilities. 4. Expansion Opportunities: - Identifying potential new delivery points in the region to support growing demand and incorporate additional logistics services, such as same-day and express delivery options. The above recommendations serve as a starting point for further discussions and decision-making. Kindly find attached a detailed PowerPoint presentation summarizing the data analysis and recommendations, as well as an Excel spreadsheet with further metrics and comparisons. I would be grateful for your feedback and suggestions on the proposed strategies, and I am more than happy to schedule a meeting at your earliest convenience to delve into the topic further.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Alexandros Othonaios ( Greek : , Gytheio , 1879 - Athens , 20 September 1970 ) was a distinguished Greek general , who became briefly Prime Minister of Greece , heading an emergency government during an abortive coup in 1933 . - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. - The Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic (\\"Prothypourgós tis Ellinikís Dimokratías\\"), colloquially referred to as the Prime Minister of Greece (\\"Prothypourgós tis Elládas\\"), is the head of government of the Hellenic Republic and the leader of the Greek cabinet. The incumbent prime minister is Alexis Tsipras, who took office on 21 September 2015. - Alexis Tsipras (; born 28 July 1974) is the 185th and current Prime Minister of Greece, having been sworn in on 21 September 2015. He previously served as the 183rd Prime Minister of Greece from 26 January 2015 to 27 August 2015. Tsipras has been leader of the left-wing Greek political party Syriza since 4 October 2009. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - East Mani (- \\"Anatolikí Máni\\") is a municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Its seat of administration is the town Gytheio (before 2011 the small town Kotronas). The municipality is located in the eastern part of the Mani Peninsula. It is a mountainous and rocky area. Its economy relies on fishing, olive oil and tourism. - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. - The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles. - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country. - A metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. The term is Greek and means the \\"mother city\\" of a colony (in the ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers. This was later generalized to a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or any large, important city in a nation. - Piraeus (\\"Pireás\\" , , \\"Peiraieús\\") is a port city in the region of Attica, Greece. Piraeus is located within the Athens urban area, southwest from its city center (municipality of Athens), and lies along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf. - Gytheio, the ancient Gythium or Gytheion, is a town and a former municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality East Mani, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 197.313 km. It was the seaport of Sparta, some north. Gytheio used to be an important port until it was destroyed in 4th century AD, possibly by an earthquake. Today it is the largest and most important town in Mani. It is also the seat of the municipality of East Mani. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? What object entity has the relation of 'given name' with the subject 'alexandros othonaios'?

He drew on the country for resources to fight his war with Philip on the continent. Conflict continued in Ireland between the Anglo-Norman settlers and the indigenous Irish chieftains, with John manipulating both groups to expand his wealth and power in the country. During Richard's rule, John had successfully increased the size of his lands in Ireland, and he continued this policy as king. In 1210 the king crossed into Ireland with a large army to crush a rebellion by the Anglo-Norman lords; he reasserted his control of the country and used a new charter to order compliance with English laws and customs in Ireland. John stopped short of trying to actively enforce this charter on the native Irish kingdoms, but historian David Carpenter suspects that he might have done so, had the baronial conflict in England not intervened.

Next morning, the Dolphin's Head of Operations Roger Podacter (Troy Evans) and his Chief Publicist named Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox) are instructed to find the missing Snowflake before the upcoming Super Bowl (out of fear that the theft will affect the superstitious football players). A member of their staff was previously a client of Ace Ventura so they decide to call in this \\"pet detective\\" in to try investigating.Meanwhile, Ace is trying to capture a rare bird with a reward of 25,000 with no success. After receiving the request from Melissa to investigate, Ace goes to the stadium and takes a look inside Snowflake's tank, finding a small stone in the filter system. Roger spots a team of reporters heading to the tank and is worried (fearing the negative press that would result from knowledge of Snowflake's abduction). Ace poses as an eccentric animal trainer and manages to drive the reporters (Antoni Corone and Margo Peace) away.Later that day, Ace Ventura stops in at the local police headquarters. After an altercation with Sgt. Aguado (John Capodice), Ace meets his friend Detective Emilio (Tone Loc) to find out what leads the police may have. Emilio admits that a missing animal case isn't a priority for the police but they suspect that one of the local animal rights groups, who have repeatedly protested the Miami Dolphin's ownership of Snowflake, may be responsible. At this point, Emilio's superior, attractive female Lt. Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) comes along and throws Ace out.Ace visits his hacker buddy Woodstock (Raynor Scheine) to try and find information relating to the purchase of equipment that would be...

Write some highlights for the following article: A couple have been given compensation after NHS staff failed to recognise their baby was in distress - leading to her being stillborn. Wendy Pratt, 36, and husband Chris, 46, sued Scarborough Hospital, North Yorkshire, after staff missed vital signs that their daughter was struggling while in the womb. The couple had tried for a baby for six years and had finally conceived after undergoing IVF on the NHS in 2009. But staff at the hospital failed to recognise signs their baby girl Matilda was in distress, leading to her being delivered stillborn in April 2010 at 27 weeks. Wendy Pratt, 36, and husband Chris, 46, sued Scarborough Hospital, North Yorkshire, after staff missed vital signs their daughter was struggling while in the womb. The devastated couple, of Filey, North Yorkshire, instructed medical negligence lawyers at Irwin Mitchell and the NHS trust has now made an undisclosed payout. It admitted it had not kept a close eye on Mrs Pratt after her 20 week scan, and that if they had Matilda could have survived. Mrs Pratt said: 'We have been trying for a baby ever since we got married 11 years ago. Once we got married and felt secure we knew we wanted to have babies. 'We tried for six years and then we had our first and only shot at NHS funded IVF treatment. 'We had spent three years on the waiting list and then we got the call. I thought this was going to be our chance. 'It was a feeling of our life is going to change one way or the other. I was really dreading it but after a while I was really excited.' The couple were told there was a one in three chance of conceiving and just eight weeks after treatment Mrs Pratt found that she was four weeks pregnant. Staff at the hospital failed to recognise signs their baby girl Matilda was in distress, leading to her being delivered stillborn in April 2010 at 27 weeks. She said: 'I was 25 at the time and I was young so I had that on my side. The hospital were optimistic but for me it was already six years of being disappointed. 'We were just ecstatic and we really thought that was it and we have made it. It was a relief that we weren't having to face a childless future. 'From that point were never thought anything would go wrong.' Midwifery staff told Mrs Pratt her baby was smaller than expected at 20 weeks and that she would need to be closely monitored. But it was another seven weeks before a CTG [to measure the baby's heartbeat] and a scan was provided for her baby. Mrs Pratt, a writer who formally worked as a microbiologist, said: 'It got to the 20 week scan and everything was fine. Despite midwifery staff telling Mrs Pratt her baby was smaller than expected at 20 weeks and that she would need to be closely monitored, it was another seven weeks before a CTG [to measure the baby's heartbeat] and a scan was provided for her baby. 'They said she was measuring small but said it would just be keeping an eye on it. We went away feeling happy and relieved. 'A couple of days later I started having heart palpitations and my GP signed me off work. I relaxed and put my feet up. I had no caffeine or alcohol and I did everything right because it meant so much to us because we had tried for so long. 'Then we got to 24 weeks and she had always been a very active baby. She had a pattern of movements that I knew really well. The movements weren't as defined, weren't as definite. My midwife said it was fine and that some babies are quiet. 'I trusted my midwife because she was my midwife. I just wish that I hadn't.' But still concerned at 27 weeks, Mrs Pratt explained: 'I listened at home on my Doppler device, which you are not supposed to do, and we listened to the heartbeat and I thought it was slowing.' She returned to hospital on April 17, 2010, where staff performed a CTG and two ultrasounds which showed the baby had restricted growth and poor blood flow through the baby's umbilical cord. 'It was about 1am and they said they were going to call a consultant. I know there was something wrong. The consultant scanned me and kept asking if my dates were wrong. He said there was a problem with the blood flow. 'They admitted me and I didn't sleep at all. I couldn't feel her moving. They took me to a scan and the baby's fingers were moving and the consultant said it looked like there had been an improvement. Family picture shows the grave of Matilda Pratt. The devastated couple, of Filey, North Yorkshire, instructed medical negligence lawyers at Irwin Mitchell and the NHS trust has now made an undisclosed payout. 'They sent me home and I was only home for an hour when I said to Chris I didn't feel right and we went back.' Mrs Pratt then readmitted herself because of the continued lack of foetal movements, and another ultrasound was performed that same day. She had seen three different consultants at Scarborough Hospital. On April 20 they were transferred to Leeds General Infirmary for another scan and a CTG. She said: 'We drove ourselves to Leeds and I felt like they were waiting for the baby to die. They didn't even give us an ambulance. 'They were getting me to sign things and preparing me for surgery and were getting ready to spray me with the epidural and her heart started to slow down. 'It was Chris who had to tell me that she hadn't made it. She still had a heartbeat but it stopped during the delivery. It was all really quick.' But the baby's heart rate started to drop as Mrs Pratt was prepared for an emergency C-section. Matilda was delivered by emergency caesarean and could not be resuscitated. She said: 'There is just a catalogue of mistakes that ended up costing my daughters life. Waking up in theatre was a dividing line to my life before and after my child dying.' Mrs Pratt said the couple have since used their compensation for three more rounds of IVF treatment - sadly suffering two miscarriages in 2011 and 2012. Now they're urging others to speak out to make sure the same mistakes don't happen again. The couple decided to take legal action and York Teaching Hospital NHS Trust have now agreed to pay an undisclosed amount after admitting that had they performed a CTG scan after her 20 week scan, Matilda would, on the balance of probabilities, have been born alive. The couple have since used their compensation for three more rounds of IVF treatment - sadly suffering two miscarriages in 2011 and 2012. Now the couple urging others to speak out to make sure the same mistakes don't happen again. 'It's important that people speak out. The NHS is being pushed to its limits and if you keep pushing them then mistakes will happen. 'If people don't speak up then nothing changes.' Sarah Coles, a specialist medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell's Leeds office, representing the couple, said: 'This is a tragic case that has left Wendy and Chris absolutely devastated by the loss of their longed-for daughter Matilda. They have both found it incredibly difficult to accept what happened and they have needed extensive support to help them come to terms with their loss. 'What is clear is that the midwives made a number of errors and failed to detect and act upon basic signs which highlighted things were not right and ultimately led to Matilda being stillborn. 'Whilst we welcome the admission of liability from the Trust and settlement, it remains very difficult and painful for the family to come to terms with the fact Matilda's death could have been avoided.' York Teaching Hospital NHS Trust have been contacted for a comment.

Process: - Electromagnet creates magnetic field with electricity - Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electric current gets introduced from power source - Flows through the wire - Magnetic field gets created in the wire - And the metal gets magnetized - When turned off it is no longer magnetic. Question: suppose more copper wire is wound happens, how will it affect a STRONGER electromagnet. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"A: more Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Electromagnet creates a magnetic field with electricity: When an electric current is passed through a conductive wire, it creates a magnetic field around the wire. 2. Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal: The wire is coiled around a metal core, typically an iron or steel, to concentrate and increase the strength of the magnetic field produced. 3. An electric current gets introduced from a power source: The electric current is supplied to the coiled wire, which flows through the wire. 4. Flows through the wire: The electric current circulates in the wire, generating the magnetic field. 5. Magnetic field gets created in the wire: As the electric current flows through the wire, the magnetic field is established around the wire. 6. And the metal gets magnetized: The concentrated magnetic field created by the coiled wire magnetizes the metal core, turning it into a strong electromagnet. 7. When turned off it is no longer magnetic: When the electric current is stopped, the magnetic field dissipates, and the metal core ceases to be an electromagnet. Now, if more copper wire is wound around the piece of metal, it will affect the strength of the electromagnet as follows: 1. More turns of copper wire increase the total length of the wire, which subsequently leads to an increase in the number of times the magnetic field generated by each part of the wire gets concentrated around the core. The multiple loops or turns of the wire help to improve the magnetic field strength. 2. With more copper wire wound, you get more of the wire's \\"length\\" contributing to the magnetic field strength. This enhances the overall power of the electromagnet, making it stronger. In conclusion, winding more copper wire around the metal core will result in a stronger electromagnet (A: more)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - obscure - see-through - opaque - thick - misunderstood Explain why a human would choose \\"thick\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human might choose \\"thick\\" as the answer to why someone would have a hard time seeing through a clear medium because the thickness of the material can impact the way light passes through it, thus affecting its transparency and visibility. When a medium is very thick, it can scatter, refract, or absorb the light passing through it, causing the light to be dispersed or deflected in various directions. This makes it more challenging for the human eye to perceive clear images or objects on the other side of the medium. In comparison, if a medium is thin and uniformly transparent, the light will pass through it with minimal scattering or refraction, allowing clear visibility.

Variational inference based on chi-square divergence minimization (CHIVI) provides a way to approximate a model's posterior while obtaining an upper bound on the marginal likelihood. However, in practice CHIVI relies on Monte Carlo (MC) estimates of an upper bound objective that at modest sample sizes are not guaranteed to be true bounds on the marginal likelihood. This paper provides an empirical study of CHIVI performance on a series of synthetic inference tasks. We show that CHIVI is far more sensitive to initialization than classic VI based on KL minimization, often needs a very large number of samples (over a million), and may not be a reliable upper bound.

After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years.

Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member. During the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How did editor Furtok feel about the disappointed father to didn't get in the program?

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Five facts about the asthenosphere 1. Layer within Earth's mantle: The asthenosphere is a part of Earth's mantle, which is located between the crust (the outermost layer) and the lower mantle. The asthenosphere lies beneath the lithosphere, the rigid and brittle outermost layer that contains both the crust and the upper part of the mantle. 2. Composition: The asthenosphere is mainly composed of solid peridotite, an ultramafic rock primarily containing minerals such as olivine and pyroxene. Despite being classified as solid, the asthenosphere's material behaves more like a semi-solid or plastic due to the high temperatures and pressures at these depths. 3. Convection currents: The asthenosphere is marked by convection currents, which occurs as heated rocks from the lower mantle rise to the asthenosphere and then cool down as they approach the lithosphere. This process of convection helps transfer heat from the Earth's interior to the surface and causes the movement of the plates on Earth's surface. 4. Plate tectonics: The asthenosphere plays a crucial role in plate tectonics. Due to its partially molten and ductile nature, it allows the rigid lithospheric plates to move over it, enabling the processes of plate tectonics, including continental drift, subduction, and the formation of mountain ranges. 5. Depth: The asthenosphere starts at approximately 80 to 200 kilometers below Earth's surface and extends to the depths of around 660 kilometers. The depth varies depending on the location, with the asthenosphere being shallower beneath the oceanic crust and deeper beneath the continental crust. Question 2: Five facts about the lithosphere 1. Earth's outermost shell: The lithosphere is Earth's outermost rigid layer, consisting of the crust and the uppermost portion of the mantle. It is a relatively thin layer making up just a small fraction of Earth's total volume. 2. Composition: The lithosphere is composed of two main types of crust: the continental crust, which is primarily made of granitic rocks, and the oceanic crust, which is predominantly made of basaltic rocks. The lithosphere's upper mantle portion mainly consists of solid peridotite. 3. Tectonic plates: The lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. These plates consist of both continental and oceanic crust and include major plates such as the North American, South American, Eurasian, African, Pacific, and Antarctic plates. 4. Plate interactions: The movements of the lithospheric plates cause various geological events and processes, including earthquakes, volcanic activities, mountain building, and the formation of oceanic trenches. These plate interactions can be classified into three types: convergent boundaries, where plates move towards each other; divergent boundaries, where plates move away from each other; and transform boundaries, where plates slide past each other. 5. Thickness variations: The thickness of the lithosphere varies depending on its location and type. Continental lithosphere generally ranges from 100 to 250 kilometers in thickness, while oceanic lithosphere is thinner, ranging from 15 to 100 kilometers in thickness. To answer the final part of your query, no, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Although both the asthenosphere and lithosphere are parts of Earth's interior, they have distinct characteristics and functions. The asthenosphere is a semi-solid, ductile layer within the mantle that plays a key role in plate tectonics, while the lithosphere is Earth's rigid, outermost layer consisting of the crust and the upper portion of the mantle, which is divided into tectonic plates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses. There came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people. My partner’s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn’t even part of your ancestry. It’s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don’t really want. Soon after that, my partner’s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister.

In a typical organization hierarchy, the title of \\"Director\\" usually denotes a managerial position that holds responsibility for overseeing a particular department or function, whereas \\"Junior Executive Vice President\\" tends to represent a more senior executive role. While the roles and responsibilities of these two positions might overlap, they are not necessarily interchangeable. Linda Calbom's title as Director suggests that she is directly responsible for managing the department, aligning it with organizational goals, ensuring that the department is equipped with the necessary resources, and supervising a team of professionals. It is possible that Linda Calbom reports to a more senior executive, such as an Executive Vice President, in the organization's financial management and assurance hierarchy. On the other hand, a \\"Junior Executive Vice President (JEVP)\\" is a more senior executive title, which typically indicates a higher level of responsibility and authority within a company. This position generally reports to the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, or even the President or Chief Executive Officer, depending on the organization's structure. In addition to working closely with various stakeholders, the JEVP has oversight and decision-making power over broader operational, strategic, and financial matters.

Almost his sole champion in the years after his death was his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Primarily an illustrator, as well as a scholar and archaeologist, Pullan trained with Alfred Waterhouse in Manchester, before joining Burges's office in the 1850s. In 1859, he married Burges's sister. Following Burges's death in 1881, Pullan lived at The Tower House and published collections of Burges's designs, including Architectural Designs of William Burges (1883) and The House of William Burges (1886). In his preface to Architectural Designs Pullan expressed the hope that illustrated volumes of his brother-in-law's work \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated, not only by his professional brethern, but by all men of educated taste in Europe and America.\\" This hope was not to be fulfilled for a hundred years but Burges's work did continue to attract followers in Japan. Josiah Conder studied under him, and, through Conder's influence, the notable Japanese architect Tatsuno Kingo was articled to Burges in the year before the latter's death.

Write an article using the following points: A relative says shooter Adam Lanza had a form of autism, law enforcement official says. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder, not a personality disorder. Advocacy groups caution against speculation about link between violence and autism. Violence for those with autism spectrum disorders is not planned, expert says. Article:","completion":"Title: Autism and Violence - Dispelling the Myths Surrounding the Adam Lanza Case Introduction Recently, a relative of Adam Lanza, the infamous school shooter, claimed that Lanza had a form of autism. According to a law enforcement official, this claim has raised concerns about the public's perception of those with autism and generated unfounded speculation regarding the link between violence and autism. In this article, we aim to clarify the misconceptions about autism and highlight expert opinions on the matter. 1. Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorders Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interactions, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Individuals with ASD often face challenges in understanding and responding to the social world around them. Importantly, autism is not a personality disorder and should not be confused with conditions like antisocial personality disorder. 2. Advocacy Groups Caution Against Speculation Advocacy groups, including the Autistic Self Advocacy Network and Autism Society, urge caution when discussing the alleged link between violence and autism. The groups stress that individuals with autism are far more likely to be victims rather than perpetrators of violence. Moreover, experts argue that reinforcing stereotypes may contribute to the discrimination and exclusion of those with ASD. 3. Expert Opinion on Violence and Autism Dr. Valerie Gaus, a clinical psychologist who specializes in autism, states that violence perpetuated by individuals with autism spectrum disorders is typically reactive and impulsive, rather than planned. She explains that most violent acts by people with autism are a response to feelings of being threatened or overwhelmed, rather than a premeditated, calculated effort to cause harm. In contrast, the planning and execution of the tragic events perpetrated by Adam Lanza indicate a degree of forethought and intention that is inconsistent with the reactive nature of violence typically observed in individuals with ASD. Therefore, it is important to recognize that Lanza's actions are not representative of the autistic community’s behavior. 4. The Importance of Dispelling Myths Understanding the true nature of autism and dispelling myths about its association with violence is crucial in promoting acceptance and support for those with ASD. Discrimination and stigmatization only serve to alienate and marginalize a community that already grapples with social challenges. By educating the public on the realities of autism, we can work together to create a more inclusive and compassionate society, where people with ASD are recognized for their strengths and supported in their areas of need. Conclusion The tragic actions of Adam Lanza should not be used as a basis to judge or stereotype individuals with autism. Instead, it is imperative that we remain vigilant in questioning and debunking unfounded assumptions about the relationship between autism and violence. Doing so will help create a more empathetic and informed society, one that embraces individuals with autism spectrum disorders and supports their growth, inclusion, and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Camillo Golgi (Italian: [ka'millo 'goldZi]; 7 July 1843 - 21 January 1926) was an Italian physician and pathologist known for his works on the central nervous system. He studied medicine at the University of Pavia (where he later spent most of his professional career) between 1860 and 1868 under the tutelage of Cesare Lombroso. Inspired by pathologist Giulio Bizzozero, he pursued research in nervous system. His discovery of a staining technique called black reaction (sometimes called Golgi's method or Golgi's staining in his honour) in 1873 was a major breakthrough in neuroscience. Central nervous system was difficult to study during Golgi's time because the cells were hard to identify. The available tissue staining techniques were useless for studying nervous tissue. While working as chief medical officer at the Hospital of the Chronically Ill, he experimented with metal impregnation of nervous tissue, using mainly silver (silver staining). In the early 1873, he discovered a method of staining nervous tissue that would stain a limited number of cells at random in their entirety. He first treated the tissue with potassium dichromate to harden it, and then with silver nitrate. Under microscope, the outline of the neuron became distinct from the surrounding tissue and cells. The silver chromate precipitate, as a reaction product, only selective stains some cellular components randomly, sparing other cell parts. The silver chromate particles create a stark black deposit on the soma (nerve cell body) as well as on the axon and all dendrites, providing an exceedingly clear and well-contrasted picture of neuron against a yellow background. This makes it easier to trace the structure of the nerve cells in the brain for the first time. Since cells are selective stained in black, he called the process la reazione nera (\\"the black reaction\\"), but today it is called Golgi's method or the Golgi stain. On 16 February 1873, he wrote to his friend Niccolo Manfredi: I am delighted that I have found a new reaction to demonstrate, even to the blind, the structure of the interstitial stroma of the cerebral cortex. His discovery was published in the Gazzeta Medica Italiani on 2 August 1873.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What archipelago has the highest sea cliffs in the United Kingdom., using the article: St Kilda (Scottish Gaelic: Hiort) is an isolated archipelago situated 64 kilometres (40 mi) west-northwest of North Uist, in the North Atlantic Ocean. It contains the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The largest island is Hirta, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom. Three other islands (Dùn, Soay and Boreray) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting. The islands are administratively a part of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar local authority area.The origin of the name St Kilda is a matter of conjecture. The islands' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the First World War contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell's film The Edge of the World and an opera.Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There are known to be 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.The entire archipelago is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. It became one of Scotland's six World Heritage Sites in 1986, and is one of the few in the world to hold mixed status for both its natural and cultural qualities...., what would be the answer ?

Given the following context: The latitude calculated on 9 May, 84°3′N, was disappointing—Nansen had hoped they were farther south. However, as May progressed they began to see bear tracks, and by the end of the month seals, gulls and whales were plentiful. By Nansen's calculations, they had reached 82°21′N on 31 May, placing them only 50 nautical miles (93 km; 58 mi) from Cape Fligely at the northern extremity of Franz Josef Land, if his longitude estimate was accurate. In the warmer weather the ice began to break up, making travel more difficult. Since 24 April dogs had been killed at regular intervals to feed the others, and by the beginning of June only seven of the original 28 remained. On 21 June the pair jettisoned all surplus equipment and supplies, planning to travel light and live off the now plentiful supplies of seal and birds. After a day's travel in this manner they decided to rest on a floe, waterproof the kayaks and build up their own strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained camped on the floe for a whole month.On 23 July, the day after leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: \\"At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!\\" In the succeeding days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although by the end of July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.Nansen called this first land \\"Hvidtenland\\" (\\"White Island\\"). After making camp on an ice foot they ascended a slope and looked about them. It was apparent that they were in an archipelago, but what they could see bore no relation to their incomplete map of Franz Josef Land.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Some of his decisions will be straightforward. Some will cause arguments. A few might even shock, for a Lions tour demands characters and skill-sets like no other, even if no-one should expect anything quite as eye-raising as the last time a Lions party was picked to meet the All Blacks, when Sir Clive Woodward also unveiled a specially commissioned pseudo-anthem called The Power of Four, with matching bracelets and lyric sheets for his players. Historically, there has been no tougher place for a Lions team to tour than New Zealand; just six Test wins over 113 years, with 29 defeats. Great challenges require great selection. Should Gatland and his men require late inspiration, here are some of the most astute picks made by his predecessors over the past half a century. Eighteen-year-olds and Lions tours should seldom go hand in hand, particularly when the destination is South Africa in the brutal mid-1950s and the itinerary is spread across three months. O'Reilly did not have much of a track record either - just five senior club appearances before being picked for Ireland, just four matches for his national side (three defeats and a draw). What O'Reilly did have was precocious self-belief. And speed. And height. And a natural delight in the big stage and his own role upon it. In future years his business empire would stretch from baked beans to newspapers to butter, zinc mines and fertiliser. On that tour he instead made hay, scoring two tries from the wing on his debut against a Northern Universities XV, bagging hat-tricks against the North Eastern Districts XV and Transvaal and starting all four Tests against the Springboks. In the first, in front of 95,000 at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, he scored a try in the Lions' one-point defeat; as they won the fourth in Port Elizabeth to level the series at 2-2 he scored another. That summer he would play a total of 15 games, scoring 16 tries. Four years later, in Australia and New Zealand, he played 23 and ran in 22 tries. As the 21-year-old George North would prove 54 years further on, age is less important on a Lions tour than the physical gifts that are beginning to blossom. And the chutzpah to make the most of them. Dixon, a mobile and athletic back row forward, had been ignored by England's selectors for so long that he assumed his only involvement in the summer's tour to New Zealand would be reading about it in his newspaper two days after each match. Coach Carwyn James, routinely ahead of the game, aware that to match the All Blacks he would need forwards with as much gas as they had grunt, thought otherwise. In a team that boasted the attacking talents of Gareth Edwards, Barry John, Mike Gibson and JPR Williams, Dixon would go on to play three of the four Tests and score one of the most important tries of all. After being rucked so badly in the second Test in Christchurch that he needed six stitches to the head, he returned for the fourth and decisive match at Eden Park in Auckland alongside Welsh Grand Slam winners Mervyn Davies and John Taylor to dive over for the only Lions try of the game. It might not have been flashy - when the ball fell loose from a line-out, Dixon \\"just grabbed it and drove over,\\" - but it set the platform for the draw that would seal the 2-1 series win, the only time the Lions have won a series in New Zealand. Future Lions and World Cup-winning coach Graham Henry would later call that summer \\"the biggest wake-up call in New Zealand rugby history\\". Dixon, never the star, was a critical cog in that alarm clock. Kudos to Carwyn, as if the great innovator needed any more. John Dawes had captained that 1971 Lions tour and, having gone on to coach Wales before taking on the Lions job for their return to New Zealand, knew exactly what was required. Which wasn't always what had worked for Wales, dominant though they had been in the Five Nations. Scrum-half Williams had never been capped by his national side when Dawes decided to take him to the other side of the world; his first appearance for Wales wouldn't come for another year, and his other two starts not until 1981. Such were the issues that came with sharing eras with Gareth Edwards and Terry Holmes. But on that 1977 tour, Williams was outstanding in the narrow 16-12 defeat in the first Test in Wellington and the 13-9 win in Christchurch that levelled the series two weeks later. In the third Test at the House of Pain in Dunedin it was Williams' break that set up Willie Duggan's first-half try and gave Dawes' men hope of a repeat of the triumph of six years earlier. Instead, having torn his hamstring, Williams limped off early in the second half as the match and series slipped away. In his two and a half games, he had proved one of the old adages of Lions selection: it is not where you start in the pecking order that matters, but what you do to it. Remarkable though it seems in retrospect - as well as at the time, when his form for Bath was so inspired - Guscott had not featured at all for England in their Five Nations campaign earlier that year. Neither was he initially selected for the Lions, but when England captain Will Carling withdrew with injury, coach Ian McGeechan decided he had seen all he needed. The first Test had ended in a 30-12 defeat, their biggest ever on Australian soil. Guscott, along with Rob Andrew and Mike Teague, was among the critical changes McGeechan made for the second in Brisbane. Guscott delivered immediately, cuffing a left-footed grubber through the Wallabies' defence before gathering the ball for the decisive try in a 19-12 win. When the final Test in Sydney was stolen 19-18, David Campese's fateful dally and dance and all, Guscott had become part of the only Lions team to come from a match down to win a series. Eight years on, another swing of the boot - this time his a drop goal with his right - would seal another series win, the famous 2-1 triumph in South Africa. Having been a fly-half until the age of 19, perhaps that made sense. So too did McGeechan's hunch. So confident and insouciant was Guscott, even before establishing himself with England, that he probably felt he should have been picked in the first place. Bentley had faced his own battle with Carling, winning two caps for England aged 21 before realising that his face and background didn't fit with the national selectors in quite the same way as did the army officer from the private school. He had gone off to play rugby league with Halifax and Leeds, before returning as part of the Rob Andrew revolution at Newcastle at the start of 1996. He played well that season, but it was in the second tier; aged 30, still nowhere near a recall with England, he was in few people's minds when McGeechan prepared to name his squad to play World Cup holders South Africa. To McGeechan, as creative with his selections as he was as a fly-half and centre on the Lions tours of 1974 and 1977, Bentley's background was exactly what made him fit. To beat the Springboks on their own turf he needed players who were fit, resilient and aggressive. His legion of league returnees - Allan Bateman, Alan Tait, Scott Quinnell, Scott Gibbs and Dai Young - would give him exactly that at a time when union in the northern hemisphere was still stumbling out of the faux-amateur era. What McGeechan might not have envisaged was how much else Bentley would bring to the party. While his 70-metre try against Gauteng at Ellis Park and running battle with Springbok totem James Small against Western Province were unforgettable, so too were his contributions off the pitch - relentlessly upbeat, finding fun everywhere, the embodiment of the perfect Lions tourist. Robinson had a storied league career with Wigan, England and Great Britain before switching codes to join Sale, just seven months before the Lions tour to Australia. While he had been picked three times for England in the 2001 Six Nations he had never started a rugby union Test and never scored an international union try. He was so convinced that he would not be picked by Lions coach Graham Henry that when the squad announcement was made he was in his back garden mending a fence. Henry, helped by the counsel of his defence specialist Phil Larder, who had coached Robinson in the GB and England rugby league sides, believed when others did not. If Robinson could blow apart tightly organised league defences, he reasoned, he could do so if given ball and space in union. So it proved. On his Lions debut Robinson ran in five tries against a weak Queensland President's XV; when the chance came in the first Test, with Wallabies full-back Chris Latham ahead of him and no space to work in at all, he swerved and skipped past just as he had so many times for Wigan. Another try would follow in the third Test in Sydney. While the Lions would lose the tightest of series 2-1, Robinson would be back in Stadium Australia two years later to score England's only try in their World Cup final triumph. Much of what Henry did on that tour came in for sustained criticism in the aftermath; his punt on Robinson never could.

Under their reign, Mysore overtook the Bengal Subah as India's dominant economic power, with productive agriculture and textile manufacturing.Tipu Sultan is credited with founding state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded depots in foreign locations such as Karachi, Jeddah and Muscat, where Mysore products were sold. During Tipu's rule French technology was used for the first time in carpentry and smithing, Chinese technology was used for sugar production, and technology from Bengal helped improve the sericulture industry. State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the monopoly in the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, betel nut, tobacco and sandalwood, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty-one centers within the kingdom.The Mysore silk industry was initiated during the rule of Tipu Sultan. Later the industry was hit by a global depression and competition from imported silk and rayon. In the second half of the 20th century, it however revived and the Mysore State became the top multivoltine silk producer in India.Under Tipu Sultan, Mysore enjoyed one of the world's highest real wages and living standards in the late 18th century, higher than Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe. Mysore's average per-capita income was five times higher than subsistence level, i.e. five times higher than 400 (1990 international dollars), or 2,000 per capita. In comparison, the highest national per-capita incomes... Guess a valid title for it!

Q:Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

Answer the following question: Process: - Plates on the Earth&#x27;s crust move slowly past each other - As the plates move, they exert a great force - When the force is large enough, the crust breaks - The stress is released as energy - The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves - We feel the earthquake - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less force is exerted happens, how will it affect the crust will break sooner. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if lesser force is exerted between the plates on the Earth's crust, the crust will break sooner. In this case, the supposed perturbation would have both direct and indirect effects on the process of plate movement and earthquake generation. Direct Effects: 1. Reduced force between the plates: If the force between the plates is less than usual, the plates might not exert enough pressure to build up significant stress at the plate boundaries. As a result, the likelihood or frequency of crust breaking may decrease. 2. Smaller energy release: With less force exerted, the amount of stress that accumulates in the crust before it breaks would likely be lesser. Consequently, when the crust does break, the energy release in the form of seismic waves might be smaller, leading to weaker earthquakes or less noticeable ground shaking. Indirect Effects: 1. Unpredictability: If the forces between plates become less predictable, so does the pattern of earthquake occurrence. Reduced force may lead to different timings or locations of crustal breaking, making it more difficult to accurately assess and prepare for seismic risks. 2. Plate boundary changes: If less force is exerted consistently, it could potentially alter the dynamics of plate boundaries. This might lead to changes in the way crustal materials behave at the boundaries, which in turn could affect the long-term geological activity and landscape evolution in those areas. 3. Tectonic implications: Lesser forces could indirectly impact the tectonic processes, such as the creation of new crust at divergent boundaries or the destruction of old crust at convergent boundaries. Over time, this could have broader implications for the Earth's geological and geophysical processes. It is important to note that the dynamics of plate tectonics and earthquakes are significantly complex, and any perturbation to established processes may have far-reaching consequences that are difficult to predict or model accurately."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It has definitely added a unique and creative touch to my smartphone's home screen. Overall, I would give this app a well-deserved 4 out of 5 stars. The app offers a wide variety of high-quality images from various sources. It has consistently kept me engaged with its daily rotation of wallpapers, which is a beautiful blend of classic paintings, modern art, and stunning photography. The blur and dim effects effortlessly ensure that my app icons remain visible, and I can appreciate the artwork without any distractions. Muzei's integration with other apps and support for third-party extensions is noteworthy and allows me to customize my experience even further. Additionally, the option to manually select and add personal images to the wallpaper rotation is a fantastic feature. However, there are a few areas where I believe the app could benefit from some improvements. The main drawback I've encountered is occasional image loading issues, which cause a delay in updating wallpapers. For users with limited data, the app might be a concern, as there seems to be no option to reduce image quality or limit data usage. To sum up, Muzei Live Wallpaper (net.nurik.roman.muzei) is a highly appealing and engaging app that art enthusiasts or anyone looking to add a touch of creativity to their home screen should give a try.

After losing the first Test, England lead 2-1 and will earn a first series win in India since 1985 if they avoid defeat in the final match in Nagpur. Media playback is not supported on this device \\"I can't fault the character they have shown since Ahmedabad,\\" said Cook. \\"I can't praise the lads enough, but we have to keep our feet on the ground because we're here to win the series.\\" Just as in the the 10-wicket second Test win in Mumbai, the victory in Kolkata came after Cook lost the toss and was asked to field first. But England restricted India to 316 all out, with the bowlers again coming to the fore to take six wickets for 36 runs on the fourth afternoon to halt the hosts' second-innings revival. \\"After Ahmedabad, a few basic things were rammed home to the England team. Deep down, they knew they had a better bowling attack than India, but that was never going to do them any good unless they had runs to play with. The tourists worked out what they had to do - bat long, sell your wicket dearly.\\" Read the rest of Jonathan Agnew's column \\"It was a great performance level for four and a half days. Everyone performed from one to 11,\\" Cook, on his first tour since being appointed as Andrew Strauss's successor, told BBC Sport. \\"To keep India to 300 on that wicket was a fantastic effort and to get six wickets in that session really won us the game. It was a credit to the hard work they've put in that they can perform in these conditions.\\" Cook made 190 - an England record 23rd Test century - in the tourists' first-innings total of 523, but was denied a double hundred by a bizarre run-out. The left-hander, in easy reach of the crease at the non-striker's end, moved to avoid Virat Kohli's throw, which then hit the stumps to leave the opener short of his ground. \\"I just wasn't thinking and before I knew it I was out,\\" said the Essex man. \\"It was a frustrating way to go, but if someone offers you 190 before the game you take it. 1984-85: India 1-2 England (5 Tests) 1992-93: India 3-0 England (3 Tests) 2001-02: India 1-0 England (3 Tests) 2005-06: India 1-1 England (3 Tests) 2008-09: India 1-0 England (2 Tests) \\"The record means a huge amount. I was probably more emotional when I got the 22nd century, but it means a lot to be on top of that list.\\" Cook's efforts helped England to a lead of 207 and the tourists looked set for an innings victory when India collapsed on the fourth afternoon. However, Ravichandran Ashwin's 91 not out stretched the game into a fifth day, with England eventually set 41 to win. They slipped to 8-3 - including Cook, stumped in the first over - but were taken across the line by Nick Compton and Ian Bell. \\"It's a great win, especially after losing the toss on a wicket like that,\\" Cook continued. \\"It's not 'job done' though, there's still five days in Nagpur to go.\\" \\"England have beaten India at their own game, despite having lost the toss in their last two matches. They have been playing on subcontinental style pitches, but have emphatically outplayed India. Seven wickets does not really flatter England but that won't matter. It's a terrific turnaround from the first Test.\\" Fast bowler James Anderson, who took six wickets in Kolkata, told BBC Sport's Sportsweek programme: \\"After the first Test we thought it would be tough, but we bounced back last week and to produce an equally impressive performance this week is really special. \\"Alastair Cook has been brilliant. He likes to lead from the front and by example and he's clearly doing that at the moment. \\"It's vital for the team to get a big first innings score and his 190 was crucial in us doing that here.\\" Listen to Jonathan Agnew and Geoffrey Boycott's analysis of the final day's play on the Test Match Special podcast.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose daughter recalls she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen? , can you please find it? The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The Gunpowder Plot was conspiracy to kill King James I, as well as the members of the House of Lords and Commons at the re-opening of Parliament. It was designed by a group of Catholics in protest against the anti-Catholic laws that were being introduced by the king. Robert Catesby was the leader of the group. It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks. It's a family tradition and an occasion to eat potatoes baked by the flames. There is always a 'guy' on top of the fire, a model of Guy Fawkes, dressed in the clothes of the 17th century.

Q: The town's first significant defences were likely erected due to commercial interests, following the temporary seizure of St. John's by the Dutch admiral Michiel de Ruyter in June 1665. The inhabitants were able to fend off a second Dutch attack in 1673, when this time it was defended by Christopher Martin, an English merchant captain. Martin landed six cannons from his vessel, the Elias Andrews, and constructed an earthen breastwork and battery near chain Rock commanding the Narrows leading into the harbour. With only twenty-three men, the valiant Martin beat off an attack by three Dutch warships. The English government planned to expand these fortifications (Fort William) in around 1689, but actual construction didn't begin until after the French admiral Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville captured and destroyed the town in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign (1696). When 1500 English reinforcements arrived in late 1697 they found nothing but rubble where the town and fortifications had stood.

Clarke. The novel was developed concurrently alongside a film under the direction of Stanley Kubrick. \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" is a groundbreaking work that explores human evolution, artificial intelligence, and the presence of extraterrestrial life. The story is centered around a voyage to Jupiter with the intelligent computer HAL after the discovery of a mysterious black monolith affecting human evolution. As the crew members of the spacecraft investigate, they are subjected to a series of increasingly dangerous and inexplicable events. The novel and the film were released in 1968, during the height of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Both the book and the movie captured the public's imagination with their realistic depiction of space travel and their bold vision of humanity's place in the cosmos. The film version of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the film is famous for its scientifically accurate portrayal of space, its enigmatic narrative structure, and its pioneering use of special effects. The film features minimal dialogue and relies heavily on a stunning visual narrative accompanied by a rich classical music score, giving the audience an immersive and thought-provoking experience. Arthur C. Clarke's novel provides a more detailed and comprehensive explanation of the story's events, while the movie leaves much open to interpretation, allowing viewers to draw their own conclusions about the meaning of the monolith and the film's iconic ending. The collaboration between Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick resulted in a unique synergy, making \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" both a classic of science fiction literature and a landmark in film history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this \\"Health spending should be frozen and funds diverted to improving care for the elderly, according to the body representing independent care services.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Diverting Health Spending to Elderly Care: A Necessary Investment for the Future\\" Introduction A recent statement from the body representing independent care services suggests that health spending should be frozen and funds redirected to improving care for the elderly. This proposal is significant given the rapidly aging population and the anticipated increased demand for elderly care services. The following article will explore the reasons behind this recommendation, the benefits of prioritizing elderly care, and potential challenges arising from freezing health spending. Reasons Behind the Recommendation The primary reason for this proposal is the aging global population. According to the World Health Organization, the number of people aged 60 or older is expected to double by 2050, reaching 2.1 billion. Moreover, with advancements in healthcare leading to longer life expectancy, the need for improved elderly care services is more crucial than ever. Another reason to prioritize elderly care services stems from the existing shortcomings within the current care system. Staff shortages, sparse resources, and poor quality care in some facilities have led to suboptimal outcomes for senior citizens. By diverting funds from broader health spending, the focus can be primarily on enhancing elderly care facilities and providing better-trained staff to deliver superior care. Benefits of Prioritizing Elderly Care Investing in elderly care services will have several benefits. Firstly, it will improve the overall quality of life for senior citizens who often suffer chronic illnesses and require daily assistance. Better care services will allow them to age with dignity and comfort, greatly benefiting their mental and emotional well-being. Secondly, improved elderly care will also benefit families, who often bear the burden of caregiving, putting significant strain on their finances, relationships, and mental health. With better access to professional care, this burden can be alleviated, allowing families to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Furthermore, the investment in elderly care services will create job opportunities in healthcare and related sectors, thereby helping address the persisting challenges of underemployment and credentialing in these industries. Challenges of Freezing Health Spending While the benefits of directing funds toward elderly care are clear, there are potential challenges associated with freezing health spending. Such a freeze might limit the allocation of resources to other essential healthcare services, such as maternal and child health, mental health, or non-communicable diseases. Moreover, freezing health spending could affect progress in medical research and innovations, which could have long-term implications for public health. However, it is essential to recognize that investing in elderly care services is not only a moral obligation but also an acute societal need that will continue to grow in importance. Ensuring the well-being of an aging population is critical for the continuity of our communities and economies, and, therefore, a balanced approach to healthcare spending should be adopted to prioritize this pressing need. Conclusion In conclusion, the idea of freezing health spending and diverting funds to improving elderly care services, as suggested by the body representing independent care services, is an essential step in addressing the increasing demands of an aging population. It is crucial to weigh the benefits and challenges carefully and implement a comprehensive and balanced approach to tackle this growing issue efficiently and sustainably. Investing in elderly care today will pave the way to a better future not only for our aging societies but also for the generations that follow."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step-by-step justification: 1. Magma moves closer to the Earth's crust: As tectonic plates move or pressure decreases, magma from the mantle (the partially molten layer of the Earth) begins to rise toward the crust. 2. The magma starts to cool: As the magma gets closer to the Earth's cooler crust, the temperature of the magma decreases, leading to the cooling process. 3. The cooling causes atoms in the magma to condense: As the magma cools down, the atoms within it start to lose their high-energy states and begin to bond together. This process of condensing forms different mineral structures. 4. The condensed magma solidifies: With further cooling, the minerals in the magma continue to bond and eventually form solid materials, leading to the solidification of the condensed magma. 5. The solidified magma forms igneous rock: Once the magma has completely solidified, it forms a type of rock called igneous rock, which can be either intrusive (formed within the Earth's crust) or extrusive (formed due to volcanic eruptions or other surface events).

Q:Background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... Paragraph: Two continents were known for the strange discrepancies in animal populations. Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which continent was inhabited by fewer turtles?

André Kertész (French: [kɛʁtɛs]; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Kertész Andor, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known. They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period.

This is a correct answer to the following question about World War I. Yes or no?

Question: who started world war i","completion":"No, this answer is not a correct answer to the question \\"Who started World War I?\\" To properly answer the question, let me provide a brief overview of the event: 1. World War I began on July 28, 1914, and lasted until November 11, 1918. One of the most significant triggers for the start of the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist, Gavrilo Princip, on June 28, 1914. 2. Growing tensions among European powers, along with intricate alliances, made the situation ripe for a major conflict. There were two main alliances - the Triple Entente (comprised of France, Russia, and the United Kingdom) and the Triple Alliance (consisting of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy). 3. After the assassination, Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia, which was rejected. Consequently, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, beginning World War I. 4. Other nations quickly got involved in the conflict because of their alliances and mutual defense agreements. In conclusion, there is no single nation or person that can be solely blamed for the start of World War I. However, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was an important trigger that set off a chain of events, leading to the global conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices: -- yes. -- it is not possible to tell. -- no.","completion":"-- no. The hypothesis \\"The Imperial Palace wouldn't be of interest to those with an interest in Japanese design\\" contradicts the given premise, which suggests that Kyoto Gosho (The Imperial Palace), along with the Katsura and Shugakuin imperial villas, are mandatory destinations for anyone with even a shred of interest in Japanese architecture, design, and aesthetics. By mandating the visitation of these places for individuals with any level of interest in the above-mentioned domains, we can deduce that the Imperial Palace is indeed a valuable destination that holds importance in the context of Japanese design. Located in Kyoto, the Imperial Palace is a symbol of Japanese history and culture, showcasing intriguing architectural designs from various periods. It is the former location of the emperor's residence and the political center of Japan until 1869. Some highlights of the palace include the main gate, the Shishinden (Throne Hall), the Seiryoden (Imperial residence), and the exquisite gardens and court markings. All of these aspects contribute to the rich Japanese design character found throughout the palace grounds. On the other hand, the Katsura and Shugakuin imperial villas are also outstanding examples of Japanese design. The Katsura Imperial Villa is a magnificent representation of Japanese architecture and garden design from the early Edo period. Its unique layout and intricate architectural details are a testament to the craftsmanship of this period. Similarly, the Shugakuin Imperial Villa, built during the mid-17th century, consists of stunning tea houses, gardens, rustic huts, and ponds, showcasing the beauty of Japanese design in both architecture and landscaping. Based on the importance that the Imperial Palace and the Katsura and Shugakuin imperial villas hold in the context of Japanese architecture, design, and aesthetics, it is safe to say that the hypothesis in question is false. Instead, the Imperial Palace, along with the Katsura and Shugakuin imperial villas, are indeed of interest to those with a fascination for Japanese design."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Take out a piece of paper or use a calendar tool on your computer to create slots of every hour of your work day, or the hours of the day that you are awake. This could be from nine to five or ten to seven. Though you do not need to fill up each time period down to the minute, it can be helpful to make sure each hour of your day is accounted for in your schedule. Start to fill each hour of the day with your required tasks for the day. You may start with the most important tasks first and work your way down to the least important tasks. As well, if you consider yourself a morning person, you may decide to put the more complicated tasks earlier in the day, but if you know you usually get a second wind after lunch, you may place complicated tasks later in the day. Try to customize your schedule to fit your needs and work habits, as this will set you up for success when you use the schedule. You may want to create a template for your schedule on a whiteboard or a calendar tool so you can update it every day according to your schedule for that day. It can be difficult to focus on one task or a group of tasks for longer than one to two hours. Make sure you schedule in a ten minute break every hour or every two hours so you do not feel overworked or stressed out. During the mini break, you should get up and walk around the office, or talk to a coworker in the break room. You may go get a coffee or go for a quick walk outside. Try to keep the break to 10 minutes or less so your schedule is not thrown off. You can also take 10 long, slow deep breaths at the top of every hour to clear your mind and pause. This may help you to get some perspective on a task you are doing or going to do and ensure you are checking in with yourself despite your busy work day. Rather than try to rush through your schedule and address every item quickly, take the time to do each task correctly, the first time. Rushing through your emails could lead to prolonged email exchanges, especially if you send cryptic or confusing emails to a client. Slow down and take some time to compose clear emails, or do a thorough read of your school notes. Doing a task right the first time can save you lots of wasted time in the long run. Sometimes we need the support of others to stay focused on the tasks at hand. Ask a close friend, a parent, a sibling, or a coworker to check in with you every couple of hours to ensure you are sticking to your schedule. They may bring you a cup of coffee or toss out a friendly word so you can take a moment to laugh or smile and then get back to your daily tasks. Though you may be busy, having a small moment with a friend can lift your spirits and lead to better time management.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the painting whose duplicate was radically different in feel? By the time Hope was exhibited, Watts had already committed himself to donate his most significant works to the nation, and although he received multiple offers for the painting he thought it inappropriate not to include Hope in this donation, in light of the fact that it was already being considered one of his most important pictures. In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated to the nation allowing him to sell the original. Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is radically different in feel. The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.In late 1886 this second version was one of nine paintings donated to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in the first instalment of Watts's gift to the nation. Meanwhile, the original was briefly displayed in Nottingham before being sold to the steam tractor entrepreneur Joseph Ruston in 1887. Its whereabouts was long unknown until in 1986 it was auctioned at Sotheby's for £869,000 (about £2,500,000 in 2019 terms), 100 years after its first exhibition.On their donation to the South Kensington Museum, the nine works donated by Watts were hung on the staircase leading to the library, but Hope proved a popular loan to other institutions as a symbol of current British art. At the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887 in Manchester, an entire wall was dedicated to the works of Watts. Hope, only recently completed but already the most famous of Watts's works, was placed at the centre of this display. It was then exhibited at the 1888 Melbourne Centennial Exhibition and the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris, before being moved to Munich for display at the Glaspalast.

Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How do I make the wood clean and smooth?","completion":"To make wood clean and smooth, you'd follow these steps: Step 1: Inspect the wood Carefully look for any imperfections, dirt, or foreign objects stuck in the wood. This step will help you understand the cleaning and smoothing needs of the wood surface. Step 2: Remove dirt and debris Use a soft brush or cloth to wipe away any surface dirt and debris. If there is hard-to-remove grime or sticky residues, you may use a soft damp cloth with a mild detergent or soap to gently clean the wood surface, being careful not to soak the wood. Step 3: Repair any damages If there are any large splinters, uneven surfaces, or other noticeable damage, use wood filler or putty to fill in the gaps or holes. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to apply and allow the filler to dry before proceeding to the next step. Step 4: Sand the wood Start by sanding the wood with a coarse-grit sandpaper (around 80-100 grit) to remove any rough or uneven spots. Sand in the direction of the wood grain to minimize scratches. Then, move to a medium-grit sandpaper (around 120-150 grit) to smooth the surface further. Finally, finish with a fine-grit sandpaper (around 180-220 grit) for a smooth, clean finish. Remember to wipe the wood surface with a dry cloth or tack cloth between each sanding session to remove any dust or debris. Step 5: Optional - Apply wood conditioner If you plan to stain the wood, apply a wood conditioner following the manufacturer's instructions. This step will help to ensure the stain absorbs evenly across the wood surface. Step 6: Apply finish Once the wood surface is clean and smooth, apply your choice of protective finish, such as varnish, polyurethane, or oil. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application, allowing the finish to dry completely before handling the wood. By following these steps, you can transform rough, unclean wood into a smooth, clean surface that's ready for further use or decoration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: The original rock is the source of the inorganic portion of the soil. Mechanical weathering breaks rock into smaller pieces. Chemical reactions change the rock's minerals. Choices: - liquid - nuclear - mineral - chemical A: Answer:","completion":"The type of weathering that causes changes in the rock's materials, as stated in the given paragraph, is chemical weathering. Weathering generally refers to the breakdown of rocks, soils, and minerals through direct contact with the planet's atmosphere. There are two primary types of weathering, namely chemical and mechanical. Mechanical weathering involves the breakdown of rocks into smaller pieces without any change in their chemical composition. This occurs through agents like wind, water, thermal expansion and contraction, and biological activity, all of which physically break down the rock structures. For instance, freezing and thawing cycles can cause rock to crack and fracture over time, while plants can wear away rock as roots expand into cracks and crevices. On the other hand, chemical weathering involves the alteration or decomposition of rocks and minerals due to chemical reactions. This results in changes to the rock's mineral composition and can lead to the formation of new minerals. Agents of chemical weathering include water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and acidic substances. For example, water can react with minerals in rock to form clays, changing the rock's chemical composition. Also, carbon dioxide dissolved in rainwater forms a weak carbonic acid that can dissolve certain types of rock such as limestone. In the context of the paragraph provided, the statement, \\"Chemical reactions change the rock's minerals,\\" clearly points to chemical weathering as the process leading to changes in the rock's materials. Therefore, among the choices provided - liquid, nuclear, mineral, and chemical - the correct answer is chemical, since it is the type of weathering that causes changes in the rock's materials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Powhatan People (sometimes Powhatans) (also spelled Powatan) are an Indigenous group traditionally from Virginia. In some instances, The Powhatan, may refer to one of the leaders of the people. This is most commonly the case in historical writings by the English. The Powhatans have also been known as Virginia Algonquians, as the Powhatan language is an eastern-Algonquian language also known as Virginia Algonquian. The Powhatan lived east of the Fall Line in Tidewater Virginia. They built their houses, called yehakins, by bending saplings and placing woven mats or bark over top of the saplings. They supported themselves primarily by growing crops, especially maize, but they also fished and hunted in the great forest in their area. Villages consisted of a number of related families organized in tribes led by a chief (weroance/werowance or weroansqua if female). They paid tribute to the paramount chief (mamanatowick), Powhatan. According to research by the National Park Service, Powhatan \\"men were warriors and hunters, while women were gardeners and gatherers. The English described the men, who ran and walked extensively through the woods in pursuit of enemies or game, as tall and lean and possessed of handsome physiques. The women were shorter, and were strong because of the hours they spent tending crops, pounding corn into meal, gathering nuts, and performing other domestic chores. When the men undertook extended hunts, the women went ahead of them to construct hunting camps. The Powhatan domestic economy depended on the labor of both sexes.\\" All of Virginia's natives practiced agriculture. They periodically moved their villages from site to site. Villagers cleared the fields by felling, girdling, or firing trees at the base and then using fire to reduce the slash and stumps. A village became unusable as soil productivity gradually declined and local fish and game were depleted. The inhabitants then moved on. With every change in location, the people used fire to clear new land. They left more cleared land behind. The natives also used fire to maintain extensive areas of open game habitat throughout the East, later called \\"barrens\\" by European colonists. The Powhatan also had rich fishing grounds. Bison had migrated to this area by the early 15th century. Where did they establish?","completion":"The Powhatan people established themselves in the Tidewater region of Virginia, which is the coastal plain area located east of the Fall Line. This region is characterized by its low, flat lands, numerous rivers, and proximity to the Chesapeake Bay. The area provided the Powhatan with fertile land, abundant resources for hunting, fishing, and agriculture, as well as access to waterways for transportation and trade. Their villages were typically situated along the banks of rivers and waterways, which further facilitated their lifestyle and community activities."},{"prompt":"Question: how did lena horne impact the harlem renaissance I found the following answer on Google: Many of its ideas lived on much longer.

In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Michael Gray wrote that the album was: \\"Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s.\\" The track \\"Most of the Time\\", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while \\"What Was It You Wanted?\\" has been interpreted both as a...

Please write a short summary for the following article: Microsoft: Secret Codes, Straight Talk David LeBlanc may be the most straightforward person in the computer industry. The 48-year-old engineer is responsible for an important product at a big software company, a position that usually lends itself to an oily brew of dissembling, p.r. and spin. LeBlanc, however, is startlingly honest. He says of one feature from an older version of his product: \\"It was a mistake to have even offered it.\\" A certain programmer working on another product had no business doing so, he says. A particular version of the product works so badly that users would be better off using something from another company. And so on. LeBlanc's frankness is all the more remarkable when you consider that he works at the biggest software company, Microsoft ( MSFT - news - people ), with one of its biggest products, Office. Specifically, he is responsible for Office's encryption, which is what you use to scramble a Word or Excel file to keep prying eyes from being able to read it. I initially encountered LeBlanc after calling Microsoft with some run-of-the-mill Office encryption questions. LeBlanc, a ten-year Microsoft veteran, was the person the company put on the phone to explain things. He ended up not only answering my questions, but also giving the sort of unvarnished, real-world history that you rarely get from any company, Microsoft included. LeBlanc's basic narrative is that while Office encryption is now first-rate, it was a long time coming. Sometimes the fault wasn't Microsoft's; up until the late 1990s, there were government controls limiting the strength of encryption software that might be shipped abroad. But in many other instances Microsoft had no one but itself to blame. Usually, LeBlanc says, it was because the programmers developing Office encryption weren't specialists and ended up making lots of beginner's mistakes. The most basic form of encryption is the decoder ring, in which one letter substitutes for another. Modern computer-based encryption systems are vastly more complex. But computers are a double-edged sword, since bad guys can use the brute force of a computer to break a code, the way the Allies broke Enigma in World War II. As a result, says LeBlanc, the job of an encryption system \\"is to try to hold off the attacker long enough so that the information is no longer valuable by the time he gets it. You can never make it impossible. Just very, very hard.\\" Which is where Microsoft has let its users down over the years. Versions of Office from the 1990s have encryption so weak that even well-chosen passwords can be cracked by specialized programs, in some cases in a few minutes. \\"We had a guy who was a good programmer, but didn't know anything about encryption,\\" admits LeBlanc. Things slowly improved at Microsoft, not only with encryption but with security in general. And while Office 2003 had much better encryption than its predecessors, it still wasn't good enough for users with supersensitive information, like the proverbial formula for Coca-Cola ( KO - news - people ). In fact, LeBlanc says that Office 2003 users should use third-party encryption software to protect their documents, and recommends the data compression program made by WinZip. Even Office 2007, Microsoft's most recent version, was nearly saddled with a serious encryption bug. One part of every encryption system is the portion that handles passwords. The relevant code in Office 2007 was simply too well-written; because it worked so quickly, a crypto-attacker could rapidly progress through all possible password variations. Someone caught the error before the product was shipped and rewrote the software to make it slower--50,000 times slower, as it happened. It may be one of the few times in software history that programmers deliberately made a program run slower rather than faster. Ironically, hearing straight talk about the difficulties Microsoft had getting encryption right made me more, not less, willing to trust them with it. But I still had the obvious question: If so much has gone wrong with Office encryption in the past, why should we assume it's now all fixed? LeBlanc says the programmers who handle encryption now are specialists who work closely with scientists at Microsoft Research. He also notes, correctly, that his isn't the only tech company that does better on security these days than it has in the past. \\"I am not saying it's perfect,\\" he says. \\"Things change. But to the best of my knowledge, and to the best of the knowledge of all the people who have reviewed it, it's solid and very good.\\" Senior editor Lee Gomes covers technology from our Silicon Valley bureau.

Undefeated in battle, Alexander had conquered the Persian Empire in its entirety by 330 BC. By the time of his death in 323 BC, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to India. His empire split into several kingdoms upon his death, the most famous of which were the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch, Seleucia and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa. Although the political unity of Alexander's empire could not be maintained, it resulted in the Hellenistic civilization and spread the Greek language and Greek culture in the territories conquered by Alexander.

How to create a coconut volcano Choose a space that is easy to clean. This is a messy project so find an area that can cope with getting a little messy, or work in an area that can be covered thoroughly with newspaper (such as the kitchen counter or table). You can skip the messy newspaper if you do the experiment outside on gravel.","completion":"Step 1: Gather the necessary materials. To create a coconut volcano, you will need the following items: - A coconut with its top cut off and its water removed - Baking soda - Vinegar - Food coloring (optional) - A small cup or container - A spoon - Newspaper (if working indoors) Justification: Before starting any project, it is important to have all the necessary materials at hand to ensure a smooth execution of the task. Step 2: Set up the work area. If you are working indoors, cover your work area with newspaper to protect it from any spills or mess. If you are working outdoors, ensure the chosen location is suitable for the project and can be easily cleaned afterward. Justification: Properly setting up the working area helps to prevent any mishaps or damage to the surroundings. Step 3: Place the small cup or container inside the coconut. Insert the small cup or container into the hollowed-out coconut. This will be used to hold the vinegar and create the volcanic reaction. Justification: The cup or container is needed to house the reacting agents that will create the \\"lava\\" effect. Step 4: Add baking soda. Using a spoon, add a few spoonfuls of baking soda to the small cup or container in the coconut. The exact amount depends on the size of your container, but generally, 2-3 spoonfuls should be sufficient. Justification: Baking soda is one of the two main ingredients needed for the reaction to occur, so adding it to the container is a crucial step. Step 5: Add food coloring (optional). If you want to create a more visually appealing lava effect, add a few drops of food coloring to the baking soda and mix it in. Justification: Food coloring adds a visually interesting aspect to the project and can make the lava explosion more enjoyable to watch. Step 6: Prepare the vinegar. Pour the vinegar into a separate container (a glass or measuring cup will work well). You will need about twice as much vinegar as there is baking soda in the coconut container. Justification: Vinegar is the second key ingredient that reacts with the baking soda, and having it ready to pour quickly will make it easier to create the explosion. Step 7: Create the volcano eruption! Quickly pour the vinegar into the cup or container with the baking soda. The reaction between the baking soda and vinegar will cause the mixture to bubble up and overflow, creating a volcanic eruption effect. Observe and enjoy the reaction! Justification: Pouring the vinegar into the baking soda is the final step that triggers the reaction, creating the desired coconut volcano effect."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I was driving on Highway 35 on my way home from work. Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.

Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan.

One such dance is waltz . There is a basic form for waltz, which you can see in this drawing of a dancing couple. The man places one arm around the woman's waist and she places her opposite hand on his shoulder. Then, they stretch their other arms out from their bodies and clasp hand.

Formal dancing has even become a profession, with people entering competitions. Have you ever seen a formal dance competition? Today, ballroom dancing is almost considered a competitive sport; professionals perform different dances, each with strict rules. Everything from where the dancers place their hands to how they move is judged. In the glide waltz, dancers are judged by how smoothly they move. \\" I can dance with a glass of water on my head,\\" is a well known sentence used by skilled dancers in the old days. In the past, some people learned how to dance by reading books, while others studied with a teacher called the \\"dancing master.\\" How do people learn to dance today? What is the author's purpose in writing the passage? A) To tell us to learn waltz. B) To tell us how to dance. C) To tell us something about waltz. D) To tell us the development of waltz. Answer:","completion":"The author's purpose in writing the passage seems to be D) To tell us the development of waltz. The passage explores various elements of the waltz dance, discussing its basic form, various styles like the traditional and Mexican waltz, and how the dance has evolved over the years. For instance, the waltz's transformation into a competitive form and the standards by which performances are judged are discussed. The topic of education in waltz and dance, in general, is also brought up, comparing historical methods such as dance books and dance masters to unspecified current techniques. The text doesn't explicitly instruct readers to learn the waltz (option A) or general dance moves (option B). It also does more than just inform about the waltz (option C) by providing a larger context for its existing forms, how it is performed and judged competitively, and its evolution in dance education. Hence, the passage goes beyond stating features of the waltz to illustrating its relevance and development over the years, underlining the answer that the main purpose is D) To tell us the development of waltz."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - eat ice cream - swim - cut hair - cool off - lemonade The answer is \\"swim\\" because Answer:","completion":"The hot weather was unbearable, and you needed relief. Out of the given options - eat ice cream, swim, cut hair, cool off, and lemonade - the answer is \\"swim\\" because: Step 1: Analyzing the options for immediate relief against heat: - Eating ice cream provides only a temporary sense of relief from the heat. - Cutting hair doesn't have a direct impact on providing relief from hot weather. - Drinking lemonade can help cool you down, but its effects can be short-lived. Step 2: Comparing the remaining options: - Cooling off could encompass various activities, but it's a less specific option among the given alternatives, so keep it for the last comparison. - Swimming involves submerging oneself in water, which can directly impact body temperature and provide lasting relief from the heat. Step 3: Selecting the best option: - Comparing swimming and cooling off, swimming is a more precise and effective solution to combat unbearable heat.

Does the word \\"conduct\\" mean the same thing in \\"She can not conduct modern pieces.\\" and \\"Bernstein conducted Mahler like no other conductor.\\"?","completion":"The word \\"conduct\\" has different meanings in various contexts, but in both sentences provided, it refers to the act of directing or leading a musical performance. However, the nuances of the word \\"conduct\\" in these sentences carry slightly different implications. In the first sentence, \\"She cannot conduct modern pieces,\\" the primary meaning of \\"conduct\\" is to lead or guide a group of musicians, specifically in playing music. Here, \\"conduct\\" suggests that the person is not able to effectively direct or lead the performers in playing modern pieces. This limitation might be due to several factors, including lack of knowledge, experience, or ability to connect with the artistic style of the modern pieces they're attempting to perform. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"Bernstein conducted Mahler like no other conductor,\\" the word \\"conduct\\" not only refers to the act of directing a musical performance but also implies a certain level of mastery or excellence in that direction. This sentence suggests that Leonard Bernstein's ability to conduct Mahler's music was unique and of remarkably high quality, distinguishing him from other conductors. It highlights the manner in which Bernstein led the orchestras successfully during the performances of Mahler's symphonies. In conclusion, while the word \\"conduct\\" in both sentences refers to the act of directing a musical performance, it conveys a sense of limitation and inability in the first sentence, while in the second sentence, it denotes extraordinary proficiency and the exceptional ability to create a distinctive interpretation of the music."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In discussing Ukraine, however, Putin seemed to go out of his way to suggest he had no aggressive intentions and was not planning to divide the rest of the country.

He noticed when he fell, he got a pretty bad cut in his knee. He decided to ignore the injury for now and keep playing. Later when he got home he realized the area of the cut was warm and swollen But I can use this background: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm.

I had two, one for staff accountant and the other was as accounting manager for a holistic health clinic. The clinic job paid about 40% more and came with a “manager” title. I believed in myself and all that, but who offers someone just out of school with only 2 years of internship and no specialty in field manager level? That kept bugging me. Something just wasn’t right. Acting on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies. The IRS was after them — it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn’t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic’s Board of Directors. It was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out. Those in on the medical fraud got even worse and the three principals all got 2-digit sentences. Question: What kind of financial situation is he in?

Furthermore, details about the person's income, savings, debt, and expenses are not provided. Some factors that may have impacted the person's financial situation include legal fees, asset seizure, penalties, and damage to their reputation. This could have made it difficult to secure another job or maintain a source of income. On the other hand, the individual may have taken steps to rebuild their finances after serving time in jail or pay back any debts incurred due to the fraudulent activities.

Premise: - California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations. - There is only one legal aid lawyer per 10,000 poor people. Hypothesis: - There is a wide range of legal aid options in California. Let's go step-by-step: 1. The premise states that California has a strong network of legal aid organizations, which would potentially support the hypothesis that there is a wide range of legal aid options in California. 2. The second part of the premise, however, reveals that there is a limited number of legal aid lawyers available per 10,000 poor people. This statement could be interpreted as limiting the accessibility to legal aid options due to the shortage of lawyers. Now, let's evaluate the answer options: a) It could be tempting to answer \\"yes,\\" considering the strong network of organizations mentioned in the premise. However, the disparity in the number of lawyers per poor people makes this answer less straightforward. b) \\"It is not possible to tell\\" would indicate that there is not enough information in the premise to support the hypothesis. c) \\"No\\" would mean that the premise contradicts or does not support the hypothesis. Considering the mentioned steps, the best answer would be: b). it is not possible to tell.

This could end the worries of many parents fearful for their children's safety on the roads. Until now the Country Council has only been prepared to provide bus services for children living more than three miles from their school, or sometimes less if special reasons existed. Now it has been decided that if a group of parents ask for help in organizing transport they will be prepared to go ahead, provided the arrangement will not lose money and that children taking part will be attending their nearest school. The new scheme is to be tried out this term for children living at Milton who attend Impington school. The children live just within the three-mile limit and the Council has said in the past it will not undertake to provide free transport to the school. But now they have agreed to organize a bus service from Milton to Impington and back, a plan which has the support of the school's headmaster. Between 50 and 60 parents have said they would like their children to take part. Final calculations have still to be carried out, but a council official has said the cost to parents should be less than PS6. 50 a term. They have been able to arrange the service at a low cost because there is already an agreement with the bus company for a bus to take children who live further away to Impington. The same bus would now just make an extra journey to pick up the Milton children. The official said they would get in touch with other groups of parents who in the past had asked if transport could be provided for their children, to see if they would like to take part in the new scheme.

The easiest way to do it is to stack rocks to create a spillway on the edge of your pond. You could also dig out the soil to create a lower pond and an upper pond. Connect them by having the water spill from the upper pond to the lower one or by building a sloping stream between them. If you already have a pond in your yard, pile up soil and rocks to create a shelf for water to spill from. This is the easiest way to get a waterfall since you get to avoid a lot of extra digging. The water falls from the spillway to the pond, then enters a pump system you install to bring it back to the top. To create a stream, you need to first dig out a pair of ponds or basins. Then, dig out the stream to go from the higher basin to the lower one. The stream has to be sloped to move water downhill, so working on a natural incline in your yard reduces the amount of digging you have to do. With a stream, you have the option to build many small waterfalls. Arrange the rocks in the stream to create shelves for the water to spill from. Stream waterfalls are long compared to pond waterfalls and require a stronger pump and a longer hose. For example, streams are generally at least 3 ft (0.91 m) long, so you need to commit more space in your yard to set it up. If you have limited space or a yard that isn’t easy to build on, you still have a way to get a good pond. Stack strong building material like limestone boulders to build a basin that catches the water. Then, stack more of the material on one end of the basin to create an area for the water to fall from. You could build a basin out of resistant materials like cinder blocks or bricks. Above-ground waterfalls come in many styles, so let your creativity loose when designing yours. To hold the pond together, spread a waterproof expanding foam around every rock. The building material has to be strong and well-sealed to hold the water in place. Most pond and stream waterfalls involve a little bit of digging. For this type of waterfall, you basically dig a hole in the ground, then make a vertical stack of rocks on one end. Place a water hose in the rocks to spill water down and into the basin. This is called a pondless basin, and the water gets circulated continuously through a strong pump. This type of waterfall is similar to any basic pond waterfall. If you don’t already have a pond or a water basin, you could dig a new one before building your waterfall. The average size of a pond with a built-in waterfall is 10 ft × 15 ft (3.0 m × 4.6 m). If you’re planning on making a stream or a pondless basin, do some math to estimate the minimum size you need. Generally, the basin has to hold about 2.5 times the amount of water circulating through the waterfall. To figure out how much water is in motion through your waterfall, measure the waterfall’s length, width, and depth in feet. The formula is length x width x (depth x 0.25) x 7.48. The 0.25 is the thickness of the water and the 7.48 is the number of gallons in a cubic foot. Then, multiply the amount of water in motion by 2.5 to figure out how many total gallons of water you need. For example, if your waterfall is 10 x 3 x 0.5 ft in size: 10 ft x 3 ft x (0.25 x 0.5 ft) x 7.48 gal/cubic ft = 28.05 gallons of water in motion. Then, 28.76 gallons x 2.5 = 70 gallons of water needed in the pond. Remember to do the same for the upper pond or basin if you plan on building one. Keep it roughly the same size to ensure water moves through the waterfall at a steady rate. Put your waterfall in a spot where it can be enjoyed from different angles, both inside and outside your home. The best spot for a pond is usually near a deck, patio, or window on your home. These areas also tend to be accessible to water spigots and electrical outlets you may need to power your waterfall. Also, since waterfalls are all about water falling from a higher area to a lower one, build on a natural incline to reduce the amount of digging you have to do. Any ponds connected to the waterfall require about 6 hours of direct sunlight if you’re keeping any plants or fish. For example, place the pond close to a water spigot so you can easily fill it with a hose. Also, the pond’s lower basin needs to be within range of an electrical outlet to operate the pump. However, connect the pump with an extension cord to prevent water from splashing onto the outlet. Gravel is very important for covering and pinning down the pond’s liner, so purchase plenty of rounded gravel or river rocks. You also need plenty of boulders and flat rocks to line the stream. These larger stones are great for decorating the pond and covering some of its construction components. Flat limestone rocks are great for creating waterfall spillways, while larger boulders are useful for framing the pond. Most home and garden centers have limited supplies of pond-building material. For a bigger selection, search for quarries and stone suppliers in your area. To figure out how many boulders you need, multiply your waterway’s length and width, then divide it by 65 tons per foot. This gives you an estimate in tons, but keep in mind that rocks come in different sizes. For instance, if your waterfall is 10 ft x 3 ft in size, you need about 0.46 tons of rocks for that area. Estimate the amount of gravel you need by taking the amount of boulders in tons you need, then dividing by 0.45. The gravel layer generally has to be about 3 in (7.6 cm) deep. For example, if your waterfall is 10 ft x 3 ft, you need approximately 1 ton of gravel to fill it.

Leia infiltrates Jabba's palace on Tatooine, disguised as a bounty hunter with Chewbacca as her prisoner. Lando is already there, disguised as a guard. Leia releases Han from the carbonite, but she is captured and enslaved. Luke arrives soon afterward but, after a tense standoff with Jabba and a battle with his rancor, is captured. Jabba sentences him, Han and Chewbacca to death, planning to feed them to the Sarlacc, a pit monster. They are taken to the Great Pit of Carkoon, the Sarlacc's nesting ground. Luke, with R2-D2's help, frees himself and battles Jabba's guards. During the chaos, Boba Fett attempts to attack Luke, but Han, temporarily blinded from the carbonite, inadvertently knocks him into the Sarlacc pit. Meanwhile, Leia strangles Jabba to death, and Luke destroys Jabba's sail barge as the group escapes. While the others rendezvous with the Rebel Alliance, Luke returns to Dagobah, where he finds that Yoda is on his deathbed. Before he dies, Yoda confirms that Darth Vader, once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and that \\"there is another\\". The ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi confirms that this \\"other\\" is Luke's twin sister: Leia. Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must fight Vader again to defeat the Empire. Obi-Wan also warns Luke to keep his emotions in check, as his anger could lead him to the Dark Side. The Rebels learn that the Empire has been constructing a second Death Star under the direct supervision of the Emperor himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of Endor; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. The strike team, accompanied by Luke and Leia, travels to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. On Endor, Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of Ewoks and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust.... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi,\\" Princess Leia is captured by the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. The context of her capture takes place during the mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba's palace on Tatooine.

This type of degree is designed to provide students with a basic foundation in a particular field of study, as well as to prepare them for entry-level jobs or further education. There are several types of associate degrees, depending on the field of study. In the United States, the most common types are the Associate of Arts (A.A.), Associate of Science (A.S.), and Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) degrees. These degrees serve different purposes and are geared toward different career paths: 1. Associate of Arts (A.A.): This degree is typically focused on liberal arts, humanities, and social sciences. It is designed for students who plan to transfer to a four-year institution to complete a bachelor's degree in the same field of study, such as literature, history, psychology, or sociology. 2. Associate of Science (A.S.): This degree is dedicated to subjects like mathematics, natural sciences, and technology. Like the A.A. degree, the A.S. is also meant for students who plan to transfer to a four-year college or university to complete a bachelor's degree in a related field, such as biology, chemistry, physics, or computer science. 3. Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.): This degree is geared toward vocational and technical fields, offering specialized training in a specific career area.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

But recharging with a shallow nap offers no such mental improvement, the research suggests. The results of the study add to the evidence that Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is very important to the brain's ability to strengthen memories. An average night's sleep includes four or five periods of REM sleep, but these tend to be longer towards the end of the night. This means that adults who get less than the recommended seven to eight hours a night -- and therefore inadequate REM sleep -- may be damaging their mind's ability to form strong memories. Although REM sleep is not classified as a type of deep sleep, it is only reached after the brain has passed through deep sleep stages. In the most recent study, participants were shown groups of three words -- such as \\"cookie\\", \\"heart\\", and \\"sixteen\\" -- and asked to find another word that can be associated with all three words. In this example, the answer would have been \\"sweet\\". They were tested once in the morning and then given the same task again in the afternoon. In between, some were allowed a nap with REM sleep, some a nap without REM sleep, while the others had a quiet rest period. The quiet rest and non-REM sleep groups showed no improvement in their test results, but the REM sleep group improved on their morning performance by an average of almost 40 percent. Dr Sara Mednick, a sleep researcher at the University of California who led the study, believes the formation of connections between previously unassociated information in the brain -- which leads to creative problem-solving -- is encouraged by mental changes which occur during REM sleep. People woken while their closed eyes made rapid movements recalled much more color1ful and detailed dreams than people woken during other stages of sleep.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

It's increasingly clear that this is the case with school bullying :Only news reports about it have increased, not the behavior itself. In fact, both bullying and fear of it are down among US middle school students The rate of students who reported fearing an attack or harm at school at all has dropped dramatically, from nearly 12% in 1995 to less than 4% in 2011. For black and Hispanic students, it's an even more encouraging shift--from more than 20% of both groups of students worried about being attacked at school to less than 5% in 2011. The decline in actual physical violence in schools is even more dramatic: It was down 74% between 1992 and 2010, according to the latest US Department of Justice data. What about cyberbullying? Online _ increased from 6% in 2000 to 9% in 2005 to 11% in 2010 between, and it's interesting to note that it increased less between 2005 and '10 than in the first 5 years tracked. Because social media is very much a reflection of school social life for young people, the peer aggression seen in social media is a lot like the peer aggression seen on school bathroom walls. So once it finds its \\"dead level,\\" it will probably decline in the same way verbal and written aggression have. Besides education and crime prevention at the social level, medicine treatment and better access to mental healthcare also contribute to this downward trend in victimization of self and others. The rise of social media is what people don't typically think of as a positive force in society.

Context: The term Carnival is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence. However, the Philippines, a predominantly Roman Catholic country, does not celebrate Carnival anymore since the dissolution of the Manila Carnival after 1939, the last carnival in the country. In historically Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on Shrove Tuesday. In Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which student studied less about wolves? Two students studied animal behavior for the biology class. Ned studied more about predators, while Kim studied more about herbivores. Hint: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. Answer:","completion":"Based on the paragraph, Kim studied less about wolves. This is because Ned studied more about predators, which includes wolves as mentioned in the paragraph, while Kim focused on herbivores, which does not include wolves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Designing Bras for Bigger Curves\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Designing Bras for Bigger Curves Introduction: The lingerie industry has evolved over the years, catering to the diverse body types and sizes of women around the world. With a wide array of styles and fits available, it's crucial for the industry to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of body diversity. For this reason, designing bras for bigger curves deserves a closer look. From understanding the unique challenges faced by curvy women to exploring the latest innovations in design and technology, this article delves into all aspects of creating supportive, comfortable, and stylish bras for women with bigger curves. Understanding the Challenges: One of the main challenges of designing bras for bigger curves is providing adequate support without compromising on style and comfort. Women with larger busts face issues such as back and shoulder pain due to the weight of their breasts, inadequate coverage, and difficulty finding well-fitting, stylish bras. As such, it's necessary to develop bras that address these concerns while also ensuring a fashionable and flattering appearance. The Importance of Band and Cup Sizes: In order to cater to a broader range of plus-size and full-busted women, it is vital to have an extensive range of band and cup sizes. Brands need to invest in research and development to create bras in larger band and cup sizes, going beyond the traditional size range to include hard-to-find sizes. Offering a wider size selection will make it easier for women with larger busts to find supportive and comfortable bras that cater to their needs. Innovative Textiles and Materials: Creating bras that provide comfort and durability for fuller figures requires innovation in textile and material technologies. Lightweight and supportive materials like spacer foam, microfiber, and mesh can help distribute weight more evenly and reduce pressure on the shoulders, back, and underbust area. Additionally, fabrics infused with moisture-wicking and anti-microbial properties can help keep women feeling fresh and comfortable throughout the day. Design Elements for Better Fit and Support: Specialized design elements can be incorporated to ensure enhanced support for larger busts. Some of these features include: 1. Wide bands: A wide band under the bust can provide better support and weight distribution, reducing pressure on the shoulders and back. 2. Side boning: Adding side boning in the wings of the bra can help maintain shape, distribute weight, and enhance support. 3. Multi-part cups: Bras with multi-part cups, where the cups are constructed from several pieces of fabric sewn together, can provide better support, shape, and lift for fuller figures. 4. Leotard back: A leotard-style bra back has a U-shaped design that helps distribute weight across a larger surface area, contributing to better support and minimizing back fat. 5. Reinforced straps: Wider and often padded straps, as well as cushioned shoulder strap linings, can provide more support, alleviate shoulder pressure, and enhance comfort for fuller busts. 6. Full cups: Bras with full cups offer complete breast coverage, providing more support and preventing spillage for women with larger busts. Personalization and Customization: Every woman’s body is unique, and as such, customization and personalization are essential in creating bras that suit her individual needs. Brands can offer customized bras, where customers can choose elements such as band and cup size, strap style, or even materials, according to their preferences. Further, incorporating adjustable features, such as straps and closure hooks, offers women more control over the fit of the bra. Conclusion: Designing bras for bigger curves requires a combination of specialized design elements, innovative materials, and an understanding of the unique challenges faced by fuller-figured women. By prioritizing support, comfort, and style, the lingerie industry can cater to a wider range of body types and empower women to feel confident and beautiful in their own skin."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: After the deaths of Charles V and du Guesclin in 1380, France lost its main leadership and overall momentum in the war. Charles VI succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority. With France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the Harelle and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace. Difficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through proxy wars, such as during the 1383-1385 Portuguese interregnum. The independence party in the Kingdom of Portugal, which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.

In the paragraph, it clearly states that Brian Brohm threw for 368 yards. This number is significantly different from the 1,368 yards mentioned in the hypothesis. It appears that the hypothesis has an extra \\"1\\" before the \\"368,\\" which could be a typo or a misrepresentation of the actual number. Secondly, both the paragraph and the hypothesis mention that Brian Brohm threw for five touchdowns. The number of touchdowns aligns correctly in both instances. It is important to recognize that this aspect of the hypothesis is accurate. Taking these factors into consideration, the hypothesis is not true in its entirety. While the number of touchdowns is consistent between the paragraph and the hypothesis, the number of yards thrown is not. Consequently, we must reject the hypothesis as presented, as it does not accurately represent the information contained within the paragraph. A more accurate hypothesis would state, \\"Brian Brohm, the Louisville quarterback, threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A: Answer:","completion":"A globe is the best way to make a map of the whole Earth (Option 4). Globes are three-dimensional representations of the Earth and accurately portray the planet's geographical features such as landmasses, oceans, continents, and countries. They help to visualize the Earth's spherical shape, unlike two-dimensional maps that often distort shapes and sizes of landforms due to map projections. One of the primary advantages of using a globe is its ability to represent the Earth's geography accurately, with minimal to no distortion. Since a globe is a perfect round shape, it mirrors the Earth's actual shape and allows one to see the world from different perspectives by rotating the globe in different directions. In addition, globes facilitate the calculation of distances and directions more accurately as compared to flat maps. They also provide an opportunity to examine the Earth's position relative to other celestial bodies. For instance, many globes include lines that represent important meridians and circles such as the equator, Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricorn, and the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. However, while a globe is an excellent way to represent the whole Earth, its use can sometimes be limited, especially when focusing on specific regions or when detailed information is required. Flat maps offer targeted, detailed information about particular locations and can be more practical in some situations. In conclusion, a globe is the best way to make a map of the whole Earth, as it accurately represents the planet's geography, shape, and various geospatial features without the distortions that are inherent in two-dimensional maps. However, depending on the purpose or situation, flat maps can also serve as valuable tools for studying specific locations and obtaining detailed information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best.

The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, shows distinct Dravidian influences. The Hoysala architecture style is described as Karnata Dravida as distinguished from the traditional Dravida, and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftsmanship. The tower over the temple shrine (vimana) is delicately finished with intricate carvings, showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height. The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers. Hoysala temple sculpture replicates this emphasis on delicacy and craftsmanship in its focus on depicting feminine beauty, grace and physique. The Hoysala artists achieved this with the use of Soapstone (Chloritic schist), a soft stone as basic building and sculptural material.The Chennakesava Temple at Belur (1117), the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu (1121), the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279), the temples at Arasikere (1220), Amruthapura (1196), Belavadi (1200), Nuggehalli (1246), Hosaholalu (1250), Aralaguppe (1250), Korvangla (1173), Haranhalli (1235), Mosale and Basaralu (1234) are some of the notable examples of Hoysala art. While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures, the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and lesser known temples. The outer walls of all these temples contain an intricate array of stone sculptures and horizontal friezes (decorative mouldings) that depict the Hindu epics.... The answer to this question is:","completion":"the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

However, the original statement provides more specific details about the scene, while the derived statement simplifies and generalizes the given information. To break down the logical consistency between the two statements, let's analyze both of them: 1. Original statement: \\"An old man is sitting on a stoop while people walk towards him with groceries.\\" This statement includes the following key points: a. There is an old man. b. The old man is sitting. c. The old man is sitting on a stoop (a specific location). d. People are walking towards the old man. e. The people walking towards the old man have groceries. 2. Derived statement: \\"People walk towards an old man who is sitting down.\\" The derived statement includes the following key points: a. There is an old man. b. The old man is sitting. c. People are walking towards the old man. As we can see, both statements share key points a, b, and c. The derived statement omits the specific location of the old man (sitting on a stoop) and the detail that people are carrying groceries. However, the main idea of the original statement - that people are walking towards a sitting old man - is still accurately conveyed in the derived statement. In conclusion, the statement \\"People walk towards an old man who is sitting down.\\" logically follows the given scenario \\"An old man is sitting on a stoop while people walk towards him with groceries.\\" Although some contextual details are lost in the derived statement, it still maintains the core idea of the original scenario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The first step of the process is the inhalation of oxygen-rich air through the nose and mouth. This is crucial for the respiratory system, as it initiates the entire process of respiration by providing oxygen to the body, which is essential for cellular metabolism and the production of energy. During inhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, causing the chest cavity to expand. This expansion creates a negative pressure within the lungs, allowing air to flow in through the nose and mouth. The nasal cavity is responsible for filtering, warming, and humidifying the air, making it more suitable for the delicate lung tissue. Once the oxygen-rich air completes its journey through the nasal cavity, it passes into the pharynx and then the larynx, which houses the vocal cords. The air then travels down the trachea – a cartilaginous tube that acts as the main airway to the lungs – before reaching the bronchial tubes. The bronchial tubes, which branch off from the trachea, further divide into smaller bronchioles within the lungs. These bronchioles continue to branch out, eventually leading to tiny air sacs called alveoli. It is here that the critical step of gas exchange takes place between the inhaled oxygen and the bloodstream. The walls of the alveoli are extremely thin and covered in a dense network of tiny blood vessels, or capillaries. Oxygen in the alveoli diffuses across the alveolar-capillary membrane, binding to hemoglobin molecules within red blood cells. Once bound to the hemoglobin, oxygen is transported through the bloodstream, reaching the cells of various tissues and organs throughout the body. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide – a waste product produced during cellular respiration – diffuses from the bloodstream back into the alveoli. Once in the alveoli, the carbon dioxide is then expelled from the body through exhalation. Thus, the first step of the process – the inhalation of oxygen-rich air through the nose and mouth – is essential for the proper functioning of the respiratory system and maintaining the delicate balance of gas exchange crucial for life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Review: This utterly dull, senseless, pointless, spiritless, and dumb movie isn't the final proof that the world can forget about Danny Boyle and his post-\\"Trainspotting\\" movies: \\"The Beach\\" already took care of that. What this low-budget oddity does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs, booze, ego, self-delusion, bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once-promising director's quick demise. The premise is absurd: two losers (Ecclestone and some bimbo Jenna G - a rapper, likely) meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with fervour more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit-making duo - which they become. A friend of theirs - an even bigger illiterate loser - becomes their manager by smashing a store window and stealing a video-camera by which he films them in \\"action\\", and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage. Now, I know that the UK in recent years has put out incredible junk, but this is ridiculous; the music makes Oasis seem like The Beatles. During the studio recordings, the duo - Strumpet - change lyrics in every take and Ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it, and quite absurdly they do take it.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I've always believed that David and Bathsheba was a film originally intended for Tyrone Power at 20th Century Fox, although Gregory Peck does give a good account of himself as King David, the monarch with a wandering eye. A whole lot of biblical subjects get covered in this film, adultery, redemption, sin, punishment and generally what God expects from his followers. When you're a king, even king in a biblically prophesied kingdom you certainly do have a lot perogatives not open to the rest of us. King David has many wives, including one really vicious one in Jayne Meadows who was the daughter of Saul, David's predecessor. But his eyes catch sight of Bathsheba out in her garden one evening. Turns out she's as unhappily married to Uriah the Hittite as David is to quite a few women. Uriah is one of David's army captains. David sends for Bathsheba and him being the King, she comes a runnin' because she's had her eye on him too. What happens, an affair, a pregnancy, and a carefully arranged death for Uriah in a battle. But an all seeing and knowing Deity has caught all of this and is not only punishing David and Bathsheba, but the entire Kingdom of Israel is being punished with drought, disease, and pestilence. The sexist law of the day calls for Bathsheba to have a stoning death. David shows weakness in his previous actions, but here he steps up to the plate and asks that the whole thing be put on him. He even lays hands on the Ark of the Covenant which was an instant death as seen in the film. My interpretation of it is that God admires guts even if you're wrong and he lets up on David and forgives them both. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon and she and David are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah until they're both conquered. Susan Hayward is a fetching Bathsheba caught in a loveless marriage with Uriah played by Kieron Moore. The only thing that gets Moore aroused is a good battle. I liked Kieron Moore's performance as a brave and rather stupid horse's rear. No one can lay the law down like Raymond Massey. His Nathan the Prophet is in keeping with the John Brown character he played in two films, same intensity. So when His own law called for death, why did God spare Bathsheba and keep David on the throne. Maybe it was the fact He just didn't want to train a third guy for the job. He'd replaced Saul with David already. But I think the Christian interpretation might be that this was a hint of the New Testament forthcoming, that one might sin and receive mercy if one asks for it penitently. I'll leave it to the biblical scholars to submit interpretations. Watch the film and you might come up with an entirely new theory.","completion":"To determine the sentiment of this review, I will analyze the tone, language, and overall message of the text.

Initial sentiment: The reviewer starts off neutrally, mentioning that the film was potentially meant for a different actor, but Gregory Peck still gave a good performance. Positive sentiment: The reviewer mentions that a lot of biblical subjects are covered in the film and describes the performances of Susan Hayward and Kieron Moore in a positive light.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation -15*u + 54*u = -14*u - 636 for u, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on each side of the equation. On the left side of the equation, you have -15*u and 54*u. -15*u + 54*u = 39*u So, the equation now reads: 39*u = -14*u - 636 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'u' by adding 14*u to both sides of the equal sign. To cancel out the -14*u term on the right side of the equation, add 14*u to both sides. 39*u + 14*u = -14*u + 14*u - 636 This simplifies to: 53*u = -636 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'u' (53). To isolate 'u', divide both sides of the equation by 53. u = -636 / 53 Step 4: Simplify the fraction. Divide -636 by 53 to get the simplified value of 'u'. u = -12 The solution to the equation -15*u + 54*u = -14*u - 636 is u = -12."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Information: - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power. - Mustafa Bülent Ecevit (28 May 1925 5 November 2006) was a Turkish politician, poet, writer, scholar, and journalist, who served as the Prime Minister of Turkey four times between 1974 and 2002. He served as prime minister of Turkey in 1974, 1977, 197879, and 19992002. He was the leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP) between 1972 and 1980, and in 1989 he became the leader of the Democratic Left Party (DSP). - The 15th Turkish general election was held on 3 November 2002 following the collapse of the DSP - MHP - ANAP coalition led by Bülent Ecevit . It was the 15th general election to be held in Turkey . All 550 members of the Grand National Assembly were up for election . The election was held during an ongoing economic crisis which followed the 2001 financial crash , which resulted in a deep resentment of coalition governments which had governed the country since the 1980 military coup . The Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , which had only been formed in 2001 by Recep Tayyip Erdoan , won the election with nearly two - thirds of the seats . The protest vote was such that every sitting party previously represented in parliament was ejected , with the AKP winning 363 seats with just 34.3 % of the vote . The only other party which passed the 10 % threshold to gain representation was the Republican People 's Party , which came second with 19.38 % of the vote and 178 seats . The election produced Turkey 's first single party government since 1987 and the country 's first two - party parliament since 1960 . The moderate Islamism advocated by the AKP was at odds with the secular establishment of the Republic of Turkey . While serving as the Mayor of Istanbul , Erdoan was sentenced to a 10 month prison term in 1998 for reciting a poem in Siirt which incited racial intolerance . This barred him from initially seeking a seat in parliament , meaning that the AKP 's co-founder Abdullah Gül became Prime Minister following their election victory . With the help of the CHP , the government overturned Erdoan 's political ban in 2003 , after which he was able to seek a seat in a controversial by - election in the Province of Siirt . Erdoan became Prime Minister in March 2003 , with Abdullah Gül concurrently assuming the role of Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister . - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - The Prime Minister of Turkey (Turkish: \\"Babakan\\") is the head of government of Turkey. The prime minister is the leader of a political coalition in the Turkish parliament (Meclis) and the leader of the cabinet. The current holder of the position is Binali Yldrm of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), who took office on 24 May 2016.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How have people holding black money escaped the demonetisation? Programming in anderoid mobile? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? A. no; B. yes;","completion":"A. No The two questions are different from each other. The first question pertains to the issue of black money and how people evaded the demonetisation policies put in place. The second question is about programming in Android mobile, which is a topic related to software development and technology. I will provide detailed answers to both questions. 1. How have people holding black money escaped the demonetisation? Demonetisation was a policy implemented in some countries, like India, to curb the accumulation of black money – income obtained illegally or not declared for tax purposes. By demonetising specific high-value currency notes, governments aimed to discourage hoarding black money and push people to deposit their money into banks, making it traceable. However, some individuals with black money found ways to bypass the system. Here are some methods they used to escape the effects of demonetisation: a. Conversion to new currency: People holding black money employed various tactics to exchange their demonetised currency notes with new ones. They used other individuals or agents to deposit or exchange the old notes on their behalf, thus avoiding being identified or questioned by the authorities. b. Conversion to gold and other valuables: Some individuals converted their black money into gold, jewelry, and other valuable assets to store their wealth and evade demonetisation's impact. Such assets can be resold later in the market to regain their original value in the form of cash. c. Real estate transactions: People with black money often invested in real estate, purchasing properties in cash using their undeclared income. This method allowed them to park their black money in a tangible asset that typically appreciates over time. d. Shell companies: Some individuals with black money created shell companies, which are companies that exist only on paper and have no office or employees. These companies were involved in transactions that helped in converting the black money into white (legal) money. e. Use of cryptocurrencies: A few individuals turned to cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, to escape demonetisation. They purchased cryptocurrencies using their black money and later converted them back into a legal currency. This method provided anonymity and made it difficult for authorities to trace the source of the funds. 2. Programming in Android mobile: Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google that powers many smartphones and tablets. Programming for Android devices involves creating applications, or \\"apps,\\" that can run on the Android operating system. To develop an Android app, one must follow these steps: a. Learn a programming language: The primary language used for Android app development is Java, although Google has introduced Kotlin as a more modern, alternative language. Developers should learn one or both of these languages to begin programming for Android. b. Install the necessary software: Android app development requires specific software, such as Android Studio (an integrated development environment, or IDE) and the Java Development Kit (JDK). These tools provide the necessary frameworks and libraries for developing an Android app. c. Understand Android app components: Apps are made up of components like activities, services, content providers, and broadcast receivers. Each component serves a different purpose in the app's functionality, so learning how they interact is essential for development. d. Create and design the app: Developers must design the app's user interface (UI) using Android-specific XML markup language and create the code for the app's functionality in Java or Kotlin. e. Test the app: To ensure the app works without any issues, thorough testing on various Android devices and emulations is critical. App testing includes debugging and performance optimization. f. Publish the app: Once the app is tested and functioning correctly, developers can publish it on the Google Play Store, making it available for users to download and install on their devices. In conclusion, these two questions are not the same. The first question is about black money and demonetisation policies, while the second question is about Android app development. They both pertain to completely different fields – economics and technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Daryl Franklin Hohl (born October 11, 1946), better known by his stage name Daryl Hall, is an American rock, R&B, and soul singer; keyboardist, guitarist, songwriter, and producer, best known as the co-founder and lead vocalist of Hall & Oates (with guitarist and songwriter John Oates). In the 1970s and early 1980s, Hall scored numerous Billboard chart hits and is regarded as one of the best soul singers of his generation. Guitarist Robert Fripp, who collaborated with him in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has written, \\"Daryl's pipes were a wonder. I have never worked with a more able singer.\\" Hall was born in Pottstown, a Pennsylvania borough 40 miles (64 km) from Philadelphia. His parents each had a background in music: his father was a professional singer and his mother was a vocal coach. He is of German descent. He started recording while still a student at Owen J. Roberts High School, from which he graduated in 1965. In college at Temple University in Philadelphia, he majored in music, while continuing to record, working with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff as both an artist and a session musician. During his first semester at Temple, in the fall of 1965, he and four other white Temple University students formed the vocal harmony group the Temptones. They were popular additions to the largely black Philly soul scene, defeating both The Ambassadors and The Delfonics in a contest at the Uptown Theater. The Temptones recorded a handful of singles for Arctic Records, produced by Jimmy Bishop. While performing at the Uptown theatre, Hall formed creative affiliations with such artists as Smokey Robinson, The Temptations, and many other top soul singers of the 1960s. In 1967 Hall met John Oates, who was also an undergraduate at Temple University. According to Daryl Hall, they met when \\"We got in the middle of a fight at a dance - I have no idea what the fight was about. I guess the Greek letters on one gang's jackets didn't appeal to the other gang. We both beat it out the back and met on the elevator while leaving the place rather quickly.\\" Hall was by then a senior, while Oates was a freshman. They played together until Oates transferred to a different school at age 19. Hall did not let Oates' departure discourage him from pursuing his own musical career: he dropped out of college in 1968 and worked with Tim Moore in a short-lived rock band, Gulliver, and released an album on the Elektra Records label. In 1969 Hall again began recording songs by other artists, which led to the duo signing their first record contract in early 1972.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What border is represented at the true 103rd meridian? Oklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United States, covering an area of 69,899 square miles (181,040 km2), with 68,595 square miles (177,660 km2) of land and 1,304 square miles (3,380 km2) of water. It lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri, on the north by Kansas, on the northwest by Colorado, on the far west by New Mexico, and on the south and near-west by Texas. Much of its border with Texas lies along the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen, a failed continental rift. The geologic figure defines the placement of the Red River. The Oklahoma panhandle's Western edge is out of alignment with its Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is 2.1 miles (3.4 km) to 2.2 miles (3.5 km) east of the Texas line. The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first as a result of a survey by Spain in 1819. It was then set along the 103rd meridian. In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered the Texas line was not set along the 103rd meridian. Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd meridian was approximately 2.2 miles (3.5 km) to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the surveying error. The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd meridian. Cimarron County in Oklahoma's panhandle is the only county in the United States that touches four other states: New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, and Kansas. Answer:","completion":"The border represented at the true 103rd meridian is the Oklahoma/New Mexico border. Due to a surveying error in 1819, the Texas line was not set along the 103rd meridian as intended. When Oklahoma was formally surveyed in the 1890s using more accurate equipment and techniques, it was discovered that the actual 103rd meridian was about 2.2 miles (3.5 km) east of the Texas line.

Step 1: Evaluating Option [i] Option [i] suggests using a fine pointed rod that is 1 inch thick and 5 inches long. However, this thickness might be too much for comfortable use and also, for making fine stitches. Additionally, the type of material doesn't necessarily determine the effectiveness of the makeshift crochet stick, but rather the structure, shape, and size. So, we can infer that this option might not be the best one. Step 2: Evaluating Option [ii] Option [ii] expands the answer to allow for any metal or wooden rod that is at least 5 inches long and has a fine point. It suggests possible items such as a drum stick or a thick antenna, which are items that could reasonably be modified to mimic the function of a crochet hook. This option appears more adaptable and flexible to the situation at hand. Considering these points, it seems more reasonable to go with [ii] as the answer.

And you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.\\" The most prominent Democrat in the House of Representatives, however, disagreed with Walters. \\"Trump's daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable,\\" Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Twitter on Monday. \\"As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea.\\" Pelosi's tweet included a link to a CNN story about Waters encouraging harassment of Trump administration officials. Trump also responded to Water's remarks, saying on Twitter that the congresswoman — whom he referred to as an \\"extraordinarily low IQ person\\" — had called for his supporters to be harassed. In the social media message, the president concluded, \\"Be careful what you wish for Max!\\" Last week, protesters yelled at Department of Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen at an upscale Mexican restaurant near the White House. Earlier, Nielsen publicly defended the policy of separating children from parents who were apprehended for illegally entering the U.S., a policy the president has since reversed. Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller, also an immigration hard-liner, was called a \\"fascist\\" while dining at a Mexican cantina in a neighborhood in the District of Columbia. The incident involving Sanders took place Friday night at the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, 300 kilometers south of the U.S. capital. \\"I explained that the restaurant has certain...

Question: Given the below context: Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect modernism or other recent styles. Public monuments representing collective memorials to particular groups of dead people continue to be erected, especially war memorials, and in the Western world have now replaced individual or family memorials as the dominant types of very large memorials; Western political leaders now usually receive simple graves. Some large memorials are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and several Holocaust memorials, such as Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Vel d'Hiv Memorial in Paris (1994), the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin (2004), and the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate. Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated Neue Wache in Berlin and the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which is internationally controversial.Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, at least on the Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.Many large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including Lenin's Mausoleum and those for Atatürk, Jinnah, Kim Il-Sung, Che Guevara and several Presidential...

Write the answer: Later holding a cabinet post, who finished second to Edward Heath in the 1965 Conservative Party Leadership Election?","completion":"Reginald Maudling, a prominent British Conservative politician, finished second to Edward Heath in the 1965 Conservative Party Leadership Election. Maudling had a long and distinguished political career, holding various senior posts throughout his tenure. Born on March 7, 1917, in Finchley, London, Reginald Maudling was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and Merton College, Oxford, where he progressed his knowledge in economics. Maudling's political career began when he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Barnet constituency in 1950. Known for his pragmatic approach to politics, Maudling soon gained respect within his party. Reginald Maudling held several high-profile positions in government during the 1950s and 1960s. He served as Minister of Civil Aviation from 1955 to 1957, Economic Secretary to the Treasury from 1957 to 1958, and Paymaster-General from 1958 to 1959. Maudling's economic background and expertise enabled him to play a significant role in shaping the economic policies of the British government during these years. In 1962, Maudling's political career further advanced when he was appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. Maudling's ambitious economic plans included stimulating economic growth and lowering the unemployment rate. Though his time as Chancellor was overshadowed by a balance of payment crisis and devaluation, his efforts aimed at promoting growth and increasing public expenditure. When the 1965 Conservative Party Leadership Election took place, Reginald Maudling was one of the leading contenders to replace Alec Douglas-Home, who had served as a Prime Minister from 1963 to 1964. Maudling was known for his moderate views and considered a viable choice for the party's leadership. However, he faced stiff competition from Edward Heath, who ultimately emerged victorious in the election with 150 votes to Maudling's 133, securing the Conservative Party leadership. Despite his loss in the leadership election, Maudling continued to serve in prominent roles within the Conservative government. He was appointed as Home Secretary in 1970 under Heath's administration, a position he held until 1972. Maudling's tenure as Home Secretary included dealing with sensitive issues such as race relations and policy towards Northern Ireland. His political career came to an end after a series of controversies and declining health; Maudling eventually passed away on February 14, 1979. In conclusion, Reginald Maudling was a prominent British Conservative politician who finished second to Edward Heath in the 1965 Conservative Party Leadership Election. Maudling's career included holding various cabinet posts and contributing significantly to the party's economic policies during his tenure. Though he did not secure the leadership, Maudling's influence on the party and British politics was considerable and long-lasting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Solve -419*r = 669 + 1845 for r.","completion":"To solve the given equation (-419*r = 669 + 1845) for r, you need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the numbers on the right side of the equation. Since 669 and 1845 are on the same side of the equation and there are no variables involved with them, you can add them together. 669 + 1845 = 2514 Now the equation becomes: -419*r = 2514 Step 2: Solve for r. In order to isolate r, you need to get rid of the coefficient -419 which is currently being multiplied by r. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by -419. (-419*r) / -419 = 2514 / -419 The -419 on the left side will cancel out, leaving just r: r = 2514 / -419 Step 3: Simplify the right side of the equation. To find the value of r, simply divide 2514 by -419: r = -6 So, the solution to the equation -419*r = 669 + 1845 is r = -6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Anjem Choudary is nothing like Mahatma Gandhi. Nor Nelson Mandela for that matter. Indeed, that was my point and I am saddened if it has been misconstrued. Let me be clear what I was saying - the legislation being devised to deal with the former will need to be very carefully drafted to avoid scooping up anti-establishment figures such as the latter. The home secretary and the prime minister are looking for a way to silence individuals whose extremist rhetoric helps radicalise people into supporting so-called Islamic State and Al Qaeda. Such support can and, tragically, sometimes does lead to violence that threatens our very way of life. It is the responsibility of ministers to consider how to counter such threats to national security and individual safety. But there are concerns that the definition of extremism being used by the government is too broad and risks undermining the very freedoms ministers say they are trying to defend. The Home Office's Prevent strategy defines extremism as \\"vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs\\". Denying the right to free speech to anyone who falls foul of this description has already worried senior parliamentarians. The former attorney general Dominic Grieve QC says he is concerned that extremism powers could result in people being prosecuted for having a point of view. The former head of MI5, Eliza Manningham-Buller has similar anxieties: \\"I am afraid that it is a profound irony that we are seeking to protect our values against this pernicious ideology by trying to bar views that are described, too vaguely, as 'non-violent' extremist - but which fall short of incitement to violence or to racial or ethnic hatred - which is already forbidden by law.\\" This is the dilemma I was highlighting. Putting new powers into statute may deal with one immediate problem, but some speculate how a future government might exploit such powers to silence dissent and criticism. There is an irony in this, not lost on the prime minister and home secretary. They wish to defend fundamental British values such as free speech, but to do so they find themselves looking at ways to deny some that very right. It is far from easy.

On his headstone read the simple inscription he once said was all he wanted: his U.S. Navy identification number and the words, \\"He loved Barbara very much.\\" The Thursday ceremonies began at the Texas funeral, where Bush was eulogized by his longtime best friend, James Baker, who became his secretary of state and was with him in his last hours. He described Bush as \\"a truly beautiful human being.\\" \\"Man’s glory begins and ends with friends,\\" Baker said of their many decades together. He began with an apology to a man he said was always humble, but always clear in his decisions. \\"I'm about to do something you always hated — brag about yourself,\\" he said. \\"I will do this because it must be done.\\" Speaking of a world in many ways now past - a time before presidential Twitter feeds - he called Bush a \\"charter member of the greatest generation,\\" the \\"finest\\" one-term president the country ever had, and a man who believed in \\"humility toward and not humiliation of\\" his adversaries. David J. Phillip/Pool via AP Baker also poked fun, joking that during a friendly disagreement, Bush used what Baker said was his \\"effective way of ending a discussion:\\" 'Baker, if you're so smart, why am I president and you're not?'\\" As he finished, he paraphrased the Irish poet William Butler Yeats, saying, \\"Our glory, George, was to have you as our president, and such a friend,\\" then broke briefly into tears. As he walked back to his pew, he got a warm hug from former President George W. Bush.

Bush, who served in the Navy like his grandfather, shared memories of the good times the Bush grandchildren had with the man they knew as \\"Gampy.\\" Joe Raedle/Getty Images Speaking at his father's emotional service in Washington on Wednesday, the 43rd president said the family took solace in knowing the elder Bush will be reunited with those who meant so much to him. \\"So, through our tears, let us see the blessings of knowing and loving you – a great and noble man, and the best father a son or daughter could have,\\" he said, choking up. \\"And in our grief, let us smile knowing that Dad is hugging Robin and holding Mom’s hand again.\\" Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images H.W. Bush became a Texas transplant in the late 1950s after graduating from Yale University and leaving his home in a wealthy town in Connecticut, where he was raised.

Phillip/Pool via AP Before the Texas funeral began, he lay in repose at the St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston, which the Bushes joined in 1959. The Texas ceremonies were intended for about 1,200 friends of the family -- many of whom are said to hail from \\"west of the Mississippi\\" -- and included stars from the country music world Bush came to love: Reba McEntire sang \\"The Lord's Prayer\\" and the Oak Ridge Boys performed a rendition of \\"Amazing Grace.\\" Jack Gruber/USA Today Network During his homily, the rector of St. Martin's, the Rev. Dr. Russell Levenson, spoke of the never-ending love affair between George and Barbara Bush, married for 73 years. He told a story about how one day, when he was going to visit the ailing president, he asked Barbara Bush if she wanted him to relay any message. \\"Just tell him I adore him,\\" he said she told him. Saying of the late president, \\"He was ready for heaven, and heaven for him,\\" Levenson said he could imagine Barbara Bush standing there with her hands on her hips, telling her husband, \\"What took you so long?\\" Then, he said, she would say to him, \\"We adore you,\\" and give him \\"a big 'ole Texas hug.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"The funeral of President George H.W.

Write the answer: In July 1963 which osteopath was convicted of living off immoral earnings?","completion":"In July 1963, the well-known British osteopath Stephen Ward was convicted of living off immoral earnings, a charge related to prostitution. Ward was a central figure during the notorious Profumo Affair, a political scandal that hastened the downfall of the Conservative government in the United Kingdom. Stephen Ward was a prominent figure in British society who treated several high-profile clients, including politicians, celebrities, and aristocrats. He was known for hosting parties where he would introduce guests from various social classes, a practice that ultimately led to his involvement in the scandal. The Profumo Affair began when John Profumo, the British Secretary of State for War, had a sexual relationship with a young woman named Christine Keeler in 1961. Unbeknownst to Profumo, Keeler was simultaneously having a relationship with Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet naval attaché. This raised concerns about national security and the potential leaking of state secrets. Ward's role in the scandal stemmed from his close friendship with Keeler, as well as his acquaintance with John Profumo and the Soviet attaché. He had introduced Keeler to Profumo at one of his parties, unknowingly setting the stage for their illicit affair and the scandal that ensued. When the Profumo Affair became public knowledge in 1963, a series of investigations were launched. The focus soon turned to Ward, who was suspected of being a \\"pimp\\" for high-profile individuals, including the British aristocracy. He was arrested and charged with living off immoral earnings, specifically the earnings derived from the prostitution of Christine Keeler and another woman, Mandy Rice-Davies. Stephen Ward's trial generated a media frenzy, as it exposed the seedy underbelly of British politics and society. After a sensational and controversial trial that lasted only a week, Ward was found guilty of living off immoral earnings on July 31, 1963. He was sentenced to two concurrent terms of imprisonment, one for three years and the other for 12 months. Tragically, Ward fell unconscious after an overdose of sleeping pills the night before the verdict and never regained consciousness. He died on August 3, bringing a tragic end to one of the most publicized cases in 20th-century British history. The Profumo Affair and Ward's trial significantly damaged the reputation of the Conservative Party, contributing to their defeat in the 1964 general election, and has remained an enduring symbol of political and social scandal in the United Kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the Lethal Weapon series has had four films released so far, with Lethal Weapon 3 being the third film in the series, it is impossible to say with certainty whether the series will continue indefinitely. Many factors could influence the future of the series, such as the commercial success of the films, the reception by audiences and critics, and the interest of the actors and filmmakers in continuing to produce new installments. After Lethal Weapon 3, the series continued with Lethal Weapon 4 in 1998. Since then, there has been no new film in the series, although there was a television adaptation that aired from 2016 to 2019. In recent years, there have been talks of a potential Lethal Weapon 5, with the original cast and director expressing interest in returning to the franchise. However, there is no guarantee that this sequel will materialize or that the series will keep continuing beyond it. Furthermore, the potential continuation of the series will depend on the storyline and how it evolves in future installments. If the film series were to reach a natural conclusion or if it becomes financially unviable to produce new films, it may come to an end. Alternatively, the series could be rebooted or reimagined with a new set of characters, which could give it a longer lifespan. In conclusion, while it is impossible to predict the future of the Lethal Weapon series with certainty, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that the series will continue indefinitely.

The diner is operated by a young, beautiful woman, Cora Smith, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, a hardworking but unimaginative immigrant from Greece. Frank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet. Cora is tired of her situation, married to an older man she does not love, and working at a diner that she wishes to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick to start a new life together without her losing the diner. Their first attempt at the murder is a failure, but Nick is not even aware they tried to kill him, so goes about living his life as usual. Frank and Cora succeed with their next attempt.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Claudio Monteverdi, born in Cremona in 1567, was a musical prodigy who studied under Marc'Antonio Ingegneri, the maestro di cappella (head of music) at Cremona Cathedral. After training in singing, strings playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga's court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio—a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas—into increasingly elaborate forms. Led by Jacopo Corsi, these successors to the renowned Camerata were responsible for the first work generally recognised as belonging to the genre of opera: Dafne, composed by Corsi and Jacopo Peri and performed in Florence in 1598. This work combined elements of madrigal singing and monody with dancing and instrumental passages to form a dramatic whole. Only fragments of its music still exist, but several other Florentine works of the same period—Rappresentatione di Anima, et di Corpo by Emilio de' Cavalieri, Peri's Euridice and Giulio Caccini's identically titled Euridice—survive complete. These last two works were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses, and as such were direct precursors of Monteverdi's L'Orfeo.The Gonzaga court had a long history of promoting dramatic entertainment. A century before Duke Vincenzo's time the court had staged Angelo Poliziano's lyrical drama La favola di Orfeo, at least half of which was sung rather than spoken. More recently, in 1598 Monteverdi had helped the court's musical establishment produce Giovanni Battista Guarini's play Il pastor fido, described... answer the following question: What are the specific titles of the two separate works with identical names that were the first of many musical representations of the Orpheus myth as recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses?

Afterwards, he directly addresses the audience, and gives them a tour of Cherry Tree Lane, stopping outside the Banks family's home. George Banks returns home to learn from his wife, Winifred, that Katie Nanna has left their service after Jane and Michael ran away again. They are returned shortly after by Constable Jones, who reveals the children were chasing a lost kite. The children ask their father to help build a better kite, but he dismisses them.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was known for their fascination with contrasts in skin tones? ? William Etty (1787–1849), the seventh child of a York baker and miller, began his career as an apprentice printer in Hull at the age of 11. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk crayons\\", with the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters, and studied under renowned artist Thomas Lawrence. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, Etty submitted numerous paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited.In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra), which depicted a large number of nude figures. Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in painting nudes, and many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work.

Given the question: Information: - Weight classes are divisions of competition used to match competitors against others of their own size. This reduces the exclusion of smaller athletes in sports where physical size gives a significant advantage. Weight classes are used in a variety of sports, especially combat sports (such as boxing, wrestling, and mixed martial arts). - Professional boxing, or prizefighting, emerged in the early twentieth century as boxing gradually attained legitimacy and became a regulated, sanctioned sport. Professional boxing bouts are fought for a purse which is divided between the boxers as determined by contract. Most professional bouts are supervised by a regulatory authority to guarantee the fighters' safety. Most high-profile bouts obtain the endorsement of a sanctioning body, which awards championship belts, establishes rules, and assigns its own judges and referee. - Welterweight is a weight class in combat sports. Originally the term \\"welterweight\\" was used only in boxing, but other combat sports like Muay Thai, taekwondo and mixed martial arts also use it for their own weight division system to classify the opponents. In most sports that use it, welterweight is heavier than lightweight but lighter than middleweight. - Jeff Mayweather (born July 4, 1964 in Grand Rapids, MI) is a former boxer who fought in the 1990s. - Boxing is a combat sport in which two people wearing protective gloves throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of time in a boxing ring. - Muay Thai is a combat sport of Thailand that uses stand-up striking along with various clinching techniques. This physical and mental discipline which includes combat on shins is known as \\"the art of eight limbs\\" because it is characterized by the combined use of fists, elbows, knees, shins, being associated with a good physical preparation that makes a full-contact fighter very efficient. Muay Thai became widespread internationally in the twentieth century, when practitioners defeated notable practitioners of other martial arts. The professional league is governed by The Professional Boxing Association of Thailand (P.A.T) sanctioned by The Sport Authority of Thailand (S.A.T.), and World Muaythai Federation (WMF) overseas. - Super featherweight, also known as junior lightweight, is a weight division in professional boxing, contested between and up to . - Roger Mayweather ( born April 24 , 1961 ) is a retired professional boxer . He won two major world titles in two different weight classes . Throughout his career , Mayweather fought against many other boxing champions of the 1980s and 1990s . He is a part of the Mayweather boxing family ; his brothers are former welterweight contender Floyd Mayweather and former IBO super featherweight champion Jeff Mayweather , and his nephew is five - division world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. Roger eventually became Mayweather Jr. 's trainer . - Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a full-contact combat sport that allows both striking and grappling, both standing and on the ground, using techniques from other combat sports and martial arts. The first documented use of the term \\"mixed martial arts\\" was in a review of UFC 1 by television critic Howard Rosenberg in 1993. The term gained popularity when newfullcontact.com, then one of the largest websites covering the sport, hosted and republished the article. The question of who actually coined the term is subject to debate. - In combat sports where champions are decided by a challenge, the lineal championship of a weight class is a world championship title held initially by an undisputed champion and subsequently by a fighter who defeats the reigning champion in a match at that weight class. In professional boxing, the lineal champion is informally called \\"the man who beat the man\\". Champions recognized by sanctioning bodies such as the World Boxing Association (WBA) or World Boxing Council (WBC), or the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) may vacate their title voluntarily, or be stripped of the title for breaching the sanctioning body's regulations or contracts. There will thus be a breach of continuity in the list of sanctioned champions which the lineal championship is intended to prevent. However, there is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class, because there is no agreed upon method of determining the starting point for each lineage and conflicting opinions on what to do when the current champion retires or moves to a different weight class, although there is agreement that any stripping of a title be discounted. - The Best Fighter ESPY Award (ESPY means Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly) was created by the cable television network ESPN and has been presented annually since 2007 to the professional or amateur boxer or mixed martial artist, irrespective of nationality, gender, weight class, or sanctioning body or league, adjudged to be the best in a given calendar year. The award subsumed the Best Boxer ESPY Award, limited exclusively to boxers, which was presented between 1993 and 2006, inclusive. - A combat sport, or fighting sport, is a competitive contact sport with one-on-one combat. Determining the winner depends on the particular contest's rules. In many fighting sports, a contestant wins by scoring more points than the opponent or by disabling the opponent. Boxing, wrestling, Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, Sambo, and Mixed Martial Arts are examples of combat sports. - Lightweight is a weight class in the sports of boxing, kickboxing, mixed martial arts, and rowing. - Floyd Joy Mayweather Jr. (born Floyd Joy Sinclair; February 24, 1977) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1996 to 2015, and currently works as a boxing promoter.

On May 20, one lucky foreigner would be selected to become the modern-day Marco Polo, getting a free 15-day trip to the scenic city of Hangzhou in China, and rewarded 55,000 in the next year for working part-time to promote the city to the global audience. Five finalists from Australia, Romania, U.S., Switzerland and France were in the final race. They came from a pool of 700 applicants from around the world, carefully selected by the Hangzhou Tourism Commission on their familiarity with China, social media presence and adventurous spirit. Located about 100 miles southwest to Shanghai, Hangzhou is home to 844 million population and among China's richest cities as measures by per-capita GDP. Traditionally, Hangzhou is known for its charming West Lake, a UNESCO world heritage site with traditional Chinese stories and tales, and the Grand Canal, which travels from Hangzhou to Beijing and was a key route of transportation in ancient China. The city's mild climate and charming environment drew 97 million tourists last year, contributing to 6.5% of the city's GDP. The lucky winner would start an all-expense-paid trip to Hangzhou, which, in addition to visits to tourist sites and tastings of delicious food, also would include a four-day ride along the Grand Canal and three evenings spent at a local resident's home. \\"It is in fact a part-time job.

Here is a news article: The reality that free services aren’t actually free is currently being demonstrated through the latest money-grab by MySpace. User account information is being made available to anyone who wants it for a surprisingly cheap price. One look at the Infochimps website shows that you can purchase 24 hours of MySpace’s real-time data stream for just 30. The data is described as follows: It contains most all fields and data offered by the stream, unparsed and packaged for a full day. When you sign up for a MySpace account, you also agree that MySpace own all the content you decide to upload. A fair exchange in return for the service being free? Maybe it was at the time, but now anyone can buy all the information for analysis and marketing if they so wish. [UPDATE] MySpace has since been in contact making it clear that they are in fact not selling user data, instead allowing what is already freely available to be repackaged and sold by Infochimps. Here’s MySpace’s official response to this news: MySpace is not selling user data to Infochimps. MySpace provides developers, including companies such as Infochimps, with free access to publicly available real-time data (such as status updates, music, photos, videos) using our Real Time Stream feed. We have identified the need for third-party developers who can’t handle the size of our full feed to still have access to the data in a different format. For this reason InfoChimps is offering developers a pre-packaged version of our Real Time Stream, as a value-added service. MySpace also point to the Infochimps blog for further information on what exactly is being offered: This data is not sold by MySpace, but given out for free from their API and then packaged by Infochimps for redistribution. By giving developers free access to publically available real-time data (such as status updates, music, photos, videos) MySpace reinforces its commitment to powering the real-time social Web and the development of open standards. Read more at PC World Matthew’s Opinion Unfortunately, this is the reality of your data on a site like MySpace. The content of the site is owned by the company, not the individual, and they can use it how they please. There is a developer agreement attached to purchasing the data, but that won’t stop marketeers filtering through the information and using it for their gain. Targeted advertising, statistical analysis for future product launches, and even use by other social networks to help improve their service, are all potential uses for this data. The decision to sell this data is clearly one based on a need to generate revenue from the network. MySpace has lost its mojo of late while rival Facebook is going from strength to strength. Turning to selling off of data streams sounds like desperation to me. ||||| Social networking just became a little riskier to your privacy. Information from MySpace is now for sale to third parties ranging from academics and analysts to marketers. The data will include any activity or information that is attached to an account. That includes blog posts, location, photos, reviews, and status updates--among others. Infochimps, an Austin, Texas, company that collects and sells structured data, is selling the data. Of course, MySpace is perfectly within its rights to work with Infochimps, because it legally owns the data and the server logs. Users waive their right to privacy in exchange for free Web hosting and access to its social features. \\"Free\\" comes at a cost. Here's snippet of what \\"they\\" know about you. This is exactly the type of scenario that Eben Moglen, a Columbia University law professor and founder of the Software Freedom Law Center, warned of at a seminar about privacy in cloud computing last month. I wouldn't have imagined that MySpace would be one of the aggressive purveyors of personal data. In his talk, Moglen advocated development of peer-to-peer social networks in which users retain ownership of their data. His suggestion is looking more appealing (and prophetic) now that one of the biggest names in social networking has sold out its users' privacy. [NOTE: The original version of this story stated that MySpace was selling data; in fact, Infochimps is the seller, through a revenue-sharing agreement with MySpace. MySpace has released the following statement: MySpace is not selling user data to Infochimps. MySpace provides developers, including companies such as Infochimps, with free access to publicly available real-time data (such as status updates, music, photos, videos) using our Real Time Stream feed.

Title: The Thin Man Goes Home Movie plot: Nick and Nora visit Nick's parents (Lucile Watson and Harry Davenport) in Nick's hometown, Sycamore Springs, in New England. The residents are convinced that Nick is in town on an investigation, despite Nick's repeated denials. However, when aircraft factory employee Peter Berton (Ralph Brooks) seeks out Nick and is shot dead before he can reveal anything, Nick is on the case. An old childhood friend, Dr. Bruce Clayworth (Lloyd Corrigan), performs the autopsy and extracts a pistol bullet. Then, when Nick searches Berton's room for clues, he is knocked unconscious by Crazy Mary (Anne Revere), a local eccentric. Nora's innocent purchase of a painting for Nick's birthday present turns out to be the key to the mystery. When she shows it to her husband, it brings back unpleasant memories for him, so she donates it to a charity bazaar. When Edgar Draque (Leon Ames) offers Nora a large sum for the painting, Nick wonders why it is so valuable. Nick learns that Draque's wife Helena (Helen Vinson) bought the artwork, but she is knocked out and the painting disappears. Nick discovers that Crazy Mary is Berton's mother and goes to see her, only to come across her lifeless body. Nick and Nora's dog Asta finds the painting in her shack. Nick puts the pieces together and has the police bring all the suspects to his father's house. (Early on, it is revealed that Nick's father, Dr. Bertram Charles, has never been overly impressed with his son's unusual career choice, so this gives Nick an opportunity to change his father's mind.) Using Dr. Charles's fluoroscope, Nick shows that there is a blueprint hidden underneath the paint. Several people identify it as part of the specifications for a new aircraft propeller worth a great deal to a \\"foreign power\\".

For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. Now, I have a new situation: Two students studied animal behavior for the biology class.

Write an article that answers the following question: On which day of the week was the game played?","completion":"Title: The Art of Pinpointing the Day of the Week: A Detailed Look into the Game Day Dilemma Introduction The simple task of determining the day of the week on which a game was played might, at first, appear quite straightforward. Yet, as we shall soon discover, numerous factors need to be taken into account, including the different schedules in leagues and sports, holidays, and specific traditions. In order to provide a comprehensive and accurate answer, we must delve into the various elements that shape the game-playing events calendar. General Time-frames Typically, teams across various sports adhere to a specific time-frame designated for their matches. Let's take a closer look at some of the common sports and their respective schedules. 1. Football (Soccer): In most countries, soccer matches occur on weekends – specifically, Saturdays and Sundays – as this leads to increased audience turnout and television viewership. Domestic games are rarely scheduled in the middle of the week. However, international games such as the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League are usually held on Tuesdays and Thursdays respectively. 2. American Football: The National Football League (NFL) in the United States predominantly holds its games on Sundays. However, there are also games scheduled for Thursdays and Mondays for prime-time television spots. 3. Basketball: Both college and professional basketball (such as the NBA) tend to have games spread out across the week, typically with no specific day reserved for every match. However, the frequency of games may increase on weekends. 4. Baseball: With a long season, baseball tends to have games scheduled throughout the week. Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States is played nearly every day, while other smaller leagues might have a concentrated schedule on weekends or specific weekdays. 5. Cricket: In various countries where cricket is a popular sport, cricket matches – especially one-day internationals (ODIs) and T20s – are usually held on weekends. Test matches, which last for five days, can begin on any day of the week. However, in general, test matches tend to begin on Thursdays or Fridays to maximize public interest and viewership. 6. Hockey: The game schedules for both the National Hockey League (NHL) and college hockey vary, with hockey games being scheduled throughout the week. However, weekends are typically more packed with games, as this is when the majority of fans will have the time to attend or tune in. The holidays and traditions factor In certain countries and cultures, specific days of the week or holidays may impact the scheduling of games. For instance, in most European countries, games will not be scheduled on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. Similarly, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day are considered off-limits for games in the NHL. In the United States, Thanksgiving Day usually features NFL games, with games scheduled on the holiday itself and throughout the Thanksgiving weekend. College football bowl games frequently take place around New Year's Day. An analytical approach: clues to finding the specific day Apart from schedules, holidays, and traditions, one can also look for clues that help determine the day on which the game was played: 1. Box scores: Box scores of games usually come with dates attached, providing insights into the day the game was played. 2. Announcements and media coverage: Press releases, news articles, or social media posts by teams or leagues often provide valuable information on game dates. 3. Ticket stubs or memorabilia: Physical evidence in the form of ticket stubs or promotional merchandise (such as a game day t-shirt or cap) will often carry a date or day of the week, making it an essential source to pinpoint the game day. Conclusion In conclusion, the day of the week on which a game is played greatly depends on the sport, league, and traditions involved. While certain sports tend to follow a more consistent schedule, others are known for their more flexible arrangements. However, finding the specific day on which a game was played often requires a combination of understanding general timings, investigating holidays and traditions, and seeking out concrete evidence through box scores, media, and memorabilia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Brave 6-year-old girl battling brain cancer gets her wish to play in the snow - in Texas Maddie Higgins, only 6 but battling brain cancer, plays in the snow outside her Texas home. The words of 6-year-old Maddie Higgins rang true, but yet there was snow on the ground outside of her North Texas home Friday. Maddie, who is battling an aggressive form of brain cancer, wished for a winter wonderland despite living in sweltering Arlington. The nonprofit group Kinsley's Kure, dedicated to helping sick and terminally ill children, turned the girl’s dream into a reality. Maddie was blindfolded and taken to the front yard. When the covering was removed, and with family and neighbors looking on, little Maddie could not believe what she was seeing: “Impossible, it's summer!” she shouted. Her first order of business: build a snowman dressed as a pirate, then engage in several snowball fights. \\"She was ecstatic!\\" mom Melanie Higgins told the Daily News on Tuesday. \\"She could not believe that there was snow in her yard, especially during these blazing hot Texas summers. She was convinced that Kinsley's Kure beckoned a snow fairy to visit her overnight, just to grant her very special wish.\\" Higgins said her daughter was born on a rare day when Texas saw snow — leading the girl to believe she would feel the frosty flakes again. \\"For the last year-and-a-half she has been asking to go someplace where she can play in real snow and build a snowman,\\" Higgins said. \\"We searched for a place to try to get to in the short amount of time we have had, and there just were not any places we could get her to.\\" Jennifer Brown-Thomas, the founder of Fort Worth-based Kinsley’s Kure, said she first learned about Maddie through a friend. Her group decided they would help the family make some of the young girl’s wishes come true, including pampering her with a beauty and spa day, and giving her a head-to-toe makeover. RELATED: FANS COMPLETE TALIA JOY CASTELLANO'S BUCKET LIST The summer snow day came courtesy of Emergency Ice, which blasted 20,000 pounds of ice through a machine onto the Higgins’ front lawn. Setting the scene took about two-and-a-half hours, said Earl Toler, Emergency Ice president. He said his sister’s son passed away from brain cancer, so being able to help another child battling the same terminal illness inspired him to help. “You see a kid go through something like that, it really changes your perspective on things,” Toler said. Maddie still has a tumor on the cerebellum in the back of the brain, according to a post on the Fight for Maddie Facebook page. With chemotherapy not working, the family will need to decide whether Maddie undergoes a third brain surgery. “We still have not made a decision for ‘treatment’ because it feels like not doing the surgery is giving up, but to do it puts her in such harm's way,” the family said Tuesday, adding that a clinical trial they are waiting on doesn’t appear promising. Higgins said Maddie plans to see pop singer Kelly Clarkson in September, and dreams of one day visiting Japan. If snow can appear in Texas in July, then having Maddie experience another country doesn't sound so impossible. \\"We have to get creative there!\\" Higgins said. USING MOBILE?

Answer the following question: Barbara and Jane are two students. They both like meteorology. Barbara studies the formation of the ozone layer, while Jane studies about the stratosphere. Which student learned more about temperature inversion? Hint: The mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by British mathematician Sydney Chapman in 1930. Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the UV-C region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240 nm. Radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is photolysed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. Ozone (O3) photolysis produces O and O2. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O3, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with altitude (see temperature inversion); the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 K (−3°C or 26.6°F). This vertical stratification, with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular convection and associated turbulence in this part of the atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops in severe supercell thunderstorms, may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the surface of the planet outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause, the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the stratopause, above which the temperature decreases with height. Answer:","completion":"Jane learned more about temperature inversion, as her studies focus on the stratosphere, where temperature inversion occurs due to the rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone. The stratosphere is characterized by increasing temperatures with altitude, and this vertical stratification creates a stable environment with minimal convection and turbulence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The US Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job. Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and on the next day, when further rescue arrived, Walden was reported dead. Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic (Matt Damon), praises Walden heavily. Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward and that Monfriez himself led the crew in combat, and that the fuel bladder technique was originated by him. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and rendered unconscious.

Nearly a year after Sept. 11, the Legal Aid Society-the lawyers for New York's poor and homeless-remains, well, homeless. The nonprofit has been barred from returning to its 90 Church St. headquarters, across from the World Trade Center site, because of environmental concerns. Legal Aid has uncomfortable company. More than 11,500 New Yorkers continue to work out of temporary space, according to analysis by Manhattan-based real estate brokerage TenantWise.com Inc. and Crain's New York Business. That's 8% of the 137,000 workers who lost their offices or access to them when the Twin Towers collapsed. Legal Aid's 450 displaced attorneys and staffers have spent the past 12 months spread among previously unused spaces-some unused for good reason-in the nonprofit's other offices. It could be another year and a half before they return to their old desks. They have contended with difficult working conditions as demand for Legal Aid's services is on the rise because of Sept. 11 and the deteriorating economy. The civil division is spread among a few boroughs. Their papers and documents, some 20,000 boxes worth, are stuck in a storage facility in Linden, N.J. \\"I am counting the days till we can have all the parts back in one place,\\" says Steven Banks, Legal Aid's associate attorney in chief. In the memories of the exiled workers, the old office has achieved mythical proportions. They say the wood paneling and rugs had the ability to cool emotions and lift spirits. The Legal Aid office on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights, where 65 displaced workers have cobbled together space amid the faded and scratched walls, looks more like a bargain basement.

Here are possible answers to this question: - dance - become inebriated - urinate - sleep at night - socialize I believe the correct choice is \\"socialize\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"Socialize, here's a step-by-step justification of this choice: 1. Interpret the question: The question asks what people are more likely to do when they consume alcohol at a bar. We have five possible answers: dance, become inebriated, urinate, sleep at night, and socialize. 2. Analyze each possible answer and its relation to the context: - Dance: While some people might dance when they drink alcohol at a bar, not all bars have dance floors or play music for dancing. This option is possible but not guaranteed. - Become inebriated: Although consuming alcohol can lead to inebriation, the question specifically asks about people's behavior or actions at a bar, not the state they reach due to alcohol consumption. - Urinate: Drinking alcohol might increase the need to urinate as it is a diuretic. However, this is a side effect of alcohol consumption rather than a greater purpose or motivation for going to a bar. - Sleep at night: This choice is not directly related to the experience of drinking alcohol at a bar. While alcohol might affect sleep patterns, this option is irrelevant to the context of the question. - Socialize: Bars are locations where people often gather to meet friends, interact with others, and engage in conversation. Socialization is a key component of the bar experience, and alcohol consumption can facilitate social interactions by lowering inhibitions and increasing relaxation. 3. Determine the most likely answer: Considering the context of the question and the relevance of each possible answer, the most likely behavior or action that people engage in when they drink alcohol at a bar is to socialize. This choice is the most applicable and directly related to the purpose of visiting a bar and the role that alcohol can play in enhancing social experiences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This article: Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine. In 1965, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to the Jackson 5.

Given the below context: The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) writes: \\"Frank Zappa dabbled in virtually all kinds of music—and, whether guised as a satirical rocker, jazz-rock fusionist, guitar virtuoso, electronics wizard, or orchestral innovator, his eccentric genius was undeniable.\\" Even though his work drew inspiration from many different genres, Zappa was seen as establishing a coherent and personal expression. In 1971, biographer David Walley noted that \\"The whole structure of his music is unified, not neatly divided by dates or time sequences and it is all building into a composite\\". On commenting on Zappa's music, politics and philosophy, Barry Miles noted in 2004 that they cannot be separated: \\"It was all one; all part of his 'conceptual continuity'.\\" Guitar Player devoted a special issue to Zappa in 1992, and asked on the cover \\"Is FZ America's Best Kept Musical Secret?\\" Editor Don Menn remarked that the issue was about \\"The most important composer to come out of modern popular music\\".Among those contributing to the issue was composer and musicologist Nicolas Slonimsky, who conducted premiere performances of works of Ives and Varèse in the 1930s. He became friends with Zappa in the 1980s, and said, \\"I admire everything Frank does, because he practically created the new musical millennium. He does beautiful, beautiful work ... It has been my luck to have lived to see the emergence of this totally new type of music.\\"Conductor Kent Nagano remarked in the same issue that \\"Frank is a genius. That's a word I don't use often ... In Frank's case it is not too strong ... He is extremely literate musically. I'm not sure if the general public knows that.\\" Pierre Boulez told Musician magazine's posthumous Zappa tribute article that Zappa \\"was an exceptional figure because he was part of the worlds of rock and classical music and that both types of his work would survive.\\"In 1994, jazz magazine DownBeat's critics poll placed Zappa in its Hall of Fame.

Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I was interested to see what he'd do with total creative control over a movie. Sadly, it is unwatchable, though not because the jokes aren't funny--some (I won't say most) of them are, and in fact Mr. Mike did a good job translating his mentally unbalanced screeds into visual gags. The trouble is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, you name it) is so God-awful, the movie is intolerable. Some outfit called \\"PKO Productions\\" gets the producing credit, but it doesn't look produced at all; it looks more like Mike stole one of the cameras from the SNL set and made the whole thing in an afternoon. I realize Mike's goal was to torture the audience, but even that deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear or comprehend whatever it is that's supposed to be shocking. Still, the DVD isn't a total waste: it includes a eulogy for O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and three \\"Mr. Mike's Least Loved Bedtime Stories\\" from SNL.

The question asks when the fighting started, which refers specifically to combat situations. We will need to find the choice that best aligns with this context. Step 2: Evaluate the choices against the context of the question. - Fort: A fort is a defensive structure where fighting may take place, but just mentioning the \\"fort\\" doesn't represent the actual combat situation. - Orphans: This choice seems unrelated to the context of the question, as it focuses on the consequences of war rather than the fighting itself. - Battlefield: A battlefield directly represents the location where fighting and combat take place. - Other countries: While John joined the army to see the world, this choice refers to general travel rather than the actual fighting situations. - War: War is a larger concept that includes various aspects such as politics, strategies, and combat. It is not as specific as the context requires. Step 3: Choose the most fitting answer based on the evaluation.

Stay with your baby at all times. Place your baby down. Wash your baby. Make sure your baby's scalp is clean. Dry off your baby.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Ultimate Guide to Washing Your Baby Safely and Comfortably Introduction Bathing your baby can be a bonding experience between parents and their little one, but it can also be challenging, especially for first-time parents. Ensuring your baby's safety and comfort is the top priority during bath time. In this article, we will provide a step-by-step guide based on the key pointers: working in a warm room with warm water, making sure you’re ready, staying with your baby at all times, positioning your baby properly, washing your baby, ensuring your baby’s scalp is clean, and drying off your baby thoroughly. 1. Working in a Warm Room with Warm Water Create a comfortable environment for your baby by making sure the room temperature is at a cozy level. The ideal room temperature for bathing a baby should be between 75℉ and 80℉. This helps maintain their body heat and keeps them from getting chilled. Prepare warm water for the bath, with a temperature of approximately 100℉, which is neither too hot nor too cold. 2. Making Sure You're Ready Before bringing your baby into the bathing area, gather all necessary bath supplies such as baby soap, a washcloth, a soft towel, a clean diaper, and baby clothes. Having everything within arm's reach ensures that you don't need to leave your baby unattended during bath time. Being prepared also minimizes the stress that both you and your baby might experience during this process. 3. Staying with Your Baby at All Times Never leave your baby unattended during bath time, even for a few seconds. Accidents can happen quickly, and it is crucial to be vigilant to ensure your baby's safety. If you need to step away to grab something, take the baby with you by wrapping them in a towel. Remember that it is always better to be cautious than to risk your baby's safety. 4. Placing Your Baby Down Ensure that your baby is safely placed on a non-slip surface before you start the washing process. You may use a baby bath seat, a bathtub sling, or a sponge bath pad for support. Position your baby at a slight incline, with their head slightly elevated, to prevent water from entering their ears or splashing on their face. 5. Washing Your Baby Begin washing your baby by gently applying soap and warm water using a soft washcloth. Start with your baby's face, neck, and ears, working your way down to their arms, chest, back, legs, and finally the diaper area, which is usually the dirtiest. Be mindful of sensitive areas, such as skin folds, where dirt and bacteria may accumulate. 6. Ensuring Your Baby's Scalp is Clean Babies often develop a common cradle cap, which is characterized by greasy, scaly patches on their scalp. Gently massage a small amount of baby soap into your baby's scalp using your fingertips or a baby brush. Rinse thoroughly to ensure that no soap is left behind, as it may cause irritation or dryness. 7. Drying Off Your Baby After rinsing your baby, lift them out of the bath support and gently wrap them in a soft, warm towel. Pat your baby dry, making sure to thoroughly absorb any moisture in their skin folds, as this could lead to irritation or diaper rash. Once your baby is dry, dress them in clean clothes and apply a gentle moisturizer if needed. Conclusion Bath time can be an enjoyable and relaxing experience for both parent and baby when proper precautions and techniques are used. By following these seven steps, you can ensure a safe and comfortable bathing experience for your little one, setting the foundation for a lifetime of good hygiene habits. Happy bathing!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The passage describes the narrator's journey on the metro, referring to it as a \\"really scary rollercoaster\\". This might indicate a level of unease or unfamiliarity with this mode of transport, perhaps denoting that they don't use it very often. The narrator mentions that their ears popped as the metro descended to the Medical Center stop, which suggests the metro was in an underground tunnel. The narrator then narrates their fear of missing their stop, another hint at their possible inexperience or anxiety about traveling on the metro. They safely made it to the orientation, however, along with four other new people. One of these individuals was someone the narrator had met during an open house event. The narrator acknowledges some relief that there were other people also new to the experience, which shared in their lack of knowledge on what to do.

Wheeler had been expecting and openly hoping for war with Nazi Germany for a year prior to the outbreak of hostilities; he believed that the United Kingdom's involvement in the conflict would remedy the shame that he thought had been brought upon the country by its signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938. Volunteering for the armed services, he was assigned to assemble the 48th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery at Enfield, where he set about recruiting volunteers, including his son Michael. As the 48th swelled in size, it was converted into the 42nd Mobile Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment in the Royal Artillery, which consisted of four batteries and was led by Wheeler – now promoted to the rank of colonel – as Commanding Officer. Given the nickname of \\"Flash Alf\\" by those serving under him, he was recognised by colleagues as a ruthless disciplinarian and was blamed by many for the death of one of his soldiers from influenza during training. Having been appointed secretary of the Society of Antiquaries in 1939 and then director in 1940, he travelled to London to deal with society affairs on various occasions. In 1941 Wheeler was awarded a Fellowship of the British Academy. Cole had meanwhile entered into an affair with a man named Clive Entwistle, who lambasted Wheeler as \\"that whiskered baboon\\". When Wheeler discovered Entwistle in bed with his wife, he initiated divorce proceedings that were finalised in March 1942.In the summer of 1941, Wheeler and three of his batteries were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS Empress of Russia; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, they were forced to travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban. There, Wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain. The ship docked in Aden, where Wheeler and his men again took shore leave.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. and the situation: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. Answer the following question: Which country would have lower labor supply in response to their taxation? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided and the differing taxation policies implemented by Germany and France after the Second World War, it is likely that France would have a lower labor supply in response to their taxation policy. As mentioned, Germany, specifically West Germany, elected pro-capitalist governments that implemented tax rates below the critical rate. This taxation policy is in line with the Laffer curve's theory, which suggests that reducing tax rates below this critical point encourages an increase in labor supply and economic activity, ultimately leading to an increase in government revenue. On the other hand, France implemented tax rates above the critical rate due to the election of pro-socialist governments. According to the Laffer curve, these higher tax rates would lead to a decline in labor supply and a reduction in government revenue. This is because individuals and businesses in France face disincentives to work, invest, and produce when higher tax rates are imposed, such as a reduced share of their income following taxation. This can negatively impact the labor supply as businesses and individuals weigh the costs and benefits of working more or less in response to the taxation level. Businesses operating in France would therefore need to make informed decisions considering the higher tax environment and the possibility of encountering a lower labor supply due to the disincentives created by the tax structure. They may need to adjust their business strategies to attract and retain talent in an environment where high taxes may discourage labor market participation. In conclusion, given the information about the two countries' taxation policies, it is likely that France would experience a lower labor supply due to their higher tax rates, which are above the critical rate suggested by the Laffer curve, resulting in disincentives for businesses and individuals to engage in economic activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. and the situation: Two students studied animal behavior for the biology class. Ned studied more about predators, while Kim studied more about herbivores. Answer the following question: Which student studied more about keystone species? Answer:","completion":"Given the background information and situation, it is more likely that Ned, who studied predators, focused more on keystone species as part of his research. This is because predators often play a significant role in maintaining the balance and stability of an ecosystem, and they can be identified as keystone species. As mentioned in the background, predators fulfill essential functions within an ecosystem, such as controlling the populations of herbivores and preventing them from dominating the environment. Overpopulation of herbivores could lead to the depletion of plant resources- placing a strain on the ecosystem as a whole. In the example provided, wolves serve as a keystone species because their presence or absence can have a ripple effect on the populations of deer and, consequently, the availability of plants and grasses in the ecosystem. While herbivores also play an essential role in ecosystems, their functions and interactions are less likely to be directly associated with keystone species, as they are generally considered to be consumers, or primary consumers, who feed on plants and convert the energy stored within them into a usable form for other organisms. In contrast, predators act as secondary or tertiary consumers that exercise top-down control on the populations of herbivores, resulting in a more considerable impact on the overall ecosystem dynamics. Therefore, given the greater association between predators and keystone species, it is reasonable to conclude that Ned, who focused on predators, studied more about keystone species than Kim, who concentrated on herbivores."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Given the task definition and input, reply with output. Given a question and a context passage, generate the answer having the word or phrase from the context passage. Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Context: Biotic and abiotic factors determine the population size of a species in an ecosystem. What are some important biotic factors? Biotic factors include the amount of food that is available to that species and the number of organisms that also use that food source. What are some important abiotic factors? Space, water, and climate all help determine a species population. When does a population grow? A population grows when the number of births is greater than the number of deaths. When does a population shrink? When deaths exceed births. What causes a population to grow? For a population to grow there must be ample resources and no major problems. What causes a population to shrink? A population can shrink either because of biotic or abiotic limits. An increase in predators, the emergence of a new disease, or the loss of habitat are just three possible problems that will decrease a population. A population may also shrink if it grows too large for the resources required to support it. When the number of births equals the number of deaths, the population is at its carrying capacity for that habitat. In a population at its carrying capacity, there are as many organisms of that species as the habitat can support. The carrying capacity depends on biotic and abiotic factors. If these factors improve, the carrying capacity increases. If the factors become less plentiful, the carrying capacity drops. If resources are being used faster than they are being replenished, then the species has exceeded its carrying capacity. If this occurs, the population will then decrease in size. Every stable population has one or more factors that limit its growth. A limiting factor determines the carrying capacity for a species. A limiting factor can be any biotic or abiotic factor: nutrient, space, and water availability are examples (Figure 1.1). The size of a population is tied to its limiting factor. What happens if a limiting factor increases a lot? Is it still a limiting factor? If a limiting factor increases a lot, another factor will most likely become the new limiting factor. This may be a bit confusing, so lets look at an example of limiting factors. Say you want to make as many chocolate chip cookies as you can with the ingredients you have on hand. It turns out that you have plenty of flour and other ingredients, but only two eggs. You can make only one batch of cookies, because eggs are the limiting factor. But then your neighbor comes over with a dozen eggs. Now you have enough eggs for seven batches of cookies, but only two pounds of butter. You can make four batches of cookies, with butter as the limiting factor. If you get more butter, some other ingredient will be limiting. Species ordinarily produce more offspring than their habitat can support (Figure 1.2). If conditions improve, more young survive and the population grows. If conditions worsen, or if too many young are born, there is competition between individuals. As in any competition, there are some winners and some losers. Those individuals that survive to fill the available spots in the niche are those that are the most fit for their habitat. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: A frog in frog spawn.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who believes that the set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes, published in 1859, reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty\\"? is inside the article: The Esquisses of 1861 are a set of highly varied miniatures, ranging from the tiny 18-bar no. 4, Les cloches (The Bells), to the strident tone clusters of no. 45, Les diablotins (The Imps), and closing with a further evocation of church bells in no. 49, Laus Deo (Praise God). They were preceded in publication by Alkan's deceptively titled Sonatine, Op. 61, in 'classical' format, but a work of \\"ruthless economy [which] although it plays for less than twenty minutes ... is in every way a major work.\\"Two of Alkan's substantial works from this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. Salut, cendre du pauvre, Op. 45 (1856), follows a section of the poem La Mélancolie by Gabriel-Marie Legouvé; while Super flumina Babylonis, Op. 52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of Psalm 137 (\\"By the waters of Babylon ...\\"). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces. Alkan's publications for organ or pédalier commenced with his Benedictus, Op. 54 (1859). In the same year he published a set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes (1859, without opus number), which, in Smith's opinion, \\"seem to stand outside the barriers of time and space\\", and which he believes reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty.\\" These were followed by pieces such as the 13 Prières (Prayers), Op. 64 (1865), and the Impromptu sur le Choral de Luther \\"Un fort rempart est notre Dieu\\" , op. 69 (1866). Alkan also issued a book of 12 studies for the pedalboard alone (no opus number, 1866) and the Bombardo-carillon for pedalboard duet (four feet) of 1872.Alkan's return to the concert platform at his Petits Concerts, however, marked the end of his publications; his final work to be issued was the Toccatina, Op. 75, in 1872., can you guess it ?","completion":"Yes, the name of the person who believes that the set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes, published in 1859, reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty\\" is Ronald Smith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Isolate the term with the variable (n) on one side of the equation. 2. Simplify the equation if needed. 3. Solve for the variable (n). Let's work through the steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable (n) on one side of the equation. To isolate the term with the variable n (6n) on the left side, first, we will move the constant term (-8) from the right side to the left side of the equation. We can do this by adding 8 to both sides of the equation. -20 + 8 = 6n - 8 + 8 After adding 8 to both sides, we get: -12 = 6n Now, we have successfully isolated the term with the variable (n) on the right side of the equation. Step 2: Simplify the equation if needed. In this case, we don't need to simplify the equation further as we already have a simplified equation: -12 = 6n Step 3: Solve for the variable (n). Now, to find the value of n, we will divide both sides of the equation by 6: -12 / 6 = 6n / 6 By dividing, we get: -2 = n So, n = -2.

Cabinets provide a discreet and organized way to store your television when not in use and prevent it from being the central focus of the room. There are several types of cabinets that can accommodate televisions, and choosing the one that best matches your interior design and storage needs will ensure that your television remains hidden and protected when you want it to be. For example, you can consider the following cabinet options: 1. TV lift cabinets: These cabinets have a built-in motorized mechanism that lifts the television into view when you want to watch it and hides it when not in use. This provides a clean and uncluttered look for your living space, as well as added protection for your television from dust and accidental damage. 2. Armoires: This type of cabinet is essentially a large, freestanding wardrobe with shelving or drawers for storage. Many armoires have a dedicated compartment for a television, along with other compartments for storage, like DVDs, game consoles, and other electronic devices. 3. Entertainment centers and media cabinets: These are specifically designed to house your television and other media devices. They often come equipped with doors or sliding panels that can easily hide your television when not in use. 4. Custom-built cabinets: If you have a specific vision in mind for your television hiding place, you can consult with a carpenter or cabinetmaker to craft a custom-built cabinet that fits your style and storage requirements. Keep in mind that the specific room where the cabinet is placed can still vary depending on your preference. While a living room or a bedroom might be more traditional locations for a television cabinet, it's ultimately up to your own interior design and personal preferences as to where you want to have your television hidden. However, the most suitable option specifically for storing and hiding a television remains a cabinet, allowing you to control its visibility and integrate it seamlessly into your home's overall design and aesthetic."},{"prompt":"Who was born first Cate Shortland or Aaron Katz ?","completion":"Cate Shortland was born first.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Robert David Sanders \\"Bob\\" Novak (February 26, 1931 - August 18, 2009) was an American syndicated columnist, journalist, television personality, author, and conservative political commentator. After working for two newspapers before serving in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, he became a reporter for the Associated Press and then for The Wall Street Journal. He teamed up with Rowland Evans in 1963 to start Inside Report, which became the longest running syndicated political column in U.S. history and ran in hundreds of papers. They also started the Evans-Novak Political Report, a notable biweekly newsletter, in 1967. Novak was born in Joliet, Illinois, the son of Jane Sanders and Maurice Novak, a chemical engineer. His paternal grandparents immigrated from Ukraine, and his mother's family was from Lithuania. Novak's parents were secular Jews who had little interaction with their local Jewish community and rarely attended religious services. Neighbors considered Novak's family to be Polish. Novak suffered from chronic bronchitis through his early childhood, which led his mother to drive him to and from school instead of letting him walk. Because of the constant family attention, his cousins mockingly called him \\"Baby Jesus\\". Novak also loved to tease, offend, and shock his family from an early age, and he later compared himself to French rebel Bertran de Born. Novak's journalism career began when he was in high school as a student-writer for the Joliet Herald-News, his hometown newspaper, and he received ten cents per inch. After high school, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UI) from 1948 to 1952. His father had attended the college, and he later remarked that \\"I was an Illini from birth\\". He became a brother of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, at the time a mostly Jewish college fraternity, while attending the University of Illinois. Novak would later use the group's 'secret handshake' whenever he met fellow alumnus Wolf Blitzer. He continued gaining journalism experience as a sports writer for the Daily Illini (DI), the college's student newspaper. Novak's wrote how his disappointment about not being named the paper's main sports editor for the 1951-52 school year (he lost the job to Tony Garcia) led him to skip his senior classes and to work full time for the Champaign-Urbana Courier. After four years at the University, Novak left it to become a full-time journalist without a degree, even though he was only one course short of the requirements. In 1993 a college Dean determined that four mandatory physical education classes that Novak had gone through for no credit should constitute enough credit hours, and Novak received his bachelor's degree. Novak later described his academic achievements as \\"very uneven.\\" He spoke at the university's May 1998 commencement, and in his speech he credited the college for bringing him up from working class immigrant status into the American middle class. During the Korean War, Novak served in the U.S. Army, and he reached the rank of lieutenant. He later stated that he had fully expected to die in the service. After serving from 1952 to 1954, he joined the Associated Press (AP) and became a political correspondent in Omaha, Nebraska. He was transferred to Lincoln, Nebraska, and then to Indianapolis, Indiana, covering the two state legislatures in his reporting. In 1957, Novak was transferred to Washington, D.C. where he reported on Congress. He left the AP to join the D.C. bureau of The Wall Street Journal in 1958, covering the Senate. He rose to the rank of chief congressional correspondent in 1961. He generally did his work without using a tape recordings or paper notes, relying just on his detailed memory. Novak's colleagues at The Wall Street Journal later said that he absorbed himself in his work so completely that he often forgot to shave, left his shoes untied, and even started accidentally placing burning cigarettes into his pockets. Did he work with any news organizations?","completion":"Yes, Bob Novak worked with news organizations. He was a reporter for the Associated Press and then for The Wall Street Journal.

The bank building was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building. In 1955 Dallas Barrack, a Springdale antique dealer, bought Oklahoma Row, and renovated it into an antique store called the Palace Art Galleries. He was to have carried \\"some of the finest...

Write an email with the following subject: Final Potts Opinion Email:","completion":"Subject: Final Potts Opinion Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. After careful deliberation and thorough analysis of the Potts case, I am writing to present my final opinion on this matter. The purpose of this email is to provide a clear and concise overview of the critical aspects surrounding the case, the precedent that we may rely upon, and the most viable legal strategy to pursue in our attempt to resolve it. Firstly, let's take a moment to recap the essential facts of the case at hand. Our client, Mr. Potts, has been accused of copyright infringement by the plaintiff, who claims that Mr. Potts used a substantial portion of their copyrighted material in his work without obtaining the necessary permission. In response, Mr. Potts has refuted these allegations, arguing that his use of the material falls under the fair use doctrine and, therefore, does not amount to copyright infringement. During our extensive research, we scrutinized several similar cases and studied both the legislative framework and judicial interpretation of copyright law. The fair use doctrine, as outlined in Section 107 of the Copyright Act, allows for the limited use of copyrighted material without acquiring permission from the copyright holder, provided that certain criteria are met. These criteria include the nature and purpose of the copyrighted work, the portion used concerning the copyrighted work as a whole, and the potential market impact of its use. Having reviewed the evidence, it has become increasingly apparent that our client's use of the copyrighted material aligns with the fair use doctrine. Mr. Potts' work is primarily educational, adhering to characteristic limitations within the realm of fair use. Furthermore, he used a relatively small, non-significant portion of the copyrighted work, which does not detract from its original value or intent. Lastly, we argue that Mr. Potts' work does not substantially impact the market or potential market for the copyrighted work, as it serves an entirely different purpose. In light of these findings, we must highlight landmark cases that support our position. One such case is Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994), which sets a significant precedent for transformative work and the fair use doctrine. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the defendant, opining that parody constituted fair use, despite potential market impact. Drawing parallels from this case, we can establish that Mr. Potts' work shares sufficient transformative qualities, ultimately contributing to the educational domain. Considering our legal strategy, the first step is to prepare a comprehensive defense, emphasizing the applicability of the fair use doctrine to Mr. Potts' work. We will need to gather the necessary documentation and evidence to support our claims before presenting them in a clear, compelling manner. Additionally, we should be prepared to negotiate with the plaintiff if they are willing to settle out of court, as it may be a more cost-effective and efficient option for our client. To summarize, I am confident in our prospects for success in defending Mr. Potts against the allegations of copyright infringement based on the fair use doctrine. By carefully aligning our legal strategy with precedent in similar cases, conducting thorough research, and effectively presenting our argument, I believe that we can achieve a favorable outcome for our client. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Together, we will diligently work towards resolving the Potts case in the best possible manner.

Title: House at the End of the Street Movie plot: A young psychotic girl murders her parents with a hammer in the middle of a stormy night. Four years later, a newly divorced woman, medical doctor Sarah Cassidy (Elisabeth Shue), and her 17-year-old daughter Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence) move to a small, upscale town. Their house is near the house where the massacred family lived. As told by the neighbors, four years prior, a girl named Carrie-Ann Jacobson killed her parents, then fled into the forest and was never seen again, leaving her brother Ryan (Max Thieriot) as the sole survivor. Ryan now lives alone and is hated by his neighbors; Bill Weaver (Gil Bellows), a local police officer, appears to be Ryan's only supporter. The mother-daughter relationship becomes rocky and Elissa starts dating Ryan against her mother's wishes, finding Ryan to be lonely but a sweet boy. Ryan confides in her that he accidentally injured Carrie-Ann by allowing her to fall from a swing when they were little; he was supposed to be watching her while their parents were getting high on drugs. The resulting brain damage from the accident made her extremely aggressive, leading to their parents' murder. Ryan is revealed to have been secretly taking care of a seemingly now-grown Carrie-Ann (Eva Link) in a hidden room. When she, Ann, escapes, Ryan accidentally kills her while trying to hide her. In grief, he goes to the diner, where he meets a kind waitress named Peggy (Jordan Hayes). Later, some unruly high school boys pick a fight with Ryan and he flees, and Elissa drives to his house and subdues a fire the boys started.

Amanda Holden, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a standing ovation. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that \\"it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers\\". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final. He sang \\"Tears in Heaven\\" by Eric Clapton; judge Holden told him he had \\"a gift from God in [his] voice\\". At the final on 30 May, he again sang \\"Pie Jesu\\". He finished in third place, behind the winner, the street dancer George Sampson and runners-up, the dance group Signature. Johnston left the stage in tears, later saying that he \\"was upset.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Given the background: Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content. and the situation: Dee and Ann were two cousins. Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level. Answer the following question: Which cousin experienced more temperature inversion phenomena? The answer is:","completion":"Ann, who lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, likely experienced more temperature inversion phenomena. This is due to the fact that temperature inversions are more common in high altitude areas. A temperature inversion, in meteorology, is a deviation from the normal change of an atmospheric property with altitude. It almost always refers to a \\"temperature inversion\\", i.e., an increase in temperature with height, or to the layer within which such an increase occurs. In the case of Ann's mountain village, under certain conditions (like calm nights with clear skies), the air at the surface can cool rapidly. Because the air near the ground is often cooler than the air above it, it can result in an inversion layer forming where the temperature increases with height. In stable atmospheric conditions, this inversion can trap pollution, like smoke or fog, leading to poorer air quality on the valley floor. On the other hand, if one is standing on the mountaintop during an inversion, temperatures could be warmer than in the valley below and the views quite clear. Inversion layers are more common in mountain regions. Dee, living at sea level in a coastal town, is less likely to experience these temperature inversions. Coastal regions tend to have a more moderated climate due to the influence of the nearby water, which has a high specific heat capacity, transmitting warmth during the winter and coolness during the summer. As a result, coastal regions like where Dee lives have less fluctuation in temperatures compared to higher altitudes like where Ann lives, making temperature inversions less common."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Baby girls make their way directly for dolls as soon as they can crawl, while boys will head for cars, a study has shown. The findings, the first to show differences in very young babies, suggest there is a biological basis to their preferences. Psychologists Dr Brenda Todd from City University London carried out an experiment involving 90 babies aged 9 months to 36 months. The babies were allowed to choose from seven toys. Some were typically boys' toys ---- a car, a digger, a ball and a blue teddy. The rest were girls' toys: a pink teddy, a doll and a cooking set. They were placed a meter away from the toys;and could pick whichever toy they liked their choice and the amount of time they spent playing with each toy were recorded. Of the youngest children (9 to 14 months), girls spent significantly longer playing with the doll than boys, and boys spent much more time with the car and ball than the girls did. Among the two and three-year-olds, girls spent 50 percent of the time playing with the doll while only two boys briefly touched it. The boys spent almost 90 percent of their time playing with cars, which the girls barely touched. There was no link between the parents' view on which toys were more appropriate for boys or girls, and the children's choice. Dr Brenda Todd said, \\"Children of this age are already exposed to much socialization. Boys may be given 'toys that go' while girls get toys they can care for, which may help shape their preference. But these findings agree with the former idea that children show natural interests in particular kinds of toys. There could be a biological basis for their choices. Males through evolution have been adapted to prefer: moving objects, probably through hunting instincts , while girls prefer warmer colors such as pink, the colour of a newborn baby.\\" Question: Both baby boys and baby girls like to play with _ according to the study.

(CNN) They destroy like swarms of locusts, breed like rabbits, and are masters of disguise. Multiple species of armyworm moths are laying waste to vast tracts of farmland across southern Africa. In their larval stage, the inch-long pests have destroyed thousands of hectares of crops in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi -- threatening food security and livelihoods in a region still reeling from a devastating spell of drought As the insects continue to multiply and spread, national governments and aid agencies are struggling to contain them. Native and alien species Zimbabwe is currently the worst affected country. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that armyworms are present in seven of the country's eight provinces, with estimates of 70% crop destruction in some areas. The outbreak includes both the native African armyworm (Spodoptera exempta) and the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) -- a non-indigenous, or alien, species that originated in the Americas and is even more destructive. \\"This is affecting almost every maize farm that uses irrigation,\\" says Dr. Godfrey Chikwenhere, chief entomologist at Zimbabwe's Ministry of Agriculture. \\"We cannot assess the total cost yet.\\" The fall armyworm escapes detection by burrowing inside maize stems, says Chikwenhere, whereas local farmers are used to looking for the caterpillar on the outside of plants. The invasive species can lay six generations of around 50 eggs in a single location, leading to rapid colonization and destruction of territory. The Zimbabwean government is circulating information and pesticides among farmers to help them combat the threat, but faces a long struggle to turn back the tide. The fall armyworm is devastating Zimbabwe's maize crop, exacerbating the damage caused by a severe recent drought. Zambia deploys the air force Neighboring Zambia has taken drastic measures to halt the march of the armyworm, which gets its name from the large, army-like groups it forms when on the move. Over 100,000 hectares of farmland have been infested, and the government has dispatched army planes to spray the affected areas with pesticides. Officials are confident of success. \\"We have managed to contain the outbreak,\\" says Peter Lungu, head of the technical services at Zambia's Ministry of Agriculture. \\"A number of government agencies and departments are collaborating and we have disaster management units providing chemicals and safety materials.\\" Intensive surveillance is ongoing and Zambia remains vulnerable to invasive pests, according to Moses Mwale, director of the Zambia Agricultural Research Institute. \\"We can only deal with an outbreak once it has happened,\\" he says. \\"We cannot eliminate such outbreaks in future but we must be constantly on the lookout... and we need to be sure that all international airports are properly equipped to inspect plant products coming from outside and scientists are properly trained to do the surveillance.\\" Zambia is using its air force against the pests. Out of control? Outbreaks of different strains of armyworm have also been reported in Namibia and Malawi -- where the government recently reported the destruction of 2,000 hectares of maize. \\"Any one of the outbreaks could potentially have a devastating impact on food security,\\" says Dr Chimimba David Phiri, FAO Subregional Coordinator for Southern Africa, highlighting the knock-on effect after a recent severe drought that left 40 million people dependent on aid . Maize is a staple food crop in southern Africa and a poor, worm-affected harvest is likely to have serious effects. Phiri adds that the fall armyworm in Zimbabwe represents the greatest threat, particularly if it spreads to further crops. \\"If it spreads across large areas of Zimbabwe and even beyond we have major concerns,\\" he says. \\"So far we have not heard about problems with [Zimbabwe's] sugar plantations, which could be economically devastating.\\" Hard to kill The fall armyworms moths are born survivors, according to Georg Goergen, an entomologist at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture who is a long-time researcher of the species. \\"This species is the number one pest of the Americas,\\" he says. \\"We saw it last year in Nigeria and Togo and it has spread much faster than expected.\\" In North America the species migrates over huge distances, from Florida in the South to Canada in the North, and Goergen expects them to spread further in Africa. \\"The next step will be countries such as Kenya and Tanzania... I don't know if it can cross the Sahara.\\" The entomologist is involved with research efforts to find an effective pesticide to control the caterpillars. He says the existing chemicals being used in Africa are unlikely to succeed. In the US, genetically modified crops have been used to combat them, although they have developed defences As the armyworm crisis deepens, the search for a solution is at risk of becoming desperate. ||||| The new pest - fall army worm. Photo © Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development, Zimbabwe. 3 February 2017, Harare – A fall armyworm outbreak, the first emergence of the pest in southern Africa, is causing considerable crop damage in some countries. If the pest damage aggravates, it could dampen prospects for good crop harvests that is anticipated in the current farming season. Maize, a staple food in the region has been the most affected, as well as other cereals including sorghum, millet and wheat. Southern Africa is reeling from the effects of two consecutive years of El Nino-induced drought that affected over 40 million people, reduced food availability by 15 percent and caused a cereal deficit of 9 million tonnes. The FAO Subregional Coordinator for southern Africa, David Phiri, said that the situation was constantly evolving. “The situation remains fluid. Preliminary reports indicate possible presence (of the pest) in Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe has positively identified the presence of the pest while the rest are expected to release test results soon,\\" he said. In Zambia, the Government has already spent US 3 million in an attempt to control the pest that has affected approximately 130 000 hectares of crops. However, the full extent of the damage in the country and other affected countries, is yet to be established. The pest which primarily spreads through wind dispersal and host plant products, is reported to be still active. The affected countries are also in different stages of assessing the damage to the crops because the outbreaks did not occur simultaneously. Fall armyworm is a relatively new pest from the Americas, whose presence on the African continent was first reported in Sao Tome and Principe around January 2016. The pest is known to cause extensive crop losses of up to 73 percent depending on existing conditions and is difficult to control with a single type of pesticide, especially when it has reached an advanced larval development stage. Emergency Regional Meeting to shape coordinated action FAO, in partnership with the Southern African Development Committee (SADC) and the International Red Locust Control Organization for Central and Southern Africa (IRLCO-CSA), is organizing an Emergency Regional Meeting of key stakeholders from 14 to 16 February 2017 in Harare, Zimbabwe. “Southern Africa is currently facing serious threats posed by diverse transboundary pests and diseases, including the varied armyworms, locusts, the tomato leaf minor and maize lethal necrosis disease. The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, H5N8 strain, that has been confirmed to be in Uganda and possibly Rwanda too, is likely to spread southwards, along the wild bird migration routes”, said David Phiri. The Harare meeting will discuss the strengthening of surveillance, preparedness and coordinated emergency responses to transboundary crop pests and livestock diseases, including the fall armyworm infestation. It will also discuss control strategies and measures and provide a platform for sharing experiences and valuable lessons. The meeting is being organized with funding availed to FAO by the Africa Solidarity Trust Fund, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFiD). Developing capacities for rapid response As the region faces up to these new and emerging challenges, that are threatening the livelihoods of over 70 percent of the population that depend on agriculture, there is a crucial need to enhance capacity at country and regional levels, to prevent, detect and respond rapidly to any new pests and diseases threat. “The countries need to maintain and, where needed, expand diagnostic laboratory, surveillance and response capacity as well as conduct assessments and research to enable rapid responses to recurrent and new threats”, said David Phiri. FAO is working with governments, the SADC and other stakeholders to develop and roll out an appropriate strategy to determine the level of fall armyworm infestation and its impact on crop production. The organization will continue supporting response efforts as well as contribute to enhancing the resilience capacity of the countries and stakeholders in the region. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Many types of armyworm moths are causing big problems for farmers in southern Africa.

The Veterans Committee was the popular name of the National Baseball Hall of Fame Committee to Consider Managers, Umpires, Executives and Long-Retired Players; a former voting committee of the U.S. Baseball Hall of Fame that provided an opportunity for Hall of Fame enshrinement to all individuals who are eligible for induction but ineligible for consideration by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). The term \\"Veterans Committee\\" (was composed of four committees of baseball veterans) is taken from the body's former official name: National Baseball Hall of Fame Committee on Baseball Veterans (1953). In July 2010, the Veterans Committee name was changed by the Hall of Fame Board of Directors and its name was no longer officially used by the Hall of Fame, which called three new 16-member voting committees by era: the Expansion Era Committee (1973-present), the Golden Era Committee (1947-1972), and the Pre-Integration Era Committee (1876-1946) - each, \\"The Committee\\" (the term \\"Veterans Committee\\" is still being used by some sports media). The three committees met on a rotating cycle once every three years to elect candidates from each era to the Hall of Fame that have been \\"identified\\" by a BBWAA-appointed \\"Screening Committee\\" named the \\"Historical Overview Committee\\" (10-12 representatives; BBWAA members). On May 9, 1949, it was announced that two pitchers had been selected: Mordecai \\"Three Finger\\" Brown, whose career extended from 1903 to 1916, ending with 239 victories and a 2.06 ERA; he had been the main pitching star on the Chicago Cubs teams which dominated the National League between 1906 and 1910, with Brown winning 20 or more games each season as the club won four pennants. His shutout in Game 5 of the 1907 World Series clinched the championship for the Cubs. In twenty-five career matchups against Christy Mathewson, Brown won thirteen times, with Mathewson winning eleven. His partial loss of two fingers in a childhood farm accident had led to his pitches having an atypical motion. Charles \\"Kid\\" Nichols, who won 360 games between 1890 and 1906, primarily with the five-time champion Boston Beaneaters; at age 30, he became the youngest man ever to win 300 games, and he retired with the third-most wins of any pitcher. He won over 20 games every year in the 1890s, and won 30 or more a record seven times. An incredibly strong-armed pitcher despite his small size (5'9\\", 170 pounds (77 kg)), he regularly pitched over 400 innings per year, and completed all but 30 of his 561 career starts - never being replaced by a relief pitcher. Nichols was still living, but Brown had died February 14, 1948. They were formally inducted on June 13 along with Charlie Gehringer and the 1948 selections, Pie Traynor and the late Herb Pennock; Nichols and Traynor were in attendance. The selection of these two pitchers from the period between 1890 and 1916 was roundly applauded, but it was noted that stars of the earlier era had been ignored once again, as well as position players from the same period.","completion":"This text is about the Veterans Committee, which was a voting committee of the U.S. Baseball Hall of Fame that considered the induction of managers, umpires, executives, and long-retired players who were ineligible for consideration by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA).

A:","completion":"Stephen Spender and Mary Stewart, both influential writers in their own rights, focused on different themes in their respective works, but they did so with an intensity and insight that has cemented their place in literary history. Stephen Spender (1909-1995) was a renowned British poet, essayist, and critic who was associated with the so-called \\"Oxford Poets\\" of the 1930s. His work often dealt with themes such as social injustice, political disillusionment, and the experience of the individual in the larger scheme of things. Spender's poetry and essays also frequently touched upon his personal observations and experiences as a homosexual man living in a time when homosexuality was still considered taboo. Some notable works by Spender include \\"The Pylons,\\" \\"The Still Centre,\\" and \\"The Temple.\\" His views on literature and society are well-documented in his numerous critical essays, commentaries, and autobiographical writings. Mary Stewart (1916-2014), on the other hand, was a popular British author known for her romantic mysteries and historical fiction, featuring strong-willed female protagonists faced with complex mysteries and challenges. Stewart's writing often drew inspiration from classical mythology, literature, and history, and incorporated elements of the supernatural, suspense, and romance. The themes she explored in her work were more focused on the inner lives of her characters, their relationships, and their personal growth amidst adversity. Some of Mary Stewart's most celebrated works include \\"The Moon-Spinners,\\" \\"The Crystal Cave,\\" and \\"The Ivy Tree.\\" While it's clear that both Spender and Stewart had their unique take on the human experience, there are some differences in their themes. Spender's work primarily centered around socio-political themes with an emphasis on the individual's place in society, particularly in relation to issues of social injustice and political systems. This is understandable given that Spender came of age during a tumultuous time, witnessing firsthand the World Wars, the Great Depression, and the advent of Communism in Eastern Europe. Mary Stewart, however, wrote primarily about the emotional and psychological journeys her characters went through in their personal lives, usually in the context of mystery, suspense, and romantic elements. Stewart's themes tended to be more focused on individual growth, self-discovery, and the complexity of relationships and human connections. In conclusion, Stephen Spender and Mary Stewart had distinct thematic concerns in their writing, with Spender examining social and political issues, and Stewart concentrating on more personal struggles and emotional experiences. Consequently, their themes diverge significantly, reflecting their unique interests, experiences, and artistic objectives. While their works may not directly align in terms of theme, both writers provide deep insights into the human condition and the different aspects of life that shape our experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: The Mummy 's Shroud is set in 1920 and tells the story of a team of archaeologists who come across the lost tomb of the boy Pharaoh Kah-To-Bey . The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah-To-Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection . Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried . The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb . They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid , a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud . Sir Basil is bitten by a snake just after finding the tomb . He recovers , but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo .

Broadrick and Green reformed Godflesh in 2010. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor.

What is the answer to this question? do you need a permit to buy a gun in va?","completion":"No, you do not need a permit to buy a gun in Virginia; however, there are several regulations and requirements that must be met before you can purchase a firearm. Here is a detailed overview of the process and related laws in the state of Virginia. 1. Background Check: Under federal law, all firearms dealers must perform background checks on individuals looking to purchase a firearm. In Virginia, this is done through the Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP). When you buy a gun from a dealer, they will perform a background check on you through the VFTP to ensure you do not have any outstanding warrants or disqualifying criminal convictions. 2. Age Requirements: In Virginia, the minimum age to purchase a rifle or shotgun is 18, and the minimum age to purchase a handgun is 21. 3. Residency Requirements: To purchase a gun in Virginia, you must be a resident of the state. You will need to provide a valid state-issued identification, such as a driver's license, to prove your residency. 4. Mandatory Waiting Period: There is no mandatory waiting period in Virginia to purchase a firearm; however, the background check process may take several minutes to several hours to complete. 5. Private Sales: When buying a gun from a private seller, Virginia law does not require a background check. However, it prohibits any person from selling a firearm to any individual they know is prohibited from possessing firearms. Also, starting from July 1, 2021, an amendment to the Virginia Code requires that private sales of firearms between individuals who are not licensed dealers must be facilitated by a licensed firearms dealer who will conduct the background check. 6. Concealed Carry Permit: While you don't need a permit to buy a firearm in Virginia, you do need a permit to carry a concealed handgun in the state. To obtain a concealed handgun permit, you must apply through the local circuit court and meet various requirements, including providing proof of firearms training, undergoing a background check, and being at least 21 years old. 7. Gun Restrictions: Virginia has several types of firearms that are prohibited from being purchased, including machine guns, sawed-off shotguns and rifles, silencers, and certain types of ammunition. Furthermore, state law prohibits individuals who have been convicted of certain crimes or have known restraining or protective orders from purchasing or possessing firearms. In summary, while you do not need a permit to buy a gun in Virginia, you must meet several requirements like being a state resident, being of a certain age, and passing a background check. Additionally, you will need a permit if you plan to carry a concealed handgun. Always ensure that you are familiar with both state and federal laws before purchasing a firearm."},{"prompt":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Portuguese.

Choices: - microscope - diameter - focal point - specimen A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"specimen. The numerical aperture (NA) is a critical parameter in microscopy for determining the resolving power of an objective lens. It is a measure of the ability of a lens to collect and focus light rays at a specific point, like a sample or specimen. Essentially, the higher the numerical aperture of a lens, the better its resolution and ability to distinguish fine details in the specimen. However, when comparing the resolutions of different objective lenses using the numerical aperture, it does not directly indicate the working distance, which is how far the lens could be from the specimen. The working distance is essential for various microscopy applications, especially when dealing with live specimens or when using certain techniques that require physical contact with the sample. The working distance is typically inversely proportional to the magnification of the objective lens. Higher magnification lenses usually have a shorter working distance, while lower magnification lenses have a longer working distance. This information is essential because it helps users to determine the appropriate objective lens for their specific microscopy needs, taking into account factors such as the size of the specimen, required magnification, and the necessary distance between the lens and the specimen for sample manipulation or the use of various microscopy techniques. To summarize, while the numerical aperture is vital for comparing the resolutions of various objectives, it does not directly indicate the working distance, which is the distance the lens could be from the specimen. The working distance depends on the objective lens' design, magnification, and specific application requirements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose during hot days happens, how will it affect magma is pushed with pressure to cool. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To address the question and the perturbation hypothesis, let's go through the steps of the process and analyze whether the proposed perturbation - hot days - will have a direct or indirect effect on the process. Step 1: Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - Hot days may affect the surface temperature, but the pressure caused by gases beneath the earth largely depends on the geological and chemical processes occurring deep within the Earth's crust and mantle, which are not significantly influenced by surface temperatures. Thus, there is no direct or significant indirect effect in this step. Step 2: The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - As the process of magma being pushed to the surface is due to pressure from gases beneath the earth, the influence of hot days remains minimal in this step. There is no direct or significant indirect effect in this step. Step 3: The magma cools - Once the magma reaches the surface, it begins to cool and solidify. Hot days could potentially slow down the cooling process slightly, leading to magma taking longer to cool down and harden. This effect, however, is likely to be minor given the difference in temperatures between magma (600-1200°C) and even the hottest days on Earth's surface. Therefore, while there is an indirect effect on the cooling rate of the magma, it is likely to be negligible. Step 4: With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The pressure build-up beneath the earth's surface is mostly influenced by geological processes unrelated to surface temperatures. Therefore, hot days are unlikely to have a direct or significant indirect effect on the pressure build-up. Step 5: The resulting volcano may explode - Volcanic eruptions are primarily triggered by the build-up of internal pressure due to the movement of magma and gases. While hot days might slightly slow down the cooling process of magma, the larger geological forces responsible for volcanic eruptions remain unaffected by surface temperatures. Consequently, the effect of hot days on whether a volcano may explode would be minimal to nonexistent. In conclusion, while the perturbation of hot days might have a minor indirect effect on the cooling of magma, it does not have a significant influence on the overall process leading to the formation or eruption of a volcano. Surface temperature variations have a minimal impact on these deep geological phenomena."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: SHE moved through the crowded streets like she owned the place. Hell, if things went as planned in the coming months, she might in fact own the place. Or some other place if that's what she wanted. If things went as planned, there was no limit to what she could have. She smiled to herself as a crowd of sunburned, middle-aged men broke ranks to let her pass on her way toward Mallory Square. They had no idea who she was, but she liked to think that they could sense her strength and that it intimidated them. Not enough to stop them from staring openly at her chest of course, but what did she expect? They were still men. Duval Street, Key West's main tourist drag, buzzed with early evening activity. The sun had set less than an hour ago, and the throngs moving up from the nightly sunset ritual in Mallory Square now wandered about, trying to choose between the dozens of bars and restaurants vying for their attention. She moved against the general flow and seemed to know exactly where she was going. She knew these streets well and had planned out her route ahead of time. But something bothered her. That nagging feeling in the back of her brain that she'd long ago learned to heed even though it was wrong as often as it was right. You couldn't survive in her world without learning to pay attention to such feelings, and she'd more than survived - she'd prospered beyond the dreams of any young hacker or con artist. Heeding the subliminal warning, she changed plans and stepped out into the crawling Duval Street traffic.

Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored.

The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters. After going around and around for a while with me and the principal, her mother said that her divorce had really affected this girl, and she had been fighting so hard all her life to get into Berkeley, and what did I have against her daughter? She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went.
