It is known that any two rectangles can be intersected by a vertical or horizontal line. We need to prove that it is possible to draw one horizontal and one vertical line such that any rectangle intersects at least one of these two lines. Lemma: Let’s prove the following intermediate result: **Lemma:** If in a family of rectangles, any two can be intersected by a vertical line, all of them can be intersected by a single vertical line. **Proof of Lemma:** 1. Consider the rectangle with the leftmost right boundary and the rectangle with the rightmost left boundary. 2. By the given condition, we can intersect these two rectangles with a vertical line. 3. Therefore, for any remaining rectangle, its left boundary will be to the left of this vertical line, and its right boundary will be to the right of it. 4. Hence, this vertical line will intersect all the rectangles. blacksquare With the lemma proven, let’s proceed to solve the main problem. Main Solution: Assume the contrary to the main problem. We will consider pairs of \\"separated\\" rectangles, meaning rectangles that a vertical line cannot intersect together. **Case 1: No Separated Pairs Exist Below a Certain Line** 1. Choose the lowest horizontal line ( h ) such that it intersects at least one rectangle, separating the remaining rectangles into those above and below ( h ). 2. Assume there are no pairs of separated rectangles below ( h ). 3. If there are no separated pairs of rectangles below ( h ), by our lemma, there exists a vertical line that intersects all rectangles below ( h ). 4. Hence, at least one of the initially considered horizontal and vertical lines will intersect every rectangle, and we are done by contradiction. **Case 2: A Pair of Separated Rectangles Exists Below Line ( h )** 1. Consider a pair of separated rectangles, say ( A ) and ( B ), below ( h ). 2. Since ( A ) and ( B ) are separated by the selection of ( h ), and ( A ) lies above ( h ), ( B ) must lie below ( h ), creating a contradiction. Therefore, in both cases, we reach a contradiction.

Miranda's savings for one week would be: 1000 / 4 weeks = 250/week To find the fraction of her salary that Miranda saves, we divide her weekly savings by her weekly salary: 250/week / 500/week = 1/2 Therefore, Miranda saves boxed{1/2} (or half) of her salary."},{"prompt":"is known that the probabilities of person A and person B hitting the target in each shot are frac{3}{4} and frac{4}{5}, respectively.

If they take turns shooting in the order of A, B, A, B, ..., until one person hits the target and stops shooting, then the probability that A and B have shot a total of four times when stopping shooting is ____.","completion":"To solve this problem, we first identify the sequence of events that lead to stopping after a total of four shots. Since they take turns shooting, the sequence must be: A misses, B misses, A misses again, and finally, B hits the target on their second shot. Let's denote the event of person A hitting the target as A and the event of person B hitting the target as B. The complementary events, where A or B misses, are denoted as overline{A} and overline{B}, respectively. Given that the probability of A hitting the target is frac{3}{4}, the probability of A missing the target is 1 - frac{3}{4} = frac{1}{4}. Similarly, since the probability of B hitting the target is frac{4}{5}, the probability of B missing the target is 1 - frac{4}{5} = frac{1}{5}. The sequence of events for stopping after four shots is overline{A}overline{B}overline{A}B. We calculate the probability of this sequence happening as follows: [ P(overline{A}overline{B}overline{A}B) = P(overline{A}) times P(overline{B}) times P(overline{A}) times P(B) ] Substituting the probabilities of missing and hitting for A and B: [ P(overline{A}overline{B}overline{A}B) = left(1-frac{3}{4}right) times left(1-frac{4}{5}right) times left(1-frac{3}{4}right) times frac{4}{5} ] Simplifying the expression: [ P(overline{A}overline{B}overline{A}B) = frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{5} times frac{1}{4} times frac{4}{5} = frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{5} times frac{1}{4} times frac{4}{5} = frac{1}{100} ] Therefore, the probability that A and B have shot a total of four times when stopping shooting is frac{1}{100}.

After distributing the initial 400 boxes, an anonymous donor gives the organization 4 times the amount of money they had already spent. However, the donation is in euros and needs to be converted to dollars at a 1.2 conversion rate. Taking into account fluctuating exchange rates, shipping costs, and the bulk discount, how many boxes do they pack in total?","completion":"First, let's calculate the cost of the initial 400 boxes without the discount: Each box contains: - 80 worth of food - 165 worth of additional supplies - 7 shipping cost The total cost for one box is 80 + 165 + 7 = 252. Since they are distributing 400 boxes, the total cost without the discount is 400 * 252 = 100,800. Now, let's calculate the discount they receive for the additional supplies when they purchase for more than 200 boxes: The cost of additional supplies for one box is 165. For 400 boxes, it would be 400 * 165 = 66,000. The discount is 10%, so the discount amount is 10/100 * 66,000 = 6,600. The discounted cost for the additional supplies is 66,000 - 6,600 = 59,400. Now, let's calculate the total cost with the discount: The cost of food for 400 boxes is 400 * 80 = 32,000. The cost of shipping for 400 boxes is 400 * 7 = 2,800. The total cost with the discount is 32,000 (food) + 59,400 (discounted additional supplies) + 2,800 (shipping) = 94,200. After distributing the initial 400 boxes, the organization receives a donation of 4 times what they spent, which is 4 * 94,200 = 376,800. The donation is in euros, so we need to convert it to dollars. The conversion rate is 1.2 dollars for 1 euro, so the donation in dollars is 376,800 * 1.2 = 452,160. Now, let's calculate how many additional boxes they can pack with the donation: Since they now have a large amount of money, they will continue to receive the 10% discount on additional supplies. Therefore, the cost per box remains the same as after the discount, which is 252 - 16.5 (discount per box on additional supplies) = 235.5 per box. The number of additional boxes they can pack with the donation is 452,160 / 235.5 ≈ 1919 boxes.

The total intensity of the new mixture can be calculated by taking the weighted average of the intensities of the remaining original paint and the added solution. The new mixture has an intensity of 40%. So, the equation representing the mixture is: ( 0.75 times 45% + 0.25 times I = 40% ) Now, we can solve for ( I ): ( 33.75% + 0.25I = 40% ) Subtract 33.75% from both sides: ( 0.25I = 40% - 33.75% ) ( 0.25I = 6.25% ) Now, divide both sides by 0.25 to find ( I ): ( I = frac{6.25%}{0.25} ) ( I = 25% ) So, the intensity of the solution of red paint that was added is boxed{25%} ."},{"prompt":"Find the constant b such that left(3x^2 4x + frac{5}{2}right)(2x^2 + bx + c) = 6x^4 11x^3 + 13x^2 frac{15}{2}x + frac{10}{2}","completion":"To find b, we focus on the coefficient of the x^3 term.

Since there are 12 squares surrounding the central square, each quadrant will contain 3 squares. 3. **Color Distribution**: Given that there are 8 red squares and 5 blue squares, and each quadrant must look the same, we distribute the colors in each quadrant. If each quadrant had only red squares, we would need 12 red squares, which is not possible since we only have 8.

This implies that (m = 1) or ((a+d, b-c) = 1). 1. **Case 1: If (m = 1):** We can then write: [ (a+d, b-c) = ab + cd > ab + cd - (a - b + c + d) ] Simplifying this expression: [ = (a+d)(c-1) + (b-c)(a+1) ] However, ((a+d)(c-1) + (b-c)(a+1) geq (a+d, b-c)) is a contradiction because the right-hand side should equal the left-hand side or be less. 2. **Case 2: If ((a+d, b-c) = 1):** From the given condition: [ ac + bd = (b+d + a - c)(b+d - a + c) ] We can derive: [ ac + bd = (a+d)b - (b - c)a ] Given the conditions: [ ac + bd = (a+d)(b-d+a-c) ] We can re-formulate the terms as: [ (a+d)b - (b-c)a = (a+d)(b+d-a+c)+(b-c){b+d-a+c} ] Therefore: [ (a+d)(a-c-d) = (b-c)(b+d+c) ] Since (a > b > c > d), we have: (a-c-d > 0), which means there exists (k in mathbb{N}^ast) such that: [ a - c - d = k(b - c) quadtext{and}quad b + c + d = k(a + d) ] Adding these equations, we get: [ a + b = k(a + b - c + d) ] Simplifying further: [ k(c - d) = (k - 1)(a + b) ] If (k = 1), then (c = d), which is a contradiction. If (k > 1), then: [ 2 geq frac{k}{k-1} = frac{a + b}{c - d} > 2, ] This is also contradicting. Therefore, we conclude that (ab + cd) must be a composite number. Proof 2: Given: [ ac + bd = (b+d)^2 - (a-c)^2 ] which simplifies to: [ ac + bd = b^2 + d^2 - (a^2 + c^2) + 2(ac + bd) ] Now we compare: [ a^2 - ac + c^2 = b^2 + bd + d^2 ] We denote this as: [ (ac + bd)x = ac(b^2 + bd + d^2) + bd(a^2 - ac + c^2) ] [ = (ab + cd)(ad + bc) ] If (ab + cd) is a prime number, then: [ ab + cd - (ac + bd) = (a - d)(b - c) > 0, ] Therefore (ac + bd) and (ab + cd) must be coprime. Next, we see that: [ ab + cd mid b^2 + bd + d^2 ] Evaluating: [ 2(ab + cd) - (b^2 + bd + d^2) = b(a - b) + b(a - d) + d(2c - d) > 0, ] Therefore: [ b^2 + bd + d^2 = ab + cd, ] Substituting, we get: [ ac + bd = ad + bc, ] which implies: [ (a - b)(c - d) = 0, ] This is contradictory as (a > b) and (c > d). Therefore, ( boxed{ab + cd} ) is not a prime number since our initial assumption leads to a contradiction.

Since the sum of the first n terms is given by S_n = frac {n(a_1 + a_n)}{2} and is known to be 100, we can set up the equation: frac {n(a_1 + a_n)}{2} = 100.

This happens in (6) of the (18) sequences (since there are (3) choices for (E_1) and (2) choices for (O_1) that lead to an illegal move). Thus, the number of valid sequences is (18 - 6 = 12).

For x < e, both terms (x-pi) and (x-e) are negative, so their product is positive. 2. For e < x < pi, (x-pi) is negative and (x-e) is positive, making their product negative. 3.

Therefore, the smaller octagon is a scaled-down version of the larger octagon. 2. Since all sides of the smaller octagon are parallel and half the length of the corresponding sides of the larger octagon, the smaller octagon is a homothety of the larger one with a center at O and a ratio of \`1/2\`. 3.

If both players adopt the correct strategy, who will win?","completion":"To determine who will win when both players use optimal strategies, let's perform a detailed analysis. Here are the steps: 1. Define the value function v(n) as the highest power of 2 that divides n, i.e., [ v(n) = max { k mid 2^k text{ divides } n }. ] This function essentially measures the largest power of 2 that is a factor of n. 2. Initially, we have two piles of matches with counts n = 100 and m = 252. Calculate v(n) and v(m): - For n = 100: The binary representation is (100_{10} = 1100100_2). The largest power of 2 dividing 100 is (2^2 = 4), so v(100) = 2. - For m = 252: The binary representation is (252_{10} = 11111100_2). The largest power of 2 dividing 252 is (2^2 = 4), so v(252) = 2. Hence, we have v(100) = v(252) = 2. 3. If at any point v(n) = v(m), any move made by the first player will break this equality. Let's see why: - Suppose the first player takes r matches from the pile with count n such that r is a divisor of 252. - Because r must be a power of 2 divisor, v(r) le v(252) = 2. - If v(r) < v(n), then (v(n - r) = v(n)) (because subtraction might not change the power of 2 if r is small enough). - If v(r) = v(n), let’s write n = 2^k cdot n_1 and r = 2^k cdot r_1 where both n_1 and r_1 are odd (hence not divisible by 2). [ n - r = 2^k (n_1 - r_1). ] Since both n_1 and r_1 are odd, their difference n_1 - r_1 is even, meaning 2^{k+1} divides n - r, and therefore: [ v(n - r) ge k + 1 = v(n) + 1. ] 4. Because taking some r such that v(r) = v(n) makes v(n-r) ge v(n) + 1, this will break the balance v(n) = v(m). 5. Therefore, after the first player makes the first move, the second player can always respond, ensuring that v(n) = v(m) after the second player's turn. - As long as the second player maintains this balance after each of their turns, they can ensure that they eventually make the last move. Each move that the second player can make will force the first player into a suboptimal position where v(n) neq v(m), unless they can adjust back to equality with the second player’s optimal move. Conclusion: Given that v(100) = v(252) = 2 initially, the second player can always enforce keeping the value function v() equal for both piles after their turn, resulting in them winning by taking the last match. Hence, the second player will win, and therefore, [ boxed{text{The second player wins}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given two vectors in the plane, overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}, satisfying overrightarrow{a} cdot (overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}) = 3, and |overrightarrow{a}| = 2, |overrightarrow{b}| = 1, then the sine of the angle between vector overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is ( ) A: dfrac{1}{2} B: dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2} C: dfrac{1}{2} D: dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}","completion":"Given overrightarrow{a} cdot (overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}) = 3, and |overrightarrow{a}| = 2, |overrightarrow{b}| = 1, therefore overrightarrow{a}^2 + overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 3, therefore overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = -1, Let the angle between vector overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} be theta, because The range of the angle theta between two vectors is theta in [0,pi], therefore cos theta = dfrac{overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{a}||overrightarrow{b}|} = - dfrac{1}{2}, therefore sin theta = sqrt{1-cos^2 theta} = dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}, Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}.

Assume the sales revenue of the high-tech product C this year should increase by x percent compared to last year. Based on the condition that this year's total sales revenue equals last year's, we have the equation 0.4(1+x) + (1-40%)(1-20%) = 1. We solve this equation to find the solution. Let's solve the equation step by step: 1. First, simplify the equation: 0.4(1+x) + 0.6 times 0.8 = 1. 2. Simplify further: 0.4(1+x) + 0.48 = 1. 3. Subtract 0.48 from both sides: 0.4(1+x) = 0.52. 4.

The operation allowed is to take several containers from the top of one stack and place them on another stack. Step-by-step solution: 1. **Initialization:** Assume there are initially two stacks, Stack A and Stack B. The goal is to ultimately have all containers in one stack (say Stack A) in the correct order with container number 1 at the bottom, followed by 2, 3, ldots, n. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** Suppose, after a series of operations, the first k containers (1, 2, ldots, k) are correctly placed in Stack A, and the remaining containers are in Stack B or on top of correctly placed containers in Stack A. 3. **Inductive Step:** To move from k correctly placed containers to k+1 correctly placed containers: - Take all containers above k+1 from Stack B and place them temporarily on Stack A. (This requires one operation.) - Place container k+1 on top of the first k containers in Stack A by taking it from Stack B. (This may involve first moving some top containers from Stack B to Stack A, then placing k+1, and then moving those containers back, ensuring k+1 ends up on top of 1, 2, ldots, k. This can require moving both stacks back and forth but keeps following the \\"one operation\\" rule described in each scenario.) - Finally, move all containers above k+1 from Stack A back to Stack B to maintain the induction step. (This requires another operation.) Thus, moving from k to k+1 correctly placed containers requires up to 2 operations. 4. **Termination:** When k = n, all n containers are correctly placed in Stack A. The exact number of operations total will be the sum of operations needed for each step from k to k+1. Notably, for: k = 0 k rightarrow 1 : 2 cdot 1 - 1 = 1 1 rightarrow 2 : 2 cdot 2 - 1 = 3 2 rightarrow 3 : 2 cdot 3 - 1 = 5 vdots k rightarrow k+1 : 2 cdot (k+1) - 1 We systematically verify the step-wise increment to make sure we stay within the allowable 2n - 1 operations. Conclusion: It's evident through induction and careful placement operations that 2n - 1 operations suffice to arrange the n containers, ( therefore ) we can organize all containers in the desired order using the described method.

Pipe B fills the cistern in 15 hours, so its rate is C/15 per hour. Pipe C fills the cistern in 20 hours, so its rate is C/20 per hour.

Now, we solve for ( E ): ( -4E = -1,020 - 10,500 ), ( -4E = -11,520 ), ( E = frac{-11,520}{-4} ), ( E = 2,880 ) elephants per hour.

The solution requires knowledge of two angles. Which ones?","completion":"To determine the length of the shortest day in Wrocław, we'll calculate the time between sunrise and sunset on the winter solstice when the Sun is at the Tropic of Capricorn. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem: 1. **Identify Given Values and Definitions:** - Geographic latitude of Wrocław: (varphi = 51^circ 07') - Angle between the plane of the Earth's equator and the plane of the ecliptic (Earth's axial tilt): (delta = 23^circ 27') - The shortest day occurs when the Sun is at the Tropic of Capricorn, around December 23rd. 2. **Understand the Geometry:** [ cos beta = frac{O_1 P}{O_1 W} = tan varphi cdot tan delta ] This comes from the relationship within the right triangles formed by the Earth's rotation and ecliptic plane. 3. **Calculating (beta):** - Substitute (varphi = 51^circ 07') and (delta = 23^circ 27'): [ cos beta = tan(51^circ 07') cdot tan(23^circ 27') ] - Calculate the tangents: [ tan(51^circ 07') approx 1.2527 quad text{and} quad tan(23^circ 27') approx 0.4339 ] - Substitute these values into the equation: [ cos beta = 1.2527 cdot 0.4339 approx 0.5438 ] - Find (beta) from (cos^{-1}(0.5438)): [ beta approx 57^circ 27' 35'' ] 4. **Calculating Day Length:** - The day length is proportional to the angle (2beta) related to (180^circ): [ t : 24, text{hours} = 2beta : 180^circ ] - Since (beta approx 57^circ 27' 35''): [ 2beta approx 2 times 57^circ 27' 35'' = 114^circ 55' 10'' ] - Use the proportion: [ frac{t}{24} = frac{114^circ 55' 10''}{180^circ} ] [ t = 24 times frac{114^circ 55' 10''}{180^circ} ] Simplify: [ t approx 24 times frac{114.9194}{180} approx 15.189 text{ hours} ] Therefore, the duration of the shortest day in Wrocław is approximately: [ t approx 15.189 text{ hours} = 7 text{ hours } 11 text{ minutes } ] 5. **Conclusion:** - Answer: [ boxed{7 text{ hours } 39 text{ minutes } 40 text{ seconds }} ] - Note: The calculated value needs to be reduced by approximately 15 minutes due to astronomical refraction effects.

Prove that their centers are the midpoints of the sides of triangle (ABC).","completion":"Given: triangle ABC with squares constructed externally on its sides and centers P, Q, R. Additional squares are constructed internally on the sides of triangle PQR. 1. Let P, Q, and R be the centers of the externally constructed squares on the sides AB, BC, and CA respectively. 2. Consider the composition of two 90^circ rotations. First, we rotate triangle ABC 90^circ clockwise around point R such that C maps to A. Recall that the center of a square is equidistant from its sides, and thus R is uniquely the center of the square on CA. 3. Next, consider rotating 90^circ clockwise around P, which takes point A to B. This is possible because P is the center of the square on AB. 4. The composition of these two rotations results in a 180^circ rotation around their midpoint. The midpoint of P and R is the center of the corresponding square's side PR internally constructed in triangle PQR. 5. Observing that the result of these two rotations is a 180^circ rotation, we know that this midpoint must also be the midpoint of side BC. \`\`\` Let M be the midpoint of BC. Consider triangle MBC, where the center of the rotation (in triangle PQR) is also Q, the center of the square on side BC. \`\`\` 6. Therefore, another similar rotation (or composition of too 90^circ rotations) reveals that the midpoint of P Q aligns again conducts a 180^circ rotation. 7. Further, by symmetry, all centers of the squares constructed internally on the sides of triangle PQR happen to fall precisely at midpoints of triangle ABC sides. # Conclusion: Thus, we've demonstrated: - Centers of inner squares align as midpoints of corresponding triangle ABC sides formed through rotations and alignment. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Find the value of tan left( frac{13}{4} pi right)=(quad), where the options are: A: 1 B: 1 C: frac{sqrt{3}}{3} D: frac{sqrt{3}}{3}","completion":"To solve this problem, we will use the trigonometric identity tan(x + pi) = tan(x). 1.

This relates to segment partition by bisector. - If ( varphi ) and ( psi ) are both greater than (45^circ) and less than (135^circ), adjust accordingly that (P) lies on the angle bisector. 7. Special Cases: - ( varphi = psi ): This implies the triangle is isosceles. - ( varphi ) or ( psi > 135^circ ): There are no solutions. Conclusion: The triangle scenario provided: 1.

From the problem, we have two scenarios that give us two equations: 1. Buying 2 pairs of type A skis and 1 pair of type B skis costs a total of 340 yuan, which gives us the equation: 2x + y = 340. 2. Buying 3 pairs of type A skis and 2 pairs of type B skis costs a total of 570 yuan, which gives us the equation: 3x + 2y = 570. So, we have the system of equations: [ left{begin{array}{l} 2x + y = 340 3x + 2y = 570 end{array}right. ] To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination.

Lemma: Consider a polynomial ( c_{n} x^{n} + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + c_1 x + c_0 ) in ( mathbb{Z}[x] ) such that ( p nmid c_n ) and ( p mid c_t ) for ( 0 leq t leq n-1 ).

Proof of Lemma: Given the polynomial ( sum_{i=0}^{n} c_i x^i ) satisfies ( p nmid c_n ) and ( p mid c_t ) for ( 0 leq t leq n-1 ), suppose it factors as [ f(x) = g(x) h(x) = (a_r x^r + cdots + a_1 x + a_0)(b_s x^s + cdots + b_1 x + b_0). ] It follows: [ c_n x^n = a_r b_s x^{r+s}. ] Since ( p nmid c_n ) and ( c_n = a_r b_s ), it implies neither ( a_r ) nor ( b_s ) is divisible by ( p ). Define ( k ) as the smallest index such that ( a_k ne 0 ) and ( l ) as the smallest index such that ( b_l ne 0 ). Now consider the coefficient of ( x^{k+l} ): [ c_{k+l} = a_{k} b_{l} + sum_{i+j=k+l, (i,j) neq (k,l)} a_i b_j. ] Since ( p mid c_{k+l} ) and for ( (i, j) neq (k, l) ), either ( i < k ) or ( j < l ), and given ( p mid a_i ) and ( p mid b_j ) in these cases, then ( p mid sum_{i+j=k+l, (i,j) neq (k,l)} a_i b_j ). Thus, ( p mid a_k b_l ). Since neither ( a_k ) nor ( b_l ) is divisible by ( p ), this is a contradiction unless ( k+l = n ).

Considering ( x equiv sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x^i equiv 0 mod p^2 ): [ a_0 b_1 + a_1 b_0 = 0. ] Hence, [ p(a_0 b_1 + a_1 b_0) equiv 0 mod p^2, ] contradicting the lemma.

Therefore: [ P = x cdot (+1) + y cdot (+1) + (2002 - x - y) cdot (-1) ] Simplifying, we get: [ P = x + y - (2002 - x - y) = x + y - 2002 ] 5. Since ( x + y = 2002 ), we substitute: [ P = 2002 - 2002 = 0 ] This contradicts the given condition that ( P < 0 ). Therefore, our assumption must be incorrect. 6. Reconsider the problem. The correct approach is to count the number of ( +1 ) and ( -1 ) pairs. Let ( a ) be the number of pairs ( (+1, +1) ) and ( b ) be the number of pairs ( (-1, -1) ). Then: [ P = a + b - (2002 - a - b) ] Simplifying, we get: [ P = 2(a + b) - 2002 ] 7. Given ( P < 0 ), we have: [ 2(a + b) - 2002 < 0 implies a + b < 1001 ] 8. Since ( a + b ) is the number of pairs of the same sign, the number of pairs of different signs is ( 2002 - (a + b) ). Therefore, the number of ( +1 )'s and ( -1 )'s must be balanced such that: [ x approx y ] 9. Let ( S ) be the sum of the original numbers: [ S = x - y ] Since ( x + y = 2002 ) and ( x approx y ), we have: [ |S| = |x - y| leq 1000 ] The final answer is ( boxed{ |S| leq 1000 } )"},{"prompt":"Joan has 72 blue and 48 red balloons.

Show that the area of the intersection region is maximal when the line (PQ) is parallel to both bases of the trapezoid: # Detailed Steps: 1. **Identifying the dividing ratio:** Let (M) be the point on (BC) such that: [ BM : MC = AK : KD ] Since (AK) and (KD) are segments on base (AD), (M) precisely divides (BC) similarly to how point (K) divides (AD). 2. **Label the intersection points:** - Let (P) be the intersection of (AM) and (BK). - Let (Q) be the intersection of (DM) and (CK). Since (AK : KD = BM : MC) and (BK : KC = AP : PB), the lines (PQ) are parallel to the bases (AD) and (BC). 3. **Consider another point (M_1) on (BC):** Assume (M_1) is any point on the segment (BC) other than (M). - Let the intersection of (AM_1) and (BK) be (P_1). - Let the intersection of (DM_1) and (CK) be (Q_1). - Let the intersections of (AM_1) and (PQ), and (DM_1) and (PQ) be denoted as (P_2) and (Q_2) respectively. - Let the intersection of (AM) and (DM_1) be (O). 4. **Comparing Areas:** We need to show that: [ S_{MPKQ} > S_{M_1 P_1 K Q_1} ] or equivalently, [ S_{MOQ_1Q} > S_{M_1 O PP_1} ] 5. **Area Analysis:** As point (M) is such that (PQ) is parallel to the bases, the area formed by (MOQ_1Q) must be greater than the area formed by (M_1OQ_2Q) and thus greater than (M_1OPP_1). Since the area of (MPKQ) is indeed maximized when (M) is chosen to divide (BC) in the ratio (AK:KD). This completes the proof that: [ boxed{M} ] is the point on (BC) which maximizes the area of the common parts of triangles (AMD) and (BKC)."},{"prompt":"Given polynomials ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ), it is known that for some polynomial ( R(x, y) ), the equation [ P(x) P(y) = R(x cdot y)(Q(x) Q(y)) ] holds. Prove that there exists a polynomial ( S(x) ) such that ( P(x) = S(Q(x)) ).","completion":"1. **Assumption and Initial Definitions**: Assume that there exist polynomials (P(x)) and (Q(x)) such that the equation is given by: [ P(x) - P(y) = R(x, y) (Q(x) - Q(y)) ] We need to prove that there exists a polynomial (S(x)) such that (P(x) = S(Q(x))). 2. **Degree Analysis**: Let (n) be the degree of (P(x)) and (k) be the degree of (Q(x)). Since multiplying a polynomial by a non-zero constant does not affect the degree, assume the leading coefficients of (P(x)) and (Q(x)) are 1. We are given that (n > 0). We aim to show by contradiction that (S(x)) exists. 3. **Using the Leading Terms**: Consider the polynomial (T(x, y) = P(x) - P(y)). The leading term of (T(x, y)) is (overline{T}(x, y) = x^n - y^n). Expressing our condition in terms of leading terms, we have: [ x^n - y^n = overline{P(x) - P(y)} = overline{R(x, y)} cdot overline{Q(x) - Q(y)} ] Given that (overline{Q(x) - Q(y)} = x^k - y^k), we have: [ x^n - y^n = overline{R(x, y)}(x^k - y^k) ] This means (x^n - y^n) must be divisible by (x^k - y^k). 4. **Polynomial Divisibility**: Suppose (n = qk + r) (Euclidean division where (0 leq r < k)). Then: [ x^n - y^n = x^r left( x^{qk} - y^{qk} right) + y^{qk} left( x^r - y^r right) ] Now, since (x^{qk} - y^{qk}) can be factored as: [ x^{qk} - y^{qk} = (x^k - y^k) (x^{k(q-1)} + x^{k(q-2)}y^{k} + cdots + y^{k(q-1)}) ] and therefore: [ x^n - y^n = x^r (x^k - y^k)(x^{k(q-1)} + cdots + y^{k(q-1)}) + y^{qk}(x^r - y^r) ] For (x^n - y^n) to be divisible by (x^k - y^k), the term (y^{qk} (x^r - y^r)) must also be divisible by (x^k - y^k). Given that (0 leq r < k), this is only possible if (r = 0). Thus, (n) must be a multiple of (k). 5. **Conclusion of Degree Analysis**: Since (n = qk), reorganize (P(x)) and consider the polynomial (P_1(x) = P(x) - Q^{frac{n}{k}}(x)): [ P_1(x) = P(x) - Q^{frac{n}{k}}(x) ] The degree of (P_1(x)) is less than the degree of (P(x)). Note that: [ P_1(x)-P_1(y) = (R(x, y) - (sum_{i=0}^{frac{n}{k} - 1}Q^{i}(x)Q^{frac{n}{k} - 1 - i}(y)))(Q(x) - Q(y)) ] where (P(x) - Q^{frac{n}{k}}(x)) affects only the terms without altering the division condition. 6. **Inductive Argument**: By induction, there exists a polynomial (S_1(x)) such that (P_1(x) = S_1(Q(x))). Finally, let: [ S(x) = S_1(x) + x^{frac{n}{k}} ] Therefore: [ P(x) = P_1(x) + Q^{frac{n}{k}}(x) = S_1(Q(x)) + Q^{frac{n}{k}}(x) = S(Q(x)) ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{P(x) = S(Q(x))} ]"},{"prompt":"Mitzi brought 75 to the amusement park.

Every natural number can be written as the sum of two terms (not necessarily distinct) from the sequence. 2. For each positive integer ( n ), ( a_n > frac{n^2}{16} ). we define the sequence ( left(a_nright) ) to be all natural numbers ( k ) whose binary representation contains ones only in either all even positions or all odd positions. Condition i): This construction ensures that each natural number can be expressed as the sum of two terms from the sequence ( left(a_nright) ). To understand why, observe that binary numbers with ones restricted to either all even positions or all odd positions form a complete set of sums when combined. Condition ii): Now we verify that ( a_n > frac{n^2}{16} ). 1. Take integers that are smaller than ( 2^{2r} ), meaning they have at most ( 2r ) binary digits. 2. There are ( 2^r ) elements with zeros in all even positions and ( 2^r ) elements with zeros in all odd positions. However, ( 0 ) is counted twice, so the total number of unique elements is: [ 2^r + 2^r - 1 = 2^{r+1} - 1 ] 3. Thus, the ((2^{r+1} - 1))-th element in the sequence is: [ a_{2^{r+1}-1} = 2^{2r} ] 4.

This line is denoted as e. 4. **Properties of Triangle Similarity:** Since OH parallel AB and OH = frac{1}{2} AB, the triangle DOH is similar to the triangle DBA with a similarity ratio of frac{1}{2}. By the properties of similar triangles, the area of triangle DOH is: [ T_{DOH} = frac{1}{2^2} T_{DBA} = frac{1}{4} T_{DBA} ] Similarly, we have: [ T_{DOG} = frac{1}{4} T_{DBC} ] 5. **Quadrilateral Area Analysis:** Therefore, the area of quadrilateral N_1 = HOGD is: [ text{Area of } N_1 = T_{DOH} + T_{DOG} = frac{1}{4} T_{DBA} + frac{1}{4} T_{DBC} ] Since T_{DBA} + T_{DBC} = T_{ABCD} (total area of the quadrilateral), we have: [ text{Area of } N_1 = frac{1}{4} T_{ABCD} ] Similarly, for the segment N_2 = EOFB: [ text{Area of } N_2 = frac{1}{4} T_{ABCD} ] 6. **Parallel Line Movement:** As point O moves along the line e, the lines remain parallel to HG and EF, ensuring that the areas of triangles HOG and EOF remain constant. Therefore, the areas of HOGD and EOFB also remain constant, i.e., one fourth of the total quadrilateral area. 7. **Intersection of Two Parallels:** Repeat this process with the other diagonal of the quadrilateral to get another parallel line denoted by f. The intersection of these two lines e and f gives point P. 8. **Determination of Point P:** The point P will always be inside the quadrilateral as it is also the intersection of the diagonals of the parallelogram formed by extending the sides of the quadrilateral and drawing lines parallel to each other. 9. **Uniqueness of Point P:** If hypothetically there were two such points P and P_1, one of them, say P_1, would lie inside one of the regions created by the other point P. Thus, P_1 must have an area smaller than frac{1}{4} T_{ABCD} for one of the segments it divides, contradicting the requirement. 10. **Conclusion:** The only solution that divides the quadrilateral into four equal areas using the midpoints of the sides is the unique point P obtained by the intersection of lines e and f, ensuring every region has exactly a quarter of the total area of quadrilateral ABCD.

He runs at a certain rate and swims at a rate of 6 miles per hour. His average rate for the entire trip is 0.125 miles per minute. What is his running speed in miles per hour?","completion":"First, let's convert the average rate for the entire trip from miles per minute to miles per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the rate by 60: 0.125 miles/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 7.5 miles/hour This is Dan's average speed for the entire trip, which includes both running and swimming. Let's denote Dan's running speed as R (in miles per hour). We know that he swims at a rate of 6 miles per hour. The total distance for the trip is 4 miles running and 4 miles swimming, which is 8 miles. The time it takes Dan to run 4 miles is 4/R hours, and the time it takes him to swim 4 miles is 4/6 hours. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. We can set up the equation as follows: Average speed = Total distance / Total time 7.5 = 8 / (4/R + 4/6) Now we solve for R: 7.5 = 8 / (4/R + 2/3) Multiply both sides by (4/R + 2/3) to get rid of the denominator: 7.5 * (4/R + 2/3) = 8 Now distribute 7.5: 30/R + 5 = 8 Subtract 5 from both sides: 30/R = 3 Now multiply both sides by R to solve for R: 30 = 3R Divide both sides by 3: R = 10 So, Dan's running speed is boxed{10} miles per hour."},{"prompt":"The Razorback tshirt shop makes 78 off each tshirt sold at full price.

It is also given that point D lies on segment BC. Let us consider the triangles triangle ABD and triangle ACD. 3. For triangle ABD: - Since O_1 is the circumcenter of triangle ABD, it follows that angle BO_1D = 2 times angle BAC = 2 times 60^circ = 120^circ. - Likewise, I_1 is the incenter of triangle ABD, therefore angle BI_1C = 60^circ + 60^circ = 120^circ. 4. For triangle ACD: - Since O_2 is the circumcenter of triangle ACD, it follows that angle DO_2C = 2 times angle CAB = 2 times 60^circ = 120^circ. - Likewise, I_2 is the incenter of triangle ACD, therefore angle DI_2C = 120^circ. 5. From these observations, we can assert that: [ angle BO_1D = angle BI_1C = angle DO_2C = angle DI_2C = 120^circ. ] 6. Since the angles angle BO_1D and angle DO_2C indicate that points A, O_1, I_1, D, C lie on a common circle (cyclic points). Similarly, points A, O_2, I_2, D, B lie on another common circle (cyclic points). These two circles intersect at points A and D. 7. By the property of intersecting circles, we know that angle O_1DA = angle O_2DA. Hence, let's consider the angles subtended at D: [ angle O_1 DO_2 = angle BAC = 60^circ. ] 8. Since A lies on both circles, AD bisects angle O_1 DO_2. Therefore, we have: [ angle ADO_1 = angle ADO_2 = 30^circ. ] 9. With these angles, we know that angle AI_2O_2 = angle ADO_2 = 30^circ and similarly angle I_1AI_2 = 30^circ. This shows us that AI_1 is parallel to O_2P and AI_2 is parallel to O_1P. 10. Consequently, this implies: [ angle O_1PO_2 = 30^circ. ] 11. Finally, since all these angles and lines are established, we conclude that point D is the circumcenter of triangle O_1O_2P.

According to the information given, E = U. We are also told that all 150 visitors who did not enjoy the painting also did not feel they had understood the painting. This means that these 150 visitors are not included in E or U. Since the total number of visitors who answered the questionnaire is 600, the number of visitors who either enjoyed the painting or felt they had understood the painting (or both) is 600 - 150 = 450.

Hence, [ frac{1}{n} sum_{i=0}^{n-1} |p(z^i)|^2 = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=0}^{n-1} p(z^i) overline{p(z^i)} = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=0}^{n-1} p(z^i) p(z^{-i}), ] so it suffices to prove that the right-hand side (RHS) is equal to ( S(p) ). 3.

The first term simplifies to [ sum_{j=0}^{k} a_j^2. ] 7. For the second term, since ( z ) is a primitive ( n )-th root of unity, the sum ( sum_{i=0}^{n-1} z^{i(j-m)} ) is zero for ( j neq m ).

To find the share of the third person, we need to find the ratio of the third person's investment to the total investment and then apply that ratio to the total profit. The ratio of the third person's investment to the total investment is: Third person's share ratio = Third person's investment / Total investment Third person's share ratio = Rs. 8000 / Rs. 65000 Now, we apply this ratio to the total profit to find the third person's share of the profit: Third person's profit share = Total profit * Third person's share ratio Third person's profit share = Rs. 25000 * (Rs. 8000 / Rs. 65000) Let's calculate that: Third person's profit share = Rs. 25000 * (8 / 65) Third person's profit share = Rs. 25000 * 0.12307692 (approximately) Third person's profit share = Rs. 3076.92 (approximately) So, the third person will get approximately Rs. boxed{3076.92} as their share of the profit."},{"prompt":"A grid table with a width of 300 cells and a height of 50 cells is given.

The distance they walk to reach the bus stand is 5 km. What is their initial walking speed?","completion":"Let's denote the initial walking speed as ( v ) km/h. We know that when the person walks at 5 km/h, they reach the bus stand 5 minutes early. This means that if the bus takes ( t ) minutes to reach the bus stand from the time the person starts walking, the person takes ( t - 5 ) minutes to walk the 5 km at 5 km/h. Now, when the person walks at the initial speed ( v ), they miss the bus by 10 minutes. This means they take ( t + 10 ) minutes to walk the same 5 km. First, let's convert the time from minutes to hours since the speed is given in km/h. We know that 1 hour = 60 minutes. For the 5 km/h speed: ( t - 5 ) minutes = ( frac{t - 5}{60} ) hours The distance (5 km) is equal to speed (5 km/h) multiplied by time (( frac{t - 5}{60} ) hours), so we have: [ 5 = 5 times frac{t - 5}{60} ] [ 5 = frac{5t - 25}{60} ] [ 300 = 5t - 25 ] [ 5t = 325 ] [ t = 65 ] minutes Now, for the initial speed ( v ): ( t + 10 ) minutes = ( frac{t + 10}{60} ) hours The distance (5 km) is equal to speed (( v ) km/h) multiplied by time (( frac{t + 10}{60} ) hours), so we have: [ 5 = v times frac{t + 10}{60} ] [ 5 = v times frac{65 + 10}{60} ] [ 5 = v times frac{75}{60} ] [ 5 = v times frac{5}{4} ] [ v = 5 times frac{4}{5} ] [ v = 4 ] km/h So, the initial walking speed of the person is boxed{4} km/h."},{"prompt":"Given that the terminal side of angle alpha passes through point P(m, 4), and cosalpha = frac{3}{5}, then m equals ( ) A: frac{9}{2} B: 3 C: frac{9}{2} D: 3","completion":"Since cosalpha = -frac{3}{5} < 0, it follows that alpha is an angle in either the second or third quadrant.

The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is: C6H6 + CH4 → C7H8 + H2 From the equation, we can see that 1 mole of benzene reacts with 1 mole of methane to produce 1 mole of toluene and 1 mole of hydrogen. Given that 2 moles of methane are reacting, we would need 2 moles of benzene to react with them to form 2 moles of toluene and 2 moles of hydrogen, according to the stoichiometry of the reaction. However, you mentioned that the total amount of benzene required is 156. I assume you mean 156 grams of benzene. To find out how many moles of benzene this corresponds to, we need to use the molar mass of benzene, which is approximately 78.11 g/mol. Moles of benzene = mass of benzene / molar mass of benzene Moles of benzene = 156 g / 78.11 g/mol Moles of benzene ≈ 2 moles So, 156 grams of benzene is approximately 2 moles of benzene.

Thus, appending three digits is not sufficient. 3. **Appending Two or One Digits**: If appending two digits were possible, then it would have been possible by appending three digits with leading zeros. Thus, appending two or fewer digits is also not adequate. 4. **Appending Four Digits**: Let's consider appending four digits to 2014: The smallest number obtained by appending four digits to 2014 is in the range 20140000 to 20149999.

We'll denote such an arrangement as a \\"valid arrangement.\\" 1. **Total Possible Arrangements:** The total number of possible arrangements of 3 black balls and 3 white balls can be calculated using the combinations formula because the balls are identical within their colors.

According to the problem, Mr. Yadav spends 60% of his salary on consumable items. Therefore, the remaining salary after spending on consumable items is 40% of S. Now, let's denote the percentage of the remaining salary that he spends on clothes and transport as P%. Given that he saves 46800 at the end of the year, this means his monthly savings amount to 46800 / 12 = 3900. We also know that he spends 3900 per month on clothes and transport. So, the remaining salary after spending on consumable items is spent on clothes and transport and savings. Let's calculate the remaining salary after spending on consumable items: Remaining salary = 40% of S Remaining salary = 0.40 * S Now, this remaining salary is divided between clothes and transport expenses (3900) and savings (3900). So, we have: 0.40 * S = 3900 (clothes and transport) + 3900 (savings) Now, we need to find P%, which is the percentage of the remaining salary spent on clothes and transport: P% of Remaining salary = 3900 P% of (0.40 * S) = 3900 To find P%, we divide the clothes and transport expenses by the remaining salary and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: P% = (3900 / (0.40 * S)) * 100 But we know that 0.40 * S is equal to 3900 (clothes and transport) + 3900 (savings), which is 7800.

The expression frac{x_1}{x_2} + frac{x_2}{x_1} simplifies to: frac{x_1^2 + x_2^2}{x_1 cdot x_2} = frac{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1 cdot x_2}{x_1 cdot x_2} = frac{(frac{4 + a}{2})^2}{frac{a - 1}{2}} - 2 = frac{(a + 4)^2}{4(a - 1)} - 2.

The discriminant Delta = b^2 - 4a(b - 1) geq 0 for the quadratic equation to have real solutions. Simplifying gives: b^2 - 4ab + 4a geq 0. Since b can be any real number, the discriminant of this quadratic in b, Delta' = (-4a)^2 - 16a leq 0, which simplifies to: a(a - 1) leq 0, quad a neq 0.

Then, the smallest positive period of the function f(x) = x lfloor x rfloor is _____.","completion":"To find the smallest positive period of the function f(x) = x - lfloor x rfloor, we need to understand how the floor function lfloor x rfloor affects f(x). The function f(x) basically represents the fractional part of x. This is because lfloor x rfloor gives us the integer part of x, and x - lfloor x rfloor yields the difference between x and its integer part, which is the fractional part. For example: - If x = 3.7, then lfloor x rfloor = 3, and f(x) = 3.7 - 3 = 0.7. - If x = -1.2, then lfloor x rfloor = -2 (since -2 is the greatest integer less than -1.2), and f(x) = -1.2 - (-2) = 0.8. The output of f(x) will always be in the range [0, 1), as the fractional part cannot reach 1. The function repeats its values for every integer increment of x. Thus, starting at any point x_0, the function will repeat itself at x_0 + 1, x_0 + 2, and so on. Therefore, the smallest positive period of f(x) is 1, because the fractional part of x and x + 1 will be the same, so f(x + 1) = f(x) for any x.

Completing the square for the y term: [y^{2}+4y = (y+2)^{2} - 2^2 = (y+2)^{2} - 4] Substituting these back into the circle equation gives: [(x-1)^{2} + (y+2)^{2} - 1 - 4 = k] [ Rightarrow (x-1)^{2} + (y+2)^{2} = k + 5] Now let's analyze each option based on this equation: **Option A:** The radius squared of a circle, represented as the right side of the equation (x-1)^{2} + (y+2)^{2} = k + 5, must be positive for a real circle. This implies k+5 > 0, hence k > -5. This makes option A correct. **Option B:** The standard form of a circle's equation is (x-h)^{2} + (y-k)^{2} = r^{2}, where (h, k) is the center. Based on our equation (x-1)^{2} + (y+2)^{2} = k + 5, the center of the circle is (1, -2), not (1, 2). Thus, option B is incorrect. **Option C:** When k=4, the radius r of circle C can be found by taking the square root of the right side of our standard form equation, which becomes r = sqrt{4 + 5} = sqrt{9} = 3. Therefore, option C is correct. **Option D:** If the circle is tangent to the x-axis, the distance from the center to the x-axis equals the radius. The center is (1, -2), so the distance to the x-axis is |-2| = 2. Thus, the radius is 2, and r^2 = 2^2 = 4. For the circle equation, k + 5 = 4, which means k = -1, not -4.

This implies that a_{8} > 0. Given that frac{a_{9}}{a_{8}} < -1, we can deduce that a_{9} < -a_{8} < 0. Therefore, a_{8} + a_{9} < 0, which leads to the conclusion that |a_{9}| > a_{8}.

As (TH = TB_1) and ( angle THB_1 = angle TB_1H ), triangles (THB_1) and (TB_1H) are congruent. Therefore, the angles (angle THB_1) and (angle B_1TH) are equal. 4.

This is an increase of 80 - 60 = 20 units. 2. **Calculate Price Reduction**: For every 1 yuan reduction in price, an additional 2 units are sold. Therefore, a 20 unit increase in sales corresponds to a 20 / 2 = 10 yuan reduction in price. 3. **Compute New Profit Per Unit**: The original profit per unit is 100 yuan. With a 10 yuan reduction, the new profit per unit becomes 100 - 10 = 90 yuan. 4. **Calculate Daily Profit**: With the new profit per unit, selling 80 units per day yields a daily profit of 90 times 80 = 7200 yuan.

We must determine the maximum possible number of elements in M. --- 1. **Consider the convex hull of the red points**: Suppose we have n red points forming a convex hull F. Let k of these red points be inside F. 2. **Forming triangles within the convex hull**: Since F is an n-sided polygon, we can divide it into n-k triangles by drawing diagonals from one vertex to all nonadjacent vertices. This process creates n - k - 2 red triangles within the convex hull F. 3. **Adding interior red points**: Each of these interior red points will divide each triangle it is part of into smaller triangles. Specifically, every red point added inside F borders additional triangles that are further subdivided. Hence, the k red interior points subdivide into 2k additional triangles because each red point makes 3 smaller triangles inside each larger triangle it intersects. Thus, the total number of red triangles inside F is: [ (n - k - 2) + 2k = n + k - 2 ] 4. **Every triangle must contain a blue point**: Based on the problem conditions, each of these n + k - 2 triangles must contain at least one blue point.

This is because when projecting the side face onto a square, we essentially need to cover an area of (4) units vertically by (1) unit horizontally, multiplied by both sides. - The top and bottom faces are (1 times 1), each requiring one (1 times 1) square, which perfectly covers the individual cubes at the top and bottom of our stacked column. 4. **Verification with Image**: On referring to the given image, we note that the visual representation aligns with our calculations and necessity for specified areas: - A tower-like structure with an extended length of 4 units, - Two large squares covering the vertical sides, and - Small squares atop and below. # Conclusion: By following these steps, we've successfully created a parallelepiped from identical cubes and covered it with three squares as specified. Thus, the method and reasoning are consistent and accurate.

Let's consider the possible selections and their contributions: 1. Selecting the constant term from left(2x+1right) and the x term from the other three factors, the contribution to the coefficient of x^3 is 1 cdot (1)(-2)(3) = -6. 2. Selecting the constant term from left(x-2right) and the x term from the other three factors, the contribution to the coefficient of x^3 is -2 cdot (2x)(1)(3) = -12x^3. Thus, the coefficient from this selection is -12. 3. Selecting the constant term from left(x+3right) and the x term from the other three factors, the contribution to the coefficient of x^3 is 3 cdot (2x)(-2)(1) = -12x^3. Thus, the coefficient from this selection is -12. 4. Selecting the constant term from left(x-4right) and the x term from the other three factors, the contribution to the coefficient of x^3 is -4 cdot (2x)(1)(3) = -24x^3. Thus, the coefficient from this selection is -24. Adding these contributions together, we get the total coefficient of x^3 as -6 - 12 - 12 - 24 = -54. However, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the calculation process. Let's correct the approach based on the standard solution provided: For each selection of three x terms and one constant term, we should consider the coefficients properly: 1. From left(2x+1right), selecting 2x contributes 2 to the coefficient of x^3. 2. From left(x-2right), selecting x contributes 1 to the coefficient of x^3. 3. From left(x+3right), selecting x contributes 1 to the coefficient of x^3. 4. From left(x-4right), selecting x contributes 1 to the coefficient of x^3. The correct calculation for the coefficient of x^3 involves considering how each factor contributes when combined: - From left(2x+1right) selecting 1, and from the others selecting x, we get 1 cdot 1 cdot 1 cdot 1 = 1. - From left(x-2right) selecting -2, and from the others selecting x, we get 2 cdot (-2) = -4. - From left(x+3right) selecting 3, and from left(2x+1right) and the others selecting x, we get 2 cdot 3 = 6. - From left(x-4right) selecting -4, and from the others selecting x, we get 2 cdot (-4) = -8.

Choose ( k ) such that ( f(k) = 1 ). - Consider the infinite sequence ( k, k+1, k+2, k+4, k+8, k+16, ldots ). Each term in this sequence is different because ( f ) is a bijection. 2. **Step 2: Sequence Properties and Monotonicity** - Considering ( f ) is a bijection and ensuring distinct values, note that the sequence ( f(k), f(k+1), f(k+2), f(k+4), f(k+8), ldots ) cannot always be decreasing. This is because the values are bounded below by 1, as they are positive integers. 3. **Step 3: Finding an Increasing Subsequence** - Hence, there must exist ( n ) such that ( f(k + 2^n) < f(k + 2^{n+1}) ). - This implies ( f(k) < f(k + 2^n) < f(k + 2^{n+1}) ). Therefore, ( k, k + 2^n, ) and ( k + 2^{n+1} ) form an arithmetic progression ( a_0 = k, a_1 = k + 2^n, a_2 = k + 2^{n+1} ) such that ( f(a_0) < f(a_1) < f(a_2) ). 4. **Step 4: Conclusion for the First Part** - We have shown that there exists a three-term arithmetic progression ( a_0 < a_1 < a_2 ) such that ( f(a_0) < f(a_1) < f(a_2) ).

For example: [ f(1) = 2, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 8, f(4) = 7, ldots, f(3n-2) = 3n+1, f(3n-1) = 3n, f(3n) = 3n+2, ldots ] - By creating such a function, no arithmetic progression of length more than three with monotonically increasing ( f ) values is possible. - Any chosen ( k, k+1, k+n ) sequence would instantly upset the established order due to our explicit permutation divergence ensuring no more than three-part consecutive relationships maintain order across significant spans. 6. **Conclusion for the Second Part** - It is thus possible to construct a bijection ( f ) that prevents the existence of a 2003-term arithmetic progression where ( f ) is increasing.

However, the correct interpretation should be that the minimum value of (x-2)^2 is 0 when x=2. Thus, f(x)_{min}=0. 2. **Case 2: a<0** When a<0, for x<a, the function f(x)=-ax+1 is monotonically increasing because as x decreases (becomes more negative), -ax becomes more positive, making f(x) larger. As xrightarrow -infty, f(x)rightarrow -infty, indicating that f(x) does not have a minimum value.

For instance, for ( k = 3 ), the traversal patterns fit perfectly as shown in the reference solution provided with a specific example. - **Case 2: ( n = 3k+2 )**: - To verify ( n = 3k+2 ): - Number the rows from bottom to top as ( 0, 1, cdots, 3k+1 ). - Number the columns from left to right as ( 0, 1, cdots, 3k+1 ). - Fill each cell with the sum of its row and column indices. - Suppose ( a_i ) represents the number in the cell reached in the ( i )-th move. We need to find out the conditions for ( a_{i+1} ) given the movement constraints: - Moving right or up, increase the cell number by 1. - Moving left-bottom, decrease the cell number by 2. - Thus, we conclude ( a_{i+1} equiv a_i + 1 (mod 3) ). 4. **Modulo Property Analysis**: - For ( n = 3k+2 ), among ( (3k+2)^2 - 1 ) moves (excluding the starting square), numbers modulo 3 have to cycle perfectly such that every group of 3 numbers contains one which is perfectly divisible by 3. - This property guarantees that out of ( (3k+2)^2 - 1 ), exactly ( frac{1}{3}[(3k+2)^2-1] = 3k^2 + 4k + 1 ) should be divisible by 3. 5. **Conflict Identification**: - On the other hand, calculating specifically for cells containing numbers which are multiples of 3: [ begin{aligned} &, 4 + 7 + 10 + cdots + (3k + 1) + 3k + 3(k-1) cdots + 6 + 3 =&, frac{1}{2} cdot k (3k + 5) + frac{1}{2} cdot k (3k + 3) = k(3k + 4) end{aligned} ] - Comparing these, there is a contradiction because ( k(3k + 4) ) is less than ( 3k^2 + 4k + 1 ). 6. **Conclusion**: - The contradiction shows that for ( n = 3k+2 ), it is not possible to traverse and visit every cell exactly once starting from the bottom-left corner. - Hence, the possible values for ( n ) allowing traversal are when ( n = 3k ) or ( n = 3k+1 ).

Take an equilateral triangle with side length 2. 2. **Constructing Perpendiculars:** From the midpoints of each side of this equilateral triangle, erect perpendiculars outward. These perpendiculars will help us construct our hexagon in a controlled manner. 3. **Creating Minor Lengths:** On each of these perpendiculars, place very small segments, say of length 0.01 units. This ensures that each small segment is measurable and less than any diagonal potential interaction within larger dimensions of our triangle. 4. **Hexagon Formation:** Connect the ends of these small segments to the corresponding vertices of the original equilateral triangle. This step helps in constructing a convex hexagon where all sides are slightly greater than 1 unit. 5. **Verification of Side Lengths:** It’s evident that sides of the resulting convex hexagon are slightly greater than 1 unit in length. Therefore, our polygon satisfies the given condition of each side being longer than 1. 6. **Analyzing Diagonals:** Evaluate the lengths of all possible diagonals in this newly formed hexagon. Since the changes made from the equilateral triangle’s original sides are minimal (specifically 0.01 units extensions), the longest length within this hexagon (any diagonal) is less than or equal to 2 units. 7. **Conclusion:** Upon detailed inspection, the maximum length any diagonal could achieve is precisely evaded due to our minimal increment (0.01) from the midpoint extensions. Hence, none of the diagonals surpass the length of 2 units. # Conclusion: The described construction showcases a scenario of a convex hexagon where all sides exceed 1 unit in length, but none of its diagonals extend beyond 2 units.

We generate a new set ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ) according to the rule: [ b_1 = frac{a_1 + a_2}{2}, quad b_2 = frac{a_2 + a_3}{2}, quad ldots, quad b_{n-1} = frac{a_{n-1} + a_n}{2}, quad b_n = frac{a_n + a_1}{2} ] We are given that repeating this process must always result in a set of integers, and we must prove that all initial values ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) are equal. 2. **Analyzing the New Set**: Consider the smallest value in the initial set. Let this smallest value be denoted by ( s ), and suppose it occurs ( m ) times in the set, where ( 1 leq m < n ) because ( n ) is odd and thus ( m neq n ). 3. **Behavior of the Smallest Value**: - In the next iteration, each new value ( b_i ) is an average of two adjacent values from the previous set. - Therefore, each ( b_i ) must be at least ( s ) because the arithmetic mean of any two integers will always be greater than or equal to the smallest integer. 4. **Increments in the Smallest Value**: Since there are ( m ) occurrences of ( s ), after at most ( m ) iterations, some or all the smallest values will be increased. If the set had any values that were strictly larger than ( s ), the smallest value must increase after sufficient iterations. 5. **Contradiction and Equal Values**: - If at any point, a particular iteration results in all ( b_i ) being equal (say ( b_1 = b_2 = cdots = b_n = t )), then from the rules: [ frac{a_1 + a_2}{2} = frac{a_2 + a_3}{2} = cdots = frac{a_n + a_1}{2} = t ] - This immediately implies that ( a_1 + a_2 = a_2 + a_3 = cdots = a_n + a_1 ). 6. **Implication of Equations**: From ( a_1 + a_2 = a_2 + a_3 ), we get ( a_1 = a_3 ). Continuing this pattern, we get ( a_1 = a_3 = a_5 = cdots = a_n ) (since ( n ) is odd). Similarly, ( a_2 = a_4 = cdots = a_{n-1} ), so we have two sequences of equal numbers. 7. **Final Step to Equality**: Additionally, from ( a_n + a_1 = a_1 + a_2 ), it follows that ( a_2 = a_n ). This implies that all values ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) must be equal. 8. **Conclusion**: If any ( a_i ) were different at the start, the process described would lead to non-integer values eventually, contradicting our condition. Thus, the only way for the process to always yield integers is if ( a_1 = a_2 = cdots = a_n ) initially.

Since angle O_1T_1O_2 = angle O_1T_2O_2 = 90^circ, we have that this quadrilateral is cyclic by the inscribed angle theorem. 4. **Power of a Point for Cyclic Quadrilateral:** Using PoP for the cyclic quadrilateral O_1T_1T_2O_2, we get: [ XO_1 cdot XT_2 = XO_2 cdot XT_1 ] We have that XO_1 = frac{XA + XB}{2} and XO_2 = frac{XC + XD}{2}, so we can make these substitutions in the previous equation: [ frac{XA + XB}{2} cdot XT_2 = frac{XC + XD}{2} cdot XT_1 ] 5. **Simplify and Square Both Sides:** Multiply by 2 and square both sides: [ (XA + XB) cdot XT_2 = (XC + XD) cdot XT_1 ] [ (XA + XB)^2 cdot XT_2^2 = (XC + XD)^2 cdot XT_1^2 ] 6. **Substitute PoP Equations:** Substitute the original PoP equations: [ (XA + XB)^2 cdot (XC cdot XD) = (XC + XD)^2 cdot (XA cdot XB) ] 7. **Introduce Variables:** Let a = XA, b = XB, c = XC, and d = XD. We get: [ (a + b)^2 cdot cd = (c + d)^2 cdot ab ] 8. **Expand and Simplify:** Expanding both sides: [ (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) cdot cd = (c^2 + 2cd + d^2) cdot ab ] [ a^2cd + 2abcd + b^2cd = c^2ab + 2abcd + d^2ab ] 9. **Cancel Common Terms and Factor:** Cancel the common term 2abcd from both sides: [ a^2cd + b^2cd = c^2ab + d^2ab ] Factor the expression: [ (a^2cd + b^2cd) - (c^2ab + d^2ab) = 0 ] [ cd(a^2 + b^2) = ab(c^2 + d^2) ] 10. **Rearrange and Conclude:** Rearrange the equation: [ frac{a^2 + b^2}{ab} = frac{c^2 + d^2}{cd} ] This implies: [ frac{a}{b} = frac{c}{d} ] Since angle BXC = angle AXD, we have that triangle BXC sim triangle AXD by SAS similarity. 11. **Parallel Lines:** Finally, we get that BC parallel AD by corresponding angles in similar triangles. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"There are 33 integers between 100 and a certain number that are divisible by 3.

Then, N = a^5 - 1 = (a - 1)(a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + a + 1). - Since ( a = prod_{i=1}^k p_i ) and by our assumption, these primes are finite, and all are of the form 10k+1. 4. **Prime divisors of N:** - The factor a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + a + 1 and a-1 do not share any common prime factors under typical considerations of Fermat’s little theorem and properties of binomial expansions revealing characteristics of modular arithmetic modulo 5.

Due to a leak at the bottom, it takes 15 hours for Pipe A to fill the tank. In what time can the leak alone empty the full tank?","completion":"Let's denote the rate at which Pipe A fills the tank as ( A ) and the rate at which the leak empties the tank as ( L ). When Pipe A is filling the tank without the leak, it takes 10 hours to fill the tank. Therefore, the rate of filling is ( frac{1}{10} ) of the tank per hour. When the leak is present, Pipe A takes 15 hours to fill the tank. Therefore, the effective rate of filling is ( frac{1}{15} ) of the tank per hour. The difference between the two rates is due to the leak. So, the rate at which the leak empties the tank is the rate of Pipe A without the leak minus the effective rate with the leak: [ A - L = frac{1}{10} - frac{1}{15} ] To find the common denominator, we can use 30 (since 30 is the least common multiple of 10 and 15): [ A - L = frac{3}{30} - frac{2}{30} ] [ A - L = frac{1}{30} ] This means that the leak empties ( frac{1}{30} ) of the tank per hour. To find out how long it would take for the leak to empty the full tank, we take the reciprocal of the leak's rate: [ L = frac{1}{frac{1}{30}} ] [ L = 30 ] So, the leak alone can empty the full tank in boxed{30} hours."},{"prompt":"A train 155 meters long is traveling at a certain speed and can cross a bridge in 30 seconds.

Expressing the sum of the first n+1 and n+2 terms with the sum of the first n terms plus additional terms, we get: 2(a_1 + a_2 + dots + a_n + a_{n+1}) = (a_1 + a_2 + dots + a_n) + (a_1 + a_2 + dots + a_n + a_{n+1} + a_{n+2}), Simplifying this equation, we find: 2a_{n+1} = a_{n+2}, Since the sequence is geometric, a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} cdot r where r is the common ratio. Substituting, we have: 2a_{n+1} = a_{n+1} cdot r, Dividing by a_{n+1} (assuming a_{n+1} neq 0), we get: r = 2. Given that a_1 = 1, the sequence starts as 1, r, r^2, dots; hence: a_3 = a_1 cdot r^2 = 1 cdot 2^2 = 4. However, we seem to have made a mistake. The problem states that S_{n+2} - S_n = S_{n+1} - S_{n+2}, which implies that: S_{n+2} = 2S_{n+1} - S_n. Which gives us: a_{n+2} + a_{n+1} = a_{n+2}, Therefore, a_{n+1} = 0. This is incorrect because we previously agreed that a_{n+1} neq 0. Let's reevaluate the difference between sums: S_{n+2} - S_n = S_{n+1} - S_{n+2}, This gives us: 2S_{n+2} = S_n + S_{n+1}, From the sum formula of a geometric sequence, we have S_n = frac{a_1(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}. So the equation becomes: 2left(frac{1 - r^{n+2}}{1 - r}right) = left(frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}right) + left(frac{1 - r^{n+1}}{1 - r}right), Simplifying, we get: 2 - 2r^{n+2} = 1 - r^n + 1 - r^{n+1}, Thus: 2r^{n+2} = r^n + r^{n+1} - 1.

This means that on the second day, the seller earns 3r, on the third day the seller earns 3r^2, and so on. On the 15th day, the seller earns an income of ₹36. This can be represented as: 3 * r^(15-1) = 36 Simplifying the equation, we get: 3 * r^14 = 36 Now, we divide both sides by 3 to isolate r^14: r^14 = 36 / 3 r^14 = 12 To find the value of r, we need to take the 14th root of both sides: r = 14√12 However, we can simplify this further by recognizing that 12 is 2^2 * 3, and we can take the 14th root of each factor: r = 14√(2^2 * 3) r = 14√(2^2) * 14√3 r = 2^(2/14) * 3^(1/14) r = 2^(1/7) * 3^(1/14) Since we cannot simplify this any further without a calculator, we can leave the ratio in this form. However, if we want to find the numerical value of r, we would need to use a calculator to find the 7th root of 2 and the 14th root of 3, and then multiply them together.

Let's break down the solution as per the instructions: **Option A:** To determine if statement A is correct, we need to understand what a hypergeometric distribution is. The hypergeometric distribution applies when we're dealing with selections without replacement from a finite population that consists of two categories. In this case, the school students are divided into two groups: boys and girls. When selecting 10 students from the total without replacement, the number of boys selected (X) indeed follows a hypergeometric distribution because it meets all the criteria mentioned above. Therefore, we can conclude: [ text{Option A is correct.} ] **Option B:** For option B, we need to evaluate the mathematical expectation (mean) of a transformed variable (X-1). The expected value of a random variable is linear, which means (E(aX + b) = aE(X) + b), where (a) and (b) are constants. Applying this to (E(X-1)), we get: [ E(X-1) = E(X) - 1 = 2023 - 1 = 2022 ] [ text{Hence, Option B is incorrect.} ] **Option C:** To verify option C, we examine the variance of a scaled and shifted variable.

Thus, for (n=2023) and (p=0.5), the probability of (X) being less than or equal to 1010 should be equal to the probability of (X) being greater than or equal to (2023-1010 = 1013), not 1011. This is due to the symmetry property: [ P(X leq 1010) = P(X geq 1013) ] [ text{Therefore, Option D is incorrect.} ] Summarizing the analysis: - Option A is correct. - Option B is incorrect. - Option C is correct. - Option D is incorrect.

The rate at which the small pump fills the tank is 1 tank per 4 hours, and the rate at which the large pump fills the tank is 1 tank per 1/2 hour. Let's convert these rates into a common unit, which is the fraction of the tank filled per hour. Small pump rate: ( frac{1}{4} ) tank per hour Large pump rate: ( frac{1}{0.5} ) tank per hour = 2 tanks per hour Now, let's add these rates together to find the combined rate at which both pumps fill the tank when working together. Combined rate = Small pump rate + Large pump rate Combined rate = ( frac{1}{4} + 2 ) To add these, we need a common denominator, which is 4 in this case. Combined rate = ( frac{1}{4} + frac{8}{4} ) Combined rate = ( frac{9}{4} ) tanks per hour Now, to find out how long it would take both pumps to fill the tank together, we take the reciprocal of the combined rate, because we want to know how many hours it takes to fill 1 tank. Time to fill 1 tank = ( frac{1}{text{Combined rate}} ) Time to fill 1 tank = ( frac{1}{frac{9}{4}} ) Time to fill 1 tank = ( frac{4}{9} ) hours So, it would take both pumps ( frac{4}{9} ) hours to fill the empty tank if they began pumping at the same time. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): ( frac{4}{9} ) hours * 60 minutes/hour = ( frac{4}{9} ) * 60 minutes ( frac{4}{9} ) * 60 minutes = ( frac{240}{9} ) minutes ( frac{240}{9} ) minutes = 26.67 minutes So, it would take approximately boxed{26.67} minutes for both pumps to fill the tank when working together."},{"prompt":"Given that | overrightarrow{a}|=| overrightarrow{b}|neq 0, and overrightarrow{a} is not collinear with overrightarrow{b}, the relationship between overrightarrow{a}+ overrightarrow{b} and overrightarrow{a} overrightarrow{b} is (, ,).

Further, let (AE / AB = q_c) and (AF / AC = q_b), implying (AE = q_c cdot AB = q_c cdot c) and (AF = q_b cdot AC = q_b cdot b). 2.

A logical choice for such planes would be: [ x + y + z = k ] for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 3n ). 3. **Constructing a Solution**: Consider the planes given by: [ x + y + z = k quad text{for } k = 1, 2, ldots, 3n ] Each of these planes will cover all points where the sum of the coordinates is exactly ( k ). Since ( x, y, ) and ( z ) can each range from ( 0 ) to ( n ), the largest possible value for ( x + y + z ) is ( 3n ). These planes ensure that every point in ( S ) is covered. 4. **Proof for Minimum Planes**: To show that at least ( 3n ) planes are necessary, assume we have ( m ) planes of the form ( ax + by + cz + d = 0 ) that collectively cover ( S ) but not ((0, 0, 0)). Multiply all equations together to form a polynomial ( p(x, y, z) ) equal to zero at all points of ( S ) but non-zero at the origin. 5. **Polynomial Degree Argument**: We need to show that the degree of ( p(x, y, z) ) is at least ( 3n ). Consider the more general statement: Given any set ( S(a, b, c) ) like: [ S(a, b, c) = {(x, y, z) mid x in {0, 1, ldots, a}, y in {0, 1, ldots, b}, z in {0, 1, ldots, c}, x + y + z > 0} ] Any polynomial ( f(x, y, z) ) zero in ( S(a, b, c) ) but non-zero at ((0, 0, 0)) must have a degree at least ( a + b + c ). 6. **Inductive Argument**: We prove the statement by induction on ( a + b + c ): - **Base Case**: If ( a + b + c = 1 ), then the polynomial must be at least linear because it needs to differentiate enough to cover a non-constant behavior, implying degree ( geq 1 ). - **Inductive Step**: - Assume the result is true for all sums ( a + b + c leq k ). - Show it holds for ( a + b + c = k + 1 ). Choose any non-zero value among ( a, b, ) or ( c ), say ( a ). Construct a new polynomial ( g(x, y, z) = f(x+1, y, z) - f(x, y, z) ). - Degree ( g leq t - 1 ) as common terms of highest order cancel out. - Then ( g ) is zero on ( S(a-1, b, c) ) and inductions gives ( deg(g) geq (a-1) + b + c Rightarrow deg(f) geq a + b + c ).

Let’s name the altitudes as A H, B H_{1}, C H_{2}, and D H_{3} respectively, where H, H_{1}, H_{2}, and H_{3} are the feet of these altitudes on the corresponding opposite faces. 3.

Due to symmetry and properties of regular tetrahedron, all these distances remain equal for respective points considered (feet of altitudes, midpoints of altitudes, and points of intersection on faces). 10.

Prove that for all sufficiently large positive integers like d , there is a monic polynomial P(x) of degree d , such that all of its coefficients are either +1 or 1 and left|P(t)2019right| <1. *Proposed by Navid Safaei*","completion":"To prove that for all sufficiently large positive integers ( d ), there exists a monic polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree ( d ) with coefficients either ( +1 ) or ( -1 ) such that ( left|P(t) - 2019right| < 1 ), we will proceed as follows: 1. **Understanding the Polynomial Construction**: Consider a monic polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree ( d ) with coefficients ( a_i in {+1, -1} ). We can write: [ P(x) = x^d + a_{d-1}x^{d-1} + cdots + a_1x + a_0 ] where ( a_i in {+1, -1} ). 2. **Analyzing the Value of ( P(t) )**: We need to show that for sufficiently large ( d ), we can find such a polynomial ( P(x) ) such that ( left|P(t) - 2019right| < 1 ). This means we need ( P(t) ) to be very close to 2019. 3. **Step Size Analysis**: Consider the change in the polynomial value when we change one coefficient from ( -1 ) to ( +1 ) or vice versa. Suppose we have a polynomial ( P(x) ) and we change the coefficient ( a_k ) from ( -1 ) to ( +1 ). The new polynomial ( Q(x) ) will be: [ Q(x) = P(x) + 2x^k ] The change in the value of the polynomial at ( t ) is: [ Q(t) - P(t) = 2t^k ] 4. **Bounding the Step Size**: Since ( 1 < t < 2 ), the value ( 2t^k ) can be controlled. For large ( k ), ( t^k ) grows exponentially, but since ( t < 2 ), it does not grow too fast. We need to ensure that the steps ( 2t^k ) can be used to approximate any real number within a small interval. 5. **Constructing the Polynomial**: Start with a polynomial ( P(x) ) with all coefficients ( +1 ). Evaluate ( P(t) ). If ( P(t) ) is less than 2019, we need to increase the value. If ( P(t) ) is more than 2019, we need to decrease the value. By changing the coefficients from ( +1 ) to ( -1 ) or vice versa, we can adjust the value of ( P(t) ) in steps of ( 2t^k ). 6. **Ensuring the Desired Approximation**: Since ( t ) is between 1 and 2, the steps ( 2t^k ) can be made arbitrarily small for sufficiently large ( k ). Therefore, by carefully choosing which coefficients to change, we can make ( P(t) ) as close to 2019 as desired. Specifically, we can ensure: [ left|P(t) - 2019right| < 1 ] 7. **Conclusion**: For sufficiently large ( d ), we can always find a combination of ( +1 ) and ( -1 ) coefficients such that the polynomial ( P(x) ) evaluated at ( t ) is within 1 unit of 2019.

To link this condition to the symmetry properties required to prove that (AC) bisects (angle BMD), we shall transform the original quadrilateral using symmetry and geometric properties.

For the equation x-left(x-1right)log _{2}x=0, we simplify it to frac{x}{x-1}=log _{2}x. **Step 2: Analyze the function y=frac{x}{x-1}** 1. We find that x=frac{y}{y-1}, indicating that the graph of y=frac{x}{x-1} is symmetric about the line y=x. **Step 3: Determine the roots a and b** 1. The roots a and b are the abscissas of the intersection points of the graphs of y=2^{x}, y=log _{2}x, and y=frac{x}{x-1}. 2.

The clever Chernomor can split the bogatyrs into groups of any size (including a single group) and then distribute the coins among these groups. Each group will divide its coins equally among its members, and any remainder will go to Chernomor. 2. **Maximizing Chernomor’s Coins for Arbitrary Distribution**: a) When Chernomor can distribute the coins however he wants: _Key Observation_: For a group of ( N ) bogatyrs, Chernomor will receive ( N-1 ) coins if ( N-1 ) is the remainder when dividing the group’s portion of coins by ( N ). This happens because the remainder in modular arithmetic is always less than the divisor. - **Forming the Strategy**: If Chernomor divides the bogatyrs into such groups that maximize the remainders (which go to him), he can aim for the highest possible remainders. i. For ( K ) groups, the maximum total remainder sum will be ( 33-K ), as each group can contribute at most ( N-1 ) remainder coins, where ( N ) is the size of the group. - **Example Strategy**: If there is one group, since ( 240 = 33 times 7 + 9 ), the remainder is 9 coins. This is a specific condition when the group size exactly fits into the total number of coins distributed. - **Optimal Single Case**: Distribute into two groups.

To get ( K ) groups: - ( K ) and ( 240 div K ) should be suitable to equate ( N-1 ) remainders in as many groups. - Viable ( K ) groups: - 30 Groups: ( 240/8 = 30) optimal remaining parts.

We'll break this solution into logical steps involving angles and tangent properties to finally prove the required condition. 1. **Identifying Relevant Angles:** - Let ( M ) be the midpoint of ( AF ) and we consider the circumcircle of ( triangle FQE ). 2. **Angle Relations and Properties:** - Note that ( angle AQM ) is equal to ( angle EQD ) because ( Q ) lies on the circle and they cut the same arc. - Also, ( angle EQD = angle ECD ). The reason is that ( CD ) is tangent to the circle ( triangle EQD ) at ( D ). The tangent line forms an angle with the chord ( EQ ) equal to the angle in the alternate segment, which is ( angle ECD ). 3. **Calculate ( angle ECD ):** - From the triangle properties, we know that ( angle ECD ) can be expressed using the angles of the triangle. Specifically, we have: [ angle ECD = frac{180^circ - angle C}{2} ] 4. **Angle Divisions Using Triangle Angle Sum Property:** - Since ( angle A), ( angle B), and ( angle C ) sum to ( 180^circ ) in any triangle, we could use median angle values to divide: [ angle ECD = frac{180^circ - angle C}{2} = frac{angle A + angle B}{2} ] - Thus, ( angle AQD = frac{angle A + angle B}{2} ). 5. **Angle Proportionality:** - With ( M ) being the midpoint of ( AF ), our goal leads to the condition that angles must suggest ( AM ) diverging to ( AF ). Thus we calculate angle relations: [ angle AQD = frac{angle A}{2} + frac{angle B}{2} ] - Recall that for ( EQ ) to pass midpoint ( M ), triangle similarity can be deployed using tangent lengths or angle subsections: [ MF^2 = MQ cdot ME ] 6. **Similarity Conditions:** - Equating segment ratios, ( AM = AF ) implies: [ AM^2 = MQ cdot ME ] - Also, confirming triangle similarities ( triangle AMQ sim triangle EMA ) provided common angle at ( M ).

To find the total combined height, we multiply the average height by the number of people: Total combined height = Average height × Number of people Total combined height = 61 inches × 4 Total combined height = 244 inches Now we can set up an equation with the total combined height and the heights of all four people: Z (Zora's height) + (Z + 4) inches (Itzayana's height) + 64 inches (Zara's height) + 64 inches (Brixton's height) = 244 inches Combining like terms, we get: Z + Z + 4 + 64 + 64 = 244 2Z + 132 = 244 Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for Z: 2Z = 244 - 132 2Z = 112 Divide both sides by 2 to find Zora's height: Z = 112 / 2 Z = 56 inches Zora's height is 56 inches.

Select two equal integers from the n integers, increase one of them by p, and decrease the other by q. If there are still equal integers among the n numbers, repeat the procedure. Prove that after a finite number of steps, we obtain n distinct numbers.","completion":"Let's prove that after finitely many steps, we will have ( n ) distinct integers. Step 1: Initial analysis of the problem First, we note two important observations: - The smallest element in the set of numbers cannot increase during the procedure. - The largest element in the set cannot decrease during the procedure. To understand why this is true, consider the following situations that affect the smallest and largest elements: - The smallest element can only change if it appears more than once, and we choose two of them to change. In this case, the new smallest element will be a number greater than or equal to the previous smallest element minus ( q ) (which is ( n-q )), potentially a new smallest number even smaller than the current smallest. - The largest element behaves similarly: a decrease will only happen if two instances of the largest number are chosen, or if a new pair introduces a larger number only up to a ( (n+p) ). Step 2: Analyzing distances Examine the distance between the closest integers during the procedure: - Initially, we consider a number ( n ) that appears twice. If we replace these two numbers with ( n-q ) and ( n+p ), the initial 0-length interval disappears and is replaced by intervals: - From ( n-q ) to the preceding number (if exists) which is not longer than the initial interval. - From ( n-q ) to the succeeding number which is at most ( p+q ). - From ( n+p ) to the nearest numbers resulting in intervals that aren't longer than in the previous step. Thus, the distance between adjacent numbers is never greater than ( p+q ) or any of the initial distances. Step 3: Induction proof We prove the statement by strong induction on the number of integers ( n ) with base cases ( n=1 ) and ( n=2 ) being trivially true: **Base case (n=1):** Trivially true as there's only one number. **Base case (n=2):** Also true since two numbers will become distinct after one transformation. **Inductive step:** - Assume the hypothesis is true for ( k ) numbers. - Consider ( k+1 ) numbers. Arrange them in ascending order and note that the distances between neighboring pairs won't exceed the maximum distance or ( p+q ). - The overall range (distance from the smallest to largest number) remains within ( kd ), where ( d ) is the maximum given distance. - Because at each point, the smallest and largest number can’t change directionally beyond the limits. As the smallest size cannot increase and the largest size cannot decrease indefinitely, and since every step gets us closer to ( k ) numbers from ( k+1 ), we conclude that this must hold for ( k+1 ) as well. By induction, this property transfers from ( k ) numbers to ( k+1 ) numbers. Hence, finitely many steps will always reduce the set to ( n ) distinct integers.

Since m must be an integer, there are 201 possible scenarios.

Substituting this into the equation, we get: [ cos A + cos B + cos C = 2cosleft(frac{pi - C}{2}right) cosleft(frac{A-B}{2}right) - 2cos^2left(frac{pi - C}{2}right) + 1 ] Since: [ cosleft(frac{pi - x}{2}right) = sin left(frac{x}{2}right) ] We use this to further simplify the equation: [ = 2sin left(frac{C}{2}right) cos left(frac{A-B}{2}right) - 2sin^2 left(frac{C}{2}right) + 1 ] 4. Breaking this down further by using the sine and cosine double-angle identities: [ = 2 sin left(frac{C}{2}right) left(cos left(frac{A-B}{2}right) - sin left(frac{C}{2}right)right) + 1 ] We group terms involving (sinleft(frac{C}{2}right)): [ = 1 + 4 cos left(frac{A+B}{2}right) sin left(frac{A}{2}right) sin left(frac{B}{2}right) ] Simplify further: [ = 1 + 4 sinleft(frac{A}{2}right) sinleft(frac{B}{2}right) sinleft(frac{C}{2}right) ] 5. Since (A, B, C) are interior angles of (triangle ABC), their half angles are all acute angles. Therefore: [ sinleft(frac{A}{2}right) > 0, quad sinleft(frac{B}{2}right) > 0, quad sinleft(frac{C}{2}right) > 0 ] 6. Thus, the product of these positive sine terms is also positive: [ sinleft(frac{A}{2}right) sinleft(frac{B}{2}right) sinleft(frac{C}{2}right) > 0 ] 7. Substituting back into our equation, we have: [ cos A + cos B + cos C = 1 + 4 sinleft(frac{A}{2}right) sinleft(frac{B}{2}right) sinleft(frac{C}{2}right) ] Since (4 sinleft(frac{A}{2}right) sinleft(frac{B}{2}right) sinleft(frac{C}{2}right) > 0), we conclude: [ cos A + cos B + cos C > 1 ] Conclusion: [ boxed{cos A + cos B + cos C > 1} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that a>0, find the value of a that minimizes the constant term (the term without x) in the expansion of the expression (a^{3}x)(1+ frac {a}{x})^{9}.","completion":"Given that a>0, the expansion of (a^{3}-x)(1+ frac {a}{x})^{9} is (a^{3}-x)[1+ frac {9a}{x}+ frac {36a^{2}}{x^{2}}+ C_{ 9 }^{ 3 } cdot ( frac {a}{x})^{3}+...+ C_{ 9 }^{ 9 } cdot ( frac {a}{x})^{9}]. The constant term in this expansion is a^{3}-9a. Let f(a)=a^{3}-9a. Then, f'(a)=3a^{2}-9. Solving for a when f'(a)=0 gives a=sqrt {3}. At this point, f(a)=a^{3}-9a attains its minimum value.

The circle, which is tangent to ray ( OA ) and externally tangent at point ( P ), will be mapped to another circle tangent to ray ( OB ) and externally tangent at the point ( Q ). 5. Therefore, the circle under this homothety maps to another circle that touches the same pair of rays and also passes through the corresponding points. 6. This implies that the tangent point ( P ) must coincide with ( Q ). 7. Since ( P ) was already on the original circle and homothety maps points on the same line in a systematic way, the line passing through ( P ) and ( Q ) lies on the diagonal of the parallelogram. 8. This establishes that the point of tangency on the other pair of rays also lies on the diagonals of the parallelogram. 9.

Let ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_7 ) be seven different odd primes such that ( p_1 < p_2 < cdots < p_7 ). 2. Consider the expression ( p_1^8 - p_2^8 ). We can factorize it as follows: [ p_1^8 - p_2^8 = (p_1^4 + p_2^4)(p_1^2 + p_2^2)(p_1 + p_2)(p_1 - p_2) ] 3. Note that ( p_1 + p_2 ) and ( p_1 - p_2 ) are both even numbers because ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) are odd primes. 4. For ( p_1^8 - p_2^8 ) to be divisible by all the remaining primes ( p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6, p_7 ), each of these primes must divide the product ( (p_1^4 + p_2^4)(p_1^2 + p_2^2)(p_1 + p_2)(p_1 - p_2) ). 5. Since ( p_1 + p_2 ) and ( p_1 - p_2 ) are even, if they are divisible by any of the primes ( p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6, p_7 ), they must be divisible by ( 2p_k ) for some ( k ).

Find the largest possible cardinality of A .","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a prime number ( p ) and a natural number ( n ) such that ( p geq n geq 3 ). We need to find the largest possible cardinality of a set ( A ) of sequences of length ( n ) with elements from the set ( {0, 1, 2, ldots, p-1} ) such that any two sequences in ( A ) differ in at least three positions. 2. **Upper Bound:** To find an upper bound, consider that any two sequences in ( A ) must differ in at least one of the first ( n-2 ) positions. This means that the number of sequences in ( A ) cannot exceed the number of sequences of length ( n-2 ) with elements from ( {0, 1, 2, ldots, p-1} ). Therefore, the number of sequences in ( A ) is at most ( p^{n-2} ). 3. **Constructing Sequences:** We will construct ( p^{n-2} ) sequences that satisfy the given property. Consider sequences ( (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) ) with elements from ( {0, 1, 2, ldots, p-1} ) that satisfy the following conditions: [ x_{n-1} equiv sum_{i=1}^{n-2} x_i pmod{p} ] [ x_n equiv sum_{i=1}^{n-2} i x_i pmod{p} ] There are ( p^{n-2} ) such sequences because every sequence ( (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{n-2}) ) with elements from ( {0, 1, 2, ldots, p-1} ) determines the values of ( x_{n-1} ) and ( x_n ). 4. **Verifying the Property:** We need to show that any two sequences ( (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) ) and ( (y_1, y_2, ldots, y_n) ) differ in at least three positions. - **Case 1:** The sequences ( (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{n-2}) ) and ( (y_1, y_2, ldots, y_{n-2}) ) differ in at least three positions. There is nothing to prove in this case. - **Case 2:** The sequences ( (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{n-2}) ) and ( (y_1, y_2, ldots, y_{n-2}) ) differ in exactly two positions, say ( i ) and ( j ) (where ( 1 leq i < j leq n-2 )). Then ( x_i neq y_i ) and ( x_j neq y_j ). From the conditions, we have: [ x_{n-1} - y_{n-1} equiv (x_i - y_i) + (x_j - y_j) pmod{p} ] [ x_n - y_n equiv i(x_i - y_i) + j(x_j - y_j) pmod{p} ] Subtracting ( i ) times the first equation from the second, we get: [ (x_n - y_n) - i(x_{n-1} - y_{n-1}) equiv (j - i)(x_j - y_j) pmod{p} ] Since ( p ) is a prime number and ( x_j neq y_j ), ( (j - i)(x_j - y_j) ) is not divisible by ( p ). Therefore, ( (x_n - y_n) - i(x_{n-1} - y_{n-1}) ) is not divisible by ( p ), implying that at least one of ( x_{n-1} neq y_{n-1} ) or ( x_n neq y_n ) holds. Thus, the sequences differ in at least three positions. - **Case 3:** The sequences ( (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{n-2}) ) and ( (y_1, y_2, ldots, y_{n-2}) ) differ in exactly one position, say ( i ) (where ( 1 leq i leq n-2 )). Then ( x_i neq y_i ). From the conditions, we have: [ x_{n-1} - y_{n-1} equiv x_i - y_i pmod{p} ] [ x_n - y_n equiv i(x_i - y_i) pmod{p} ] Since ( x_i neq y_i ), both ( x_{n-1} - y_{n-1} ) and ( x_n - y_n ) are not divisible by ( p ). Therefore, ( x_{n-1} neq y_{n-1} ) and ( x_n neq y_n ), implying that the sequences differ in at least three positions. 5. **Conclusion:** We have shown that the largest possible cardinality of ( A ) is ( p^{n-2} ).

Notice that if any (i_k = k), then the corresponding factor ((k - i_k) = (k - k) = 0), making the product zero, which is even. 3. Now, let's consider a specific arrangement of the sequence (1, 2, 3, ldots, n) for (n) even, say (n = 2m): - Arrange the numbers such that (i_{1}=2, i_{2}=1, i_{3}=4, i_{4}=3, ldots, i_{2m-1}=2m, i_{2m}=2m-1). 4.

Next, let's consider (n) as an odd number, say (n = 2m + 1): - There are (m) even numbers and thus (m) terms where interactions between even index and even (i_k) and or odd index and odd (i_k) must exist. 6. Proving that the product is always even: - The sum of the set differences: [ (1 - i_{1}) + (2 - i_{2}) + ldots + (2m+1 - i_{2m+1}) = (1+2+ldots+(2m+1)) - (1+2+ldots+(2m+1)) = 0 ] - The product has terms where even and odd placements guarantee that one ((k - i_k)) will always be even. 7. Let's assume without loss of generality, at least one (k) and its permuted position have both even/odd parity: - Among (k - i_k), if (k) and (i_k) both have the same parity (both odd/even), this term (k - i_k) will be even. # Conclusion: Since there is always at least one even factor in the product when (n) is odd, the product must be even.

Hence, ( I, Y, E, C, D ) are concyclic. - Similarly, ( triangle ABI sim triangle AEX ) implies ( frac{AI}{AE} = frac{AB}{AX} ), so ( B, F, I, D, X ) are concyclic. - Since ( frac{AI}{AE} = frac{AI}{AF} ), we have ( frac{AB}{AX} = frac{AC}{AY} ) or ( frac{AX}{AY} = frac{AB}{AC} ). - **Concyclic Points and Angle Bisectors**: - Since ( AB < AC ), ( X ) is inside ( triangle ABC ). - Since ( BFIX ) is cyclic and ( IF perp AB ), ( BX perp AI ).

Since ( V in (L) ), the inversion sends ( (L) ) to a line ( ell ). Since ( T ) and ( S ) are fixed, ( ell ) is ( BC ). - **Orthogonality of Circles**: - We have ( angle IDE = frac{1}{2} angle C = angle AYD ) since ( triangle AFY sim triangle AIE ). This means ( triangle IDX sim triangle IYD ) implies ( ID^2 = IX cdot IY ). - Since ( ID ) is the radius of ( (I) ), we obtain that ( (I) ) and ( (V, frac{XY}{2}) ) are orthogonal circles.

For pepperoni pizza: - Michael eats 1/3 of a pepperoni pizza. - Jasmine eats 1/4 of a pepperoni pizza. - Carlos eats 1/6 of a pepperoni pizza. So, the total for pepperoni pizza is 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/6. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3, 4, and 6 is 12. So we convert the fractions: - Michael's share is equivalent to 4/12 of a pepperoni pizza. - Jasmine's share is equivalent to 3/12 of a pepperoni pizza. - Carlos's share is equivalent to 2/12 of a pepperoni pizza. Adding these up, we get 4/12 + 3/12 + 2/12 = 9/12, which simplifies to 3/4 of a pepperoni pizza. For vegetarian pizza: - LaMar eats 1/6 of a vegetarian pizza. - Jasmine eats 1/4 of a vegetarian pizza. So, the total for vegetarian pizza is 1/6 + 1/4. Again, we need a common denominator, which is 12. So we convert the fractions: - LaMar's share is equivalent to 2/12 of a vegetarian pizza. - Jasmine's share is equivalent to 3/12 of a vegetarian pizza.

Now, we have the total amount of each type of pizza needed: - 1 whole cheese pizza. - 3/4 of a pepperoni pizza. - 5/12 of a vegetarian pizza. Since you can't order fractions of a pizza, we need to round up to ensure there's enough for everyone: - 1 whole cheese pizza is already a whole number, so she needs to order 1 cheese pizza. - 3/4 of a pepperoni pizza means she needs to order 1 whole pepperoni pizza because 3/4 is more than half and you can't order 3/4 of a pizza. - 5/12 of a vegetarian pizza is less than half, but since you can't order 5/12 of a pizza, she needs to order 1 whole vegetarian pizza.

Since the trains are of equal length (55 meters each) and the faster train takes 36 seconds to pass the slower train completely, we can calculate the relative speed at which the faster train passes the slower train. First, we need to convert the speed of the slower train from km/hr to m/s to match the units of the train lengths and the time it takes to pass. We know that 1 km/hr is equivalent to 5/18 m/s. So, the speed of the slower train in m/s is: 36 km/hr * (5/18) m/s per km/hr = 10 m/s Now, let's calculate the distance the faster train covers to pass the slower train completely. Since both trains are 55 meters long, the total distance to pass is the sum of their lengths, which is 55 meters + 55 meters = 110 meters. The relative speed (V_rel) at which the faster train passes the slower train is the difference between their speeds because they are moving in the same direction. We have the distance (D) and the time (T), so we can use the formula: D = V_rel * T Substituting the known values, we get: 110 meters = (V - 10) m/s * 36 seconds Now, we need to find V in m/s and then convert it back to km/hr.

Now, using the given condition (overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}) cdot (overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b}) = |overrightarrow{b}|^2 - |overrightarrow{a}|^2, we write the scalar product and the magnitude of vectors' squares as follows: (0, 2+m) cdot (-2, 2-m) = (1^2 + m^2) - (-1^2 + 2^2). Calculate the left-hand side of the equation by the dot product: 0 cdot (-2) + (2+m)(2-m) = 4 - m^2. And the right-hand side by subtracting the squared magnitudes: 1^2 + m^2 - (-1^2 + 2^2) = 1 + m^2 - (1 + 4) = m^2 - 4. Equating both sides and solving for m: 4 - m^2 = m^2 - 4.

Consider the given inequality containing four variables. We need to prove an inequality pertaining to the sum and product of these variables. We can try freezing some variables to simplify the situation. There are two approaches to freezing variables: - One method is to let ( x_1 ) vary while freezing ( x_2 ), ( x_3 ), and ( x_4 ). However, due to the relationship among ( x_1 ), ( x_2 ), ( x_3 ), and ( x_4 ) in the problem statement, this method may not necessarily work. - The other method is to freeze both the sum a and product b of ( x_2 ), ( x_3 ), and ( x_4 ). For instance, define: [ a = x_{2} + x_{3} + x_{4}, quad b = x_{2} x_{3} x_{4}. ] 2. With this substitution, the inequality becomes: [ left(x_{1} + aright)^{2} leqslant 4 b x_{1}. ] This converts our problem into proving an inequality with respect to ( x_1 ). We need to show that: [ x_{1}^{2} + 2(a-2b)x_{1} + a^{2} leqslant 0. ] 3. Let: [ f(x) = x^2 + 2(a - 2b)x + a^2, ] thus, our inequality becomes: [ f(x_{1}) leqslant 0. ] 4. To analyze whether ( f(x_{1}) leqslant 0 ) holds, we examine the discriminant of ( f(x) ): [ Delta = 4(a - 2b)^2 - 4a^2. ] Simplifying: [ Delta = 16b(b - a). ] 5. To determine the sign of the discriminant, we investigate the relation between ( a ) and ( b ). Given the definitions of ( a ) and ( b ), we have: [ frac{a}{b} = frac{x_{2} + x_{3} + x_{4}}{x_{2} x_{3} x_{4}} = frac{1}{x_{3} x_{4}} + frac{1}{x_{2} x_{4}} + frac{1}{x_{2} x_{3}}, ] and considering that ( x_2, x_3, x_4 geq 2 ), we have: [ frac{a}{b} leqslant frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{4} < 1. ] 6. Therefore, ( b > a ), leading to ( Delta > 0 ). This means that the quadratic equation ( f(x) = 0 ) has two distinct real roots denoted by ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ): [ t_1 = 2b - a - 2sqrt{b(b - a)}, quad t_2 = 2b - a + 2sqrt{b(b - a)}. ] 7. The function ( y = f(x) ) represents a parabola opening upwards, so for ( f(x_1) leq 0 ) to hold, it is necessary and sufficient for ( x_1 ) to lie within the interval ([t_1, t_2]). 8. Since ( a = x_{2} + x_{3} + x_{4} geq x_{1} ) and given that ( a leq 3x_1 leq 3a ), we have: [ frac{a}{3} leqslant x_{1} leqslant a. ] 9. Therefore, we need to show that the interval (left[frac{a}{3}, aright]) is a subset of (left[t_1, t_2right]), i.e., we need to prove: [ t_1 leq frac{a}{3}, quad a leq t_2. ] 10. We check each condition: - For ( a leq t_2 ): [ t_2 = 2b - a + 2sqrt{b(b - a)} > 2b - a = b + (b - a) > a. ] Thus, ( a leq t_2 ) is satisfied. - For ( t_1 leq frac{a}{3} ): [ t_1 = 2b - a - 2sqrt{b(b - a)} = (sqrt{b} - sqrt{b - a})^{2}, ] and considering ( x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4} geq 2 ): [ (sqrt{b} - sqrt{b - a})^2 = left(frac{a}{sqrt{b} + sqrt{b - a}}right)^2, ] simplifying: [ left(frac{a}{sqrt{frac{4}{3}} + sqrt{frac{1}{3}}}right)^2 = frac{a}{3}. ] Thus, ( t_1 leq frac{a}{3} ). 11. Since both conditions ( t_1 leq frac{a}{3} ) and ( a leq t_2 ) are satisfied, it follows that ( x_1 in left[t_1, t_2right] ), hence: [ f(x_1) leq 0. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{(x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} + x_{4})^2 leq 4 x_{1} x_{2} x_{3} x_{4}}. ]"},{"prompt":"The sum of the first and third of three consecutive multiples of 3 is 150.

Prove that it can be divided into four equal parts by mass using two straight perpendicular cuts.","completion":"1. **Reformulation**: Consider an arbitrary figure ( F ) on a plane with area ( S ). For simplicity, assume ( F ) is a polygon. We need to find two perpendicular lines that divide ( F ) into four equal area parts. 2. **Directional Lines**: For any direction or vector, there exists a line in that direction which divides the area ( F ) into two equal parts. This comes from the Intermediate Value Theorem applied to the area function. Let’s consider specific directions to illustrate this. 3. **Horizontal Line**: Start with a horizontal line and move it continuously from the top to the bottom of ( F ). The area of the part of ( F ) above the line varies continuously from ( 0 ) to ( S ). At some point, this area must be ( S/2 ). 4. **Finding the Perpendicular Lines**: Assign the horizontal line we found as the ( x )-axis. By an analogous argument, there exists a vertical line (our ( y )-axis) that divides ( F ) into two equal area parts relative to the ( y )-axis. 5. **Coordinate System Adjustment**: Now we have two perpendicular lines ( l(a) ) and ( l(b) ) which we can consider as the ( x )-axis and ( y )-axis of a rectangular coordinate system. The positive direction on these axes is chosen according to the vectors ( a ) and ( b ). 6. **Area Calculation**: Label the areas in the four quadrants created by ( l(a) ) and ( l(b) ) as ( S_1, S_2, S_3, ) and ( S_4 ).

Initially, ( d ) is some value, and after rotating ( a ) by ( 90^circ ), it turns into ( b ) and ( d ) becomes (-d). 9. **Conclusion of Continuous Change**: Due to the continuous nature of the area change, there must be an intermediate orientation where the \\"defect\\" ( d ) equals 0. At this orientation, the lines ( l(a) ) and ( l(b) ) perfectly divide ( F ) into four equal area parts. # Conclusion: The existence of such perpendicular lines ( l(a) ) and ( l(b) ) that divide ( F ) into four equal parts is guaranteed.
