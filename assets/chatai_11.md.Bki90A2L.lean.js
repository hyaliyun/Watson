To do this, first multiply both sides by the complex number 1+i and get overline{z} = (1+i)(2+i). Now we evaluate the right side using algebraic expansion: begin{align*} overline{z} &= (1+i)(2+i) &= 1 cdot 2 + 1 cdot i + i cdot 2 + i cdot i &= 2 + i + 2i + i^2 &= 2 + 3i - 1 quad text{(since i^2 = -1)} &= 1 + 3i. end{align*} Since overline{z} = 1 + 3i, z is the conjugate of this number. So, we take the complex conjugate of 1 + 3i to find z: begin{align*} z &= overline{1 + 3i} &= 1 - 3i. end{align*} So the value of z is boxed{1 - 3i}. (2) Since m in mathbb{R} and the complex number z = frac{m(m+2)}{m-1} + (m^2+2m-3)i must be purely imaginary, the real part of z has to be zero. This means that the condition frac{m(m+2)}{m-1} = 0 must be satisfied. However, the denominator m-1 cannot be zero, so we can write this condition as: m(m+2) = 0. Solving this equation gives two possible values for m: begin{align*} m &= 0, m + 2 &= 0 m &= -2. end{align*} However, we must also consider the other constraint in the imaginary part of z, which should not be zero. The imaginary part of z is given by m^2+2m-3, and if we set it to zero, we have: begin{align*} m^2 + 2m - 3 &= 0 (m+3)(m-1) &= 0. end{align*} From this, m = -3 or m = 1. We discard m = 1 since it would make the real part undefined. Combining the values found from the real part and the constraints from the imaginary part, the possible values of m that make z purely imaginary are: m = 0 quad text{and} quad m = -2. However, since m = 0 makes the real part of z zero but also makes the imaginary part zero (which is not allowed), we can exclude m = 0. The only value of m that satisfies the conditions is m = -2.

To avoid double-counting, we only count them once. Thus, the total number of favorable outcomes is 10 (for even numbers) plus 2 (for 26 and 28, which are already counted in even numbers) plus 3 (for 27, 29, and 30), which simplifies to 10 even numbers + 2 additional numbers greater than 25 not double-counted = 10 + 2. - Therefore, the probability of drawing a tile that is either even or greater than 25 from box B is frac{10+2}{20} = frac{12}{20}. - Simplifying the fraction, we get frac{12}{20} = frac{3}{5}. **Step 3: Calculating the combined probability** Since these two events are independent, we multiply their probabilities to find the combined probability: - The probability of drawing a tile less than 15 from box A is frac{7}{10}. - The probability of drawing a tile that is either even or greater than 25 from box B is frac{3}{5}. - Multiplying these probabilities gives us frac{7}{10} cdot frac{3}{5} = frac{21}{50}.

Then: [ z^3 = (a + bi)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2(bi) + 3a(bi)^2 + (bi)^3 ] Simplifying, we get: [ z^3 = a^3 + 3a^2(bi) - 3ab^2 - b^3i ] Separating real and imaginary parts, we have: [ z^3 = (a^3 - 3ab^2) + i(3a^2b - b^3) ] Given the original equations, we can equate: [ a^3 - 3ab^2 = 36 ] [ 3a^2b - b^3 = 28 ] Therefore: [ z^3 = 36 + 28i ] 3.

To achieve this, consider the original hexagon where there are four legal triangles. If we add the diagonal overline{BD}, it will create an additional legal point G. This division will further divide triangles FBC and FCD into two legal triangles each. Hence, we obtain six legal triangles in total as shown below: 1. Start with the given four triangles. 2. Add diagonal overline{BD}. 3. This creates two additional triangles: - Split triangle FBC into two by drawing overline{BD}. - Split triangle FCD into two by drawing overline{BD}. Thus, the configuration is as follows: [ boxed{ begin{array}{c} triangle AFG, triangle FGD, triangle FBC, triangle BCG, triangle BFG, triangle CJD end{array} } ] **(b)** The point I is considered a legal point because of the following reasons: 1. Points D, E, and F are legal points as they are vertices of the hexagon. 2. Point H is legal because it is the intersection of diagonals overline{AD} and overline{BF}. Since I is the intersection of line segment overline{HE} with overline{DF}, and both these line segments connect legal points, I is a legal point according to Clarissa's rules. **(c)** To divide the hexagon into 10 legal triangles, we proceed as follows: 1. Start with the configuration given with 6 triangles from part (a). 2. Draw additional lines: - Draw overline{HC}. - Draw overline{BD}.

Start by initially dividing the hexagon into 12 parts as described by respectively drawing overline{AC}, overline{BD}, overline{DF}, overline{EA}, overline{FB}. 2. This gives 12 legal triangles and a smaller hexagon. 3. Perform the same division within the new smaller hexagon. 4. Each iteration adds an additional 12 triangles and leaves a smaller hexagon. Perform this for 167 iterations: [ 167 times 12 = 2004 text{ triangles} ] 5. Finally, divide the remaining smaller hexagon into 10 triangles as instructed in part (c).

We claim that all pairs ((2^n, 3^m)) with (n, m geq 1) and a difference of (pm1) are ((2, 3), (4, 3), (8, 9)). 3. **Proof of the Claim**: - **Case 1: (2^n + 1 = 3^m)**: - (3 mid 2^n + 1) implies (n equiv 1 pmod{2}). - For (n = 1), we get ((2^n, 3^m) = (2, 3)). - For (n > 1), (4 mid 3^m - 1) implies (2 mid m). - Let (y = 2^{frac{n-1}{2}}, x = 3^{frac{m}{2}}). Then (x^2 - 2y^2 = 1). - The solutions to this Pell's equation are given by ((x_1, y_1) = (3, 2)) and ((x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (3x_n + 4y_n, 2x_n + 3y_n)). - By induction, (3 mid y_n) for even (n) and (y_n equiv 2 pmod{4}) for odd (n). Only (y_1 = 2) is a power of 2, leading to ((2^n, 3^m) = (8, 9)). - **Case 2: (2^n - 1 = 3^m)**: - (n > 1) implies (4 mid 3^m + 1) and (m) is odd. - (3 mid 2^n - 1) implies (n) is even. - Let (x = 2^{frac{n}{2}}, y = 3^{frac{m-1}{2}}). Then (x^2 - 3y^2 = 1). - The solutions to this Pell's equation are given by ((x_1, y_1) = (2, 1)) and ((x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (2x_n + 3y_n, x_n + 2y_n)). - By induction, (2 nmid x_n) for even (n) and (x_n equiv 2 pmod{4}) for odd (n). Only (x_1 = 2) is a power of 2, leading to ((2^n, 3^m) = (4, 3)). 4. **Implications of the Claim**: - If the thief ever leaves (2, 3, 4, 8, 9), the police know where she is. - If she returns to (2, 3, 4, 8, 9), the police know her location on days when she is in a house with an odd number. - The police can strike on one of two consecutive Sundays. - If the thief never leaves (2, 3, 4, 8, 9), the police can strike (3, 3, 9, 9) on four consecutive Sundays. 5. **Strategy for the Police**: - Assume the two consecutive highest prime divisors ((2, 3)) or ((3, 2)) never occur. - If numbers ((n, n pm 2)) have the same highest prime divisor, it must be (2) since no number (>2) can divide both (n, n pm 2). - The pair ((n, n pm 2)) is ((2, 4)) or ((4, 2)). - The police can distinguish between two possibilities: 1. The thief is in the same house as two days earlier. 2. The thief moved in the same direction on the last two nights. 6. **Tracking the Thief**: - The police keep track of the set (S) of all possible pairs ((a_1, a_2)) of the house numbers the thief was in the first two days. - The path the thief follows is fully determined by the first two houses and the revealed highest prime divisors. - Whenever the police get new information, they can remove elements from (S). - After the second reveal, for every (a_1), there is at most one possible path starting at (a_1). - The police search the house the thief would be in the path starting at a minimal (a_1). - This way, the minimal (a_1) increases every week, and the police will catch the thief in a finite amount of time.

Let a_k = max_{1 leq i leq 9} a_i, and assume a_k = 1 without loss of generality. 6. **Analysis of k:** Examining this, we consider two scenarios - one where k geq 5 and the other where k leq 4. 7. **Case (a): k geq 5:** [ a_{k+1} geq 0.95 quad text{and} quad 1 geq a_{k+1} geq 0.95. ] [ a_{k+2} geq 1.9a_{k+1} - a_k geq 1.9 times 0.95 - 1 = 0.805. ] [ a_{k+3} geq 1.9a_{k+2} - a_{k+1} = 1.9 times 0.805 - 0.95 = 0.5295. ] [ a_{k+4} geq 1.9a_{k+3} - a_{k+2} geq 1.9 times 0.5295 - 0.805 = 0.00605. ] Hence, a_9 > 0, contradicting a_9 = 0. 8. **Case (b): k leq 4:** [ a_{k-1} geq 0.9. ] [ a_{k-2} geq 1.9a_{k-1} - a_k geq 1.9 times 0.9 - 1 = 0.71. ] [ a_{k-3} geq 1.9a_{k-2} - a_{k-1} = 1.9 times 0.71 - 0.9 = 0.349. ] Thus, a_1 > 0, contradicting a_1 = 0. Conclusion. Hence, there exists some i in {2, ldots, 8} such that a_{i-1} + a_{i+1} < 2a_i, and the statement remains valid if we change the 2 to 1.9. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Carla is dividing up insurance claims among 3 agents.

Assume that a pair ((x, y)) with (x < y) satisfies the required conditions: - (x) and (y) are relatively prime ((gcd(x, y) = 1)), - (y) divides (x^2 + m), - (x) divides (y^2 + m). 2. We claim that the pair (left(y, x_1right)) also satisfies the conditions, where (x_1 = frac{x^2 + m}{y}). 3. To verify this, observe that (x_1) is a positive integer because (y) divides (x^2 + m). Given that (x < y), it follows that (x_1 > y). 4. Now, we need to check that ((x_1, y)) satisfies the three required conditions: - First, we show that (gcd(x_1, y) = 1). Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that (gcd(x_1, y) = d > 1). Then, by definition, (d) divides both (x_1) and (y). Since (x_1 = frac{x^2 + m}{y}), we have: [ d mid frac{x^2 + m}{y} implies d mid x^2 + m. ] Additionally, since (d mid y) and (y mid x^2 + m), it follows that: [ d mid x^2 + m implies d mid x^2. ] Since (d mid x^2) and (d mid y) while (gcd(x, y) = 1), this leads to a contradiction because a common divisor greater than 1 would contradict (gcd(x, y) = 1). Therefore, (gcd(x_1, y) = 1). - Next, we need to check that (x_1) divides (y^2 + m). Given (x_1 = frac{x^2 + m}{y}), we must have: [ y mid x_1^2 + m. ] Since (x_1^2 + m = left(frac{x^2 + m}{y}right)^2 + m), this simplifies as: [ y mid left(frac{x^2 + m}{y}right)^2 + m. ] Since (left(frac{x^2 + m}{y}right)) is an integer, this condition is satisfied. - Finally, we need to check that (y mid x_1^2 + m). Given that: [ y mid left(frac{x^2 + m}{y}right)^2 + m, ] this condition is satisfied because (x_1^2 + m) as computed above already ensures that (x_1) divides (y^2 + m). 5.

According to the problem, the number of men and women are equal initially, so we have: [ H = M ] 3. Consider two cases: - Case 1: I am a man. - Case 2: I am a woman. Case 1: I am a man 4. If I (a man) am absent, the total number of people left in the club will be: [ H - 1 + M ] 5. The problem states that when a man is absent, ( frac{3}{4} ) of the remaining people are women: [ M = frac{3}{4}(H + M - 1) ] 6. Since ( H = M ), substituting ( M ) for ( H ) in the equation: [ M = frac{3}{4}(H + H - 1) Rightarrow H - 1 = frac{3}{4}(2H - 1) ] 7. Solving this equation step-by-step: [ H - 1 = frac{3}{4}(2H - 1) Rightarrow H - 1 = frac{3}{4}(2H - 1) Rightarrow H - 1 = frac{3}{4} cdot 2H - frac{3}{4} H - 1 = frac{3}{2}H - frac{3}{4} Rightarrow 4(H - 1) = 4 left( frac{3}{2}H - frac{3}{4} right) ] [ 4H - 4 = 6H - 3 Rightarrow -4 + 3 = 6H - 4H -1 = 2H Rightarrow H = -frac{1}{2} ] 8. This gives us ( H = frac{1}{2} ). As ( H ) and ( M ) must be integers, this solution is not valid. Case 2: I am a woman 9. If I (a woman) am absent, the total number of people left in the club will be: [ H + M - 1 ] 10. Now, since ( H + M = H + H = 2H ): [ (H + 1) - 1 = H ] 11. The equation when a girl is absent, is: [ H = frac{3}{4}(H + H - 1) Rightarrow H + 1 = frac{3}{4}(2H - 1 + 1) ] 12. Simplifying further: [ H + 1 = frac{3}{4}(2H) Rightarrow H + 1 = frac{3}{2}H ] [ H + 1 = 1.5H Rightarrow 1 = 0.5H ] [ H = 2 ] 13. Since ( H = 2 ), the number of women ( M ) is: [ M = H + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 ] # Conclusion: Therefore, there are 2 men and 3 women in the club, and I am a woman.

The height of this triangle is the y-coordinate of the point (8,12), which is 12 units. The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height So, the area of the larger triangle is: Area = (1/2) * 12 * 12 = 72 square units Now, the area of the smaller triangle is 1/9 of the area of the larger triangle, so: Area of smaller triangle = (1/9) * 72 = 8 square units The smaller triangle has a base with endpoints (6,0) and (10,0), so the length of the base is 10 - 6 = 4 units. Let's denote the height of the smaller triangle as h and the coordinates of the third point as (x, h). The area of the smaller triangle can also be calculated using the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height 8 = (1/2) * 4 * h Solving for h: 8 = 2 * h h = 4 So, the height of the smaller triangle is 4 units. Since the base of the triangle is on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of the third point must be equal to the height of the triangle. Therefore, the third point has coordinates (x, 4).

A group of students interested in biology conducted research to observe this phenomenon under a microscope. The information they collected from the internet is as follows. Information 1: Cells are cultured in a medium containing a certain type of BrdU, allowing the cells to proliferate continuously. When DNA replicates, BrdU can replace thymidine deoxyribonucleotides and be incorporated into the DNA strand. Information 2: Due to different incorporations of BrdU, after special staining, the depth of the color varies: in the chromatid, if only one strand of DNA incorporates BrdU, the staining will be darker; if both strands of DNA incorporate BrdU, it will reduce the degree of the DNA double helix, resulting in lighter staining.

The given condition states if the lengths of the segments ( AB, AC ) and ( AD ) can form the sides of a triangle, then we call such a line a triangulating line. 4. For a horizontal line to be triangular, the triangle inequality must hold for some combination of points. Concretely: [ |AB| + |AC| > |AD| ] 5. Using the distances between the points on the x-axis, we can write these conditions in terms of their coordinates: [ (x_{2} - x_{1}) + (x_{3} - x_{1}) > (x_{4} - x_{1}) ] 6. Simplify this inequality: [ (x_{2} + x_{3} - 2x_{1}) > x_{4} - x_{1} ] 7. Rearrange the inequality: [ x_{2} + x_{3} > x_{4} ] However, for a triangulating line, we can also consider: [ AB > CD implies (x_{2} - x_{1}) > (x_{4} - x_{3}) ] 8. Suppose, contrary to our claim, there exist two horizontal lines, intersecting the polynomial at ( A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}, D_{1} ) and ( A_{2}, B_{2}, C_{2}, D_{2} ) respectively, such that: - For the first line: ( |A_1 B_1| > |C_1 D_1| ) - For the second line: ( |A_2 B_2| leq |C_2 D_2| ) 9. Consider the coordinate mappings: - Let ( E ) be the midpoint of ( BC ) and AD with coordinates ( (x_{0}, y_{0}) ). 10. The polynomial ( P(x) ) given by ( y = P(x) ) can be transformed into another polynomial ( Q(u) ) in a shifted coordinate system ( (u, v) ) where ( u = x - x_{0}, v = y - y_{0} ). 11. As the graph of ( Q(u) ) in the new coordinates would still be a fourth-degree polynomial, it can be represented as: [ v = (u - u_1)(u - u_2)(u - u_3)(u - u_4) ] where ( u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4 ) are the x-coordinates of the intersection points ( A, B, C, D ). 12. Since the polynomial ( Q(u) ) is symmetric, we have ( Q(-u) = Q(u) ), thus the polynomial is symmetric about the y-axis. 13. Therefore, intersecting the curve with any horizontal line will produce segments where the lengths ( |AB| ) and ( |CD| ) exhibit a consistent relationship across any such line. 14. Consequently, the assumption that any horizontal line can be both triangulating and non-triangulating leads to a contradiction. Hence, all horizontal lines are either triangulating or none are triangulating. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{text{All horizontal lines are either triangulating or none are triangulating.}} ]"},{"prompt":"a triangle, the lengths of the three sides are 5, 12, and 13 respectively. The length of the median on the longest side of this triangle is ______.","completion":"Given that the lengths of the three sides of a triangle are 5, 12, and 13, we can check if this triangle is a right triangle by applying the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Let's verify this for our triangle: begin{align*} 5^2 + 12^2 &= 13^2 25 + 144 &= 169 169 &= 169 end{align*} Since this equation holds true, we confirm that the triangle is a right triangle with 13 as its hypotenuse. In a right triangle, the median on the hypotenuse has a special property: it is half the length of the hypotenuse. This is because the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle divides it into two equal parts. Therefore, the length of the median on the longest side (the hypotenuse) of this triangle is: begin{align*} frac{13}{2} &= 6.5 end{align*} Thus, the length of the median on the longest side of the triangle is boxed{frac{13}{2}}."},{"prompt":"A, B, and C are three given points on a line.

By the properties of similar triangles and parallel lines, we can use the intercept theorem (also known as Thales' theorem): [ frac{|CN|}{|AN|} = frac{|PC|}{|AQ|} = frac{|CB|}{|AC|} ] This relationship shows that (N) is a specific fixed point relative to (C) and the points (A) and (B) on the line. 2. **Determining the Positions of (P) and (Q):** By construction: - (P) is the intersection of the line through (C) parallel to (AD) and (BD), - (Q) is the intersection of the line through (C) parallel to (BD) and (AD). Since (AD) and (BD) are not parallel to the line (AB), (PQ) is a transversal intersecting these parallel lines at points (P) and (Q). 3. **Considering the Foot of the Perpendicular (M):** Let (M) be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from (C) onto (PQ). Since the perpendicular from a point to a line is fixed once the line is fixed, the set of all such perpendiculars forms a circle (because the locus of points equidistant from a fixed point is a circle). The radius of this circle is (CN) because the fixed distance (frac{|CN|}{|AN|} = frac{|CB|}{|AC|}) determines the circle's properties. 4. **Finding All Points (D) for a Fixed (M):** If (M) is a fixed point, then (D) must lie on a line parallel to (MN), passing through some fixed point (L) on the line (AB). This fixed point (L) is determined by: [ frac{|AL|}{|LB|} = frac{|AN|}{|CN|} ] Where (L) maintains the same ratio as (N) does relative to (A) and (C) on the segment (AB). Conclusion.

To find the combined height of the last two floors, we subtract the total height of the first 18 floors from the total height of the building: Combined height of last two floors = Total height of building - Total height of first 18 floors Combined height of last two floors = 61 meters - 54 meters = 7 meters Since there are two floors that make up this combined height of 7 meters, we need to find the height of each of these floors. We'll divide the combined height by 2: Height of each of the last two floors = Combined height of last two floors / 2 Height of each of the last two floors = 7 meters / 2 = 3.5 meters Now we know that each of the last two floors is 3.5 meters high. To find out how much higher these floors are compared to the other floors, we subtract the height of the other floors (3 meters) from the height of the last two floors: Additional height of last two floors = Height of each of the last two floors - Height of other floors Additional height of last two floors = 3.5 meters - 3 meters = 0.5 meters So, the last two floors are each boxed{0.5} meters higher than the other floors."},{"prompt":"Each child has some pencils and 13 skittles.

This can happen in two ways: 1. **Alex and Dylan form the team with higher numbers:** This occurs if Blair and Corey both draw cards that are numbered lower than a. The number of ways this can happen is binom{a-1}{2}, because there are a-1 cards lower than a and we need to choose 2 out of them. 2. **Alex and Dylan form the team with lower numbers:** This occurs if Blair and Corey both draw cards that are numbered higher than a+9. The number of ways this can happen is binom{43-a}{2}, because there are 52-(a+9) = 43-a cards higher than a+9 and we need to choose 2 out of them. Therefore, the probability p(a) that Alex and Dylan are on the same team can be calculated as follows: [p(a) = frac{binom{43-a}{2} + binom{a-1}{2}}{1225}] Simplifying the expression, we get: [p(a) = frac{(43-a)(42-a) + (a-1)(a-2)}{2 cdot 1225}] To find the minimum value of p(a) for which p(a) ge frac{1}{2}, we need to solve the inequality: [(43-a)(42-a) + (a-1)(a-2) ge 1225] Let's substitute a = 22 + b, and simplify the inequality: begin{align*} (43-a)(42-a) + (a-1)(a-2) &= (21-b)(20-b) + (21+b)(20+b) &= 2b^2 + 2 cdot 21 cdot 20 ge 1225 b^2 &ge frac{385}{2} = 192.5 > 13^2 end{align*} From this, we deduce that b > 13 or b < -13, which implies a = 22 + b < 9 or a > 35.

From the given conditions, we have two equations: - f(x) = 6 - g'(x) - f(1-x) = 6 + g'(1+x) By substituting x with 1-x in the first equation, we get: - f(1-x) = 6 - g'(1-x) Comparing this with the second given condition, we have: - 6 - g'(1-x) = 6 + g'(1+x) Simplifying this, we find that g'(1+x) = -g'(1-x). This shows that g'(x) is symmetric about the point (1,0). 2. Since g(x) - 2 is an odd function, we have: - g(x) - 2 = -[g(-x) - 2] - g(x) + g(-x) = 4 This implies that g(x) is symmetric about the point (0,2). Therefore, for x=0, we have g(0) = 2.

By substituting x with 1+x, we find: - g'(2+x) = -g'(x) And further, g'(4+x) = -g'(2+x) = g'(x), showing that g'(x), and thus f(x) = 6 - g'(x), is periodic with a period of 4. However, this does not directly imply that f'(x+2) = f'(x), making option boxed{B} incorrect. 4. From the symmetry of g'(x), we deduce that g(x) itself must also exhibit a form of symmetry. Specifically, we find that g(x+4) = g(x), confirming option boxed{C} is correct. 5.

This is because if there were two consecutive even numbers, their sum would be even, and the only even prime number is 2. However, (a + b^c) would not be 2 in general. - Since there are 9 numbers (an odd count), there must be at least two consecutive odd numbers. These two odd numbers must both be 1 to satisfy the prime condition. 5. **Limiting the Number of Different Numbers:** - If there are more than 4 numbers greater than 1, there would be two adjacent numbers both greater than 1. Let's denote these numbers as (a) and (b) with (a, b > 1). - Consider the sequence (1, a, b, c) with (a, b > 1). For (1 + a^b) to be prime, (a) must be even (since (a^b) is odd if (a) is even and (b) is odd). - For (a + b^c) to be prime, (b) must be odd (since (b^c) is odd if (b) is odd and (c) is even). 6. **Contradiction:** - If (a) is even and (b) is odd, then (a + 1) divides (1 + a^b) and (a + 1 < 1 + a^b), which means (1 + a^b) cannot be prime.

We need to count the number of possible three-term arithmetic sequences within this sequence, and compare it to the number of such sequences in the sequence (1, 2, ldots, k). 2. Let (t_3(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k)) denote the number of three-term arithmetic sequences that can be formed from the sequence (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k). 3. For an element (a_i) in the sequence to be the middle term of a three-term arithmetic sequence, there needs to be an element from the subset (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{i-1}) that serves as the first term, and an element from the subset (a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, ldots, a_k) that serves as the third term. 4. Denote by (t_3^i(a_1, ldots, a_k)) the number of such three-term arithmetic sequences where (a_i) is the middle term. The number (t_3^i(a_1, ldots, a_k)) is limited by the number of possible choices for the first and third terms. 5. Specifically, the first term must be one of the ((i-1)) elements before (a_i), and the third term must be one of the ((k-i)) elements after (a_i). Therefore, the number of sequences with (a_i) as the middle element satisfies: [ t_3^i(a_1, ldots, a_k) leq min(i-1, k-i) ] 6. Consider now the sequence (1, 2, ldots, k). For each (i), the potential three-term sequences where (i) is the middle term has exactly: [ t_3^i(1, 2, ldots, k) = min(i-1, k-i) ] since the structure of the sequence (1, 2, ldots, k) is strictly increasing and evenly spaced. 7. Summing up the possible counts for all (i), the desired quantities for the original sequence and the sequence (1, 2, ldots, k) yield: [ t_3(a_1, ldots, a_k) = sum_{i=1}^k t_3^i(a_1, ldots, a_k) ] and [ t_3(1, 2, ldots, k) = sum_{i=1}^k t_3^i(1, 2, ldots, k) ] 8.

We can express this as an equation: 2F = 3J (Equation 1) Next, we are told that if the February bill (F) had been 20 more, the ratio would have been 5 : 3. So, we can write this as: (F + 20) / J = 5 / 3 This gives us another equation: 3(F + 20) = 5J (Equation 2) Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of F and J. First, let's simplify Equation 2: 3F + 60 = 5J Now, we can use Equation 1 to substitute for J in terms of F: 2F = 3J So, J = 2F / 3 Substitute J in Equation 2: 3F + 60 = 5(2F / 3) Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: 9F + 180 = 10F Subtract 9F from both sides: 180 = F Now we know that the February bill was 180.

According to the problem, the total number of candies eaten is: [ P + M + T + O = 88 ] 3. From the given information, we know that: [ M + T = 57 ] 4. The problem further states that Pasha ate more candies than any of the others. Hence, ( P ) is greater than both ( M ) and ( T ), and also greater than ( O ). 5. To find the minimum value of ( P ), note that ( M ) and ( T ) must each eat at least 1 candy.

For k = 1, the statement is trivially true because any graph with at least one vertex contains a cycle, hence contains one cycle. Therefore, the statement holds for k = 1. 2. **Induction Hypothesis** Assume that the statement holds for k-1, i.e., if |H| geq s_{k-1}, then H contains k-1 disjoint cycles. 3. **Induction Step** We need to show that the statement holds for k. Consider a graph H with |H| geq s_k. Let C be a shortest cycle in H.

It is known that when x= sqrt{30}, f(x) reaches its minimum value. Also, f(5)=6+5-15=-4 and f(6)=5+6-15=-4. Therefore, the minimum value of f(n) is boxed{-4}. By setting the common difference d of the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, using the given S_8=8 and a_3=4, and applying the general term formula and sum formula of an arithmetic sequence, we can obtain a_1 and d, and then a_n and S_n. Substituting into dfrac{3a_n-S_n}{n}= dfrac{30}{n}+n-15 and using derivatives to study the monotonicity, extremum, and maximum/minimum values of the function, we can find the answer.

It is known that any 12 of them can be arranged on two pans of a balance, with six weights on each pan, such that the balance is achieved. Prove that all the weights have the same mass if it is known that: a) the mass of each weight is an integer number of grams; b) the mass of each weight is a rational number of grams; c) the mass of each weight can be any real (nonnegative) number.","completion":"We are given 13 weights and we know that any selection of 12 weights can be split into two groups of 6 equal weights that will balance the scales. We need to prove that all the weights have the same mass under three different conditions. Part (a): Mass of each weight is an integer. 1. Let ( w_1, w_2, ldots, w_{13} ) represent the weights. It is given that the sum of any 6 weights equals the sum of the remaining 6 weights. This can be written as: [ w_1 + w_2 + ldots + w_6 = w_7 + w_8 + ldots + w_{12}. ] 2. There are a total of 13 weights and for any group of 12 weights, we can apply the given balance condition. This can be represented by 12 linear equations with 13 variables (weights): [ begin{cases} w_1 + w_2 + ldots + w_6 = w_7 + w_8 + ldots + w_{12} w_1 + w_2 + ldots + w_5 + w_7 = w_6 + w_8 + ldots + w_{13} vdots end{cases} ] 3. To find a solution, let's consider some properties of these equations and the weights involved: - All weights are integers. Every weight can be expressed as ( w_i = k_i ), where ( k_i in mathbb{Z} ). 4. Due to the balancing condition, if we remove one weight and subtract it from the sum of the remaining weights, the sum must still balance. This implies that the sums composed of 12 weights are always even: [ S = w_1 + w_2 + cdots + w_{13} - w_i. ] Where ( S ) denotes the sum of the weights. Since the equation must be balanced and ( S ) must always be even, all weights must be integers of the same parity (even or odd). 5. Assume all weights are even without loss of generality. We could divide all the weights by 2, reducing the problem. This process is repeated until each weight must be an integer that starts dividing until they become the same because they are limited by the balances' condition. 6. Such repetitive division and checking would ultimately find that all weights ( w_i ) must be the same since if one of them is different, it violates the balancing condition. Based on this, all weights are indeed the same. ( boxed{text{All weights have the same integer mass}} ). --- Part (b): Mass of each weight is a rational number. 1. Let ( w_1, w_2, ldots, w_{13} ) be rational numbers. Assume each weight can be represented as ( w_i = frac{a_i}{b} ), where ( a_i, b in mathbb{Z} ) and ( b ) is a common denominator for all weights. Thus, [ w_1 + w_2 + cdots + w_{6} = w_7 + w_8 + cdots + w_{12}. ] 2. Introduce a new measure by setting ( n = b ) and redefine the weights ( w'_i = w_i cdot b ). Now ( w'_i ) are integers. 3. Since the original condition holds under integer scaling (or by multiplying every equation by ( b )), it’s reduced to the problem, we have proved in part (a). Thus, the weights as rational numbers must also be equal. (boxed{text{All weights have the same rational mass}}). --- Part (c): Mass of each weight can be any non-negative real number. 1. Let ( w_1, w_2, ldots, w_{13} ) be real numbers satisfying the same condition of balance. 2. This problem translates to a homogeneous system of linear equations with real coefficients: [ A vec{w} = 0, ] where ( A ) is a matrix with integer coefficients, (vec{w} = (w_1, w_2, ldots, w_{13})^T). 3. The solution to this system is a subspace in (mathbb{R}^{13}), and because the solution is homogeneous with more variables than equations, it implies there are infinite solutions aside from the trivial solution (vec{w} = 0). 4. Since any non-trivial solution to the system satisfies all weights being proportional, considering the balancing constraints will reduce to weights must all be equal to keep the balance. This concludes the proof for the case of real numbers.

When a new part becomes infested, it joins the existing block of infested parts. - Since the new part must have at least two infested neighbors, this action effectively reduces the boundary length by at least 2. - This is because the sides it shares with existing infested parts were previously contributing to the boundary length, and now they do not. 5. **Boundary Dynamics Over Time**: - After propagation of over one step, the net increase in the boundary cannot be positive. - Specifically, if a new part gets infested, its addition must come from requiring 2 shared edges, thus not raising the count beyond the initial maximum of 36, potentially making it lesser. 6. **Final Boundary Condition**: - Ultimately, if every part were to become infested, this would necessitate a boundary length of (4 times 10 = 40), which is impossible with the initial growth rule and initial maximum boundary sum. - The initial maximal boundary length of (36) cannot reach (40), thus showing a limitation in total infestation. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The whole field cannot become fully infested with weeds.}} ]"},{"prompt":"lden's current master bedroom is 309 sq ft and his master bath is 150 sq ft.

For a perimeter of 32, this becomes binom{32-1}{4-1} = binom{31}{3}. 2. **Excluding Degenerate Quadrilaterals:** A quadrilateral becomes degenerate (not forming a proper shape) if one side is greater than or equal to the sum of the other three sides.

Let (left(x_{1}, y_{1}right)) be the fundamental solution of the Pell's equation (x^{2} - d y^{2} = 1). 2. Given (d equiv 1 pmod{4}), it implies that ( d equiv 1 pmod{4} implies d equiv 1 pmod{4}). Therefore, by replacing (d) in the given equation, we have: [ x_{1}^{2} - d y_{1}^{2} equiv 1 pmod{4} ] 3. Analyzing the congruence relation modulo 4, we observe: [ x_{1}^{2} equiv 1 pmod{4} ] implies that (x_{1} equiv 1 pmod{2}) (since (1^2 equiv 1 pmod{4})) and [ y_{1}^{2} equiv 0 pmod{4} ] implies that (y_{1} equiv 0 pmod{2}). 4.

In reality, the interior angles on the same side of a transversal with two parallel lines are supplementary, not necessarily equal.

While vertical angles are indeed equal, not all pairs of equal angles are vertical angles. Equal angles can result from various geometric configurations, not just from intersecting lines creating vertical angles. Hence, this statement is false. **C**: The proposition that two lines parallel to the same line are parallel to each other is based on the Transitive Property of Parallel Lines. If line l is parallel to line m, and line m is parallel to line n, then line l is parallel to line n.

Therefore, we can write the equation: [ frac{1}{18} = 0.92C ] Now, to find the cost price ( C ), we solve for ( C ): [ C = frac{1}{18 times 0.92} ] [ C = frac{1}{16.56} ] Next, we are told that to achieve a certain percentage gain, he must sell the oranges at the rate of 11.420689655172414 a rupee. This means the selling price of one orange is ( frac{1}{11.420689655172414} ) rupees. Let's denote the desired percentage gain as ( G ). The selling price will then be ( 100% + G% ) of the cost price, or ( (1 + frac{G}{100})C ).

Define the function (L(a, b, c, d, x, y, z, t) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2). 3. Notice that (L(a, b, c, d, x, y, z, t) le L(0, 0, 0, 0, x+a, y+b, z+c, t+d)). This is because (a, b, c, d le 1) and squaring these values will always be less than or equal to the squared values of (x, y, z, t) which are greater than or equal to 1. 4.

This transformation shows that increasing the largest value and decreasing the smallest value (while keeping their sum constant) will not decrease the sum of squares. 8.

On the right side of each row, we have the sum of cubes of two consecutive numbers, where the larger number's square is the concluding term of the number sequence on the left. For the next row, we use the cubes: [ 4^3 + 5^3 = 64 + 125 = 189 ] Thus: [ 17+18+19+20+21+22+23+24+25 = 64 + 125 ] 4.

Now, let’s observe the pattern in two-factor multiplication: [ 3 cdot 3 = 9 ] [ 5 cdot 7 = 35 ] [ 7 cdot 13 = 91 ] In these factorizations, the first factor is the number of terms on the left, and the second factor is the middle term magnitude-wise. For the fifth row, we identify: [ 189 = 3 cdot 63 = 7 cdot 27 = 9 cdot 21 ] The recognized pattern continues with: [ 9 cdot 21 ] 6. For the 20th row, based on the 19th square + 1 up to the 20th square terms: [ n = 20 ] [ text{Starting term: } 19^2 + 1 = 362 ] [ text{Ending term: } 20^2 = 400 ] Sum these integers: [ S = frac{39(362 + 400)}{2} = 39 cdot 381 = 14859 ] On the right, calculate: [ 19^3 + 20^3 = 6859 + 8000 = 14859 ] Thus: [ boxed{The equality holds at the 20th sequence as well.} ] In conclusion, the left side of the 20th row's first, middle, and last terms, and their corresponding sum on the right, verify: [ boxed{The pattern and equality consistently apply in the 20th row.} ]"},{"prompt":"A roundrobin tennis tournament is organized with 10 players where each player plays every other player precisely once.

The period of sin(ax) is frac{2pi}{a}. Therefore, the period of sin(2x - frac{pi}{3}) is frac{2pi}{2} = pi.

These bisectors intersect at the incenter I of triangle ABC. 2. Construct lines parallel to l_A and l_B through point C. Let these lines intersect l_B and l_A at points D and E, respectively. 3. Given that line DE is parallel to line AB, we need to prove that triangle ABC is isosceles. First, we analyze the angles: 4. Since l_A is the angle bisector of angle A, we have: [ angle BAD = angle CAD ] Similarly, since l_B is the angle bisector of angle B, we have: [ angle ABE = angle CBE ] 5. Since DE parallel AB, corresponding angles are equal: [ angle EDB = angle ABD quad text{and} quad angle EBD = angle ADB ] 6. Notice that angle CBD = angle ABD and angle BCE = angle ABE because D and E lie on the angle bisectors l_B and l_A, respectively. 7. Therefore, we have: [ angle CBD = angle ABD = angle EDB quad text{and} quad angle BCE = angle ABE = angle EBD ] 8. This implies that angle BCE = angle EDB. Hence, quadrilateral EBDC is cyclic (opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary). 9. Since EBDC is a cyclic quadrilateral and DE parallel AB, EBDC must be an isosceles trapezoid. Therefore, we have: [ BC = ED ] 10. Similarly, consider quadrilateral EADC. Since DE parallel AB and EADC is cyclic, it must also be an isosceles trapezoid. Therefore, we have: [ AC = ED ] 11. Combining the results from steps 9 and 10, we get: [ AC = BC ] Thus, triangle ABC is isosceles. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Frank was reading through some books.

Given a triangle (ABC) with its incenter (I) (the point of intersection of the angle bisectors) and the circumscribed circle. 2. Construct the angle bisectors (AI, BI,) and (CI) of the triangle. The point where these bisectors intersect is the incenter (I). Find the points (A_1) and (C_1) on the circumscribed circle where the bisectors (AI) and (CI) intersect the circle, respectively. - (AI cap (ABC) = A_1) - (CI cap (ABC) = C_1) 3. Next, identify the midpoint (W) of arc (AC) that does not contain (B). This can be done by noting that (W) lies on the perpendicular bisector of the segment (AC), which is also the bisector of the angle subtended by arc (AC). 4. Construct the external angle bisector (BL) of (angle B) such that it intersects the line (AC) at point (L). This step uses the property that the external angle bisector meets the opposite side in such a way that the segment is divided in the ratio of the other two sides. 5. Observe that points (A_1, C_1,) and (L) lie on a straight line. This fact can be proved using Menelaus' theorem or similar triangle properties (for instance, considering the extended version of the angle bisector theorem). 6. Draw the line through (A_1) and (C_1) and extend it to find the intersection point (L) with line (AC). 7. Draw the line (BL) and find its intersection (K) with the circumscribed circle. Notably, (K) is one point of the diameter you seek since (BW) will be perpendicular to (K). 8. Finally, construct the line (KW). Since (K) and (W) are endpoints of the diameter (because (angle KBW) is a right angle), the line (KW) is the required diameter of the circumscribed circle. # Conclusion: Since (angle KBW = 90^circ), by the definition that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle, the line (KW) forms a diameter of the circumscribed circle. Thus, we have successfully constructed the diameter of the circumscribed circle using no more than seven straight-line constructions.

To convert km/hr to m/s, we use the following conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 63 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 63 * (1000 / 3600) m/s 63 * (10 / 36) m/s 63 * (5 / 18) m/s (63 * 5) / 18 m/s 315 / 18 m/s 17.5 m/s Now that we have the speed of the train in m/s, we can calculate the time it takes to pass the tree. The time (t) it takes for the train to pass the tree can be calculated using the formula: t = distance / speed The distance the train needs to cover to pass the tree is equal to the length of the train, which is 630 m.

This is because a cubic function can intersect the x-axis at most three times, but we want it to intersect only once. 4. **Calculating the derivative**: To find the local minimum or maximum, we calculate the derivative of the function f'(x)=3ax^2-6x. 5. **Finding the critical points**: Setting the derivative equal to zero gives us the critical points: 3ax^2-6x=0 Rightarrow x(3ax-6)=0 Rightarrow x=0, x=frac{6}{3a}=frac{2}{a}. 6. **Analyzing the critical points**: We are given that the zero point x_0 > 0, so we are interested in the point x=frac{2}{a}. This point is a local minimum if a<0 and a local maximum if a>0. 7. **Finding the value of a**: Since the function intersects the x-axis at the local minimum/maximum, we have f(frac{2}{a})=0. Substituting x=frac{2}{a} into the function gives us a(frac{2}{a})^3-3(frac{2}{a})^2+1=0 Rightarrow frac{8}{a^2}-frac{12}{a}+1=0. 8. **Solving the quadratic equation**: The quadratic formula gives us a=frac{12 pm sqrt{144-32}}{16}=frac{12 pm sqrt{112}}{16}=frac{3 pm sqrt{7}}{4}. However, we are interested in the range of a, not the specific values. 9. **Determining the range of a**: Since we want the function to open downwards and have a local maximum at x=frac{2}{a}, we need a<0. Looking at the quadratic equation, we see that the discriminant is positive, which means the equation has two distinct real roots. However, only one of these roots can be negative, and it must be less than -2 to ensure that x_0 > 0. 10. **Final answer**: Therefore, the range of a is boxed{left( -infty ,-2 right)}."},{"prompt":"Camille the snail lives on the surface of a regular dodecahedron.

In a net representation, this point is denoted as (J). 4. **Using Geometric Relations** The objective is to find the distance (L) between points (A) and (J) on the net.

This means that [ min_{1 le i < j le 4} P_iP_j = 1 ] and we need to minimize the sum of the six distances between the four points. 2. **Consider the geometric configuration**: To minimize the sum of the distances, we need to consider the geometric arrangement of the points. One possible configuration is to place the points at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. However, since we are working in a plane, we need to consider planar configurations. 3. **Planar configurations**: The simplest planar configuration is to place the points at the vertices of a square. In this case, the distances between adjacent vertices are 1, and the distances between diagonally opposite vertices are (sqrt{2}). 4. **Calculate the distances for a square**: - There are 4 edges of length 1. - There are 2 diagonals of length (sqrt{2}). Therefore, the sum of the distances is: [ 4 times 1 + 2 times sqrt{2} = 4 + 2sqrt{2} ] 5. **Calculate the expression**: Since the minimum distance is 1, the expression simplifies to: [ frac{sum_{1 le i < j le 4} P_iP_j}{min_{1 le i < j le 4} P_iP_j} = 4 + 2sqrt{2} ] 6. **Verify if this is the minimum**: To ensure that this is the minimum value, we need to consider other possible configurations.

However, the shopkeeper offered a discount of 5%. This means the article was sold at 95% of the intended selling price without discount. So, the selling price with the discount (SP_discount) would be 95% of 134, which is: SP_discount = 0.95 * 134 = 127.30 Now, we need to calculate the profit percentage with the discount.

Given that the average area of each triangle is frac{1}{n-2}, combining two triangles will give us an area of at least frac{2}{n-2}. 8. **Ensuring Minimum Area:** For large n, frac{2}{n-2} can be very small. However, since the total area is 1, and we are combining areas, we can always find a combination of triangles that will give us a quadrilateral of area at least frac{1}{2}. 9. **Conclusion:** Therefore, every convex n-gon of area 1 contains a quadrilateral of area at least frac{1}{2}. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Let i be the imaginary unit.

Let ( P = frac{r}{s} ), where ( r ) and ( s ) are integers and are coprime (i.e., ( gcd(r, s) = 1 )). 2. Given that ( P ) is a root of the polynomial ( f(x) = x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + ldots + a_n ) with integer coefficients, we substitute ( frac{r}{s} ) into ( f(x) ): [ fleft(frac{r}{s}right) = left(frac{r}{s}right)^n + a_1 left(frac{r}{s}right)^{n-1} + ldots + a_n = 0 ] 3. Multiply every term by ( s^n ) to clear the denominators: [ r^n + a_1 r^{n-1}s + a_2 r^{n-2}s^2 + ldots + a_n s^n = 0 ] 4. Notice that starting from the second term, every term in the equation contains a factor of ( s ). Since the entire sum equals zero, and all terms except the first term are divisible by ( s ), it follows that the first term ( r^n ) must also be divisible by ( s ): [ r^n equiv 0 (text{mod} s) ] 5. However, since ( r ) and ( s ) are coprime ((gcd(r, s) = 1)), the only way ( r^n ) can be divisible by ( s ) is if ( s = 1 ). Therefore: [ P = frac{r}{s} = r quad text{(where ( s = 1 ))} ] This implies that ( P ) is an integer. 6. Since ( P ) is an integer, we now consider the polynomial division of ( f(x) ) by ( x - P ): [ f(x) = (x - P)g(x) + A ] where ( g(x) ) is the quotient polynomial and ( A ) is the remainder, which is a constant because the degree of ( x - P ) is 1. 7. By substituting ( x = P ) into the polynomial equation ( f(x) ): [ f(P) = (P - P)g(P) + A = 0 ] This gives us: [ A = 0 ] Therefore, we can rewrite ( f(x) ) as: [ f(x) = (x - P)g(x) ] 8. Now, for any integer ( m ), we substitute ( m ) into the above equation: [ f(m) = (m - P)g(m) ] This shows that ( f(m) ) is divisible by ( (m - P) ) for any integer ( m ). # Conclusion: Therefore, we have shown that ( P ) is an integer and that ( f(m) ) is divisible by ( P - m ) for any integer ( m ).

Determine the range of values for b.","completion":"(1) Since the tangent line at P(1, f(1)) is y = 3x + 1, the derivative of f(x) at x = 1 must be 3, i.e., f'(1) = 3. The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + b. Plugging in x = 1 we get: f'(1) = 3 cdot 1^2 + 2a cdot 1 + b = 3 + 2a + b = 3. This simplifies to: 2a + b = 0 quad text{(i)}. Also, f(1) must match the y-intercept of the tangent line, which is 2, so we have f(1) = 1^3 + a cdot 1^2 + b cdot 1 + c = 2. This simplifies to: a + b + c + 1 = 2 quad text{(ii)}. Since y = f(x) has an extreme value at x = -2, f'(-2) = 0. Thus, from the derivative: f'(-2) = 3 cdot (-2)^2 + 2a cdot (-2) + b = 0. This simplifies to: 12 - 4a + b = 0 quad text{(iii)}. Solving the system of equations given by (i), (ii), and (iii) to find a, b, and c: From (i), we find that b = -2a, Substituting b in (iii): 12 - 4a - 2a = 0, which gives 6a = 12, hence, a = 2. Substituting a back into the equation (i), we get b = -2a = -4. Now, substituting a and b into equation (ii), we get c = 5. Therefore, the expression for f(x) is boxed{f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x + 5}. (2) To be monotonically increasing on the interval [-2, 1], the derivative f'(x) must be greater than or equal to 0 on this interval. Now we have a = 2 and therefore b = -2a = -4. The derivative becomes f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2a cdot x + b = 3x^2 + 4x - 4. Given that the value of a is fixed at 2, we only need to adjust the value of b to ensure that the derivative is non-negative on [-2, 1]. Considering that f'(x) is a parabola opening upwards (since the coefficient of x^2 is positive), and knowing it must be non-negative at its minimum for the function to be monotonically increasing, we determine the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola as follows: x_{text{vertex}} = -frac{4}{2 cdot 3} = -frac{2}{3}. The vertex occurs at x = -frac{2}{3}, which lies within the interval [-2, 1]. Therefore, we need to ensure f'(x) is non-negative at this point. Substituting x = -frac{2}{3} and a = 2 into f'(x), we get: f'left(-frac{2}{3}right) = 3left(-frac{2}{3}right)^2 + 4left(-frac{2}{3}right) - 4 = 4 - frac{8}{3} - 4 = -frac{8}{3} + frac{12}{3} - frac{12}{3} = -frac{8}{3}. Since b is already defined to be -4, we do not have a range for b in this context, and b is simply equal to -4. However, if b were variable, we would set f'(x) at the vertex to be non-negative, and b geq -frac{8}{3} for the function to be monotonically increasing.

Since p and q are coprime, there is no common divisor between them other than 1. 2. **Initial Consideration:** - We treat the pie as a long rectangle. Suppose we cut it into p equal pieces, this would require p-1 cuts.

What is the minimum total cost?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Functional Relationship for Type A Fruit Given that the cost per square meter for the first 300m^{2} is 14 yuan, and for any area beyond that, it's 10 yuan per square meter, we can establish the cost function for when the planting area x exceeds 300m^{2}. 1. For the first 300m^{2}, the cost is 300 times 14 yuan. 2. For any area beyond 300m^{2}, the cost is 10 yuan per square meter. Thus, for the excess area, the cost is 10(x - 300) yuan. Combining these, the total cost y when x > 300m^{2} is: [y = 300 times 14 + 10(x - 300)] [y = 4200 + 10x - 3000] [y = 10x + 1200] Therefore, the functional relationship between y and x when the planting area of type A fruit exceeds 300m^{2} is boxed{y = 10x + 1200}. Part 2: Minimizing Total Cost with Constraints Given that the total planting area for types A and B is 1200m^{2}, and the cost for type A is as derived above, and for type B is 12 yuan per square meter, we can find the total cost w. 1. The cost for type A when x > 300m^{2} is 10x + 1200. 2. The cost for type B, given its area is (1200 - x)m^{2}, is 12(1200 - x).

Since -2 < 0, the total cost w decreases as x increases within this range. Thus, to minimize w, we set x to its maximum value within the range, which is 900m^{2}.

After the second discount of 20% on the already discounted price, the price becomes ( 0.90P - 0.20(0.90P) = 0.90P times (1 - 0.20) = 0.90P times 0.80 ).

What is the probability that at least one of the numbers Ben chooses is a multiple of 3?","completion":"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the total number of integers between 1 and 50, inclusive, that are multiples of 3. We can find this by noting that the smallest multiple of 3 in this range is 1 cdot 3 = 3 and the largest is 16 cdot 3 = 48. This gives us a total of 16 multiples of 3. Next, we calculate the number of integers in this range that are not multiples of 3. Since there are 50 integers in total and 16 of these are multiples of 3, the number of integers that are not multiples of 3 is 50 - 16 = 34. The probability that a randomly chosen integer from 1 to 50 is not a multiple of 3 is then frac{34}{50}.

Illustration 3. The required points (M) and (N) on the skew edges (AD) and (EB) respectively are determined by the line that intersects both edges and is perpendicular to both (normal transversal). This implies that (MN) is parallel to the plane of the projection, and thus its true length is visible in the projection. 4. Since the projection plane is parallel to the edge (EB), (MN) is also perpendicular to (EB) in the projection. 5. The ratio of corresponding segments in the projection is the same as in space because parallel projection preserves these ratios.

Since the slope of AC is 4/3, we can write: ( frac{opposite}{adjacent} = frac{b}{a} = frac{4}{3} ) Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the lengths of the sides of the right triangle: ( AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 ) ( 225^2 = b^2 + a^2 ) We can express \\"a\\" in terms of \\"b\\" using the slope ratio: ( a = frac{3}{4}b ) Now, substitute this expression for \\"a\\" into the Pythagorean theorem: ( 225^2 = b^2 + (frac{3}{4}b)^2 ) ( 225^2 = b^2 + frac{9}{16}b^2 ) ( 225^2 = frac{16}{16}b^2 + frac{9}{16}b^2 ) ( 225^2 = frac{25}{16}b^2 ) Now, solve for \\"b^2\\": ( b^2 = frac{16}{25} times 225^2 ) Take the square root of both sides to find \\"b\\": ( b = sqrt{frac{16}{25}} times 225 ) ( b = frac{4}{5} times 225 ) ( b = 180 ) So the length of AB is boxed{180} units."},{"prompt":"Solve for x: x = dfrac{45^2}{7 frac{3}{4}}.","completion":"Firstly, address the denominator: 7 - frac{3}{4} = frac{28}{4} - frac{3}{4} = frac{25}{4}.

We split our consideration into two cases based on the value of (sigma(n)): - **Case 1: ( sigma(n) = n )**: If (sigma(n) = n), then (n) is a fixed point, forming a cycle of length 1. Hence, the problem reduces to counting permutations of ({1, 2, ldots, n-1}) with (k-1) cycles. There are (c_{n-1}(k-1)) such permutations. - **Case 2: ( sigma(n) = m ) and ( m < n )**: If ( sigma(n) = m ) where (m) is some integer less than (n), (n) will be part of a cycle of length at least 2. Construct (tau) by removing (n) from (sigma) forming a permutation of ({1, 2, ldots, n-1}) still retaining (k) cycles. To rebuild (sigma) from (tau), insert (n) into the cycle of (tau) that contains (m). Since (n) could pair with any of the (n-1) elements less than it, there are ((n-1)c_{n-1}(k)) such permutations. By combining both cases, we get the recurrence relation: [ c_n(k) = c_{n-1}(k-1) + (n-1)c_{n-1}(k) ] 2. **Summing the Recurrence Relation**: Now, considering the polynomial (P_n(x)) defined as: [ P_n(x) = sum_{sigma in mathfrak{S}_n} x^{mathrm{cyc}(sigma)} = sum_{k=1}^{n} c_n(k) x^k ] Substituting the recurrence relation for (c_n(k)) into (P_n(x)) gives: [ P_n(x) = sum_{k=1}^n c_n(k) x^k = sum_{k=1}^n left[ c_{n-1}(k-1) + (n-1) c_{n-1}(k) right] x^k ] 3. **Simplification**: We rearrange and simplify the sums: [ P_n(x) = sum_{k=1}^n c_{n-1}(k-1) x^k + (n-1) sum_{k=1}^n c_{n-1}(k) x^k ] Notice that the first term shifts from (x^{k-1}): [ sum_{k=1}^n c_{n-1}(k-1) x^k = x sum_{k=1}^{n-1} c_{n-1}(k) x^k = x P_{n-1}(x) ] And the second term: [ (n-1) sum_{k=1}^n c_{n-1}(k) x^k = (n-1) sum_{k=1}^{n-1} c_{n-1}(k) x^k= (n-1) P_{n-1}(x) ] Thus, we combine them: [ P_n(x) = x P_{n-1}(x) + (n-1) P_{n-1}(x) = (x + n-1) P_{n-1}(x) ] 4. **Conclusion**: By iteratively applying this recurrence, starting from: [ P_1(x) = x ] Applying the recurrence relation repeatedly results in: [ P_n(x) = (x+n-1)(x+n-2) cdots (x+1)x ] It becomes apparent that the roots of (P_n(x)) are (-1, -2, ldots, -(n-1)).

To find out how many marbles he has now, we need to add these amounts together: 87 (initial marbles) + 8 (from Dylan) + 12.5 (from Ellie) = 107.5 marbles However, it's unusual to have half a marble, as marbles are typically counted in whole numbers. If we assume that the 12.5 marbles is a mistake and should also be a whole number, then we would round it to the nearest whole number before adding. If we round 12.5 to the nearest whole number, it becomes 13.

First, let's define the relevant variables: - Let CF = a. - Let BE = b. From these definitions, we can determine the dimensions of the rectangle and relevant segments: - Since F is the midpoint of CD, the full length of CD = 2a. - By the problem statement, BC = 3b. - Therefore, CE = 2b (since E extends twice the length BE on the same line as C). Next, we calculate the area of the shaded region. The shaded region's area is the difference between the areas of two triangles: triangle BCD and triangle ECF. The area of triangle BCD is: [ S_{triangle BCD} = frac{1}{2} times text{Base} times text{Height} = frac{1}{2} times CD times BC = frac{1}{2} times 2a times 3b = 3ab ] The area of triangle ECF is: [ S_{triangle ECF} = frac{1}{2} times text{Base} times text{Height} = frac{1}{2} times a times 2b = ab ] Thus, the area of the shaded region is: [ S_{text{shaded}} = S_{triangle BCD} - S_{triangle ECF} = 3ab - ab = 2ab ] Now, we calculate the area of the entire rectangle ABCD: [ S_{ABCD} = CD times BC = 2a times 3b = 6ab ] Finally, we find the ratio of the rectangle's area to the shaded region's area: [ text{Ratio} = frac{S_{ABCD}}{S_{text{shaded}}} = frac{6ab}{2ab} = 3 ] Conclusion: The number of times the area of the rectangle ABCD is the area of the shaded region is: [ boxed{3} ]"},{"prompt":"The altitude of an equilateral triangle is 2sqrt{3} units.

Then: [ b = dk^2 ] 7. **Verify ( d ) divides ( a ):** From equation (1): [ u + v + w = u'(u' + v')k + v'(u' + v')k - u'v'k = (u' + v')(u' + v')k - u'v'k = (u' + v')^2 k - u'v'k ] Since ( k mid a ), it follows that ( d mid a ).

Since line l passes through the center of the circle and A is the midpoint of BP, we can conclude that line l is symmetrical with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, the slope of line l can be either positive or negative, depending on the direction it intersects the y-axis and the circle. To find the equation of line l, we consider two cases based on the slope: 1. If the slope is positive, the line intersects the y-axis above the center of the circle. Given that A is the midpoint of BP, the line must have a slope that allows it to intersect the circle at two points symmetrically placed with respect to the center. This leads to the equation 2x - y - 1 = 0. 2. If the slope is negative, the line intersects the y-axis below the center of the circle. Similarly, for A to be the midpoint of BP, the line's slope and position must allow it to intersect the circle symmetrically. This results in the equation 2x + y - 11 = 0.

Since overline{KL} is perpendicular to diagonal overline{LN}, we can express KP (the projection of KL on overline{KN}) in terms of beta as KP = 28sinbeta. Similarly, because overline{KO} is part of overline{KM}, we can express KP in terms of alpha as KP = 8cosalpha. 3. By equating these two expressions for KP, we have 28sinbeta = 8cosalpha. Additionally, we know that KN can be expressed in terms of alpha and beta due to the given sides MN = 65 and KL = 28. Thus, KN = frac{65}{sinalpha} = frac{28}{sinbeta}, leading to the equation 65sinbeta = 28sinalpha. 4.

Thus, OA = OB must hold. - This equality for all lines l passing through O indicates that O must be the center of symmetry for the polygon, and the polygon is centrally symmetric with respect to O.

This is because the slope k = -2 can be thought of as the tangent of an angle in the unit circle where the angle is measured from the positive x-axis to the line. The angle whose tangent is -2 is the angle theta such that tan(theta) = -2. Since tan(pi - theta) = tan(theta) for any angle theta, and considering the negative sign, we adjust the angle to be in the correct quadrant, leading to theta = pi - arctan 2.

By geometric observation, a set of three non-collinear points form a plane, and to add a perpendicular condition, we need to consider points on different faces of the cube. To ensure that every chosen segment has a perpendicular counterpart, we can start by examining the smallest plane configuration in the cube: a rectangle formed by any four coplanar vertices. For any side of this rectangle, we need at least one vertex on a non-coplanar face to create a perpendicular line segment. This non-coplanar face shares only one vertex with the original rectangle, and thus four vertices are from one face, and one vertex is from an adjacent face. At this point, we have five vertices and guaranteed perpendicularly for segments within the original face. Now, consider the remaining vertices. To extend the perpendicularity condition to segments connecting vertices on different faces, we must add the vertex diagonally opposite to the fifth vertex (the one vertex on the adjacent face). This addition satisfies that segments crossing the cube diagonally will also have perpendicular counterparts. In summary, with a minimum of 6 vertices, every line formed by these vertices will have a perpendicular counterpart. However, after having 6 vertices, we can also add the remaining 7^{th} and 8^{th} vertices without violating the condition, as these will only create more segments with perpendicular counterparts. Hence, the possible values of k are 6, 7, or 8. Therefore, the solution is: boxed{6, 7, 8}"},{"prompt":"Which of the following equations is not true?

The area covered by the crossroad running along the length (60 m) is: Area = length × width of road Area = 60 m × 3 m Area = 180 m² The area covered by the crossroad running along the width (40 m) is: Area = width × width of road Area = 40 m × 3 m Area = 120 m² However, the intersection area, which is a square of side 3 m (the width of the road), has been counted twice. So, we need to subtract it once to get the correct total area of the crossroads. The area of the intersection (a square with a side of 3 m) is: Area = side × side Area = 3 m × 3 m Area = 9 m² Now, let's calculate the total area covered by the crossroads: Total crossroads area = Area along length + Area along width - Intersection area Total crossroads area = 180 m² + 120 m² - 9 m² Total crossroads area = 300 m² - 9 m² Total crossroads area = 291 m² Finally, we can find the area of the lawn by subtracting the total crossroads area from the total area of the park: Area of lawn = Total area of park - Total crossroads area Area of lawn = 2400 m² - 291 m² Area of lawn = 2109 m² So, the area of the lawn is boxed{2109} m²."},{"prompt":"There are two wooden bars with lengths of 30cm and 50cm, respectively.

Thus, each brick has dimensions of 1 times 2 times 4 in this new unit system. 2. **Constructing Rectangular Prisms**: Assume we want to build a rectangular prism using these smaller 1 times 2 times 4 bricks where all edges of the bricks are aligned parallel to the edges of the prism. Suppose the desired prism has dimensions a times 2b times 4c, where a, b, and c are positive integers. 3. **Building the Prism**: Construct bc numbers of a times 2 times 4 prisms from the small bricks. Then place b of these a times 2 times 4 prisms side by side so that the 2 unit edges are aligned and concatenate this c times by stacking them: - First, create bc prisms of a times 2 times 4 from the small bricks. - Next, place b of these side by side aligning the 2 unit edges. - Repeat this process c times by stacking, resulting in c rows each containing a prism of a times 2b times 4. This constructs a prism of dimensions a times 2b times 4c using the small bricks, with all brick edges parallel to the prism edges. 4. **Uniqueness of the Constructed Prism Dimensions**: To show that no other dimension rectangular prism can be constructed, observe: - Every face of the small bricks has an area that is even (since the brick dimensions are 1 times 2 times 4). - Consequently, any face of the resulting rectangular prism must also have an even area because it is built from these even-area faces. 5. **Edge Length Analysis**: The edge lengths of the prism must conform such that at least one of the dimensions aligns with the factor of 4 (derived from the length and arrangement of small bricks): - Assume it is not true. Then, since the volume of each brick is 8 (1 times 2 times 4 = 8), the volume of any constructed prism must be divisible by 8. - Let ( a, b, c ) be dimensions of the prism where all dimensions are expressed such as ( 2d, 2e, 2f ) for appropriate odd integers ( d, e, f ). 6. **Chessboard Coloring Argument**: - Imagine dividing the rectangular prism into 2 times 2 times 2 cubes and use a chessboard coloring scheme (where no two touching cubes share the same color): - Each small brick will then contain an equal number of black and white 1 times 1 times 1 cubes. - Thus, if the prism was built successfully, it would contain the same number of black and white cubes. - However, since the total count of such 2 times 2 times 2 cubes within the larger a times 2b times 4c prism is ( def ), and this must be an odd integer, there would be an imbalance in the counts of black and white cubes by an odd number. This contradicts the required equal count, thus proving the impossibility. # Conclusion: Therefore, the only possible dimensions of the rectangular prism that can be constructed using these bricks, with aligned edges, must be of the form a times 2b times 4c where a, b, c are positive integers.

Lines l_1 and l_2 are drawn parallel to PT and PS, so triangle QRV sim triangle PUT by AA similarity (both have angle QRV = angle PUT = 60^circ and parallel sides from construction). - The area of triangle PUT is calculated as frac{1}{2} times 9 times 15 times sin 120^circ = frac{135sqrt{3}}{4}. The ratio of triangle PUT to triangle QRV in terms of area is the square of the side length ratio, left(frac{6sqrt{3}}{24}right)^2 = frac{1}{16}.

Step-by-step solution: 1. **Expressing ( 2n + 1 ) as a square:** Let's assume ( 2n + 1 ) is a perfect square. Thus, there exists an integer ( k ) such that: [ 2n + 1 = k^2 ] Since ( k^2 ) is an odd number (as the left-hand side is odd), let ( k = 2a + 1 ) for some integer ( a ). Substituting ( k ) into the equation, we get: [ 2n + 1 = (2a + 1)^2 ] Expanding the equation: [ 2n + 1 = 4a^2 + 4a + 1 ] Subtracting 1 from both sides: [ 2n = 4a^2 + 4a ] Dividing by 2: [ n = 2a^2 + 2a ] Therefore, [ n + 1 = 2a^2 + 2a + 1 = a^2 + (a^2 + 2a + 1) = a^2 + (a+1)^2 ] 2. **Conversely, assume ( n + 1 = a^2 + (a+1)^2 ):** Under this assumption: [ n + 1 = a^2 + (a+1)^2 = a^2 + a^2 + 2a + 1 = 2a^2 + 2a + 1 ] Hence: [ n = 2a^2 + 2a ] Then: [ 2n + 1 = 2(2a^2 + 2a) + 1 = 4a^2 + 4a + 1 = (2a + 1)^2 ] Thus, ( 2n + 1 ) is indeed a perfect square. 3. **Expressing ( 3n + 1 ) as a square:** Let's assume ( 3n + 1 ) is also a perfect square. Thus, there exists an integer ( m ) such that: [ 3n + 1 = m^2 ] As ( m^2 ) is a perfect square, let ( m = 3b + z ) for some integer ( b ) and ( z in {-1, 1} ). We can check both cases: - **Case ( z = 1 ):** [ 3n + 1 = (3b + 1)^2 ] Expanding the equation: [ 3n + 1 = 9b^2 + 6b + 1 ] Subtracting 1 from both sides: [ 3n = 9b^2 + 6b ] Dividing by 3: [ n = 3b^2 + 2b ] Hence: [ n + 1 = 3b^2 + 2b + 1 = b^2 + 2(b^2 + b + 1) = b^2 + 2(b+1)^2 ] - **Case ( z = -1 ):** [ 3n + 1 = (3b - 1)^2 ] Expanding the equation: [ 3n + 1 = 9b^2 - 6b + 1 ] Subtracting 1 from both sides: [ 3n = 9b^2 - 6b ] Dividing by 3: [ n = 3b^2 - 2b ] This is not consistent with the expression ( 3b^2 + 2b ), so this case does not yield valid results. 4. **Conversely, assume ( n + 1 = b^2 + 2(b + 1)^2 ):** Under this assumption: [ n + 1 = b^2 + 2(b + 1)^2 = b^2 + 2(b^2 + 2b + 1) = 3b^2 + 4b + 2 ] Thus: [ n = 3b^2 + 4b + 1 - 1 = 3b^2 + 4b ] Then: [ 3n + 1 = 3(3b^2 + 4b) + 1 = 9b^2 + 12b + 1 = (3b + 2)^2 ] Therefore, ( 3n + 1 ) is indeed a perfect square. Conclusion: Hence, we have shown that ( 2n + 1 ) and ( 3n + 1 ) are both perfect squares if and only if: [ n + 1 = a^2 + (a+1)^2 = b^2 + 2(b+1)^2 ] for some integers ( a ) and ( b ).

Is it true that the tetrahedron is regular?","completion":"# Problem: We know that for any point ( P ) inside the tetrahedron ( A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4} ), the inequality [ P A_{i} + P A_{j} + P A_{k} < A_{l} A_{i} + A_{l} A_{j} + A_{l} A_{k} ] holds for any permutation ( i, j, k, l ) of the numbers ( 1, 2, 3, 4 ). Is it true that the tetrahedron must be regular? Firstly, we demonstrate that the given inequality does not necessarily imply that the tetrahedron must be regular by showing that it holds for any tetrahedron with equal edges (an equilateral tetrahedron). An equilateral tetrahedron is defined as having congruent faces. This can be formed by considering any rectangular prism and selecting the endpoints of two non-parallel face diagonals. Let the edges of the rectangular prism be of lengths ( a, b, ) and ( c ). By Pythagorean theorem, the edges of the tetrahedron are: [ sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, quad sqrt{b^2 + c^2}, quad text{and} quad sqrt{a^2 + c^2} ] From this, it is obvious that the tetrahedron will be regular only if the rectangular prism is a cube. # Auxiliary Theorem: Let ( KL ) and ( MN ) be two non-parallel face diagonals on opposite faces of some rectangular prism ( mathcal{T} ). Then for any interior point ( R ) on the segment ( KL ), the inequality [ RM + RN < KM + KN ] holds. Proof: Reflect ( mathcal{T} ) around the mid-point ( F ) of diagonal ( KL ) (as shown in the figure). Let ( M' ) be the reflection of point ( M ). Since ( K ) and ( M ) are reflected to ( L ) and ( M' ) respectively, ( KM parallel LM' ) and ( KM = LM' ) making ( KMLM' ) a parallelogram. Therefore, [ K M' = ML = KN quad text{and} quad LM' = KM = LN ] implying that ( KLM' ) and ( KLN ) are congruent triangles. This means ( RM' = RN ), so it suffices to prove [ RM + RM' < KM + KN ] By symmetry, assume ( R ) lies inside the triangle ( KMM' ) within the parallelogram. If ( R ) coincides with ( F ), the triangle inequality directly gives (1). When ( R ) is an interior point of ( KMM' ), [ R M + R M' < K M + KM' ] by the result from problem B.4325(a). # Returning to the Original Problem: Let ( A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4} ) be an equilateral tetrahedron with edge lengths ( e, f, g ) as previously defined. We need to verify the inequality [ P A_{i} + P A_{j} < A_{4} A_{i} + A_{4} A_{j} ] for points ( P ) inside the tetrahedron. For convenience, reflect for a distribution where ( R_{k} ) intersects edge ( A_{4} A_{k} ) from the plane ( A_{i} A_{j} ). Given the intersection points within the triangle ( A_{i}A_{j}R_{k} ) prove with relations [ P A_{i} + P A_{j} < R_k A_i + R_k A_j ] often utilizing auxiliary theorem to show ( R_k A_i + R_k A_j < A_4 A_i + A_4 A_j ). Combining results, [ P A_{i} + P A_{j} < A_{4} A_{i} + A_{4} A_{j} ] Summing up for all ( i,j ): [ 2left(P A_{1} + P A_{2} + P A_{3}right) < 2left(A_{4} A_{1} + A_{4} A_{2} + A_{4} A_{3}right) = 2(e + f + g) ] Thus, [ P A_{1} + P A_{2} + P A_{3} < e + f + g ] confirming that such inequalities are verified for any configuration satisfying symmetry. Hence, other tetrahedron shapes also meet the specified condition without implying regularity. Hence, the regularity of a tetrahedron is not guaranteed by the given condition. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Which angles satisfy between 0 and (2 pi) the following system of equations: [ begin{aligned} & sin x+cos y=0 & cos x sin y=frac{1}{2} end{aligned} ]","completion":"We need to find the angles between (0) and (2pi) that satisfy the following system of equations: [ begin{aligned} & sin x + cos y = 0 & cos x sin y = -frac{1}{2} end{aligned} ] 1. **Analyzing the first equation:** (sin x + cos y = 0) This can be rewritten as: [ cos y = -sin x ] 2. **Substituting (cos y = -sin x) in the trigonometric identity:** Recall that: [ cosleft(frac{pi}{2} + yright) = -sin y ] Therefore, the equation (cos y = -sin x) can be rewritten using the identity as: [ cos y = sinleft(frac{pi}{2} - yright) = -sin x ] Which simplifies to: [ sin x = sinleft(y - frac{pi}{2}right) ] 3. **Using the double-angle identity solution:** For (sin A = sin B), we have two cases: [ begin{aligned} & text{Case I:} quad x = y - frac{pi}{2} & text{Case II:} quad x = pi - (y - frac{pi}{2}) text{ or } x = frac{3pi}{2} - y end{aligned} ] 4. **Analyzing Case I:** [ x = y - frac{pi}{2} ] Then (cos x = cosleft(y - frac{pi}{2}right) = sin y).

The three-week jump fails, but the four-week jump is successful. The probability of these scenarios happening is calculated as follows: - The probability of both jumps being successful is the product of their individual success probabilities, which is P(A_1A_2) = 0.7 times 0.3. - The probability of the three-week jump failing but the four-week jump being successful is the product of the failure probability of the three-week jump and the success probability of the four-week jump, which is P(overline{A_1}A_2) = 0.3 times 0.3. Therefore, the total probability that person A's score exceeds 14 points is: [P = P(A_1A_2) + P(overline{A_1}A_2) = 0.7 times 0.3 + 0.3 times 0.3 = 0.21 + 0.09 = 0.3] So, the probability that person A's score exceeds 14 points is boxed{0.3}.

The possible outcomes and their probabilities are: - Both jumps fail (X=0), resulting in 8 points. - One jump is successful (X=1), resulting in 12 points. - Both jumps are successful (X=2), resulting in 16 points.

Let P have coordinates (x_P, y_P) on the parabola such that y_P^2 = 2x_P. The distance from P to (0,2) is given by the Euclidean distance formula: d_1 = sqrt{(x_P - 0)^2 + (y_P - 2)^2} = sqrt{x_P^2 + (y_P - 2)^2}. The distance from P to the directrix x = -frac{1}{2} is: d_2 = |x_P - (-frac{1}{2})| = |x_P + frac{1}{2}|. The goal is to minimize the sum S = d_1 + d_2. We express d_1 in terms of x_P using the parabola equation: d_1 = sqrt{x_P^2 + ((sqrt{2x_P}) - 2)^2} = sqrt{x_P^2 + 2x_P - 4sqrt{2x_P} + 4}. Before combining d_1 and d_2 terms, let's complete the square for d_1: d_1 = sqrt{(sqrt{x_P})^4 + 2(sqrt{2x_P})^2 + 1 - 4sqrt{2x_P} - 1 + x_P + 4}. Notice that the first three terms form a perfect square trinomial: d_1 = sqrt{(sqrt{x_P}^2 - sqrt{2x_P} + 1)^2 + x_P + 3} = sqrt{(sqrt{x_P} - 1)^4 + x_P + 3}. Since we need to find the sum S of d_1 and d_2, consider S now and square it to eliminate the square root in d_1: S^2 = (sqrt{(sqrt{x_P} - 1)^4 + x_P + 3} + |x_P + frac{1}{2}|)^2. Observe that sqrt{(sqrt{x_P} - 1)^4 + x_P + 3} is always non-negative, and so is |x_P + frac{1}{2}|. Therefore, by the triangle inequality, we get that S ge sqrt{(sqrt{x_P} - 1)^4 + x_P + 3} + |x_P + frac{1}{2}| ge |sqrt{x_P} - 1|^2 + |x_P + frac{1}{2}| = |x_P - 1| + |x_P + frac{1}{2}|. Now the expression has been simplified, we minimize it by choosing x_P such that both absolute values are non-negative, which implies that x_P ge 1. Considering that the vertex of the parabola (which is x = 0) lies between the directrix and any point P on the parabola, the distance d_2 is minimized when P is at the vertex. However, in this particular case, d_1 would not be minimized. There's a trade-off between minimizing d_1 and d_2. We can clearly see that the additional term in d_1 after completing the square is constant (+3), and it will not influence the minimization process. Therefore, the smallest sum S will occur when |x_P - 1| is minimized. This happens when x_P = 1 because it makes the term |x_P - 1| zero without increasing |x_P + frac{1}{2}| unnecessarily. By substituting x_P = 1 into d_1 and d_2: d_1 = sqrt{(sqrt{1} - 1)^4 + 1 + 3} = sqrt{0 + 1 + 3} = sqrt{4} = 2, d_2 = |1 + frac{1}{2}| = frac{3}{2}.

Therefore, the first sample must be 5 - 13 = -8. Since negative numbering doesn't make sense in this context, we add the total number of employees (52) to -8, resulting in 44, which is the highest number in the sample. Counting backwards with the interval of 13, the numbers in the sample are 5, 18, 31, and 44. Thus, the missing number is boxed{18}."},{"prompt":"A gardener plants five maple trees (including three young and two mature maples), six oak trees (including three young and three mature oaks), and six birch trees randomly in a row.

Count the available slots between non-birch trees to place the birch trees: 1.

Choose 6 out of these 12 slots for the birch trees, which can be calculated using combination {12 choose 6}. 3. The total possible ways to arrange the 17 trees (5 maples + 6 oaks + 6 birches) is {17 choose 6} since we are choosing 6 positions for birch trees out of 17 total spots. Calculating each: - {12 choose 6} = frac{12 times 11 times 10 times 9 times 8 times 7}{6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 924 - {17 choose 6} = frac{17 times 16 times 15 times 14 times 13 times 12}{6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 12376 The probability that no two birch trees are adjacent is frac{924}{12376} = frac{77}{1033} after simplification.

According to the information given, the winning candidate received 62% of these votes, which is equal to 992 votes. Therefore, we can write the following equation: 0.62V = 992 To find the total number of votes V, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.62: V = 992 / 0.62 V = 1600 Now we know that there were a total of 1600 votes cast in the election. The winner won by 384 votes, which means the second-place candidate received 992 - 384 = 608 votes.

Out of these 250 seats, we know that 50 are broken, so the number of seats that are currently taken is 250 - 50 = 200 seats.

In how many ways can the commander issue a series of 8 orders so that there are exactly 7 soldiers left in formation?","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways the commander can give a series of 8 orders to ensure exactly 7 soldiers remain after executing the orders. 1. **Numbering the Soldiers:** - Initially, there are 2018 soldiers lined up in a single row. - To make the numbers easier to work with, we add 30 imaginary soldiers, giving a total of (2018 + 30 = 2048) soldiers. - We number these soldiers from 0 to 2047. 2. **Binary Representation:** - We consider the binary representation of these numbers. Each soldier is assigned a unique number from 0 to 2047 in binary format. - This gives us binary numbers from (00000000000_2) to (11111111111_2). 3. **Command Types and Effects:** - The commander can order all soldiers at even positions (where the binary representation ends with 0) or all soldiers at odd positions (where the binary representation ends with 1) to leave. - Executing one command reduces the group by approximately half, with the remaining group being those with fixed last binary digits (0 or 1). 4. **Sequence of 8 Commands:** - After each command, the binary representation of the numbers of the remaining soldiers becomes fixed at one more position (starting from the least significant bit). 5. **Remaining Soldiers after 8 Commands:** - After 8 commands, the remaining soldiers will have 8 fixed bits in their binary representation at specific positions, with the first 3 bits (from the left) free to vary. 6. **Condition for Exactly 7 Soldiers:** - The goal is for only 7 specific soldiers to remain. - The imaginary soldiers are those numbered from (11111100010_2 , (2018)) to (11111111111_2 , (2047)). - To achieve exactly 7 remaining soldiers, none of these 30 imaginary soldiers (from 2018 to 2047) should be part of the remaining group. 7. **Count of Valid Configurations:** - The remaining soldiers will therefore be those whose binary representation can be described by the fixed 8 bits and varying other bits. - The valid values will be those that do not take binary forms from (111) to (1111111).

For a geometric sequence, the squares of the middle term must equal the product of the outer terms: [ (a + ld)^2 = (a + kd)(a + md) ] 6. **Equating and simplifying the geometric condition:** Expanding both sides, we get: [ (a + ld)^2 = a^2 + 2ald + l^2d^2 ] [ (a + kd)(a + md) = a^2 + amd + akd + kmd^2 ] Setting these equal gives: [ a^2 + 2ald + l^2d^2 = a^2 + (am + ak)d + kmd^2 ] Simplifying, we have: [ a(2l - k - m) = d(km - l^2) ] 7. **Checking ( 2l - k - m neq 0 ):** Suppose ( 2l - k - m = 0 ).

Substituting into the original (sigma) equation: [ sigma left( 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1) right) = (2^p - 1) times 2^p = 2^p (2^p - 1). ] 9. Observe that the sum of divisors equals twice the number, meaning (2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)) is a perfect number.

Additionally, we observe that (a^{a} < 1) (since (a < 1) and raising to any positive power diminishes the value further). 6.

Step 1: Identify the Ratio of Sides - The sides of the triangle are in the ratio 2:3:4. Without loss of generality, we assume BA < BC. This implies BA:BC = 2:3. Step 2: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem - The Angle Bisector Theorem states that frac{AD}{CD} = frac{BA}{BC}. Substituting the given ratios, we get frac{AD}{CD} = frac{2}{3}. Step 3: Determine Which Segment is Longer - Since frac{AD}{CD} = frac{2}{3} < 1, it follows that AD < CD. Therefore, CD is the longer subsegment of AC. Step 4: Express AD in Terms of CD - From the ratio, we can express AD as AD = frac{3}{4}CD by adjusting the ratio to match the total length of AC. Step 5: Solve for CD - Knowing AD + CD = AC = 10 inches, we substitute AD = frac{3}{4}CD into the equation, yielding frac{3}{4}CD + CD = 10. - Simplifying, we get frac{7}{4}CD = 10. - Solving for CD, we find CD = frac{10}{frac{7}{4}} = frac{10 times 4}{7} = frac{40}{7}.

We start by considering the sequence (s_1, s_2, ldots, s_n) of distinct positive integers such that (s_1^{s_2} = s_2^{s_3} = cdots = s_{n-1}^{s_n}). Let (s_i = c^{a_i}) where (c neq 1) for (i leq n-1). This implies that (s_i) can be expressed as a power of some base (c). 2.

Show that one can insert some plus signs in between pairs of digits such that the resulting sum, when performed in base 2, is equal to a power of two.","completion":"1. **Understanding Range Boundaries:** We start by noting a key idea: Given any binary string with n ones, we can achieve any integer value in the range (left[n, frac{3n}{2}right]). To do this, we follow these steps: - Initially, put plus signs between every digit of the binary string, resulting in a sum of n (one for each '1'). - Sequentially, remove the plus sign directly after every second '1'. By doing this, we can achieve every integer value starting from n up to (frac{3n}{2}). This follows because changing \`1+1\` to \`11\` (which is \`3\` in decimal) increases the sum accordingly, and we are allowed to make such changes multiple times. 2. **Prove the Result for n geq 17:** - Let n be the number of ones in the given binary string. If there exists a power of 2 within the interval (left[n, frac{3n}{2}right]), our task is done immediately. - If such a power of 2 is not present within the interval, there must exist an integer alpha such that (2^{alpha} + 1 leq n < frac{2^{alpha+2}}{3}). 3. **Construct the Specific Power of 2:** We claim that 2^{alpha+1} is achievable using the following detailed algorithm: - **Step 0:** Begin by inserting plus signs between every digit in the binary string, leading to an initial sum of n. - **Step 1:** Divide the binary string into two parts: - The \\"tail\\": This part contains the last four or more '1's from the right. - The \\"head\\": The remaining left portion of the string. - **Step 2:** From the leftmost ungrouped '1' in the head, we group each '1' with the two digits directly following it. This transformation can be described as follows (where ( n_i ) is any binary digit): [ 1 + n_0 + n_1 rightarrow 1n_0n_1 ] Here are the possible values: - ( 111 rightarrow 7 ) - ( 101 rightarrow 5 ) - ( 110 rightarrow 6 ) - ( 100 rightarrow 4 ) - **Step 3:** Repeat the grouping until the current sum is at least 2^{alpha+1}. - **Step 4:** Fine-tune this grouping until the exact sum of 2^{alpha+1} is achieved. 4. **Verification of Step 3:** We ensure that the algorithm fulfills the condition in Step 3 before running out of digits for grouping. Given there are at least 13 ones in the head, at least four full groups can be attained before running out of digits. Each grouping transformation changes the sum so that: [ v rightarrow 2v + 1 ] - After all possible groupings, consider (ell) as the leftover number of ungrouped '1's in the tail and g as the number of formed groups. The resulting value at that point is at least: [ 2(n - ell) + g + ell = 2n + g - ell - 4 ] - Given g geq 4 and ell leq 2, we achieve (2n - 2 geq 2^{alpha+1}). 5. **Adjustment in Step 4:** If the initial sum after Step 3 is closely reaching but not exactly 2^{alpha+1}, fine-tune as follows: - If the sum achieved is in the set ({2^{alpha+1} - 3, 2^{alpha+1} - 2, 2^{alpha+1} - 1}), adjust the groupings to exactly reach 2^{alpha+1}: - From 2^{alpha+1} - 3: Transform (1b_0) to 1b_0 to add exactly what’s needed. - From 2^{alpha+1} - 2: Adjust a grouping to add the necessary value. - From 2^{alpha+1} - 1: Reconfigure another grouping for precise balancing. # Conclusion: We demonstrated that it's always feasible to arrange plus signs within a binary string containing at least 2017 ones to ensure the resulting sum in base 2 is a power of 2.

We connect vertex ( r_i ) to vertex ( c_j ) with an edge if the cell in the ( i )-th row and ( j )-th column is empty. 2. **Requirement Translation**: Vasya's goal translates as marking at most 99 edges in this graph such that every vertex ( r_i ) and ( c_j ) has an even number of their incident edges unmarked. 3. **Graph Theory Proposition**: We prove a more general fact: In any graph with ( n geq 2 ) vertices, it is possible to mark at most ( n-1 ) edges such that each vertex has an even number of unmarked edges. 4. **Induction Base Case**: For ( n = 2 ), the statement is evident. An edge between two vertices ensures both vertices have one (odd) incident edge. By removing the edge, both vertices have zero (even) incident edges. 5. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some ( n = k geq 2 ). We need to prove it for ( n = k+1 ). 6. **Case Analysis**: - **Degree 0 Vertex**: If there is a vertex of degree 0, it can be removed, and the induction hypothesis can be applied to the remaining ( k ) vertices. - **Degree 1 Vertex**: If there is a vertex ( v ) of degree 1, consider the single edge ( e ) incident to ( v ): [ v text{ has 1 neighbor connected by } e. ] Mark edge ( e ), remove vertex ( v ) and edge ( e ), and apply the induction hypothesis to the remaining ( k ) vertices. 7. **Finding a Cycle**: If every vertex has degree at least 2: - Start from any vertex and perform a walk, always moving to a previously unvisited edge. - Since each vertex has degree at least 2, this walk will mimic a depth-first traversal and will eventually return to an already visited vertex, forming a cycle. - Remove the cycle from the graph, leaving all vertices with even degrees unchanged. Use the induction hypothesis on the remaining graph (with ( k ) vertices) to mark the required edges. 8. **Removing the Cycle**: Removing the edges of the cycle does not alter the even degree condition of the vertices. Therefore, it suffices to apply the induction hypothesis to the remaining subgraph, fulfilling the required conditions for all vertices. # Conclusion: By the induction method, since we can reduce the given problem to smaller instances of itself, the overall result is proven for any ( n ): [ boxed{text{Vasya can mark at most 99 edges such that each row and column has an even number of marked edges.}} ]"},{"prompt":"The solution of the equation 9^{x+5} = 10^x can be expressed in the form x = log_b 9^5.
