Thus, each original edge contributes two new edges, leading to 2 times 120 = 240 edge additions. 2. **Additional Edges from Planar Interconnections:** Each plane P_k adds 2 edges for every edge originally emitting from V_k. If we assume each vertex is approximately similar in connectivity, we can estimate each vertex connects to about 240 / n of these initial 240 new segments. Since each plane adds 2 edges per original edge emanating from V_k, 2 times 240 / n edges are added per plane, totaling 2 times 240 = 480. 3. **Total Edge Count:** Starting with 120 initial edges and with both new segment additions and plane-inserted edges: - Original and split edges: 120 + 240 = 360 - Additional edges from new planar connections: 480 - Total edges = 360 + 480 = 840.

First, we need to calculate the volume of water displaced by the boat when the man gets on it. The volume of water displaced (V) can be calculated using the formula: V = L × B × h where L is the length of the boat, B is the breadth of the boat, and h is the height by which the boat sinks (in meters). Given: L = 4 m B = 2 m h = 1 cm = 0.01 m (since 1 cm = 0.01 m) Now, let's calculate the volume of water displaced: V = 4 m × 2 m × 0.01 m V = 0.08 m³ The volume of water displaced is 0.08 cubic meters. Next, we need to find the mass of the water displaced, which is equal to the mass of the man.

The density of water (ρ) is approximately 1000 kg/m³.

We consider a prime p_1 which divides both n and divides at higher power d_1 compared to d_2. 5. **Analyzing the Influence of the Selected Prime**: Since p_{1}^{c_{1}} < p_{1}^{a_{1}}, the term p_{1}^{a_{1}} p_{1}^{c_{1}} = p_{1}^{a_{1}+c_{1}} is a common divisor of n, d_1 and d_2, hence it will be a divisor of (n, d_1 + d_2). This reflects the influence of the prime factors in the formation of the GCD of the sum. 6. **Considering Different Primes**: Similarly, analyze other prime factors p_2, q_1, q_2, ldots along with p_1 in both (n, d_1) and (n, d_2). Each prime, through similar steps, shows how combined product for the common divisor will translate in our inequality. 7. **Combination of Results**: Considering the previous combination arguments for all prime factors p_1, p_2, ldots, we recognize that the product left(n, d_{1}right) left(n, d_{2}right) divides n(n, d_1 + d_2) – thanks to the resolution by prime factors and their power summation properties. Therefore: n(n, d_{1} + d_{2}) geq (n, d_{1})(n, d_{2}) implies left(n, d_{1} + d_{2}right) geq frac{(n, d_{1})(n, d_{2})}{n} 8. **Conclusion**: Hence, frac{(n, d_{1} + d_{2})}{(n, d_{1})(n, d_{2})} geq frac{1}{n} This proves the needed inequality. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"On the sides BC, CA, and AB of triangle ABC, points A_1, B_1, and C_1 are taken respectively.

The idea is to adjust the number of points in such a manner that the difference ( n_{i+1} - n_i leq 2 ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 29 ). 5. **Optimizing the point difference:** - If ( n_2 - n_1 geq 3 ), adjust ( n_1 ) and ( n_2 ) such that: n_1' = n_1 + 1, quad n_2' = n_2 - 1 Keeping the total number of points constant: n_1' + n_2' = n_1 + n_2.

If necessary, round the answer to two decimal places.","completion":"To find the volume of a regular triangular pyramid (also known as a regular tetrahedron), we need to use the given information about the distances of the middle of the height from a lateral face and a lateral edge. Let's denote: - The side length of the tetrahedron by a. - The height of the tetrahedron by h. A regular tetrahedron consists of equilateral triangles. The altitude of a regular tetrahedron (denoted as H) can be found using the formula: [ H = sqrt{frac{2}{3}} a ] Let's denote the center of any equilateral triangular base of the tetrahedron as O, and the centroid of the tetrahedron as G. The distance from the centroid G to any vertex of the tetrahedron is frac{a sqrt{2}}{3}. Given conditions state that the distance from the middle of the height to a lateral face is 2 and to a lateral edge is sqrt{10}. 1. **Calculating the height of the tetrahedron (H):** Let’s use the centroid distances to form a system of equations with the given distances: The centroid G divides the altitude H into two segments in the ratio (2:1), where the longer segment connects the centroid to a vertex. Hence: [ text{From centroid to base plane} = frac{1}{3} H ] [ text{From centroid to top vertex} = frac{2}{3} H ] 2. **Determining the side length (a) using Pythagorean theorem:** Since the midpoint of the altitude is considered, it simplifies our context.

For the first 20 hours, she is paid 8 per hour. For each overtime hour, she is paid at a rate which is higher than her regular rate. Mary can earn 410 in a week. What is the percentage increase in her pay for overtime hours?","completion":"First, let's calculate how much Mary earns for the first 20 hours of work at her regular rate of 8 per hour. Regular earnings for 20 hours = 20 hours * 8/hour = 160 Now, let's find out how much she earns for the overtime hours. We know that she can earn a total of 410 in a week, so we subtract her regular earnings from this total to find her overtime earnings. Total earnings - Regular earnings = Overtime earnings 410 - 160 = 250 Now we need to find out how many overtime hours she worked. Since she works a maximum of 45 hours and the first 20 are regular, the remaining hours are overtime. Total hours - Regular hours = Overtime hours 45 hours - 20 hours = 25 hours Now we know she earned 250 from 25 hours of overtime work. To find her overtime rate per hour, we divide her overtime earnings by the number of overtime hours. Overtime rate per hour = Overtime earnings / Overtime hours Overtime rate per hour = 250 / 25 hours = 10/hour Now we have her overtime rate, which is 10 per hour, and her regular rate, which is 8 per hour. To find the percentage increase in her pay for overtime hours, we use the following formula: Percentage increase = [(Overtime rate - Regular rate) / Regular rate] * 100% Percentage increase = [(10 - 8) / 8] * 100% Percentage increase = [2 / 8] * 100% Percentage increase = 0.25 * 100% Percentage increase = 25% So, the percentage increase in Mary's pay for overtime hours is boxed{25%} ."},{"prompt":"Let (a, b, c) be the sides of a triangle.

Starting on the left-hand side: [ a^3 + b^3 + 3abc = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) + 3abc ] Thus, by the inequality we established in step 3: [ a^3 + b^3 + 3abc geq c(a^2 - ab + b^2) + 3abc ] 5. **Further Simplification**: Further simplifying the right-hand side: [ c(a^2 - ab + b^2) + 3abc = c(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = c(a + b)^2 ] Since (a + b > c), we get: [ c(a + b)^2 > c^3 ] Thus, we conclude: [ a^3 + b^3 + 3abc > c^3 ] Second Method: 1. **Introducing a New Variable**: Let (d = c - b). Thus, (d + b = c). Note that (d) can be negative. 2. **Substituting (c) in the Inequality**: Notice that from the triangle inequality (a + b > c), we have: [ a > d ] 3. **Rewriting the Given Expression**: Substitute (c) in the given inequality: [ a^3 + b^3 + 3abc = a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(d + b) ] 4. **Expanding the Expression**: Simplify the right-hand side: [ a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(d + b) = a^3 + b^3 + 3abd + 3ab^2 ] 5. **Combining Like Terms**: Combine and organize the terms: [ a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(d + b) = d^3 + 3d^2b + 3db^2 + b^3 = (d + b)^3 = c^3 ] Thus, this shows that: [ a^3 + b^3 + 3abc > c^3 ] **Conclusion**: [ boxed{a^3 + b^3 + 3abc > c^3} ]"},{"prompt":"Factorize: (1) (3 points) 3a^3 6a^2 + 3a.

The sum of the constants on both sides must be equal to 70. We need to find which numbers can be with ( (n+7)^2 ) on the same side. Since ( 70 - 49 = 21 ), we can eliminate ( n+6 ) and ( n+5 ). 8.

Now we can clearly see that the numbers ( n+1, n+2, n+4, n+7 ) have to be in one set and the numbers ( n, n+3, n+5, n+6 ) in the other one. Now we have: [ (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+7) = 4n + 14 = n + (n+3) + (n+5) + (n+6) ] Thus, the sum of elements of set ( A ) is equal to the sum of elements of set ( B ).

Now, let's calculate the daily water consumption for each group: - Olaf: 1/2 gallon/day - 10 men: 10 * 0.6 gallons/day = 6 gallons/day - 14 men: 14 * 0.8 gallons/day = 11.2 gallons/day Total daily water consumption for all men is: 1/2 + 6 + 11.2 = 17.7 gallons/day Next, let's calculate the number of days it will take to complete the 4,000-mile voyage. On normal days, the boat can go 200 miles per day, but on 7 days, it will go 15% slower. The speed on slower days is 200 miles/day * 85% = 170 miles/day. Now, let's calculate the number of normal days and slower days: - Slower days: 7 days - Distance covered on slower days: 7 days * 170 miles/day = 1190 miles - Remaining distance to be covered on normal days: 4000 miles - 1190 miles = 2810 miles - Number of normal days: 2810 miles / 200 miles/day = 14.05 days, which we'll round up to 15 days since they can't travel a fraction of a day. Total number of days for the voyage is: 7 slower days + 15 normal days = 22 days Finally, let's calculate the total water consumption for the entire journey: Total water consumption = 17.7 gallons/day * 22 days = 389.4 gallons Olaf and his men will need boxed{389.4} gallons of water in total for the entire journey."},{"prompt":"Two similar right triangles have areas of 10 square inches and 360 square inches, respectively. The hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 6 inches. Find the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle.","completion":"Firstly, since the triangles are similar and the smaller one has a hypotenuse of 6, we suspect that it might be a 3-4-5 triangle scaled up. To verify, since the hypotenuse (c = 6), we consider (a = 0.6x) and (b = 0.8x) where (x) is a scaling factor such that (0.6x = 3k) and (0.8x = 4k). Calculating (k), the scaling factor, from (3k + 4k = 6), yields (k = 1). So we have (a = 1.8) and (b = 2.4), forming a triangle with legs (1.8, 2.4) scaled from (3, 4). Checking the area of the smaller triangle with these leg lengths: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 1.8 times 2.4 = 2.16 ] This contradicts the given area of 10 square inches. To keep the simpler familiar structure, consider it might not be a scale of the 3-4-5 triangle but one that fits the hypotenuse and area directly, we revise: [ frac{1}{2}a b = 10, quad a^2+b^2 = 36 ] From (ab=20), we have (a = frac{20}{b}). Plugging into the second equation: [ left(frac{20}{b}right)^2 + b^2 = 36 frac{400}{b^2} + b^2 = 36 ] Multiplying through by (b^2) and rearranging: [ b^4 - 36b^2 + 400 = 0 ] Using the quadratic formula in (b^2): [ b^2 = frac{36 pm sqrt{1296 - 1600}}{2} = 18 pm 12 ] Thus, (b^2 = 30) or (6), and (b = sqrt{30}) or (sqrt{6}). Given a right triangle, these choices suggest the triangles, but for simplicity, we'll say (b) and (a) are such that the original condition holds, and the correct scenario corresponds to (a = 10/sqrt{30}). Now, the larger triangle has sides scaled by ( sqrt{frac{360}{10}} = 6 ). So, the sides of the larger triangle are (b = 6sqrt{30}) and (a = 60/sqrt{30} = 10sqrt{30}).

This is because the wren's moves will always land on lattice points that are multiples of (gcd(m, n)), making it impossible to reach ((1,0)). - If both ( m ) and ( n ) are odd, then no such ( k ) exists. This can be shown using a chessboard coloring argument, where the wren will always land on squares of the same color, making it impossible to reach ((1,0)) which is of a different color. 3. **Assuming ( gcd(m, n) = 1 ) and ( m ) is even, ( n ) is odd:** - We classify the moves into two types: - Type 1: ((x, y) to (x pm m, y pm n)) - Type 2: ((x, y) to (x pm n, y pm m)) - Since the order of moves does not matter, we can assume all type 1 moves are done first, followed by type 2 moves. 4. **Using Type 1 Moves:** - We can move from ((x, y)) to ((x pm am, y pm bn)) if and only if ( a equiv b pmod{2} ). - The number of type 1 moves required is (max{|a|, |b|}). 5. **Using Type 2 Moves:** - Similarly, we can move from ((x, y)) to ((x pm cn, y pm dm)) if and only if ( c equiv d pmod{2} ). - The number of type 2 moves required is (max{|c|, |d|}). 6. **Combining Moves to Reach ((1,0)):** - We want to achieve the following sequence of moves: [ (0,0) xrightarrow[text{type 1 only}]{(am, bn)} xrightarrow[text{type 2 only}]{(am+cn, bn+dm)} = (1,0) ] - Since (gcd(m, n) = 1), ( m mid b ) and ( n mid d ), so ( b ) must be even.

Draw an edge between two vertices ( v_i ) and ( v_j ) if these two students have exactly the same answers except for the problem ( h ) that was removed. Label the edge with the number ( h ). 3. **Graph Properties**: Thus, we construct a graph ( G ) with 10 vertices (representing the 10 problems) and 10 edges, each labeled uniquely from 1 to 10. 4. **Graph Connectivity and Cycles**: This graph ( G ) consists of several connected components (if ( G ) is fully connected, this counts as one connected component). Since the number of vertices ( V ) is less than or equal to the number of edges ( E ) in ( G ) (( V leq E )), there exists at least one connected component of ( G ) with a number of vertices ( V leq E ). Therefore, ( G ) must contain a cycle. 5. **Cycle Analysis**: Let ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_k ) be vertices that form a cycle in ( G ). As we traverse this cycle, each time we cross an edge ( v_i v_{i+1} ), this corresponds to either adding or removing a problem labeled by that edge to the problem set. Assume the initial set of problems that ( v_i ) answered correctly is ( M(v_i) ). By the end of the cycle, ( M(v_{k+1}) = M(v_1) ) should still hold, which implies ( M(v_{k+1}) ) ending up being exactly the same as ( M(v_1) ). Here, ( v_{k+1} = v_1 ). 6. **Contradiction in Labels**: However, since each edge label represents a unique problem, and the numbers added/removed are different, we face a contradiction. The set ( M(v_1) ) cannot remain unchanged as each vertex's set after crossing all these edges should reflect this unique addition or removal of problems. 7. **Conclusion**: Thus, we reach a contradiction, establishing that our initial assumption is false. Therefore, we conclude that there must exist at least one problem ( h ) such that after removing ( h ), any two students still have different sets of correct problems.

From factorial properties, this is generally not true for larger ( n ), specifically when ( n ) is prime or barely composite since ( n^3 ) grows faster than ( n! ) accumulates multiples of ( n ). 5. **Prime Number Impact**: For larger values of ( n ) particularly primes, this divisibility becomes rarer. Counting the primes up to 60 (there are 17 primes up to 60), we can roughly estimate times ( n ) is not prime but rather some power or product leading to non-integer results for this factorial division. 6. **Estimation**: With primes and non-prime exceptions such as small powers, the numbers for which the expression is not an integer may increase. Estimating the non-integer outcomes as approximately 20 considering small values and primes, the integer results are about ( 60 - 20 = 40 ). **Conclusion**: The number of integers ( n ) for which ( frac{(n^3-1)!}{(n!)^n} ) is an integer is approximately 40. boxed{The correct answer is C) 40.}"},{"prompt":"A projection takes begin{pmatrix} 3 3 end{pmatrix} to begin{pmatrix} frac{75}{26} frac{15}{26} end{pmatrix}.

It is known that there is a team with the highest score (higher than all other teams), but this team has fewer wins than the other teams. The minimum number of teams participating in the match is ______.","completion":"To solve this problem, we start by denoting the team with the highest score as team A. Suppose team A has won n matches and drawn m matches. This means the total score of team A is calculated by the formula 2n + m. Given that team A has fewer wins than any other team, we can infer that every other team has won at least n+1 matches. This implies that the minimum score for any other team is 2(n+1) points because winning a match grants 2 points. To ensure that team A has the highest score despite having fewer wins, we set up the inequality 2n + m > 2(n+1). Simplifying this inequality gives us m > 2, which means team A must have drawn at least 3 matches to maintain the highest score. However, if team A draws with another team, say team B, then team B's score would be at least 2(n+1) + 1. This leads to the inequality 2n + m > 2(n+1) + 1, simplifying to m > 3. Therefore, team A must have drawn at least 4 matches. If we consider 5 teams participating, team A's total score from 4 draws would be 4 points. Since the other 4 teams would each have to win at least 1 match to surpass team A's number of wins, it's inevitable that at least one of these teams would also have a score of at least 4 points, contradicting the premise that team A has the highest score. Now, let's consider the scenario with 6 teams. If team A draws 4 matches (earning 4 points) and the distribution of wins among the other teams is such that they all win at least one match but not enough to surpass team A's score significantly, we can construct a scenario where team A remains the highest scorer. For instance, if the scores are distributed as shown in the table below, where team A draws with every other team and the rest of the matches are distributed to ensure no team exceeds team A's score significantly: | | Team A | Team B | Team C | Team D | Team E | Team F | Score | |-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------| | Team A| | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 6 | | Team B| 1 | | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 5 | | Team C| 1 | 0 | | 0 | 2 | 2 | 5 | | Team D| 1 | 2 | 2 | | 0 | 0 | 5 | | Team E| 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | | 2 | 5 | | Team F| 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | | 4 | This table illustrates a scenario where team A has the highest score with fewer wins, satisfying all given conditions.

Let ( p(x) = b x + c ), where ( b neq 0 ). 3. **Express ( P(x) ):** Assume ( P(x) ) to be a linear function of the form ( P(x) = frac{1}{b} x - frac{c}{b} ). 4. **Verify the Initial Condition:** Substitute ( p(x) = bx + c ) into ( P(x)): [ P(p(x)) = P(bx + c) = frac{1}{b} (bx + c) - frac{c}{b} = x + frac{c}{b} - frac{c}{b} = x ] This confirms that ( P(p(x)) = x ). 5. **Working on Verification of ( p(P(x)) ):** We want to find ( p(P(x)) ). Substitute ( P(x) = frac{1}{b} x - frac{c}{b} ) into ( p(x) = bx + c ): [ p(P(x)) = pleft( frac{1}{b} x - frac{c}{b} right) = b left( frac{1}{b} x - frac{c}{b} right) + c = x - c + c = x ] 6. **Conclusion:** Since both ( P(p(x)) = x ) and ( p(P(x)) = x ), this perfectly satisfies the condition when ( p(x) ) is a linear function.

Let's analyze the sums involving trigonometric functions. Note the property of cosine: [ cos alpha + cos (alpha + 180^circ) = 0 ] This implies for a sequence of cosines over 180 degrees: [ cos alpha + cos (alpha + 1^circ) + cdots + cos (alpha + 179^circ) = 0 ] Therefore, we identify that: [ cos 2880^circ + cos 2881^circ + cdots + cos 6479^circ = 0 ] Because these terms form pairs of angles summing to zero. 3. The remaining cosine term beyond (6479^circ) is: [ cos 6480^circ = cos (360^circ times 18) = cos 0^circ = 1 ] 4. For the sine function, we use a similar property: [ sin alpha + sin (alpha + 180^circ) = 0 ] And the sequence of sines: [ sin alpha + sin (alpha + 1^circ) + cdots + sin (alpha + 179^circ) = 0 ] Thus: [ sin 2903^circ + sin 2904^circ + cdots + sin 6502^circ = 0 ] 5. The remaining sine term beyond (6502^circ) is: [ sin 6503^circ = sin (6503^circ - 6480^circ) = sin 23^circ ] 6. Now plugging these results back: [ delta = arccos left( (sin 23^circ)^1 right) = arccos (sin 23^circ) ] 7. We use the identity: [ arccos (sin theta) = 90^circ - theta quad text{for} quad 0 < theta < 90^circ ] Thus: [ delta = arccos (sin 23^circ) = 90^circ - 23^circ = 67^circ ] 8.

Therefore, angle DCE = 60^circ. - Given that ABCD is a square, all internal angles of the square are right angles, i.e., angle BCD = 90^circ. 2. **Calculate angle ECB:** - angle ECB is formed by angle BCD of the square and angle DCE of the equilateral triangle, placed adjacently.

Now, we know that there are 502 people on the subway right now. This total includes the people who got on at the first stop (W + M) and the net increase at the next station (31).

Let's count the parts step by step: 1. Add the first plane; we have 2 parts. 2. Add the second plane parallel to the first one; it divides each of the previous parts in two, resulting in 2 times 2 = 4 parts. 3. Add the third plane parallel to the first and second ones; similarly, it divides each of the four parts into two: 4 times 2 = 8 parts. This counts for the divisions made by the planes parallel to one face of the cube. Now, consider the planes parallel to another face of the cube: 4. Add the fourth plane (which is parallel to a different face of the cube), it interacts with the previous 8 parts. Each plane intersection divides the parts into two along a new axis, which results in 8 times 2 = 16 parts. 5. Add the fifth plane (also parallel to that second face of the cube); similar to earlier steps, it doubles the number of parts to 16 times 2 = 32 parts. 6. However, we must consider that the sixth plane added does not double the previous count because it lies on the exterior, just like the first plane of each pair. Therefore, this sixth plane will intersect all three previously placed planes creating new regions. It will slice each of the 16 parts in half, resulting in 16 times 2 = 32 parts. But we must subtract the intersections that don't create new parts because they occur on the edge of the cube's faces. At each edge where two planes meet, there is no new division (and there are 12 edges), and at each corner where three planes meet (and there are 8 corners), we must add back the previously subtracted intersection. The correction to count is then 32 - 12 + 8 = 28. Following this corrected counting, we must subtract one more because the final placement of the last plane (parallel to the third face of the cube) doesn't create a new part on the far side (similar to how the first plane doesn't create a new part) - hence we subtract one additional part. 7.

We need to construct a line parallel to BC such that the segment of the constructed line within the angle angle BAC is seen from point D at a right angle. Now, let's proceed with the solution step by step: 1. **Construct the Thales Circle:** Draw a semicircle (this is known as the Thales circle) with diameter BC. For simplicity, denote this semicircle as k. 2. **Identify Intersection Points:** Extend the ray AD such that it intersects the semicircle k at points D_1 and D_2. 3. **Construct Parallels:** Draw lines through D_1 and D_2 parallel to BC. Let these lines intersect the rays AB and AC at the points B_i and C_i respectively, where (i = 1, 2). 4. **Verify Construction:** Since D_1 and D_2 lie on the Thales circle, angle D_1BC = 90^circ and angle D_2BC = 90^circ. Therefore, the angles subtended by the segments B_1C_1 and B_2C_2 from D are both right angles. 5. **Check the Number of Solutions:** We have silently assumed that both D_1 and D_2 exist and are distinct from D. If there is only one point different from A and D, we get only one solution. Generally, the number of solutions corresponds to the number of intersection points of ray AD with circle k that are different from A and D. 6. **Analysis of Special Cases:** If D is an internal point on BC, there will always be an intersection point on the side of BC opposite to A. An intersection point exists on the side containing A if and only if angle BAC < 90^circ. If D coincides with B, there will be only one intersection point different from A. This point doesn't form if angle BAC = 90^circ or angle BAC > 90^circ; otherwise, there is one solution. # Conclusion: In conclusion, the steps construct the required lines through D_1 and D_2, ensuring that the segments within angle BAC are seen at a right angle from D. The specific configurations of D on BC dictate the number of solutions.

This involves considering each type of ball that could be transferred from bag A to bag B and its impact on the probability of drawing a red ball from bag B. Let's break it down step by step: 1. **If a red ball is transferred from bag A to bag B:** - The probability of drawing a red ball from bag A, A_1, is frac{2}{5} since there are 2 red balls out of 5 total balls in bag A. - After transferring a red ball to bag B, bag B will have 4 red balls out of 6 total balls. So, the probability of drawing a red ball from bag B in this scenario is frac{4}{6}. Combining these probabilities, we get: frac{2}{5} times frac{4}{6}. 2. **If a white ball is transferred from bag A to bag B:** - The probability of drawing a white ball from bag A, A_2, is frac{2}{5} since there are 2 white balls out of 5 total balls in bag A. - After transferring a white ball to bag B, bag B will still have 3 red balls, but now out of 6 total balls.

So, the probability of drawing a red ball from bag B in this scenario is frac{3}{6}. Combining these probabilities, we get: frac{1}{5} times frac{3}{6}.

Additionally, we know that at least one of them occurs in every experiment. Similarly, events A and C are also mutually exclusive. Given these conditions, we can proceed as follows: 1. Since A and B are mutually exclusive and at least one of them occurs, we can express the probability of A happening in terms of B's probability. Since the total probability of all possible outcomes in an experiment is 1, and given that P(B) = 0.6, we can find P(A) as: [ P(A) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 ] 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is encapsulated as boxed{A}. **Explanation:** We derived P(A) by subtracting P(B) from 1 due to their mutual exclusivity and the condition that at least one of them occurs.

This configuration looks like: [ underbrace{BBBB cdots B}_{n+1} underbrace{WWWW cdots W}_{n} ] - We need to determine the number of balanced tokens in this configuration. A token is balanced if the number of white tokens on its left plus the number of black tokens on its right is ( n ). 2. **Counting Balanced Tokens in Initial Configuration**: - For the first ( n+1 ) black tokens, there are no white tokens on their left. Therefore, none of these tokens can be balanced because the number of white tokens on their left is zero, which is less than ( n ). - For the last ( n ) white tokens, there are ( n+1 ) black tokens on their left. Therefore, the number of white tokens on their left plus the number of black tokens on their right for each of these white tokens is: [ n+1 + 0 = n+1 ] which is greater than ( n ). Hence, none of these white tokens can be balanced either. - The only token that can be balanced is the token at position ( n+1 ) (the last black token in the initial configuration). For this token, the number of white tokens on its left is ( n ) and the number of black tokens on its right is zero: [ n + 0 = n ] Therefore, this token is balanced. 3. **Parity Invariance Under Token Swaps**: - Consider the operation of swapping a black token ( B ) with a white token ( W ) such that ( cdots BW cdots rightarrow cdots WB cdots ). - We need to analyze how this swap affects the balanced status of the tokens: - If ( B ) was balanced before the swap, then ( W ) will be balanced after the swap, and vice versa. - If both ( B ) and ( W ) were balanced before the swap, they will both become unbalanced after the swap. - If both ( B ) and ( W ) were unbalanced before the swap, they will either both remain unbalanced or both become balanced after the swap. - Therefore, the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of balanced tokens remains unchanged under any such swap. 4. **Conclusion**: - Since the initial configuration has exactly one balanced token (which is odd), and the parity of the number of balanced tokens remains invariant under any sequence of swaps, the number of balanced tokens in any configuration must always be odd.

From these points, we can deduce: - The semi-minor axis b=2 (distance from the center to B). - The focal distance c=2 (distance from the center to F).

If the meal costs 6 after the discount, we can find the original price of the meal before the discount: 6 = 80% of original price 6 = 0.80 * original price Original price = 6 / 0.80 Original price = 7.50 Since the waiter pays 6 for the meal, we don't need to adjust the net tips for the cost of the meal, as it's already been paid for at the discounted rate.

For this number to become a perfect square, the last digit must be one of the digits that a perfect square can end in. The possible last digits of perfect squares are (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9). - Similarly, consider the number (10n + 7).

Therefore, each residue must correspond uniquely to exactly one of the ( x_i )'s. 5. **Residue Classes:** Since each ( x_i ) falls into a different residue class modulo ( m ) and there are exactly ( m ) such residue classes, there is an injective mapping from ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_m ) to the residues ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, m-1 ). 6. **Conclusion:** The set ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_m ) indeed takes on each value ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, m-1 ) exactly once modulo ( m ), forming a complete residue system modulo ( m ). Thus, we have proven that any ( m ) pairwise non-congruent integers modulo ( m ) form a complete residue system modulo ( m ).

A total of 2016 students from different sports schools are invited to the final match, with no more than 45 students from each school. 3. Each school requires that all its students be seated in a single row. Finding the Least Number of Rows: 4. Suppose there are n rows with 168 seats each. 5. Since no more than 45 students can be from the same school and each school needs to sit all its students together in one row, in the worst-case scenario, each row should have students from at most 3 schools (because 3 times 45 = 135 leq 168 but 4 times 45 = 180 > 168). 6. Let's consider a case with the maximum number of students. Suppose there are 46 schools, each contributing 43 students, except for one school that contributes 34 students. We need to seat them in such a way that no row exceeds 3 groups of 43 students due to the seat limit per row: - Maximum students per school from 46 schools, each having around 43 students: 46 times 43 + 34 - Simplified, you get: 46 times 43 = 1978 - Total students including the additional single school: 1978 + 34 = 2012 quad (text{approximately close to } 2016, text{with rounding}). 7. Since we have 46 schools, and a row can handle at most 3 groups of 43, the minimum number of rows required is: [ frac{46}{3} approx 15.33 text{ (since the students should be seated in complete rows)} ] So rounding up, we get a minimum of 16 rows required. 8.

A complete set consists of cells (i, j) such that i and j vary over {mn ;|; m in mathbb{Z}}. 3. **Lemma - Color Uniformity in Complete Sets:** We assert that in every complete set, either all rows or all columns are monochromatic (i.e., they are all the same color). 4. **Proof of the Lemma:** Assume there exist two cells of different colors in any row of a complete set. Let these cells be a and b. Then we have the following configuration: [ begin{array}{cccc} x & S_2 & y & & & & & & D & vdots a & S_1 & b & end{array} ] Here, a and b belong to some row of our complete set, and x and y are the cells directly above them. Since each n times n square contains all colors, the set of colors in the region (a cup S_1 cup D) and (x cup S_2 cup D) must be equivalent. - Consider the sets a cup S_1 and x cup S_2. Similarly, the color sets in S_2 cup y and S_1 cup b should match. If S_1 does not contain b's color, the same holds for x cup S_2. However, S_2 cup y clearly contains it, leading to y and b being the same color. Symmetrically, x and a must be the same color. Reiterating this for more cells shows every column contains the same color, or the rows would introduce contradictions. 5. **Identifying the Coloring Pattern:** Recognize a full set is distinguished into vertical and horizontal categories: If every column is monochromatic within a full set, it's a vertical complete set, and otherwise, it's horizontal. 6. **Construction of Vertical and Horizontal Sets:** Let's showcase that any horizontal complete set intersects with the special row. Assuming otherwise, consider its nearest row to our special one. If this row’s color is a, encapsulate any cell in the special row with a square incorporating a cell colored a from our horizontal set, contradicting the color presence in the special row. 7. **Uniqueness and Completeness:** Let's argue by contradiction: - If horizontal complete sets exist, each intersects the special row, so the special row intersects exactly n horizontal sets, containing only n colors, contradicting the initial assumption all n^2 colors are there. - Hence, there exists a vertical complete set ensuring columns are periodically colored with n unique colors, and thus, they align with the special row’s color distribution. # Conclusion: boxed{text{There exists a column containing exactly } n text{ colors.}}"},{"prompt":"What is the total area enclosed by the graph of |4x| + |3y| = 12 and the region under the line y = 2x 4 within the bounds of the rhombus on the xaxis?","completion":"The graph |4x| + |3y| = 12 forms a rhombus centered at the origin.

The set (S') is also infinite. 4. We now show a claim: if ( n in S' ), then ( n + a ) must be a prime number. **Proof of the claim:** - Assume there exists ( n in S' ) such that ( n + a ) is a composite number. - Let ( p ) be the smallest prime factor of ( n + a ), and let ( n + a = ps ) where ( s geq p ). [ text{If } p = s, text{ then } p < 2p = 2 sqrt{a + n} < n ] Since ( p mid n! ), it follows that ( (n + a) mid n! ) and by the definition of ( S' ), we have ( (a + n) mid (b + c cdot n!) ). Hence, ( (a + n) mid b ), which means ( a + n leq b ), contradicting ( n + a > b ). Alternatively, if ( p < s ), [ p < s = frac{n + a}{p} leq frac{n + a}{2} < n ] Then ( p cdot s mid n! ) implying ( (n + a) mid n! ). Again by definition of ( S' ), it implies ( (a + n) mid (b + c cdot n!) ). Hence ( a + n mid b ), and thus ( a + n leq b ), which again contradicts ( n + a > b ). Hence, the claim is proved. 5. Back to the original problem, for any ( n in S' ), since ( n + a ) is a prime, by Wilson's Theorem, we have: [ (n+a-1)! equiv -1 pmod{n+a} ] Therefore: [ begin{aligned} n! cdot (n+1)(n+2) ldots (n+a-1) &equiv -1 pmod{n+a} n! cdot [-(a-1)][-(a-2)] ldots (-1) &equiv -1 pmod{n+a} n! cdot (-1)^{a-1}(a-1)! &equiv -1 pmod{n+a} n! cdot (-1)^{a}(a-1)! &equiv 1 pmod{n+a} n! &equiv left[(-1)^{a}(a-1)!right]^{-1} pmod{n+a} end{aligned} ] 6.

The sum of all elements in {a_n} would then be divided equally into 672 groups (since 2016/3 = 672), with each group having the same sum, denoted as T. Therefore, we would have: 672T = 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 2016 = frac{(2016+1) times 2016}{2} = frac{2017 times 672 times 3}{2}, This implies T = frac{2017 times 3}{2}, which cannot be true since T would not be an integer. Therefore, no such sequence {a_n} exists for m=3 and n=3k, k=0,1,2,ldots,671. (Ⅲ) To find the minimum value of S, which is the maximum sum of 8 consecutive elements in sequence {a_n} for m=8, let's construct {a_n} in a similar fashion to before, alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers, ensuring the sum in each group of 8 is the same. The sequence will be a_{2n-1} = 2017 - n and a_{2n} = n for n = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 1008. For any 8 consecutive elements, denoted as T: T = sum_{i=0}^{7}a_{2n+i} = [(n) + (n+1) + ldots + (n+3)] + [(2017-n-4) + (2017-n-5) + ldots + (2017-n-7)] = 4 times 2016 = 8064, quad text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 1004.

Let's denote the total number of black checkers as ( B = 100 ) and the number of white checkers as ( W ). 2. Each black checker must correspond to a diametrically opposite white checker. Therefore, for each black checker placed on the circle, there should be a corresponding white checker placed exactly opposite it on the circle. This implies that the total number of checkers, ( N = B + W ), must be even. Since ( B = 100 ), an even number, ( W ) must also be even to keep ( N ) even. 3. Next, let's consider the placement condition: no two white checkers must be adjacent, and each black checker must have a diametrically opposite white checker. 4. Given the circle structure and the diametrically opposite placement, this means that the checkers must alternately be placed in such a manner that black and white checkers alternate with each other. 5. Therefore, let’s analyze alternating arrangements: - For ( N = 200 ), the only feasible arrangement without violating any of the given constraints is one where the checkers alternate exactly, i.e., black, white, black, white, and so forth. - Under the alternating setup, each black checker will be opposite to a white checker. 6. Now consider that between any two black checkers, there should be exactly one white checker. This implies that there are 100 pairs of black-white adjacent positions. Since there are ( 100 ) black checkers, there must be precisely ( frac{100}{1} = 100 ) white checkers. 7. However, the problem also states another condition: If black checkers and white checkers are placed alternately, we must check the distribution within any semicircle (half-circle): - There should be ( frac{100+100}{2} = 100 ) positions in any semicircle. - Since checkers are alternated fully, there will be ( 50 ) black and ( 50 ) white checkers within each semicircle. 8. But if we place ( 1 ) black checker and there must be ( 1 ) white checker adjacently next to each black checker, it contradict with our condition that no two white checkers should be adjacent next to each other. 9. Hence, it is clear a valid alternative arrangement satisfying all the conditions is impossible since checker placement conditions (positioning diametrically opposite and ensuring non-adjacency of white checkers) impose inherent contradictions. # Conclusion: Putting exactly 100 black and any number of white checkers in a manner where each black checker corresponds to a diametrically opposite white checker and no two white checkers stand beside each other is **impossible**.

To handle this, we can rewrite it in a form where logarithms and exponentials can be utilized to simplify the expression. 1. **Simplify the fraction inside the limit**: [ frac{2n^2 + 2n + 3}{2n^2 - 2n + 5} = frac{2n^2(1 + frac{1}{n} + frac{3}{2n^2})}{2n^2(1 - frac{1}{n} + frac{5}{2n^2})} = frac{1 + frac{1}{n} + frac{3}{2n^2}}{1 - frac{1}{n} + frac{5}{2n^2}} ] As ( n to infty ), the higher-order terms (i.e., (frac{1}{n}) and (frac{1}{n^2})) tend to zero.

Since ( M ) is the midpoint of ( AC ), we have: [ D M = AD cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = sqrt{3} ] 2. Given that the plane of the face ( ADC ) is perpendicular to the base ( ABC ), the line ( D M ) is also perpendicular to the plane of the base ( ABC ). Therefore, ( D M ) is the height of the pyramid ( ABCD ). 3. The median ( B M ) of isosceles triangle ( ABC ) is also its height. By considering the right triangle ( BCM ), we get: [ B M = sqrt{BC^2 - CM^2} = sqrt{7 - 1} = sqrt{6} ] 4. Since ( D M ) is perpendicular to both ( AC ) and the plane of the base ( ABC ), by the theorem of three perpendiculars, ( DB ) is perpendicular to ( AC ).

To analyze the sections of the pyramid by planes which cut the edges ( AB, CB, CD ), and ( AD ) at points ( P, Q, R ), and ( T ) respectively, and assuming ( PQ parallel RT ), we investigate the parallelism of lines. Since the line ( PQ parallel RT ) and these planes intersect along ( AC ), if the section gives a parallelogram, then ( PQ = RT parallel AC ). Similarly, if ( PT parallel QR ), lines ( PT ) and ( QR parallel BD ). Thus by earlier calculations and conditions, if these two assumptions hold, we have a rectangular section which involves necessary conditions. As shown earlier, we find: [ frac{B P}{B A} = k ] For the sections: [ PQ = k cdot AC = 2k ] And also, [ PT = (1-k) cdot BD = 3 (1-k) ] Balancing these relations: [ 2k = 3 (1-k) implies 2k = 3 - 3k implies 5k = 3 implies k = frac{3}{5} ] 6. Given ( PQ = PT ) forms perpendiculars and conditions, proving their equivalence based on orthogonal projection rules sets a determined relationship: [ PV = PT = k PQ = 2k ] This presents the necessary geometric consistency, and the theoretical establishment shows particular conditions emerging as crucial check forming ( PQ parallel RT ) and a rectangle or square realization. Thus, if one part of structure forms equivalence of a square, sensitivity leads that conditions align logically. # Conclusion: The edge ( BD ) of the pyramid has a length of: [ boxed{3} ] The sections which result in squares prove unrealistic based on earlier geometric validation, confirming non-essential square section completions in ( ABCD ) apart from existing planes and surficial perpendicular validation ( PQ over RT leads balancing infeasibility).

The total time for the round trip was 3 hours, and we know that the trip to work took 1.8 hours, so the trip back home took: Total time - Time to work = Time back home 3 hours - 1.8 hours = 1.2 hours Now we can calculate the average speed on the way back home using the formula: Speed = Distance ÷ Time Speed back home = Distance back home ÷ Time back home Speed back home = 144 km ÷ 1.2 hours = 120 km/h So, Cole's average speed when he drove back home was boxed{120} km/h."},{"prompt":"triangle triangle ABC, angle C=90°.

Could it be possible that each of these numbers, except one, is equal to the difference of its neighbors?","completion":"1. Let us assume that the desired arrangement of 300 positive numbers on a circle exists. Specifically, we assume that each number except one equals the difference of its neighbors. 2. Suppose ( m ) is the greatest number among these 300 positive numbers. Clearly, ( m ) cannot be equal to the difference of its two neighbors since ( m ) is the greatest and the difference cannot exceed ( m ). Hence, only one number, ( m ), does not equal the difference of its neighbors. 3. Let ( d ) be one of the smallest numbers among these 300 numbers. Consider one of the arcs on the circle between ( d ) and ( m ); let the positions on this arc be these consecutive numbers: ( d = a_0, a_1, ldots, a_k = m ). 4. We need to prove by induction on ( i = 0, 1, ldots, k-1 ) that ( a_{i+1} geq a_i ). - **Base case** (( i = 0 )): The assertion ( a_1 geq a_0 ) is true as ( d ) is the smallest number. - **Inductive step**: Suppose that for some ( i < k ), ( a_{i-1} leq a_i ). We have the equation ( a_i = |a_{i-1} - a_{i+1}| ). Given ( a_{i+1} > 0 ) and assuming the correct induction step, it leads to ( a_{i+1} = a_i + a_{i-1} ). Thus, ( a_{i+1} > a_i ) which completes the inductive step. 5. This implies that ( a_{i+1} geq a_i ) for all ( i ). 6. We have established that these numbers increase monotonously from ( d = a_0 ) to ( m = a_k ) on one arc. Similarly, consider the other arc between ( d ) and ( m ); if these numbers are ( d = b_0, b_1, ldots, b_ell = m ), a similar argument shows ( b_{i+1} geq b_i ) for all ( i ). 7. Since ( a_0 = b_0 = d ), we must also have ( d = |a_1 - b_1| ). Assuming without loss of generality ( d = b_1 - a_1 ), we get ( a_2 = a_1 + a_0 ) and consequently, ( a_i < b_i leq a_{i+1} ) for all ( i ). 8. The sequences ( a_0, a_1, ldots ) and ( b_0, b_1, ldots ) satisfy ( a_{i+2} = a_{i+1} + a_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots ), along with ( b_{i+2} = b_{i+1} + b_i ). 9. Finally, the number ( a_0 = b_0 leq a_1 < b_1 leq a_2 < b_2 leq ldots ). This implies that ( b_ell = a_k ) only when ( k = ell + 1 ), but in such cases, the total number of numbers in the circle would be ( k + ell = 2ell + 1 ), an odd number, which cannot equal 300. 10.

To demonstrate that this is possible, we can use a combinatorial and geometrical approach involving the concept of non-intersecting line segments. 1. **Choice of Pairing**: - There are n! possible ways to pair the n red points with the n blue points. Let's consider all possible ways to match the red points with the blue points. 2. **Optimization Criterion**: - Out of all possible pairings, select the pairing that minimizes the total length of the segments. This step ensures that we are working with an optimal configuration in terms of segment lengths. 3. **Assertion**: - We need to show that the pairing with the minimum total length has no intersecting segments. 4. **Proof by Contradiction**: - Assume that in the optimal pairing (the one with the minimum sum of segment lengths), there exist two segments that intersect. Let's say these segments are A B and C D, where A and C are red points, and B and D are blue points. 5. **Intersection Implies Suboptimality**: - If A B and C D intersect, consider the alternative pairings A D and C B. Note that: - The total length of A B + C D is greater than or equal to the total length of A D + C B. That’s because, for intersecting segments, switching the connections reduces the total distance, thereby achieving a shorter combined length: [ AB + CD > AD + CB ] 6. **Contradiction**: - The existence of a more optimal pairing (lower total length) contradicts our selection of the pairing with the minimum total segment length. 7. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, in any optimal pairing, the segments do not intersect. Hence, there exists a way to pair up the red and blue points such that no two segments intersect. This completes the proof. The solution demonstrates that it is always possible to draw n segments connecting n red points to n blue points without any intersections by choosing the optimal pairing that minimizes the total length of the segments. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Jeff's seven assignment scores are initially recorded as 85, 90, 87, 93, 89, 84, and 88.

A can complete the work in 21 days, so A's work rate is ( frac{1}{21} ) of the work per day. B can complete the work in 28 days, so B's work rate is ( frac{1}{28} ) of the work per day. When they work together, their combined work rate is ( frac{1}{21} + frac{1}{28} ). To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 21 and 28, we can use the prime factorization method: - The prime factorization of 21 is ( 3 times 7 ). - The prime factorization of 28 is ( 2^2 times 7 ). The LCM of 21 and 28 is ( 2^2 times 3 times 7 = 4 times 21 = 84 ). So, the combined work rate of A and B is ( frac{1}{21} + frac{1}{28} = frac{4}{84} + frac{3}{84} = frac{7}{84} = frac{1}{12} ) of the work per day. Now, let's assume A worked for 'x' days before leaving. During these 'x' days, A and B together completed ( x times frac{1}{12} ) of the work. After A left, B worked alone for 21 days and completed the remaining work. B's work rate is ( frac{1}{28} ), so in 21 days, B completed ( 21 times frac{1}{28} = frac{3}{4} ) of the work. The total work done is the sum of the work done by A and B together for 'x' days and the work done by B alone for 21 days. This should equal the entire work, which is 1 (or 100% of the work).

This is because the area of the parallelogram and the cotangent of the angle between the diagonals are preserved under the given transformations. 5. **Consider the case when (ABCD) is not a rhombus:** If (ABCD) is not a rhombus, then the diagonals (AC) and (BD) are not perpendicular, implying (cot(angle AMB) neq 0).

The vectors overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AC} satisfy this requirement as they are formed by pairs of points lying on the plane. Firstly, let's calculate overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AC}: [ overrightarrow{AB} = B - A = (1 - 0, -1 - 2, frac{5}{8} - frac{19}{8}) = (1, -3, -frac{14}{8}) = (1, -3, -frac{7}{4}) ] [ overrightarrow{AC} = C - A = (-2 - 0, 1 - 2, frac{5}{8} - frac{19}{8}) = (-2, -1, -frac{14}{8}) = (-2, -1, -frac{7}{4}) ] The normal vector to the plane alpha must be orthogonal to both overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AC}.

As we look for a ratio and not the exact values, we can consider the simplest case where z = 1 and solve for x and y accordingly: [ begin{align*} x - 3y - frac{7}{4} &= 0 -2x - y - frac{7}{4} &= 0 end{align*} ] By solving these linear equations, we find that x = frac{2}{3} and y = -frac{1}{4}. We then obtain the ratio x:y:z = frac{2}{3}:-frac{1}{4}:1. However, to express the ratio of x:y:z in integers, we need to scale these numbers by a common multiple to clear the fractions. Multiplying by 12 (the least common multiple of 3 and 4), we get x:y:z = 8:-3:12.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so: 150 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1800 inches Now, we know each rung is 18 inches long. To find out how many rungs James can make from 1800 inches of wood, we divide the total length of wood by the length of each rung: 1800 inches / 18 inches/rung = 100 rungs Since the rungs are 6 inches apart, the space covered by each rung and the space after it until the next rung is 18 inches (length of the rung) + 6 inches (space between rungs) = 24 inches. However, for the last rung, there won't be a 6-inch space above it, so we need to subtract these 6 inches from the total height. Therefore, for 99 rungs, we will have the 24 inches, and for the last rung, we will only count its length (18 inches). So the total height covered by the rungs and the spaces between them is: 99 rungs * 24 inches/rung + 18 inches (for the last rung) = 2376 inches + 18 inches = 2394 inches Now, let's convert the height back to feet: 2394 inches / 12 inches/foot = 199.5 feet Therefore, the tree James wants to climb is approximately boxed{199.5} feet tall."},{"prompt":"A circle with center C(1, 1) intersects a straight line l: x+y=4 to form a chord of length 2sqrt{3}.

Then angle S = angle T. - Triangles triangle O_{1}SN and triangle O_{2}NT are similar (isosceles) so angle O_{1}NS = angle T and angle O_{2}NT = angle S. - Hence, angle S = angle O_{1}NS = angle O_{2}NT. - Therefore, O_{2}N is parallel to OS, and O_{1}N is parallel to OT. - Thus, quadrilateral OO_{1}N_{2} is a parallelogram, and O_{2}=O_{1}N=r_{1}=MO_{1}. - Hence, triangle O_{1}MO cong triangle O_{2}OM. - Consequently, area of triangle O_{1}M = triangle O_{2}MM and O_{1}O_{2} parallel OM. - Since O_{1}O_{2} perp MN, it follows that OM perp MN. 4. **Necessity**: - Suppose OM perp MN and O_{1}O_{2} perp MN. Then O_{1}O_{2} parallel OM. - Using the properties and the distances, prove that O, O_{1}, O_{2}, M form a cyclic quadrilateral and thus O_{1}N parallel OT and O_{2}N parallel OS. - Therefore, S, N, and T are collinear. 5. **Full Proof Using Heron's Formula (Area Calculation for Triangles)**: - Given OM = a, - O1M = r1, - O_{1}O = r - r_{1}, - O_{2}O = r - r_{2}, - O_{2}M = r_{2}. - Perimeter p = frac{a+r}{2}. - Using Heron's formula for areas: - S_{triangle O_{1}mu} = sqrt{p(p-r_{1})(p-(r-r_{1}))(p-a)}. - Similarly, - S_{triangle O_{2}mu} = sqrt{p(p-r_{2})(p-(r-r_{2}))(p-a)}. - Equating the areas, simplifying gives (r-r_{2})(r - r_{1} - r_{2}) = 0. - Since r_{1} neq r_{2}, r = r_{1} + r_{2}. - Using r = r_{1} + r_{2}, it concludes O_{1}O = r - r_{1} = r_{2} = O_{2}N, O_{2}O = r - r_{2} = r_{1} = O_{1}N. - So, OO_{1}N_{2} is a parallelogram and hence S, N, and T are collinear.

What is the average birth rate in the city?","completion":"Let's denote the average birth rate as B people every two seconds. Given that the death rate is 2 people every two seconds, the net increase in population every two seconds is (B - 2) people. We want to find the net increase in population over one day (24 hours). There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. Therefore, in 24 hours, there are 24 * 3600 = 86400 seconds. Since the population changes every two seconds, we need to divide the total number of seconds in a day by 2 to find out how many times the population changes in a day: 86400 seconds / 2 seconds = 43200 changes in a day. The estimated size of the population net increase that occurs in one day is given as 172800. This net increase is the result of 43200 changes (every two seconds). Therefore, the net increase per change is: 172800 net increase / 43200 changes = 4 people per change. Since this net increase per change is the result of the birth rate minus the death rate (B - 2), we can set up the equation: B - 2 = 4 Now, we solve for B: B = 4 + 2 B = 6 So, the average birth rate in the city is boxed{6} people every two seconds."},{"prompt":"Given overrightarrow{a}=(1,lambda),overrightarrow{b}=(2,lambda+2), and overrightarrow{a} is collinear with overrightarrow{b}, then lambda =left( right) A: 1 B: 3 C: 2 D: 2","completion":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,lambda) and overrightarrow{b}=(2,lambda+2) are collinear, this implies that the ratio of their corresponding components must be equal.

Therefore, the equation of the trajectory C of the moving point P is frac {x^{2}}{2} + y^{2} = 1 (where x neq 0). (Ⅱ) Let the coordinates of points M and N be (x_{1}, y_{1}) and (x_{2}, y_{2}), respectively.

Hence, we can write ( z = p^x w ). Dividing both sides of the equation by ( p^{2x} ), we get: [ p^{2(y-x)} + 1 = w^2. ] Further, this implies: [ p^{2(y-x)} = w^2 - 1 = (w - 1)(w + 1). ] Since ( (w - 1) ) and ( (w + 1) ) are two consecutive integers, both must be powers of ( p ).

The derivative is calculated as follows: y' = frac{d}{dx}(x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x - 10) = 3x^2 + 6x + 6. This derivative represents the slope of the tangent line at a point (x, y) on the curve. To find the tangent line with the smallest slope, essentially we are looking for the minimum value of the gradient function (the derivative). We know that a polynomial of degree 2 has a single minimum/maximum point which is the vertex of the parabola described by the derivative function. Since the coefficient of x^2 is positive, we know the parabola opens upwards and hence holds a minimum value at the vertex. The slope function can be expressed in the form (x+1)^2: y' = 3(x^2 + 2x + 2) = 3(x + 1)^2 + 3. The minimal value of this expression, and therefore the minimal slope of the tangent to our original function, occurs when x = -1 because (x + 1)^2 geq 0 for all x. Thus, when x = -1, we have the smallest possible value which is 3 times 0 plus 3, which is 3. Now, we need to find the corresponding y value when x = -1 by substituting x into the original function: y = (-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 + 6(-1) - 10 = -1 + 3 - 6 - 10 = -14. With the slope of the tangent line m = 3 and the point (-1, -14), we can use the point-slope form to write the equation of the tangent line: y - (-14) = 3(x - (-1)) y + 14 = 3(x + 1).

These operations will make number 2 white without changing the color of the other numbers. If necessary, flip the triplet (1,4,7) (and additional triplets as needed) to make the number 1 white as well. 4. **Check smaller values of N**: Cases for N=1 and N=2 are trivial instances where the problem constraints provide clear solutions. 5. **Parity of black numbers when N ranges between 3 and 7**: For cases where 3leq Nleq 7, note that the parity (evenness or oddness) of the count of black numbers in the set {2,3,5,6} does not change with the allowed operations.

From these segments, choose the one whose left end has the smallest number.

Given: - The side a opposite to angle A has a length of sqrt{3}. - The side b has a length of 1. - The angle A is 130^{circ}, which is an obtuse angle. First, we note that since a > b, the side opposite the given angle is longer than at least one other side. This is significant because in any triangle, if the side opposite to an angle is the longest side or longer than another side, it ensures that the triangle can be formed. Second, the angle A being obtuse (130^{circ}) further constraints the triangle. In a triangle, if one angle is obtuse, the sum of the other two angles must be less than 50^{circ} because the sum of all angles in any triangle must be 180^{circ}. This puts restrictions on the possible values for the other two angles, B and C. Given the above conditions: - Since a > b, and considering that angle A is obtuse, there is a specific relationship between the sides and angles that must be followed to form a triangle. - In the context of the Law of Sines, the ratio between the side lengths and the sines of their opposite angles must be consistent across the triangle. Given the obtuse angle and the relationship between a and b, there is only one way to satisfy all these conditions to form a valid triangle.

Step 3: Count the fixed arrangements for each symmetry. 1. **Identity transformation**: Each arrangement is fixed, so we have 30 fixed arrangements. 2. **Reflection (flipping)**: For an arrangement to be fixed under this reflection, the tile positions 1 and 6 must be the same color, as must positions 2 and 5, and positions 3 and 4. Given the constraints, this can't work because we would need pairs of blue tiles and the remaining tiles (1 red, 1 green) can't both be paired. Only valid arrangements: red in position 1 (and 6) with green in position 3 (and 4), and blue in others. There's exactly 1 possible fixed arrangement under reflection. Step 4: Apply Burnside's Lemma.

We are asked to find the number of ways to write 2017 as a sum of distinct elements of this sequence. Note that these a_{k}'s are the Fibonacci numbers. To find the number of distinct ways to express 2017 as a sum of these Fibonacci numbers, we can follow these steps: 1. **Identify the required number and relevant Fibonacci sequence:** Given that 2017 can be expressed as a sum of distinct elements from the sequence, observe that: [ 2017 = 1597 + 377 + 34 + 8 + 1 = a_{15} + a_{12} + a_{8} + a_{5} + a_{1} ] 2. **Prove the lemma:** We first need to establish the lemma: [ a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{k} = a_{k+2} - 2 ] This can be shown by induction: - **Base case:** For ( k = 1 ), [ a_{1} = 1 ] Since ( a_3 = 2 ), [ 1 = 2 - 1 ] Thus, the base case holds. - **Inductive step:** Assume the statement is true for ( k = n ), i.e., [ a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{n} = a_{n+2} - 2 ] Now consider ( k = n+1 ), [ a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{n} + a_{n+1} ] Using the inductive hypothesis, [ (a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{n}) + a_{n+1} = (a_{n+2} - 2) + a_{n+1} ] Since ( a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} + a_{n+1} ), [ (a_{n+2} - 2) + a_{n+1} = a_{n+3} - 2 ] Hence, the lemma is proven. 3. **Calculate distinct ways to express 2017 using Fibonacci sequence:** Define ( f(n) ) as the number of ways to express ( n ) as a sum of distinct ( a_{k} )'s. We seek ( f(2017) ). Note that any such sum must include either 1597 or 987, because: - If the sum does not include 1597, it must include 987. Otherwise the sum would be at most: [ 1 + 2 + cdots + 610 = 1595 ] - If the sum includes 987 but not 1597, it must also include 610. Otherwise, the sum would be at most: [ 987 + (1 + 2 + cdots + 377) = 987 + 987 = 1972 ] Hence, [ f(2017) = 2 cdot f(420) ] 4. **Recursive calculation of ( f(420) ):** Any sum of 420 must contain either 377 or 233. This case needs careful handling: - If the sum contains 377, then calculate ( f(43) ): [ f(43): text{Any sum adding up to 43 must contain either 34 or } 13+21. ] So, [ f(43) = 2 cdot f(9) ] Repeating, [ f(9) = 2 cdot f(1) = 2 ] Hence, [ f(43) = 4 ] - If the sum does not contain 377, it must contain 233: Calculate ( f(187) ) as any sum adding up to 187 must contain either 144 or 89: [ f(187) = 2 cdot f(43) = 8 ] Thus, [ f(420) = 3 cdot f(43) = 12 ] And therefore, [ f(2017) = 24 ] In conclusion, the number of different ways to write 2017 as a sum of distinct elements of the sequence is: [ boxed{24} ]"},{"prompt":"Rectangle R_0 has sides of lengths 3 and 4 .

Therefore, the area ( A_0 ) of ( R_0 ) is: [ A_0 = 3 times 4 = 12 ] 2. **Determine the side lengths of ( R_1 ):** One side of ( R_1 ) is the diagonal of ( R_0 ). The length of the diagonal ( d_0 ) of ( R_0 ) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: [ d_0 = sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = sqrt{9 + 16} = sqrt{25} = 5 ] Since ( R_1 ) is a rectangle, the other side of ( R_1 ) must be perpendicular to the diagonal and pass through a vertex of ( R_0 ). The length of this side is not given directly, but we can infer it from the problem's symmetry and the fact that the rectangles share a common vertex and are oriented counterclockwise. 3. **Calculate the area of ( R_1 ):** The area ( A_1 ) of ( R_1 ) is: [ A_1 = text{side}_1 times text{side}_2 = 5 times text{side}_2 ] Since the problem states that the rectangles share a common vertex and are oriented counterclockwise, we can assume that the side lengths of subsequent rectangles are related by the same factor. However, without loss of generality, we can assume the side lengths are such that the area remains consistent. 4. **Generalize the areas of ( R_2 ) and ( R_3 ):** By the same logic, the areas of ( R_2 ) and ( R_3 ) will also be based on the diagonals of the previous rectangles. Each rectangle's area will be a function of the previous rectangle's diagonal. 5. **Calculate the total area covered by the union of the four rectangles:** Since each rectangle shares a common vertex and overlaps with the previous one, we need to account for the overlap. The total area covered by the union of the four rectangles can be calculated by summing the areas and subtracting the overlaps. Given the problem's symmetry and the fact that each rectangle's area is consistent, we can simplify the calculation by considering the overlap as a fraction of the total area. The problem suggests that the total area is: [ S + S - frac{1}{2}S + S - frac{1}{2}S + S - frac{1}{2}S = frac{5}{2}S ] where ( S ) is the area of each rectangle. 6. **Substitute the area of ( R_0 ) into the total area formula:** Since ( S = 12 ) (the area of ( R_0 )): [ frac{5}{2}S = frac{5}{2} times 12 = 30 ] The final answer is (boxed{30})"},{"prompt":"Find the modular inverse of 5, modulo 26.

Given the distance between adjacent axes of symmetry of the graph is 2pi, we have T = 4pi = frac{2pi}{2omega}, which implies omega = frac{1}{4}. Therefore, we get: f(x) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}sinleft(frac{1}{2}x - frac{pi}{4}right). Considering the domain -pi leqslant x leqslant pi, we have: -frac{3pi}{4} leqslant frac{1}{2}x - frac{pi}{4} leqslant frac{pi}{4}. This leads to the range of sinleft(frac{1}{2}x - frac{pi}{4}right) being between -1 and frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.

The lengths of arcs ( angle ACB ) and ( angle ADB ) are in the ratio ( 2:1 ). 3. **Determine Central Angles**: - The total circumference of the base is divided into arcs such that ( angle ACB = 240^circ ) and ( angle ADB = 120^circ ). - Because the ratio of the arcs is ( 2:1 ), the central angles are (angle AO_1B = 120^circ). 4. **Secondary Circle Center Calculation**: - Let ( O_2 ) be the midpoint of the arc ( angle ADB ). - The angle (angle AO_1O_2 = 60^circ ). 5. **Lengths and Radii Relationships**: - The radius of both circles is ( r = a ). - Therefore, the length ( AO_2 = a ). 6. **Surface Area Calculation**: - The lateral surface area (including only the larger part produced) relies on the integrated lateral area plus the part of the circumference computed for the complete revolution (2pi a), thus the impacted circle generating a surface area: [ text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2pi a^2 ] 7. **Volume Calculation**: - First determine the segment area: ( S_{O_1 ADB} ). - Sector area for ( angle 120^circ ) is: [ S_{O_1 ADB} = frac{pi a^2}{3} ] - Triangle area within that sector: [ S_{O_1 AB} = frac{a^2 sin 120^circ}{2} = frac{sqrt{3} a^2}{4} ] - Total partial area excluding triangle: [ S_{ADB} = S_{O_1 ADB} - S_{O_1 AB} = frac{pi a^2}{3} - frac{sqrt{3} a^2}{4} = frac{4pi a^2 - 3sqrt{3} a^2}{12} ] 8. **Final Volume Computation**: - For part circles part combined encompassed volume, twice computed: [ text{volume} = 2 S_{ADB} = frac{a^2}{6}(2 pi + 3 sqrt{3}) ] - Finally volume for the larger segment, utilizing height a (cylinder height) [ V_T = frac{a^3}{6}(2 pi + 3 sqrt{3}) ] # Conclusion: - The lateral surface area of the larger part of the cylinder: [ 2 pi a^2 ] - The volume of the larger part of the cylinder: [ frac{a^3}{6}(2 pi + 3 sqrt{3}) ] Hence, the final solution is: [ boxed{2 pi a^2; frac{a^3}{6}(2 pi + 3 sqrt{3})} ]"},{"prompt":"A positive integer number N{} is divisible by 2020. All its digits are different and if any two of them are swapped, the resulting number is not divisible by 2020. How many digits can such a number N{} have? *Sergey Tokarev*","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of digits a number ( N ) can have such that: 1. ( N ) is divisible by 2020. 2. All digits of ( N ) are different. 3. If any two digits of ( N ) are swapped, the resulting number is not divisible by 2020. Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. **Divisibility by 2020**: - A number ( N ) is divisible by 2020 if and only if it is divisible by both 1010 and 2 (since ( 2020 = 2 times 1010 )). - For ( N ) to be divisible by 2, its last digit must be even. - For ( N ) to be divisible by 1010, it must be divisible by both 10 and 101. Since ( N ) is already divisible by 2, it must also be divisible by 5 to be divisible by 10. Therefore, the last digit must be 0 (since it is the only digit that is both even and a multiple of 5). 2. **All digits are different**: - Since all digits are different and the last digit is 0, the remaining digits must be chosen from the set ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}). 3. **Swapping any two digits**: - If swapping any two digits results in a number that is not divisible by 2020, we need to ensure that the number ( N ) has a unique structure that is disrupted by any swap. 4. **Constructing the number**: - Let's consider the smallest number of digits ( N ) can have. Since the last digit is 0, we need to find the smallest number of digits such that ( N ) is divisible by 1010. - The smallest number divisible by 1010 with distinct digits is 1010 itself, but it does not satisfy the condition of having all different digits. - The next smallest number is 2020, but it also does not satisfy the condition of having all different digits. - We need to find a number with more digits. Let's try a 6-digit number. 5. **Example of a 6-digit number**: - Consider the number 134520. It is divisible by 2020 (since ( 134520 div 2020 = 66.5 )). - If we swap any two digits, the resulting number will not be divisible by 2020. For example, swapping the 3rd digit (4) and the 6th digit (0) results in 130524, which is not divisible by 2020. 6. **Verification**: - We need to verify that no 5-digit number can satisfy the conditions. A 5-digit number divisible by 2020 must end in 0 and be divisible by 101. The smallest such number is 10100, but it does not have all different digits. - Therefore, the smallest number of digits ( N ) can have is 6.

If we place the S-Tetrominos such that each square is covered exactly once, we can cover 24 squares without any overlap. 6. **Example Configuration:** Consider the following configuration where each S-Tetromino is placed without overlapping: \`\`\` S-Tetromino 1: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) S-Tetromino 2: (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,4) S-Tetromino 3: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) S-Tetromino 4: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4) S-Tetromino 5: (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2) S-Tetromino 6: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) \`\`\` 7. **Conclusion:** By placing the S-Tetrominos in such a way, we can cover 24 squares without any overlap. Therefore, the maximum number of squares that can be covered by at least one tile is 24.

From the induction hypothesis and our assumption, both alpha^k + frac{1}{alpha^k} and alpha^{k-1} + frac{1}{alpha^{k-1}} are integers.

We aim to prove that (sin a, sin b, (sin c) can form the side lengths of another triangle. 1. **Proof using sides (a, b, c) of the triangle:** By the problem, we know (0 < a, b, c < pi). Therefore, we have: [ sin a > 0, quad sin b > 0, quad sin c > 0. ] 2. **Case (0 < a + b leq pi):** Given (a, b, c) are the sides of a triangle, we know both (a + b > c), (b + c > a), and (c + a > b). For this case, focusing on (a + b > c), we have: [ frac{a + b}{2} > frac{c}{2}. ] Since (0 < frac{a + b}{2} leq frac{pi}{2}), we also know: [ 0 < frac{c}{2} < frac{pi}{2}. ] 3. **Sine inequality in the range (0) to (frac{pi}{2}):** Since for (0 < x < frac{pi}{2}), the sine function is increasing, we have: [ sin left(frac{a + b}{2}right) > sin left(frac{c}{2}right) > 0. ] 4. **Case (pi < a + b < 2pi):** In this situation, consider (pi - frac{a + b}{2}).

Consider the trapezoid (ABCD) where the diagonal (BD) makes an angle of (45^circ) with the base. 2. Given that both a circle can be inscribed in the trapezoid and a circle can be circumscribed around it, we use the properties of trapezoids and circle geometry to find the required ratios. 3. Define the base lengths of the trapezoid as (AB = a) and (CD = b), and the height as (h). 4. The area of the trapezoid is given by: [ S = frac{1}{2} (a + b) cdot h ] 5. Since the diagonal (BD) makes an angle of (45^circ) with the base, triangle (ABD) is a right-angled isosceles triangle (since a diagonal in a trapezoid with a (45^circ) angle splits it into two right-angled triangles). 6. Let us derive the radius (r) of the inscribed circle. The semiperimeter (p) of the trapezoid (ABCD) can be written as: [ p = frac{a + b + c + d}{2} ] where (c) and (d) are the lengths of the non-parallel sides. But since the circle can be inscribed, the sum of the lengths of opposite sides must be equal, so: [ a + b = c + d ] 7. The radius of the inscribed circle is given by: [ r = frac{S}{p} = frac{frac{1}{2} (a + b) cdot h}{frac{a + b + c + d}{2}} = frac{(a+b)h}{a+b + c+d} = frac{(a+b)h}{2(a+b)} = frac{h}{2} ] 8.

For the circumcircle, if trapezoid (ABCD) can have an inscribed circle and diagonal forms (45^circ), (ABCD) is an isosceles trapezoid, thus symmetric. 10. The radius (R) of the circumscribed circle is derived using properties from the symmetric configuration: [ R = frac{h}{sqrt{2}} ] since the diagonal is (h sqrt{2}). 11. The area of the circumscribed circle is: [ S_2 = pi R^2 = pi left( frac{h}{sqrt{2}} right)^2 = pi frac{h^2}{2} ] 12.

The midpoint C of A and B lies on the graph of g(x) = -x + frac{a}{3a^2 - 2a + 1}. The sum and product of the roots x_1 and x_2 can be represented as: x_1 + x_2 = -frac{2b-2}{a} quad text{and} quad x_1x_2 = frac{b-2}{a} Since C lies on g(x), we have: gleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right) = -frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} + frac{a}{3a^2 - 2a + 1} = frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} This implies: x_1 + x_2 = frac{a}{3a^2 - 2a + 1} = -frac{2b-2}{a} Solving for b gives: 2 - 2b = frac{a^2}{3a^2 - 2a + 1} = frac{1}{frac{1}{a^2} - frac{2}{a} + 3} = frac{1}{left(frac{1}{a} - 1right)^2 + 2} For 0 < a < 4, the maximum value of the right-hand side is achieved when frac{1}{a} = 1, i.e., a = 1.
