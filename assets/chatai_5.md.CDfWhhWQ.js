How to construct the axes of such symmetries?","completion":"Solution: # Part (a): Composition of Two Symmetries 1. **Introduction of Symmetries:** Let us consider two axial symmetries of space with axes ( s_1 ) and ( s_2 ), which intersect at point ( O ) and form an angle ( varphi = s_1 widehat{O} s_2 ). 2. **Decomposition of Symmetries into Planar Symmetries:** Each of these axial symmetries can be represented as a composition of two symmetries with respect to planes. Consider the pairs of planes ( alpha_1 perp alpha_2 ) and ( beta_1 perp beta_2 ), which represent the symmetries corresponding to axes ( s_1 ) and ( s_2 ), respectively. 3. **Choice of Intersecting Planes:** We choose the planes ( alpha_2 ) and ( beta_1 ) to be the plane of intersection of the axes ( s_1 O s_2 ). 4. **Identity Transformation Step:** The composition of the symmetries with respect to coinciding planes ( alpha_2 ) and ( beta_1 ) is the identity transformation. This gives us the clue on how symmetries with respect to the remaining planes should be handled. 5. **Resultant Transformation as Rotation:** The composition of the remaining symmetries produces a rotation about an axis ( l ), which is perpendicular to the plane determined by ( s_1 O s_2 ) and passes through ( O ). The angle of this rotation is twice the angle ( varphi ), making it ( 2varphi ). 6. **Construction of Rotation Axis and Angle:** The rotation axis ( l ) is constructed as described, and the angle of rotation can be determined to be ( 2varphi ). # Part (b): Representation of Rotations 1. **Equivalence of Rotation and Composition of Symmetries:** As previously shown, any rotation can be represented as a composition of two axial symmetries. 2. **Intersection of Axes:** The axes of these symmetries intersect at a point on the rotation axis and form an angle that is half of the rotation angle. 3. **Conclusion:** Specifically, if we have a rotation about some axis by an angle ( theta ), this rotation can be realized as the composition of two symmetries about intersecting axes forming an angle ( theta/2 ). Thus, we have demonstrated that the composition of two axis symmetries with intersecting axes results in a rotation and that any rotation can be decomposed into such a composition. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The set of points with spherical coordinates of the form [(rho, theta, phi) = left( 1, theta, frac{pi}{3} right)] forms a circle.

For f(x) to have three zeros, the equation f(x) = 0 must have three roots. This implies (x-1)^{3} - 3x + 2 = b has three roots. Let g(x) = (x-1)^{3} - 3x + 2, and find its derivative: g'(x) = 3(x-1)^{2} - 3 = 3x(x-2). Setting g'(x) = 0 gives x=0 or x=2. Therefore, the range of b for which g(x) = b has three roots is -3 < b < 1. Hence, the range of b is (-3,1), making statement A correct. For B: Given f(x) satisfies f(2-x) = 1 - f(x), we substitute to get (2-x-1)^{3} - a(2-x) - b + 2 = 1 - [(x-1)^{3} - ax - b + 2]. Simplifying, we find -a(2-x) - b + 2 = 1 + ax + b - 2.

To find the slope of the tangent line at any point (x_{0}, y_{0}) on g(x), we differentiate g(x) to get g'(x) = 3(x-1)^{2} - 3. Since three tangent lines can be drawn through the point (2,m) on the curve g(x), the equation for the slope m = 3(x-1)^{2} - 3 must have three solutions for x.

B: If the intersection of planes alpha and beta is line a (alpha cap beta = a), the intersection of planes alpha and gamma is line b (alpha cap gamma = b), and the intersection of planes beta and gamma is line c (beta cap gamma = c), it follows that lines a, b, and c would either intersect each other, be parallel, or be skew (non-intersecting and non-parallel in 3-dimensional space).

We start with the given inequality ( -1 < sqrt{p} - sqrt{100} < 1 ). 2. Recognize that ( sqrt{100} = 10 ). Thus, we can rewrite the inequality as: [ -1 < sqrt{p} - 10 < 1 ] 3.

They were assigned 6 geometry problems as homework. More than half of the students solved each problem. Prove that there exist two students who, between them, solved all 6 problems.","completion":"1. We begin by noting that there are 15 students in the class, and 6 geometry problems are assigned as homework. 2. Given that each problem was solved by more than half of the students, this implies that each problem was solved by at least (8) students (since (lceil frac{15}{2} rceil = 8)). 3. Consequently, the cumulative number of problem solutions by all students must be at least (8 times 6 = 48). Let’s denote the total number of problem solutions by (S), hence: [ S geq 48 ] 4. Averaging this total over the 15 students, we find the mean number of problems solved per student: [ text{Average} = frac{S}{15} geq frac{48}{15} = 3 frac{1}{5} = 3.2 ] 5. This average indicates that there must be at least one student, say student (A), who solved at least (4) problems. Let’s confirm this assumption: [ text{Minimum number of problems solved by any student } geq 3.2 ] Hence, there is at least one student who solved (lceil 3.2 rceil = 4) problems. 6. If one student solved all 6 problems, our proof is complete, as the requirement states finding two students who collectively solved all problems. In this case, this student and any other student provide a trivial solution: - Proof ends here if a student solved all 6 problems. 7. Let us assume student (A) solved exactly (4) problems. There are then (15 - 1 = 14) other students who collectively are responsible for solving the remaining problems. 8. The total number of solutions by others for the 2 unsolved problems must therefore be: [ 8 times 2 = 16 text{ solutions} ] This count corresponds to the minimum number of solutions because each of the remaining (2) problems need to be solved at least (8) times. 9. Since we assume there is a student, suspect (A), who has (4) solved problems, the remaining (14) students must solve these (2) problems at least: [ 16 text{ solutions among } 14 text{ students} ] 10. By the pigeonhole principle, if each pigeonhole represents (1) of the remaining problems and each pigeon represents a solution by a student, there should be at least (1) student who solved both remaining problems. This fact negates the possibility of each remaining problem being solved exactly once by different (14) students. 11. Therefore, there exists at least one student who solved exactly (5) problems if not more, alongside student (A), to meet the scenario.

We aim to show that such a partition will lead to a contradiction. 2. **Case 1: Both 3 and 4 are in the same subset as 2**: - Let ( 2 in A ), ( 3 in A ), and ( 4 in A ). - Then, ( 6 = 2 times 3 in B ), ( 8 = 2 times 4 in B ), and ( 12 = 3 times 4 in B). - Now, in subset B: ( 6, 8, 12 ) - Check higher products ( 48 = 6 times 8 in A ), ( 96 = 6 times 12 in A ).

Contradiction because ( 2 times 12 = 24 ). 6. **Conclusion**: As we have seen, every case for a division of set {1, 2, ldots, 96} leads to a contradiction. So, no such partition exists, meaning any partition of {1, 2, ldots, 96} will always contain three distinct numbers a, b, c with ab = c. 7. **Next, showing that ( n = 95 ) can be partitioned without the ( ab = c ) property**: - Define sets A and B as follows, based on the power or product of distinct primes: - ( A = { p^a mid p text{ prime}, a = 1 text{ or } 2 }, quad { p^4 q, p^3 q^2 } ) - ( B = { p^a mid p text{ prime}, a = 3, 4, 5, 6 }, quad { pq, p^2q, p^2q^2, p^3 q, pqr } ) - No a, b, c in either A or B such that ab = c can be found because: - Powers exceed 95, - Products are greater than 95 or are specifically partitioned to avoid ( ab = c ).

These pairs are: [ {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}, {3, 4}, {3, 5}, {4, 5} ] 2. **Cards Distribution Consideration:** Only cards containing ( {1} ) can go into box 1, i.e., ({1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}). 3. **Count of Cards in Box 1:** We analyze the scenarios where box 1 has at least 3 cards. We consider two cases separately: **Case 1: All 4 cards ({1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {1,5}) are in box 1** - Box 1 has 4 cards - Remaining 6 cards ({2, 3}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}, {3, 4}, {3, 5}, {4, 5}) must be distributed among the 4 remaining boxes. - Each of these boxes can get at most 2 cards. Determining distributions: Each of the remaining 6 cards can go to any of the 4 boxes, resulting in: [ 2^6 = 64 ] good ways to distribute them. **Case 2: Exactly 3 out of ({1,2}, {1,3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}) are in box 1** - Assume the subset of three cards in box 1 is ({1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}) and ({1, 5}) is in box 5. - Then, the 6 remaining cards need to be distributed in such a way that no other box (i.e., (2, 3, 4)) contains more than 2 cards. We consider all permutations to ensure no box exceeds 2 cards. Determining distributions: - The cards ({2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}) can distribute by categorizing into: **6 ways due to 2 cards:** Each non-box 5 has precisely up to 2 options of its cards Each of these placements end up iteratively covering considering all suitable positions equivalently calculated **2 ways due to one spread** Hence verified consistency: boxed{120} total qualified distributions.

Mathematically, it means that ( overline{OA} = overline{OA'} ), and ( overline{OB} = overline{OB'} ) for points ( B ) and ( B' ). 2. **Properties of Central Symmetry**: - In central symmetry, since ( O ) is the midpoint, the segments ( overline{OA} ) and ( overline{OA'} ) are equal, and ( overline{OB} ) and ( overline{OB'} ) are also equal. - Also, the vertical angles created between the triangles subsegmented around the midpoint ( O ) are equal. 3. **Use of Congruence of Triangles**: - Consider the triangles ( triangle AOB ) and ( triangle A'OB' ), which are formed by the points ( A, B ) and their symmetric counterparts ( A', B' ). 4. **Criteria for Congruence**: - To prove the triangles ( triangle AOB ) and ( triangle A'OB' ) are congruent, we will use the **Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Congruence Criterion: - We have: [ OA = OA' ] [ OB = OB' ] [ angle AOB = angle A'OB' quad (text{vertical angles are equal}) ] 5. **Conclusion About Distances**: - By the SAS criterion, triangles ( triangle AOB ) and ( triangle A'OB' ) are congruent. - Therefore, ( overline{AB} = overline{A'B'} ), which implies that the distance between points ( A ) and ( B ) is the same as the distance between ( A' ) and ( B' ).

At the toll booth, there is an automated system that measures the height of the vehicle. If the vehicle’s height is below a threshold value ( h ), the system classifies it as class 1, and if it is above ( h ), it classifies it as class 2. However, this system can make errors. For example, a low minibus might be mistakenly classified as class 1, and its driver would be pleased. Conversely, a passenger UAZ might be mistakenly classified as class 2, displeasing the driver, who may submit a claim for a refund of 100 rubles. The company management tasked the engineers with adjusting the system to minimize the number of errors. For several weeks, the engineers collected data on the heights of vehicles passing through the toll booth, categorizing them separately for class 1 and class 2 vehicles (see Figure 5). The xaxis represents the vehicle height in cm, and the yaxis represents the average number of vehicles of that height passing through the toll booth daily. The data points are connected with a smooth curve for clarity. Based on this information and the graphs, the engineers need to determine the threshold value ( h ) that minimizes the probability of errors.

According to the problem's instruction, this has already been done. 4. **Identify Intersection Point:** By observing the plotted graph, the intersection point of the two curves represents where the average number of vehicles of class 1 and class 2 are equal for that specific height. This is where we should set the threshold h to minimize the errors. 5. **Describe Geometric Meaning:** The area under the curve can be used to quantify the types of errors. There are two types of potential errors: - Error Type 1: The system classifies class 1 vehicles (which should be less than h) as class 2 (which should be greater than h). This is represented by the area under the class 1 curve to the right of h. - Error Type 2: The system classifies class 2 vehicles (which should be greater than h) as class 1 (which should be less than h). This is represented by the area under the class 2 curve to the left of h.

Proposed by Carl Schildkraut, MIT","completion":"1. **Assume GCD is 1**: Without loss of generality, assume that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of (a), (b), and (c) is 1. If not, we can divide all three numbers by their GCD, and the problem will reduce to a simpler form. This is because if (d = gcd(a, b, c)), then (a = da'), (b = db'), and (c = dc') where (gcd(a', b', c') = 1). The problem for ((a, b, c)) is equivalent to the problem for ((a', b', c')). 2. **Prime Factorization and (p)-adic Valuations**: Consider the (p)-adic valuations of (a), (b), and (c) for each prime (p). Let (v_p(a)), (v_p(b)), and (v_p(c)) be the (p)-adic valuations of (a), (b), and (c) respectively. For each prime (p), the GCD of (v_p(a)), (v_p(b)), and (v_p(c)) must be 1. If (2) divides all (v_p(a)), (v_p(b)), and (v_p(c)), we can reduce the problem by considering the numbers with odd or even (p)-adic valuations separately. 3. **Rephrasing the Problem**: We can rephrase the problem in terms of vectors. Let (u, v, w in mathbb{N}^d) be three distinct vectors. We need to find a subset (S subseteq mathbb{N}^d) such that for all (x in mathbb{N}^d), exactly one of (x+u), (x+v), (x+w) is in (S). 4. **Matrix Representation**: Let (M) be the matrix whose rows are (u^t, v^t, w^t) (where (t) denotes transpose) with all entries reduced modulo 3. Each column of (M) cannot have all zeros. If there exists a row vector (y^t) such that the three entries of (My) are (0, 1, 2 pmod{3}) in some order, then we can pick (S) to be the set of (x in mathbb{N}^d) such that (y^tx equiv 0 pmod{3}). 5. **Sufficient Condition**: A sufficient condition is for ((0, 1, 2)^t) or one of its permutations to be in the image of (M) (working in (mathbb{F}_3)). This condition is also necessary, although proving this rigorously is complex. 6. **Reduction of Matrix**: If one of the columns of (M) has three distinct entries, we are done. By adding a vector with three equal entries to any column, we can transform the column. If a column has the first two entries equal, we can make the column of the form ((0, 0, 1)^t) or ((0, 0, 2)^t). 7. **Nonzero Rows**: If the reduced matrix has only one nonzero row, it implies that the ratio of two of the three original numbers (after being reduced with no common factor in the exponents) is a perfect (rational) cube, while the other two ratios are not. 8. **Conclusion**: If the matrix (M) has a column with three distinct entries modulo 3, then the subset (S) exists. Otherwise, the problem cannot be solved.

Assume the vertices are labeled (A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{2n}) in counterclockwise order. The imbalance changes under certain conditions: - If the top side becomes momentarily horizontal, the imbalance decreases by 1. - If the bottom side becomes momentarily horizontal, the imbalance increases by 1. - If both sides become horizontal simultaneously, the imbalance remains unaltered. 5. **180-Degree Rotation Insight**: Upon rotating (180^circ), the highest and lowest points will exactly swap their positions. Consequently, if the imbalance was in the range ([0, n]), it will now lie between ([n, 2n]) and vice versa. Notice that since the imbalance never jumps by more than 1 and it cannot be 0 (since ( A_i ne A_j )), it must attain the value (n) at some point during the rotation. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, there exists some index (i) such that a pair of parallel lines intersect the (2n)-gon solely at (A_i) and (A_{n+i}), achieving the desired condition.

Notice that the cost increases by 0.75 for each additional hour beyond the 2nd hour. So, we can calculate the cost for the remaining hours as follows: For the 6th hour, the cost is 3.25 + 0.75 = 4.00. For the 7th hour, the cost is 4.00 + 0.75 = 4.75.

Subtract Equation (1) from this simplified equation: [ (ab + ac + bc + 2a + 2b + 2c + 3) - (ab + ac + bc + a + b + c) = 0 ] This results in: [ a + b + c + 3 = 0 ] Thus, we get: [ a + b + c = -3 quad text{(Equation 3)} ] 5.

Square Equation (3): [ (a + b + c)^2 = 9 ] This results in: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc) = 9 ] Substitute Equation (4) into this: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2 cdot 3 = 9 ] Simplify to: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3 quad text{(Equation 5)} ] 7. From Equations (4) and (5), we have: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = ab + ac + bc ] This can be rewritten as: [ (a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2 = 0 ] Since the sum of squares is zero, each term must be zero. Thus: [ a = b = c ] 8. Substitute ( a = b = c ) into Equation (3): [ 3a = -3 rightarrow a = -1 ] Conclusion: The three numbers are: [ boxed{-1, -1, -1} ]"},{"prompt":"Law of Sines.

Consider the given problem where M is the midpoint of the arc AB of the circumcircle of triangle ABC that does not contain point C, and N is the midpoint of the arc BC of the circumcircle of triangle ABC that does not contain point A. 2.

Let us denote by O the circumcenter of triangle ABC. Note that O is equidistant from A, B, and C. Consequently, the points M and N lie on a circle centered at O due to the property that they are midpoints of arcs in this circumcircle not containing the respective opposite vertex. 4.

This information tells us that the temperature change is directly proportional to the time change, with a rate of 7^{circ}mathrm{C} per minute. This can be mathematically represented as Delta T = 7Delta t. 2. **Initial Condition**: At time t = 0 minutes, the temperature T is given as 30^{circ}mathrm{C}. This serves as the initial condition for the relationship between T and t. 3. **Formulating the Relationship**: Combining the rate of temperature increase and the initial condition, we can formulate the relationship between temperature T and time t. Since the temperature increases by 7^{circ}mathrm{C} for each minute, and starts from 30^{circ}mathrm{C} at t = 0, we can express T as a function of t as follows: [ T = 7t + 30 ] This equation represents a linear relationship between T and t, where 7 is the slope (rate of temperature increase per minute), and 30 is the y-intercept (initial temperature at t = 0). 4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct relationship between temperature T and time t before the water boils (i.e., t < 10) is given by the equation T = 7t + 30.

Let's consider the boundaries of perfect squares around n(n+a): [ n^2 < n(n+1) < n(n+2) < (n+1)^2 < n(n+4) < (n+2)^2 ] This inequality helps us to define forbidden intervals where n(n+a) might touch perfect squares. 3.

To understand the behavior of ( d_n ), we need to analyze the structure of the matrix ( A_n ). The entries of ( A_n ) are periodic with period ( 2pi ), but they are not uniformly distributed. This irregularity suggests that the determinant might not have a simple closed form. 3. One approach to evaluate the limit is to consider the properties of the determinant and the behavior of the cosine function. The determinant of a matrix is zero if the rows (or columns) are linearly dependent. 4. For large ( n ), the entries ( cos 1, cos 2, ldots, cos n^2 ) will cover the interval ([-1, 1]) densely due to the periodic nature of the cosine function.

To make this more rigorous, consider the fact that the cosine function can take values arbitrarily close to each other for different arguments. For example, ( cos(k) ) and ( cos(k + 2pi m) ) are equal for any integer ( m ). As ( n ) increases, the likelihood of having rows (or columns) that are nearly identical increases. 6. If two rows (or columns) of a matrix are nearly identical, the determinant of the matrix will be close to zero. This is because the determinant is a measure of the volume spanned by the row (or column) vectors, and nearly identical vectors span a very small volume. 7.

Consider the ( n+1 ) integers ( a_0, a_1, ldots, a_n ). 2. Calculate the remainders of these integers when divided by ( n ). We denote these remainders as ( r_0, r_1, ldots r_n ).

This is because 2^t is an increasing function, and so for 2^t to decrease, t must decrease. 3. **Analyze the condition on a:** Since t=x^2-ax must decrease on (0,1), and knowing the parabola opens upwards, the axis of symmetry x=frac{a}{2} must lie to the right of the interval (0,1). This ensures that within the interval (0,1), the function t is decreasing. Mathematically, this condition is frac{a}{2} geqslant 1, which simplifies to a geqslant 2. 4. **Conclude the range of a:** From the analysis, we find that for f(x) to be monotonically decreasing on (0,1), the parameter a must satisfy a geqslant 2. Therefore, the range of values for a is left[2,+infty right). Hence, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"prompt":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, it is known that a_5 + a_9 a_7 = 10.

Hence, sin^6 x cos^2 x = (frac{1}{2} sin 2x)^2 cdot frac{1}{4} (1 - 2 cos 2x + cos^2 2x) = frac{1}{16} sin^2 2x (1 - 2 cos 2x + cos^2 2x). Therefore, the integral becomes: 16 int_{0}^{pi} frac{1}{16} sin^2 2x (1 - 2 cos 2x + cos^2 2x) , dx = int_{0}^{pi} sin^2 2x (1 - 2 cos 2x + cos^2 2x) , dx. 3. **Distribute the Integrand:** Now, expand the integrand: int_{0}^{pi} (sin^2 2x - 2 sin^2 2x cos 2x + sin^2 2x cos^2 2x) , dx. 4. **Integrate Each Term Separately:** We will treat each term separately. - For (int_{0}^{pi} sin^2 2x , dx): Using the identity (sin^2 2x = frac{1}{2}(1 - cos 4x)): int_{0}^{pi} sin^2 2x , dx = int_{0}^{pi} frac{1}{2}(1 - cos 4x) , dx = frac{1}{2} int_{0}^{pi} (1 - cos 4x) , dx.

(1) To find the derivative, F'(x)=x^{2}+2x-8, Setting F'(x) > 0, we get x > 2 or x < -4; setting F'(x) < 0, we get -4 < x < 2, and considering the function's domain is (0,+infty), therefore the function F(x) is increasing on the interval (2,+infty) and decreasing on the interval (0,2).

Since fleft(frac{5pi}{12}right) = sinleft(2 times frac{5pi}{12} + varphiright) = 1, we get frac{5pi}{6} + varphi = frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi, which gives us varphi = -frac{pi}{3} + 2kpi for some integer k. Considering that |varphi| < frac{pi}{2}, we deduce that varphi = -frac{pi}{3}. Therefore, the analytical expression for f(x) is f(x) = sin(2x - frac{pi}{3}). Translating the graph of y = f(x) to the left by frac{pi}{4} units, we obtain y = sinleft[2(x + frac{pi}{4}) - frac{pi}{3}right] = sin(2x + frac{pi}{6}). Further halving the x-coordinates of all points on the graph (keeping y-coordinates the same) leads to y = sin(4x + frac{pi}{6}), which means g(x) = sin(4x + frac{pi}{6}). The analytical expression of g(x) is therefore boxed{g(x) = sin(4x + frac{pi}{6})}. (2) In triangle ABC, since b^2 = ac and the angle opposite to side b is x, by the Law of Cosines, we have cos x = frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} = frac{a^2 + c^2 - ac}{2ac} geq frac{2ac - ac}{2ac} = frac{1}{2}, hence, 0 < x leq frac{pi}{3}.

For placing the second red face, three positions are left adjacent to the blue one: left, right, and back. - **Case 1:** Place the second red on either left or right. The third red face must be on the remaining side (left or right) since placing it on the back would leave two adjacent greens which are indistinguishable. - **Case 2:** Place the second red on the back. Then the third red can only be placed symmetrical (left or right). In either case, placing reds on opposite faces (front and back or left and right) makes rotations identical by flipping cube 180° around the vertical axis through blue face, and hence indistinguishable. 3. The green faces fill the two remaining slots. Placement of greens is straightforward once reds are placed, and doesn't contribute to further variations, due to their identically coloring. Counting distinct placements: - If the second red face is placed directly adjacent to the first one (left or right), there are 2 ways (front-left-right or front-right-left). - If the second red is placed opposite the first (on the back), the third must be next to the first (front-left-right/front-right-left again, rotational symmetry reduces their count to one distinct scenario).

The number ( 734{,}851{,}474{,}594{,}578{,}436{,}096 ) is approximately ( 734.85 times 10^{18} ). 3. To find ( n ), we need to compute ( sqrt[6]{734{,}851{,}474{,}594{,}578{,}436{,}096} ). Using the approximation, we have: [ n approx sqrt[6]{734.85 times 10^{18}} = sqrt[6]{734.85} times sqrt[6]{10^{18}} ] Since ( sqrt[6]{10^{18}} = 10^3 ), we get: [ n approx sqrt[6]{734.85} times 10^3 ] 4. Next, we estimate ( sqrt[6]{734.85} ). Since ( 734.85 ) is close to ( 729 ) (which is ( 9^3 )), we can approximate: [ sqrt[6]{734.85} approx sqrt[6]{729} = sqrt[6]{9^3} = 9^{1/2} = 3 ] Therefore: [ n approx 3 times 10^3 = 3000 ] 5. We need to refine our estimate. We know ( n ) is close to 3000. Let's check values around 3000. We calculate ( 3000^6 ) and ( 3010^6 ) to narrow down the range: [ 3000^6 = (3 times 10^3)^6 = 3^6 times 10^{18} = 729 times 10^{18} = 729{,}000{,}000{,}000{,}000{,}000{,}000 ] [ 3010^6 = (3.01 times 10^3)^6 = 3.01^6 times 10^{18} approx 734.85 times 10^{18} ] 6. Since ( 3010^6 ) is slightly larger than ( 734{,}851{,}474{,}594{,}578{,}436{,}096 ), we know ( n ) is between 3000 and 3010. 7. To further narrow it down, we consider the last three digits of the number. The last three digits of ( 734{,}851{,}474{,}594{,}578{,}436{,}096 ) are 096. We need ( n^6 ) to end in 096. 8. Checking the units digit of ( n ), we find that ( n ) must end in 4 or 6 because: [ 4^6 = 4096 quad text{(last three digits are 096)} ] [ 6^6 = 46656 quad text{(last three digits are 656)} ] 9. Therefore, ( n ) must end in 4. The only number between 3000 and 3010 that ends in 4 is 3004. 10. Verify by calculating ( 3004^6 ): [ 3004^6 = 734{,}851{,}474{,}594{,}578{,}436{,}096 ] Thus, the value of ( n ) is ( boxed{3004} )."},{"prompt":"A particular library has 75 books in a special collection, all of which were in the library at the beginning of the month.

Let's consider how the sum of coordinates of the grasshopper changes during each jump.

According to the Pythagorean theorem, this gives us the equation: [ x_{n}^2 + y_{n}^2 = n^2 ] Here, (x_{n} - x_{n-1}) and (y_{n} - y_{n-1}) are the horizontal and vertical components of the jump, respectively, and (n) is the length of the jump. 2. Now, if (n) is even, then both (x_{n} - x_{n-1}) and (y_{n} - y_{n-1}) are also either both even or both odd, since the sum of their squares equals an even number. - This implies that both (x_{n}) and (y_{n}) either both maintain their parity (even or odd) or swap them, thus not affecting the overall parity of the sum (x_n + y_n). 3. On the other hand, if (n) is odd, then one of (x_{n} - x_{n-1}) or (y_{n} - y_{n-1}) is even, and the other is odd (since the sum of their squares equals an odd number). - This change introduces a difference in the parity of the sum (x_{n} + y_{n}). Each odd-length jump changes the parity of the coordinates sum. 4. Given that the number of jumps 2222 consists of - (1111) jumps of odd length (((2222+1)/2)) - (1111) jumps of even length 5. The total number of odd-length jumps is odd (1111), hence the parity of the sum of coordinates (x_{n} + y_{n}) will change (1111) times.

Assume we have already identified the point M on the circle O such that CD parallel AB, where C and D are points where the lines AM and BM intersect the circle O again. Consider the triangle AMB and the circle gamma circumscribed around it. 2. Since CD parallel AB, it follows that: [ frac{MA}{MC} = frac{MB}{MD} ] This implies that the circles O and gamma are similar with respect to the point M. 3. For M to be the similarity center of the two circles, it must also be their tangency point. Therefore, we need to construct a circle gamma passing through points A and B which also touches the circle O. There can be two such circles unless A and B are on the same side relative to circle O. 4. Draw a circle, k, passing through A and B, intersecting circle O at points K and L. The line KL is the radical axis of circles k and O. 5. The intersection of KL and AB is a point P. Point P's power relative to circles k and O is equal, implying P's power relative to circles gamma and O is also equal. Consequently, the line connecting the centers of gamma and O—the common internal tangent line—must pass through point P. 6. To locate point M, find point P as constructed. Then draw tangent lines from P to circle O, touching it at M_1 and M_2. These two tangency points are the desired points M. 7. However, if A is outside circle O and B is inside, no such points M satisfy that CD parallel AB. This is because any point M on the circle O will create intersections C and D such that they lie on opposite sides of line AB and hence CD will intersect AB. # Alternate Detailed Solution: 1.

Therefore, we can write: [ frac{overline{BM}^2}{overline{AM}^2} = left( frac{alpha}{beta} right)^2 ] and so: [ frac{BM}{AM} = frac{alpha}{beta} ] This implies that the ratio of distances from M to A and B is constant, indicating that M must lie on an Apollonius circle associated with points A and B with ratio frac{alpha}{beta}. 4. Construct the Apollonius circle corresponding to the given ratio frac{alpha}{beta} and intersecting circle O at points M_1 and M_2. Thus, the final conclusion is that the points M are determined as M_1 and M_2 where the Apollonius circle intersects with circle O. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"f point P(1, 1) is the midpoint of chord MN of the circle (x3)^2 + y^2 = 9, then the equation of the line on which chord MN lies is ______.","completion":"Given the circle's equation (x-3)^2 + y^2 = 9 and point P(1, 1) being the midpoint of chord MN, we can find the equation of the line MN by using the fact that the line connecting the center of the circle to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord.

Next, we'll find the proportion of each grade: - For the first year: 900 out of 2700 students gives frac{900}{2700}=frac{1}{3}. - For the second year: 1200 out of 2700 students gives frac{1200}{2700}=frac{4}{9}. - For the third year: 600 out of 2700 students gives frac{600}{2700}=frac{2}{9}. Now, we apply these proportions to the sample size we are aiming for, which is 135 students: - Number of first-year students sampled: frac{1}{3} times 135 = 45 - Number of second-year students sampled: frac{4}{9} times 135 = 60 - Number of third-year students sampled: frac{2}{9} times 135 = 30 Therefore, in a sample of 135 students, the numbers to be sampled from each year are: 45 from the first year, 60 from the second year, and 30 from the third year.

Also, since ( BC parallel A_1 D_1 ), the plane ( alpha ) is perpendicular to line ( BC ). 3. The rectangular parallelepiped ( ABCD ) means ( AB perp BC ). Hence, ( AB ) also lies in plane ( alpha ). 4. The sphere touches the line ( A_1 B_1 ) at ( A_1 ). Therefore, the plane ( beta ) passing through ( O ) perpendicular to ( A_1 B_1 ), will pass through ( A_1 ) and include points perpendicular to ( D_1 A_1 ), thus including ( N_1 ). 5. Hence, the sphere’s center ( O ) and point ( N_1 ) are the intersection points of planes ( alpha ) and ( beta ), intersecting along line ( ON_1 ). 6. Let ( AB ) and ( ON_1 ) intersect at ( N ). Since ( NN_1 perp AD ) (due to perpendicularity in plane ( alpha )) and ( NN_1 perp AB ) (due to perpendicularity in plane ( beta )), ( NN_1 ) is a height of the parallelepiped with ( NN_1 = 1 ). 7. Define ( AN = x ), ( NO = y ), ( OA_1 = OB = OD_1 = R ). 8. Using right triangles ( A_1N_1O ) and ( ONB ), we get the equations: R^2 = OA_1^2 = ON_1^2 + A_1N_1^2 = 4 + (y + 1)^2 R^2 = OB^2 = ON^2 + BN^2 = y^2 + (x + 4)^2 9. Let ( A_1A_2 ) also be a height of the parallelepiped. Thus, from rectangular triangles ( AA_2N ) and ( AA_1A_2 ): AA_2^2 = AN^2 + A_2N^2 = x^2 + 4 AA_1^2 = A_1A_2^2 + AA_2^2 = 1 + x^2 + 4 = 5 + x^2 10. Using right triangles ( OD_1D ) and ( OND ): OD^2 = OD_1^2 + DD_1^2 = R^2 + 5 + x^2 OD^2 = ND^2 + ON^2 = (AN^2 + AD^2) + y^2 = (x^2 + 16) + y^2 From the equality ( R^2 + 5 + x^2 = x^2 + 16 + y^2 ), it follows that ( R^2 = y^2 + 11 ). 11. Let ( angle A_1OB = varphi ). From the isosceles triangle ( A_1OB ), we find ( A_1B = 2R sin frac{varphi}{2} ). Using right triangles ( A_2BN ) and ( A_1A_2B ): A_2B^2 = BN^2 + A_2N^2 = (x + 4)^2 + 4 A_1B = sqrt{A_1A_2^2 + A_2B^2} = sqrt{1 + (x + 4)^2 + 4} = sqrt{5 + (4 + x)^2} 12. Hence, sin frac{varphi}{2} = frac{A_1B}{2R} = frac{sqrt{5 + (4 + x)^2}}{2R} 13. Given the system: begin{cases} R^2 = 4 + (y + 1)^2 R^2 = y^2 + 11 end{cases} Solving, we find ( y = 3 ) and ( R = 2sqrt{5} ); then, (4 + x)^2 = R^2 - y^2 = 20 - 9 = 11 14. Therefore, sin frac{varphi}{2} = frac{sqrt{5 + 11}}{4sqrt{5}} = frac{1}{sqrt{5}} 15.

For m = 0, the equation becomes |2^x - 2| = 0, which has exactly one solution, as the point (x, 2^x) coincides with the line y = 2 at exactly one point.

The curve y = 2^x will intersect each of these lines at exactly one point if m is small enough that both lines intersect the curve. This is because the curve y = 2^x is continuous and increases monotonically, intersecting the line y = 2 at exactly one point and approaching infinity as x increases and approaching 0 as x decreases. Therefore, there exists a range of values for m for which the equation |2^x - 2| = m has exactly two solutions. Thus, the equation |f(x) - 2| = m has two solutions when m > 0.

According to the problem, the sum of these four integers is: [ a + b + c + d = 0 ] This implies: [ a + c = -(b + d) ] 3. Each number is then multiplied by the sum of its two neighbors. Here are the detailed calculations for each product: - For ( a ), its neighbors are ( d ) and ( b ). Thus: [ a cdot (b + d) ] - For ( b ), its neighbors are ( a ) and ( c ). Thus: [ b cdot (a + c) ] - For ( c ), its neighbors are ( b ) and ( d ). Thus: [ c cdot (b + d) ] - For ( d ), its neighbors are ( a ) and ( c ). Thus: [ d cdot (a + c) ] 4. The sum of these products is: [ a(b + d) + b(a + c) + c(b + d) + d(a + c) ] 5. We need to prove that this sum multiplied by (-1) equals twice the square of an integer. First, combine and rearrange the terms: Grouping terms with ( (b + d) ) and ( (a + c) ): begin{align*} a(b + d) + b(a + c) + c(b + d) + d(a + c) &= a(b + d) + c(b + d) + b(a + c) + d(a + c) &= (a + c)(b + d) + (b + d)(a + c) end{align*} 6. Notice that: [ a + c = -(b + d) ] Substituting ( a + c = -(b + d) ): begin{align*} (a + c)(b + d) &= (-(b + d))(b + d) &= -(b + d)^2 end{align*} 7. Therefore, the expression becomes: [ -2(a + c)(b + d) = -2 times (-(b + d)^2) ] Simplifying the expression: [ -2(a + c)(b + d) = 2(a + c)^2 ] 8. Consequently, the sum of the four products multiplied by (-1) is: [ -[a(b + d) + b(a + c) + c(b + d) + d(a + c)] = 2(a + c)^2 ] 9.

There are n1 ways to insert B entirely between the adjacent digits of A to get an n+kdigit positive integer C.

(A) 6 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11","completion":"1. **Identifying the Coordinating Numbers:** - To determine if a number B is a coordinating number, we need to check whether inserting B at any position between the digits of A (where A is divisible by B) results in a new number C that is also divisible by B. 2. **Check B = 1:** - Any number A is divisible by 1. After inserting 1 into A, the resulting number C will still be divisible by 1. - Therefore, 1 is a coordinating number. 3. **Check B = 2:** - For A to be divisible by 2, the last digit of A must be even. Inserting 2 into A at any position results in a number whose last digit is still even. - Therefore, 2 is a coordinating number. 4. **Check B = 3:** - A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Inserting 3 into A adds 3 to the sum of digits, which does not affect its divisibility by 3. - Therefore, 3 is a coordinating number. 5. **Check B = 4:** - A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. Inserting 4 into an arbitrary position may not guarantee this condition is preserved. - Therefore, 4 is not a coordinating number. 6. **Check B = 5:** - A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. Inserting 5 into the middle of A will make the last digit either 0 or 5. - Therefore, 5 is a coordinating number. 7. **Check B = 6:** - Since 6 is the product of 2 and 3, both of which are coordinating numbers, 6 will also be a coordinating number. - Therefore, 6 is a coordinating number. 8. **Check B = 7:** - Divisibility rules for 7 are sophisticated and inserting 7 can disrupt these properties. - Therefore, 7 is not a coordinating number. 9. **Check B = 8:** - A number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by the last three digits is divisible by 8. Inserting 8 does not necessarily preserve this property. - Therefore, 8 is not a coordinating number. 10. **Check B = 9:** - Similar to 3, a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Inserting 9 increases the sum by 9, preserving divisibility by 9. - Therefore, 9 is a coordinating number. 11. **Check B = 10:** - Like 5, a number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0. Inserting 10 keeps this property. - Therefore, 10 is a coordinating number. 12. **Check B = 11:** - For a number divisible by 11, the difference between the sum of the digits at odd positions and even positions must be divisible by 11. This condition is preserved on inserting 11. - Therefore, 11 is a coordinating number. 13. **Check B = 12:** - Since 12 = 3 × 4, and we already determined 4 is not a coordinating number, 12 is not a coordinating number. - Therefore, 12 is not a coordinating number. 14. **Check B = 15:** - Since 15 = 3 × 5, both of which are coordinating numbers, 15 will also be a coordinating number. - Therefore, 15 is a coordinating number. 15. **Check B = 66:** - Since 66 = 2 × 3 × 11, and all these factors are coordinating numbers, 66 must be a coordinating number. - Therefore, 66 is a coordinating number. 16. **Check B = 90:** - Since 90 = 2 × 3 × 5, all these factors are coordinating numbers, so 90 will also be a coordinating number. - Therefore, 90 is a coordinating number. # Conclusion: - The coordinating numbers among 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 66, 90 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 15, 66, 90. - Hence, the total number of coordinating numbers is 11.

The binomial theorem states that: [ (1 + x_n)^n = 1 + nx_n + frac{n(n-1)}{2} x_n^2 + cdots ] Because all higher-order terms (x_n^k) with (k geq 3) are non-negative, we can write: [ (1 + x_n)^n geq 1 + nx_n + frac{n(n-1)}{2} x_n^2 ] 3. Since (x_n = sqrt[n]{2} - 1), we know that: [ sqrt[n]{2} = 1 + x_n ] and thus: [ 2 = (1 + x_n)^n ] 4. Combining the two results, we get: [ 2 = (1 + x_n)^n geq 1 + nx_n + frac{n(n-1)}{2} x_n^2 ] 5.

First, we manipulate the given conditions to understand the properties of f(x): 1. From f(x+1)+f(x-1)=2, we can deduce that f(x+2)+f(x)=2. This is because shifting the argument of f by 1 unit does not change the equation's form due to the function's domain being mathbb{R}. 2.

When each carriage carries 2 people, there are 9 people walking, implying that the number of people that can be seated in carriages is x - 9. Since each of these carriages carries 2 people, dividing this quantity by 2 gives us the total number of carriages, leading to the equation frac{x - 9}{2} = y.

The discriminant Delta = 1 + 8a can be considered to determine the sign of the derivative and hence the monotonicity of the function. - If a leq - frac{1}{8}, then Delta leq 0; f'(x) leq 0 for all x. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on mathbb{R}. - If a > - frac{1}{8}, then Delta > 0. Setting f'(x) = 0 gives the critical points x = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 8a}}{2}. For f'(x) < 0, we have x < frac{1 - sqrt{1 + 8a}}{2} or x > frac{1 + sqrt{1 + 8a}}{2}. For f'(x) > 0, we have frac{1 - sqrt{1 + 8a}}{2} < x < frac{1 + sqrt{1 + 8a}}{2}.

The minimum value of f(x) on [1,4] is thus f(4) = 8a - frac{40}{3} = -frac{16}{3}. Solving this equation for a gives a = 1 and x_2 = 2.

She worked there for 3 years, which is equivalent to 3 * 12 = 36 months. At 5000 per month, she earned 36 * 5000 = 180,000 at her old company. Now, let's find out how much she earned at her new company. We know the total amount she earned at both companies is 426,000. So, the amount she earned at her new company is 426,000 - 180,000 = 246,000. Cadence worked at her new company for 5 months longer than at her old company. So, she worked at her new company for 36 months + 5 months = 41 months. Now, let's calculate her monthly earnings at the new company. Her total earnings at the new company divided by the number of months she worked there gives us her monthly earnings: 246,000 / 41 months = 6000 per month. Now we can calculate the percentage increase in her earnings at the new company compared to her old company. The increase in her monthly earnings is 6000 - 5000 = 1000.

We aim to show that X also lies on the circle w_2. 2. Let alpha, beta, and gamma be the angles of the triangle ABC. 3. Since BH is the altitude from B to AC, it follows that H is the orthocenter of triangle ABC. The orthocenter lies on the altitude, thus dividing angle BAC into two right angles. Thus, we have: [ angle HAC = 90^circ - gamma ] because angle BAC = gamma and angle BAC + angle HAC = 90^circ. 4. Since AH is the altitude, we also have: [ angle AHX = gamma ] 5. Notably, ACHX forms a cyclic quadrilateral because X lies both on the circle w_1 and on the other side of AC from B. Hence, the opposite angles, angle ACX and angle AHX, are supplementary: [ angle ACX = angle AHX = gamma ] 6. Similarly, we can infer: [ angle CAX = alpha ] 7. This results in: [ triangle ABC cong triangle AXC ] by the angle-angle similarity, because they share angle BAC = alpha and angle BCA = angle XCA. 8. By reflection, X is the symmetrical point to B relative to the line AC, due to the established congruence of triangles and the cyclic nature of the quadrilateral. 9. Since both circles w_1 and w_2 are symmetrical with respect to line AC and pass through B, symmetry implies that X lies on the circle w_2 as well. 10.

Hence, ( 1, 2, ldots, k-1 in A ). Without loss of generality, assume ( k in B ) (the case ( k in C ) can be treated similarly by exchanging the roles of ( B ) and ( C )). 2. **Case 1: There exists some ( x in C ) such that ( x - 1 notin A ):** Let ( x_0 ) be the smallest such element in ( C ).

The focus of a parabola in the form x^{2}=4ay is at (0,a), so for our parabola, the focus is at (0,1). Next, we need to find the equation of the line passing through this focus and inclined at an angle of frac{3pi}{4}. The slope of a line inclined at an angle theta is given by tan(theta). Since tanleft(frac{3pi}{4}right) = -1, the equation of the line can be written as y = mx + c, where m = -1 and it passes through (0,1). Substituting these values, we get y = -x + 1. Now, we have the system of equations: [ left{ begin{array}{l} x^{2} = 4y y = -x + 1 end{array} right. ] Substituting y from the second equation into the first gives us x^{2} = 4(-x + 1).

For the parabola C_2 with equation y^{2} = 4cx, the focus is at (c, 0). Substituting x = c, we get y^{2} = 4c^{2}, thus |y| = 2c. Therefore, the chord length |CD| = 4c. 2. For the ellipse C_1, substituting x = c into its equation gives y^{2} = b^{2}left(1 - frac{c^{2}}{a^{2}}right) = frac{b^{4}}{a^{2}}, so |y| = frac{b^{2}}{a}.

To scale the x-coordinates by a factor of frac{1}{4}, we multiply the argument of the sine function by 4. This gives us y=sin(4(x+frac{pi}{6})) = y=sin(4x+frac{2pi}{3}). 2. **Shifting the graph:** To shift the graph to match the desired function, we need to adjust the phase of the sine function. We want to transform y=sin(4x+frac{2pi}{3}) into y=sin(4x-frac{pi}{3}). To do this, we need to shift the graph to the right by frac{pi}{8} units, since shifting to the right by frac{pi}{8} changes the phase from +frac{2pi}{3} to -frac{pi}{3} (considering the effect of the 4x scaling on the shift).

Shifting y=sin(x+frac{pi}{6}) to the right by frac{pi}{2} units would not directly lead to the desired function. 2. **Scaling the x-coordinates:** After the incorrect initial shift, scaling the x-coordinates by frac{1}{4} would not correct the phase to match y=sin(4x-frac{pi}{3}). Therefore, the description in Option C does not accurately reflect the necessary transformations. **For Option D:** Shifting to the left by frac{pi}{2} units and then scaling the x-coordinates by frac{1}{4} also does not lead to the correct function y=sin(4x-frac{pi}{3}).

The first 3 jumps have the following number of ways considering the restrictions (not reaching vertex D): [ 2^3 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 ] - The final 2 remaining jumps can be any of the 2 options per jump without restriction, yielding: [ 2^2 = 4 ] - Therefore, the number of ways for 5 jumps without initially reaching D in the first 3 jumps is: [ 6 times 4 = 24 ] 5. **Summing All Possible Distinct Jumping Ways:** - Combining both cases: [ 2 (text{Three jumps to } D ) + 24 (text{Five jumps without reaching D}) = 26 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{26} ]"},{"prompt":"Suppose f(x) = 6x 9 and g(x) = frac{x}{3} + 2.

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Speed of first train = 60 km/hr Speed of second train = 40 km/hr Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 40 km/hr Relative speed = 100 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second to be consistent with the lengths of the trains, which are given in meters. 1 km/hr = (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) 1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s Therefore, the relative speed in meters per second is: Relative speed = 100 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed = (100 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed = (500/18) m/s Now, we need to find the time it takes for the trains to cross each other.

Each side of ( BYZ ) is scaled by (frac{k}{k+1}), giving area scaling of: [ text{Area}(BYZ) = left( frac{k}{k+1} right)^2 cdot text{Area}(BCD) ] Its height is (frac{1}{k+1}) of the height of ( A ) above ( BCD ).

The movement of the turtle can be visualized on a grid where each move is either in the horizontal or vertical direction. 4. We need to consider the total displacement of the turtle after 11 hours.

Specifically, when mixing p mixtures left(K_1, m_1right), left(K_2, m_2right), ldots, left(K_p, m_pright), the resulting mixture can be characterized as (C, m_1 + m_2 + ldots + m_p), determined by: left(C, m_1 + ldots + m_pright) = left(K_1, m_1right) + left(K_2, m_2right) + ldots + left(K_p, m_pright). 2. **Induction Step:** We need to prove that the theorem holds true for n = p + 1 mixtures. Consider mixing p+1 mixtures: left(K_1, m_1right), left(K_2, m_2right), ldots, left(K_p, m_pright), left(K_{p+1}, m_{p+1}right). By the given assumption, the mixture obtained from the first p mixtures can be represented as (C, m_1 + ldots + m_p). Therefore, mixing these p+1 mixtures is equivalent to mixing the two mixtures: left(C, m_1 + ldots + m_pright) quad text{and} quad left(K_{p+1}, m_{p+1}right). 3. **Applying the Theorem from Problem 1:** By the theorem proven in Problem 1, the result of this mixing can be characterized as: (K, m) = left(C, m_1 + ldots + m_pright) + left(K_{p+1}, m_{p+1}right). Furthermore, since: left(C, m_1 + ldots + m_pright) = left(K_1, m_1right) + left(K_2, m_2right) + ldots + left(K_p, m_pright), we can substitute this equivalence back into the equation to get: (K, m) = left(K_1, m_1right) + left(K_2, m_2right) + ldots + left(K_p, m_pright) + left(K_{p+1}, m_{p+1}right). 4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the theorem is true for n = p + 1 if it is true for n = p.

Setting the combined rate equal to ( frac{1}{3} ), we get: [ frac{7}{t} = frac{1}{3} ] Now, we solve for ( t ): [ 7t = 3 ] [ t = frac{3}{7} ] So, Pipe A takes ( frac{3}{7} ) minutes to fill the tank alone, which is approximately 0.4286 minutes. However, this result does not make sense because it would mean that Pipe A fills the tank in less than half a minute, which contradicts the information that together they take 3 minutes to fill the tank.

We will prove by induction that ( x_n + y_n + z_n = x_n y_n z_n ) for all natural numbers ( n ). **Base Case:** For ( n = 1 ): [ 2 + 4 + frac{6}{7} = 6 cdot frac{6}{7} = frac{42}{7} = 6. ] Thus, the statement holds for ( n=1 ). **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume for ( n = k ), ( x_k + y_k + z_k = x_k y_k z_k ). **Induction Step:** We need to show it holds for ( n = k+1 ).

Let D_n be the set {det A : A in mathcal{M}_n}. The problem asks for the size of D_{2021}. 2. **Base cases:** - For n = 1, the possible matrices are begin{pmatrix}0end{pmatrix} and begin{pmatrix}1end{pmatrix}, so D_1 = {0, 1}. - For n = 2, the possible matrices are begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 0 & 0end{pmatrix}, begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 0 & 0end{pmatrix}, begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 0 & 0end{pmatrix}, begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 1 & 0end{pmatrix}, begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 0 & 1end{pmatrix}, begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 0 & 1end{pmatrix}, begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 1 & 0end{pmatrix}, and begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 1 & 1end{pmatrix}. The determinants are 0, 1, -1, so D_2 = {0, 1, -1}. 3. **Symmetry in determinants:** For n geq 2, it is clear that x in D_n iff -x in D_n for any x, by exchanging any two rows of a matrix. 4. **Inclusion of determinants:** For any A in mathcal{M}_{n-1}, the matrix begin{pmatrix}1 & & Aend{pmatrix} belongs to mathcal{M}_n and has the same determinant as A. This shows that D_{n-1} subseteq D_n. 5. **Structure of matrices in mathcal{M}_n:** - If there is one row of A with no 1, then the determinant is 0, which is already in D_{n-1}. - If there is one row of A with only one 1, then removing the row and column containing that 1 from A will give a matrix in mathcal{M}_{n-1}, which has the same determinant as A. This means that det A belongs to D_{n-1}. - It follows that each row of A contains exactly two 1's. - Similarly, if there is one column of A with no 1 or only one 1, then det A belongs to D_{n-1}. - As the total number of 1's is equal to 2n, each column of A also contains exactly two 1's. 6. **Graph representation:** - No two rows of A are identical, otherwise the determinant would be zero. - We have a simple graph, whose vertices are the columns of A, and each row defines an edge connecting the two columns on which this row has a 1. - Each vertex of this graph has degree 2. Thus the graph is a disjoint union of several circles. 7. **Block diagonal form:** - The matrix A can be written as a block diagonal matrix, whose diagonal blocks are all of the form: [ begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & & & 1 1 & 1 & & & ddots & & ddots & & 1 & & & 1 & 1 end{pmatrix} ] - Each block has size at least 3 times 3. - For a block of size k, the determinant of the block is (-1)^k + 1, which is 0 or 2 according to whether k is even or odd. - Thus all blocks are of odd size. That is, we can write n = k_1 + cdots + k_r with all k_i geq 3 odd, and the determinant of A is, up to sign, equal to 2^r. 8. **Summary:** For n geq 2, we have: [ D_n = {0, pm 1} cup bigcup_{m = 3}^n {pm 2^r : m = k_1 + cdots + k_r, k_i geq 3, 2 nmid k_i} ] From here, it is easy to see that: [ D_{2021} = {0} cup {pm 2^r : 0 leq r leq 673} ] The final answer is boxed{1348}."},{"prompt":"Given the sets M = {x | x^2 2x 3 le 0} and N = {x | y = lg x}, find the intersection M cap N.","completion":"First, we factor the inequality for set M: [(x - 3)(x + 1) le 0.] By solving this inequality, we find the solution: [-1 le x le 3.] This implies that the set M can be written as an interval: [M = [-1, 3].] Now, we look at set N, where y = lg x.

The game ends when neither player can make a move or the sum of all drawn vectors is zero, with the win conditions specified accordingly. To solve this, let's analyze the given strategy and its correctness in detail: 1. **Strategy Description**: - The first player always moves by connecting points with a vector that has the maximum possible x-coordinate (abscissa). If there are multiple vectors with the same maximum x-coordinate, he chooses the one with the maximum y-coordinate (ordinate). 2. **Outcome Verification**: - We need to prove that following the above strategy results in a sum of vectors that is never zero unless the game is over, thus ensuring the first player's victory when no more moves are possible. 3. **Property of the Strategy**: - **Positive Vector**: Define a positive vector as one having either a positive x-coordinate or, if the x-coordinate is zero, a positive y-coordinate. - **Move Analysis**: - Every vector chosen by the first player is a positive vector due to the strategy. - The sum of any two positive vectors remains positive. - Consequently, each move by the first player maintains a positive resultant vector sum after his turn. 4. **No Zero Sum Condition**: - Show that after any move by the second player, the vector sum remains positive (not zero): - Suppose, hypothetically, the sum of vectors becomes zero after the second player's move. - **Possible Scenarios**: - First player's move is a vector vec{AB}. - Second player's move is a vector -vec{CD}, where -vec{CD} denotes the vector from D to C. - **Case Analysis**: - If the x-coordinates of points A and D differ, vectors vec{AC} or vec{DB} have greater x-coordinates than vec{AB} which contradicts the move selection rule. - If x-coordinates of A and D match, then their y-coordinates differ (otherwise, A=D and B=C which trivializes the move). Here, vec{AC} or vec{DB} still maintains one positive coordinate component making the sum positive. 5. **Conclusion**: - The induction on the sum ensures that it remains positive after every move by the first player, and thus the scenario of zero vector sum occurs only due to a specific move structure or end of feasible moves, wherein the first player wins due to the strategy.

Thus, such a point ( O ) fits the condition. This confirms that at least one point can satisfy the condition by this construction. 2. **Negating the Possibility of More Than One Point**: Suppose there are at least two such points ( P ) and ( Q ) satisfying the condition. - Consider ( A ) as a point different from ( P ). - The line perpendicular to segment ( PA ) through ( P ) has to have all the points, including ( A ), on one side of it. This means ( P ) must lie on the convex hull of the 2006 points. 3. **Convex Hull Argument**: - Suppose ( P ) lies on the convex hull. For ( P ) to create an acute-angled triangle with any other two points, the angles at ( P ) and its adjacent vertices on the convex hull should be acute. - A convex polygon can have at most three acute angles. Hence, if the convex hull has more than four vertices, ( P ) is the only point satisfying our condition. 4. **Triangle Convex Hull**: - If the convex hull is a triangle, then none of its vertices can be such a point, because from a point inside a triangle, at most one side appears at an acute angle. - This eliminates the possibility of having all points forming acute angles with two others at such vertices. 5. **General Argument for any number of points**: - Given the convex polygon's properties, replacing any point on the convex hull could at most contribute to one qualifying point because the acute-angle constraint limits vertex position due to internal or external angles forming obtuse or right configurations upon the insertion of additional points. Conclusively, for any set of 2006 points, at most one point can satisfy the condition of forming acute-angled triangles with any other two points. # Conclusion: [ boxed{1} ]"},{"prompt":"The condition x > 0, y > 0 is a ( ) for frac{y}{x} + frac{x}{y} geqslant 2.

To find the solution, we consider how many flowers Vasya has to pick to ensure that at least 10 bouquets can be guaranteed for sale. **Step 3:** Examine the extreme case with fewer bouquets. - Suppose Vasya has picked 69 flowers: - He might have picked 49 flowers of one type (not enough to form 10 bouquets), - Additionally, he might have picked 4 flowers of each of the other 5 types. So, the total number of flowers picked is: [ 49 + 5 cdot 4 = 49 + 20 = 69 ] In this scenario, Vasya has enough to make exactly 9 bouquets (as he can't fully complete the 10th bouquet with just one type). **Step 4:** Determine the number of flowers needed to definitely form 10 bouquets. - If Vasya picks one more flower (the 70th flower), he will be able to form at least one more bouquet. - At this point, Vasya will have 70 flowers. **Step 5:** Verify no leftover combinations can prevent forming 10 bouquets with 70 flowers: - After selling one bouquet, he has no more than 4 flowers of any one type left, thus: [ 70 - 50 = 20 ] - Ensuring that 20 flowers remain would not disrupt the counting, implying that at least 50 flowers must be used for 10 bouquets (dually). **Conclusion:** Vasya needs to pick at least 70 flowers to guarantee he can sell 10 bouquets.

Since f(a) = f(b), it follows that g(a) = log f(a) = log f(b) = g(b). This function g(x) is piecewise linear and can be expressed as: [ g(x) = max_{1 leq i leq n} g_i(x) ] where each g_i(x) is of the form: [ g_i(x) = b_i - |x - d_i| ] 2. **Evaluate Intervals of Increase for g(x)**: Let's consider an interval [u, v] over which g(x) is increasing and coincides with one of the functions g_i(x). On such an interval, the length or increase can be computed as: [ g(v) - g(u) ] Since g is increasing on this interval, we have g(v) > g(u). Therefore, the length of the interval [u, v] contributes positively to the sum of increasing intervals. 3. **Evaluate Intervals of Decrease for g(x)**: Analogously, for an interval [u', v'] where g(x) is decreasing and coincides with one of the functions g_i(x). On this interval, the length or decrease is given by: [ g(u') - g(v') ] Since g is decreasing on this interval, we have g(u') > g(v'). Hence, the length of the interval [u', v'] contributes positively to the sum of decreasing intervals. 4. **Summing Up Changes**: As g(x) is piecewise linear, the sum of the lengths of the increasing intervals minus the sum of the lengths of the decreasing intervals represents the total change in the function g(x) over the interval [a, b]. However, given that f(a) = f(b), we know that: [ g(a) = g(b) ] Therefore, the total change in g(x) over [a, b] is zero. 5. **Conclusion**: Since the total change in g(x) over the interval [a, b] is zero, it is conclusive that: [ text{Sum of lengths of increasing intervals} = text{Sum of lengths of decreasing intervals} ] The lengths of intervals where g(x) increases and decreases balance each other out, thus proving the required statement.

He decided to switch them at some point to maximize the possible distance the car can travel. Find this maximum distance (in km).","completion":"To solve the problem of maximizing the distance the car can travel by swapping tires, we need to consider the wear and tear of both sets of tires (front and rear). We are given that the front tires last for 21,000 km and the rear tires last for 28,000 km if left in their initial positions. We will determine the point at which the tires should be swapped to maximize the distance traveled. 1. **Initial Assumptions and Swappings:** Let's denote the variables as follows: - ( D_F = 21,000 ) km (duration for front tires) - ( D_R = 28,000 ) km (duration for rear tires) - ( x ) km is the distance traveled before swapping the tires. 2. **Wear of Tires Before Swapping:** Before swapping, each front tire and each rear tire will have worn down as follows: - Front tires: ( x ) km each - Rear tires: ( x ) km each 3. **Wear of Tires After Swapping:** When the tires are swapped at ( x ) km: - The front tires (initially) will have already worn ( x ) km and will be moved to the rear. - The rear tires (initially) will have already worn ( x ) km and will be moved to the front. Let ( y ) km be the additional distance traveled after the swap. Therefore: - Total distance traveled is ( x + y ) km. - Wear on new front tires (initially rear) after swap is ( x + y ). - Wear on new rear tires (initially front) after swap is ( x + y ). 4. **Conditions for Tire Wear:** Since the wear on each tire must be within its maximum allowable distance: - Front tires (initially front + moved to rear): ( x + y leq 21,000 ) km - Rear tires (initially rear + moved to front): ( x + y leq 28,000 ) km These conditions must hold for the tires to be completely utilized without exceeding their wear limit. 5. **Swapping Point**: To find ( x ) and ( y ) that maximizes ( x + y ): - Initially, after ( x ) km, let: - The front tires have ( 21,000 - x ) km tread remaining. - The rear tires have ( 28,000 - x ) km tread remaining. Assume the tires are swapped when the front tires tread is halfway: - ( x = frac{21,000}{2} = 10,500 ) km. 6. **Total Distance Calculation:** Post swapping, the remaining distance ( y ): - For front (formerly rear) tires: ( 21,000 - x = 21,000 - 10,500 = 10,500 ) km. - For rear (formerly front) tires: ( 28,000 - x = 28,000 - 10,500 = 17,500 ) km. The limiting factor is the initially front tires now on the rear, which can travel 10,500 km more: - So, ( y = 10,500 ) km.

Let k be the number of cities in Group 1, then the number of cities in Group 2 is 20 - k. Clearly, 1 leq k leq 19. 3. **Link between groups**: Since Group 1 and Group 2 are disjoint and no city from Group 1 can fly to any city in Group 2 (or the assumption would be violated), there are no flight routes between any city in Group 1 and any city in Group 2. 4. **Counting possible routes between groups**: The number of potential routes between the cities in Group 1 and Group 2 that do not exist must be: [ k(20 - k) ] Since we do not know k, let's consider the minimum value this product can take.

We can write: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} = sum_{i=1}^{11} left|A_{i}right| = 45 cdot 11 = 495 ] Also, since each pair of subsets A_i and A_j intersects in exactly 9 elements: [ sum_{j=1}^{n} binom{x_{j}}{2} = sum_{1 leq i < j leq 11} left|A_{i} cap A_{j}right| = binom{11}{2} cdot 9 = frac{11 cdot 10}{2} cdot 9 = 495 ] 3. **Obtaining x_{i} values:** Note that binom{x_{j}}{2} = frac{x_{j}(x_{j} - 1)}{2}. Thus: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} binom{x_{i}}{2} = sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{x_{i}(x_{i} - 1)}{2} = frac{1}{2} left( sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2} - sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}right) ] Given sum_{i=1}^n frac{x_i(x_i - 1)}{2} = 495, we get: [ frac{1}{2} left( sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2} - 495 right) = 495 implies sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2} - 495 = 990 implies sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2} = 1485 ] 4. **Applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:** By the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality: [ left( sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 right) left( sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2} right) geq left( sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} right)^{2} ] Let n be the number of distinct elements in A_1 cup cdots cup A_{11}. Then: [ n cdot 1485 geq 495^2 implies n geq frac{495^2}{1485} = frac{245025}{1485} = 165 ] 5. **Conclusion:** Thus, we have left|A_{1} cup A_{2} cup cdots cup A_{11}right| geq 165. **Example for Equality:** Consider A to be the set of all 165 three-element subsets of {1, ldots, 11}. Define each subset A_i to be the set of three-element subsets containing i. There are binom{10}{2} = 45 such subsets for each i, and any two different A_i's share exactly binom{9}{1} = 9 common elements. Therefore, we can achieve the equality case.boxed"},{"prompt":"Lori owns a carsharing company. There are three red cars and two white cars available to rent.

Since all cars were rented for 3 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, each car was rented for ( 3 times 60 = 180 ) minutes. The total earnings from the red cars would be ( 3 ) (red cars) (times 3) (dollars per minute) (times 180) (minutes) = ( 3 times 3 times 180 ). The total earnings from the white cars would be ( 2 ) (white cars) (times W) (dollars per minute) (times 180) (minutes) = ( 2 times W times 180 ). The total earnings from all cars is the sum of the earnings from the red cars and the white cars, which is ( 2340 ) dollars.

What is the yield percentage of the stock?","completion":"The yield percentage of a stock is calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the market price of the stock and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. In this case, a 12% stock means that the stock pays an annual dividend of 12% of its face value. However, the face value is not provided in the question. Typically, unless otherwise stated, the face value of a stock is assumed to be 100. So, if the face value is 100, a 12% stock would pay an annual dividend of: 12% of 100 = 12 The stock is quoted at 120, which means the market price of the stock is 120. Now, we can calculate the yield percentage: Yield Percentage = (Annual Dividend / Market Price) * 100 Yield Percentage = (12 / 120) * 100 Yield Percentage = 0.1 * 100 Yield Percentage = 10% Therefore, the yield percentage of the stock quoted at 120 is boxed{10%} ."},{"prompt":"On the arcs AB and BC of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC, points K and L are chosen such that lines KL and AC are parallel. Prove that the centers of the inscribed circles of triangles ABK and CBL are equidistant from the midpoint of arc ABC.","completion":"1. Let I_{1} and I_{2} be the centers of the incircles of triangles ABK and CBL respectively. 2. Note that the lines BI_{1} and BI_{2} intersect the circumcircle of triangle ABC again at points P and Q respectively. 3. Since BP and BQ are the angle bisectors of angle ABK and angle CBL (because they pass through the respective incenter), the points P and Q are the midpoints of the arcs AK and CL, respectively. - This implies AP = CQ because the arcs AK and CL are equal by construction. 4. Consider the angles: - angle PAI_{1} = angle KAP + angle KAI_{1} - angle PAI_{1} = angle KBP + angle BAI_{1} (since angle KAP = angle KBP and I_{1} is the incenter) 5. Given that AI_{1} and BI_{1} are angle bisectors of angle BAK and angle ABK respectively, we have angle KBI_{1} + angle BAI_{1} = angle ABI_{1} + angle BAI_{1}. 6. Using the related angles in isosceles triangles: - angle ABI_{1} + angle BAI_{1} = angle PAI_{1} (since angle ABI_{1} and angle BAI_{1} corresponds to isosceles triangle properties). 7. Therefore, triangle AP I_{1} is isosceles with AP = PI_{1}. 8. Similarly, we can show that triangle CQI_{2} is isosceles with CQ = QI_{2}. - Since AP = CQ, it implies that PI_{1} = QI_{2}. 9. Now, let R be the midpoint of the arc ABC. 10. Since R is the midpoint, we have RP = RQ and consequently angle I_{1} PR = angle BPR = angle BQR = angle I_{2} QR. 11. This implies that triangles I_{1}PR and I_{2}QR are congruent by the SAS (side-angle-side) criterion. 12. Therefore, the distances I_{1}R and I_{2}R are equal, establishing that the centers of the incircles of triangles ABK and CBL are equidistant from the midpoint of the arc ABC. Thus, we have shown that: [ I_{1}R = I_{2}R ] and hence the centers I_{1} and I_{2} are equidistant from R. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Suppose f(x) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R}.

The function f(x) is periodic with a period of 4. This means that for any x in mathbb{R}, f(x+4) = f(x). 2. Since f(x) is an odd function, it satisfies the property f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. 3. Given f(1) = 3, we can use the properties of odd functions and periodicity to find f(43). Let's calculate f(43) step by step: - First, note that 43 can be expressed as 4 times 10 + 3 = 4 times 11 - 1. This allows us to use the periodic property of f(x). - Since f(x+4) = f(x), we can repeatedly apply this property to find that f(43) = f(4 times 11 - 1). - Using the property of odd functions, we have f(-1) = -f(1). Since 4 times 11 - 1 = -1, we can substitute this into our equation. - Given f(1) = 3, we substitute this value to find f(-1) = -3.

Can A prevent B from winning?","completion":"Given two players, alpha (who goes first) and beta, the game involves writing an integer n on the blackboard, and taking turns modifying the number according to specific rules until the number becomes zero. The player beta wins if n becomes zero. 1. **Initialization and Basic Definitions**: - alpha starts by writing a positive integer n on the board. - beta on their turn chooses a positive integer b and replaces n with n - b^2. - alpha on their turn chooses a positive integer k and replaces n with n^k. 2. **Strategy Analysis**: - If the number n on the board becomes zero during beta's turn, beta wins. - First, let us factorize n as n = x y^2 where x in mathbb{Z}_+ does not contain any square factors. Define the function f(n) = x. 3. **Action When beta Plays**: - If n is a perfect square, beta can select b = sqrt{n} to ensure n - b^2 = 0, thus winning immediately. - If n is not a perfect square, then write n as n = x y^2, where x is not a perfect square. - In this case, beta should choose b = y. Thus: [ n - b^2 = n - y^2 = x y^2 - y^2 = (x - 1) y^2 ] - Therefore, f(n - b^2) = x - 1 < x. This means beta successfully decreases the value of the function f. 4. **Action When alpha Plays**: - alpha tries to change n by writing n^k for some integer k. - If alpha selects an odd k, then: [ f(n^k) = f(n) ] - If alpha selects an even k, then: [ f(n^k) = 1 leq f(n) ] - Consequently, alpha cannot increase the function f(n) beyond its current value. 5. **Conclusion**: - Since beta always decreases f (or keeps it invariant until a suitable move is possible), but alpha cannot increase f(n), beta can continually reduce f(n) until it reaches the condition where a perfect square is available. - Eventually, beta will have an opportunity to select a b such that n - b^2=0 and win the game.

We will choose the coordinate system such that the given parabola is represented by the equation y = x^2.

The equation of such a parabola is given by: [ y = frac{1}{2s}(x - u)^2 + v - frac{s}{2} ] when the focus is above the directrix, or [ y = -frac{1}{2s}(x - u)^2 + v + frac{s}{2} ] when the focus is below the directrix. 3. **Conditions for Tangency**: Examine when the given parabola y = x^2 and a transformed parabola y = frac{1}{2s}(x - u)^2 + v - frac{s}{2} are tangent to each other. The conditions for two curves to be tangent at a point are: - They must have a common point. - Their tangents at that common point must coincide. 4. **Equating Tangent Slopes**: For the given parabola y = x^2, the slope of the tangent at any point (x) is (y' = 2x). For the transformed parabola (y = frac{1}{2s}(x - u)^2 + v - frac{s}{2}), the slope of the tangent is (y' = frac{1}{s}(x - u)).

(2) From (1), we know f(x)=(x+1)e^{-3x}, f′(x)=(-3x-2)e^{-3x}, it is easy to see that f(x) is increasing on (-infty,- frac {2}{3}) and decreasing on (- frac {2}{3},+infty), when t+1leqslant - frac {2}{3}, i.e., tleqslant - frac {5}{3}, f(x) is increasing on [t-1,t+1], f(x)_{max}=f(t+1)=(t+2)e^{-3(t+1)}; when t-1geqslant - frac {2}{3}, i.e., tgeqslant frac {1}{3}, f(x) is decreasing on [t-1,t+1], f(x)_{max}=f(t-1)=te^{-3(t-1)}; when t-1 < - frac {2}{3} < t+1, i.e., - frac {5}{3} < t < frac {1}{3}, f(x)_{max}=f(- frac {2}{3})= frac {e^{2}}{3}.

Part (a): 8 times 9 прямоугольник 1. Начнем с закрашивания ряда длиной 9 клеток, содержащего изначально закрашенную клетку. Чтобы закрасить любую клетку, у которой нечётное число закрашенных соседей, продолжаем закрашивать клетки в ряду (это возможно, так как каждая новая клетка меняет количество закрашенных соседей у соседних клеток на нечётное). 2. Далее будем красить столбцы через один, начиная закраску от покрашенного ряда. При этом каждый новый закрашенный столбец будет иметь клетки с нечётным числом закрашенных соседей, так что закраска возможна. 3. Повторяем этот процесс для оставшихся рядов: сначала ряд (если содержит хотя бы одну закрашенную клетку), затем столбцы через один до тех пор, пока не останется незакрашенных клеток.

Изначально, когда закрашена одна клетка, полупериметр равен 2. 2. На каждом шаге полупериметр или увеличивается на 1 (если у клетки была только одна соседняя закрашенная клетка), или уменьшается на 1 (если таких соседей было 3). Таким образом, полупериметр закрашенной фигуры всегда нечётный при чётном числе закрашенных клеток. 3. Заметим, что полупериметр всего прямоугольника 8 times 10 равен 18, т.е., чётный. Следовательно, весь прямоугольник закрасить нельзя, так как на некоторых шагах полупериметр должен стать нечётным, что невозможно для полного закрашивания. **Второй способ:** 1. Пусть m и n - чётные числа. Тогда mathrm{mn} - также чётное, а mathrm{mn} - 1 – нечётное. 2. На каждом шаге добавления клетки мы меняем количество закрашенных соседей у её соседей. Стороны закрашенных клеток будут увеличиваться или уменьшаться по нечётному количеству раз. 3. Стороны всех клеток прямоугольника включают и внутренние, и внешние. Таким образом, говоря о количестве сторон у mathrm{mn} клеток (включая внешние), имеем mathrm{mn}+m+n, что является чётным. 4. Таким образом, полный прямоугольник закрасить невозможно из-за несоответствия счёта нечётных и чётных сторон. Conclusion: Саша не сможет закрасить все клетки для прямоугольника размером 8 times 10.

To solve, first note that ( overrightarrow{OP} + overrightarrow{OF_2}) cdot overrightarrow{F_2P} = 0 implies angle{F_1 P F_2} = 90^circ. Then, using |overrightarrow{PF_1}| = sqrt{3} |overrightarrow{PF_2}|, we can find |overrightarrow{PF_1}| = (sqrt{3} + 3)a and |overrightarrow{PF_2}| = (sqrt{3} + 1)a.

Step 1: From ( overrightarrow{OP} + overrightarrow{OF_2}) cdot overrightarrow{F_2P} = 0 and the fact that O is the coordinate origin, we have |overrightarrow{OP}| = |overrightarrow{OF_2}|. Since F_1 and F_2 are the foci, we also have |overrightarrow{OP}| = |overrightarrow{OF_2}| = |overrightarrow{OF_1}| = c. This implies that angle{F_1 P F_2} = 90^circ.

Step 1: Since 4 must be in the intersection, 4 has to be either a or a^2. - If a = 4, this satisfies A cap B, since a is in both A and B. - If a^2 = 4, then a could be 2 or -2. However, -2 is not an option as it is not in B. Step 2: Determine the possible values of a: - Since 3 is the only common element that does not depend on a and is present in both sets, a could either be the other element in the intersection or the square root of it. - We find that a = 2 or a = 4 satisfies the condition A cap B = {3,4}. boxed{a = 2 text{ or } 4}"},{"prompt":"Calculate the number of different ways to place k identical balls into n urns, assuming: 1.

This implies that ( 2^n + 2 equiv 0 pmod{n} ), or equivalently, ( 2^n equiv -2 pmod{n} ). 2. **Prime Factor Consideration**: If ( n ) is a prime number, then ( n mid 2^n + 2 ) implies ( n mid 2^n - 2 ) (by Fermat's Little Theorem, ( 2^n equiv 2 pmod{n} )). Therefore, ( n mid 4 ), which means ( n = 2 ).

There are 100 centimeters in a meter, so: Length in cm = 25 meters × 100 cm/meter = 2500 cm Width in cm = 16 meters × 100 cm/meter = 1600 cm Now, we can calculate the area of the courtyard in square centimeters: Area = 2500 cm × 1600 cm = 4,000,000 cm² Next, we need to find the area that each brick will cover.

A graph is \\"cool\\" if we can label each vertex with a different positive integer not greater than ( frac{n^2}{4} ) and find a set of non-negative integers ( D ) such that there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the difference between their labels is in ( D ). 2. **Calculate the number of possible labelings**: The number of ways to label ( n ) vertices with distinct integers from 1 to ( frac{n^2}{4} ) is given by: [ frac{left(frac{n^2}{4}right)!}{left(frac{n^2}{4} - nright)!} ] Using Stirling's approximation, we can approximate this as: [ left(frac{n^2}{4}right)^n ] 3. **Calculate the number of possible sets ( D )**: The set ( D ) can be any subset of the integers from 0 to ( frac{n^2}{4} ), so there are: [ 2^{frac{n^2}{4}} ] possible choices for ( D ). 4. **Calculate the total number of \\"cool\\" graphs**: The total number of \\"cool\\" graphs is the product of the number of labelings and the number of sets ( D ): [ left(frac{n^2}{4}right)^n cdot 2^{frac{n^2}{4}} ] 5. **Calculate the total number of graphs on ( n ) vertices**: The total number of graphs on ( n ) vertices is: [ 2^{frac{n^2 - n}{2}} ] 6. **Compare the number of \\"cool\\" graphs to the total number of graphs**: Taking the logarithm base 2 of the number of \\"cool\\" graphs: [ log_2 left( left(frac{n^2}{4}right)^n cdot 2^{frac{n^2}{4}} right) = n log_2 left(frac{n^2}{4}right) + frac{n^2}{4} ] Simplifying further: [ n log_2 left(frac{n^2}{4}right) + frac{n^2}{4} = n (2 log_2 n - log_2 4) + frac{n^2}{4} = 2n log_2 n - n log_2 4 + frac{n^2}{4} ] 7. **Compare with the logarithm of the total number of graphs**: [ log_2 left( 2^{frac{n^2 - n}{2}} right) = frac{n^2 - n}{2} ] 8. **Analyze the asymptotic behavior**: For large ( n ), the term ( frac{n^2}{4} ) dominates the expression for the number of \\"cool\\" graphs: [ 2n log_2 n - n log_2 4 + frac{n^2}{4} ] Comparing this to ( frac{n^2 - n}{2} ), we see that: [ frac{n^2}{4} < frac{n^2}{2} ] Hence, for sufficiently large ( n ), the number of \\"cool\\" graphs is less than the total number of graphs, implying that there must be some graphs that are not \\"cool\\".
