Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have: [ left( sum_{i=1}^m d_i right)^2 leq m sum_{i=1}^m d_i^2 ] 7. Since ( d_i ) are divisors of ( n ), we know that ( d_i leq n ).

If the number is 2xy, what is the value of xy?","completion":"Let's analyze the given information: 1. x and y are both odd prime numbers. 2. x < y. 3. The number 2xy has 8 distinct positive integer factors. The number of factors of a given number can be determined by expressing the number in its prime factorization form and then using the formula for the number of factors. The prime factorization of 2xy, given that x and y are prime, would be 2^1 * x^1 * y^1. The formula for the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... where a, b, c... are the exponents of the prime factors in the prime factorization of the number. For 2xy, the exponents are 1 for 2, 1 for x, and 1 for y. So the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8, which matches the given information that the number has 8 distinct positive integer factors. Since we have already accounted for all 8 factors with the primes 2, x, and y, we know that x and y cannot have any other factors besides 1 and themselves. Therefore, x and y must be distinct prime numbers. Now, we need to find the value of xy. Since x and y are odd primes and x < y, the smallest possible values for x and y would be the first two odd primes, which are 3 and 5.

The equation of this tangent is of the form [y - 4 = m(x - 2).] Setting y = x^2, we get x^2 - 4 = m(x - 2), or x^2 - mx + 2m - 4 = 0. Since we have a tangent, x = 2 is a double root of this quadratic. Therefore, the quadratic should be identical to (x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4. Hence, m = 4. Let the center of the circle be (a,b). The line joining the center (a, b) and (2, 4) is perpendicular to the tangent line, which means its slope is -frac{1}{4}. This gives us the equation [frac{b - 4}{a - 2} = -frac{1}{4}.] Since the points (2,4) and (1,0) are on the circle, they must be equidistant from its center.

Start by rewriting and rearranging the given inequality: [ a^{4} + 2a^{3}b + 2ab^{3} + b^{4} - 6a^{2}b^{2} geq 0 ] 3. Group the terms to facilitate factoring: [ left(a^{4} - 2a^{2}b^{2} + b^{4}right) + 2ableft(a^{2} - 2ab + b^{2}right) ] 4. Recognize the factorizations: - (a^{4} - 2a^{2}b^{2} + b^{4} = (a^{2} - b^{2})^{2}) - (a^{2} - 2ab + b^{2} = (a - b)^{2}) Using these, rewrite the expression: [ (a^{2} - b^{2})^{2} + 2ab(a - b)^{2} ] 5.

Next, simplify the term inside the parentheses: [ (a + b)^{2} + 2ab ] Since: [ (a + b)^{2} = a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2} ] Thus: [ a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2} + 2ab = a^{2} + 4ab + b^{2} ] The expression then becomes: [ (a - b)^{2}(a^{2} + 4ab + b^{2}) ] 8.

When n is even, {a_{n}} forms another arithmetic sequence with the first term a_2 = 2 and common difference d = 4. Therefore, a_{n} = 2 + 4left(frac{n}{2}-1right) = 2n - 2. 7. For odd n, the sum S_{n} can be calculated as S_{n} = frac{frac{n+1}{2}(4 + 2n + 2) + frac{n-1}{2}(2 + 2n - 4)}{2} = n^2 + n + 2. 8. For even n, the sum S_{n} is S_{n} = frac{frac{n}{2}(4 + 2n) + frac{n}{2}(2 + 2n - 2)}{2} = n^2 + n. 9. To find the smallest odd n such that S_{n} > 2023, we solve n^2 + n + 2 > 2023, which gives n geq 45. 10. To find the smallest even n such that S_{n} > 2023, we solve n^2 + n > 2023, which gives n geq 46. Since we are looking for the smallest n, and 45 is the smallest value that satisfies the condition S_{n} > 2023, the answer is 45.

Its essence is to evenly distribute the principal for repayment in each period.

Zhang Hua, a college student who started his own business, borrowed 480,000 yuan from the bank.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of repayment periods is 20 times 12 = 240 months. Therefore, the monthly repayment of the principal is the total loan amount divided by the number of repayment periods: [ text{Monthly Repayment of Principal} = frac{480,000}{240} = 2000 text{ yuan} ] 2. **Determine the Repayment Amount for the nth Month (a_n)**: The repayment amount in the nth month, a_n, consists of two parts: the fixed monthly repayment of the principal, which we've calculated as 2000 yuan, and the interest for that month. The interest for the nth month is calculated on the remaining loan amount, which is the initial loan amount minus the total principal repaid up to the month before the nth month. The total principal repaid up to the month before the nth month is (n-1) times 2000. The monthly interest rate is 0.4%, or 0.004 in decimal form. Thus, the interest for the nth month is: [ text{Interest for the } ntext{th month} = left[480,000 - (n-1) times 2000right] times 0.004 ] Adding the fixed principal repayment, the formula for a_n becomes: [ a_n = 2000 + left[480,000 - (n-1) times 2000right] times 0.004 ] Simplifying this expression: [ a_n = 2000 + left[480,000 times 0.004 - (n-1) times 2000 times 0.004right] ] [ a_n = 2000 + 1920 - 8(n-1) ] [ a_n = 3920 - 8n + 8 ] [ a_n = 3928 - 8n ] Therefore, the repayment amount for the nth month for Zhang Hua is a_{n} = 3928 - 8n.

We want to prove that one can travel from A to B even if two roads (edges) are closed for repair. 2. **Assumption Before Repair**: Assume that before any roads were closed, it was possible to reach from A to B. Since the polyhedron is convex, it is connected, and there exists a path from any vertex to any other vertex in this polyhedron. 3. **Projection Concept**: Consider a projection of the polyhedron onto a line that is not perpendicular to any of its edges. This means the vertices of the polyhedron project onto distinct points on this line. Let the projections of the vertices A and B be A' and B', respectively. 4. **Extreme Points of Projection**: - Let M' and N' be the points corresponding to the extreme projections of the polyhedron. The vertices M and N project onto M' and N', respectively. 5. **Path Discovery**: - If we move from vertex A such that in the projection it proceeds from M' towards N', eventually, it will reach vertex N. Similarly, one can move from vertex B to vertex N. This means A to B connectivity can be established through N. 6. **Handling Closed Roads**: - Suppose the direct path from A to B includes the closed edges. Because the polyhedron is convex, each edge belongs to exactly two faces. - If one edge is closed, we attempt to bypass using the adjacent edges on either side of the closed edge. - With two closed edges, consider the respective faces sharing these edges. The second closed road cannot block both alternative paths around the first closed road simultaneously because the polyhedron's structure (being convex) ensures that there is still another adjacent face/path available. Therefore, even with two edges closed, there remains at least one path (through faces or edges) making it possible to travel from A to B. 7. **Conclusion**: Thus, regardless of which two roads are under repair, the remaining roads provide a connecting path from A to B within the convex polyhedron. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"65 % of x equals 20 % of a certain number.

This setup presents a contradiction since it contradicts the original condition that three subsets must have a common element. 7. **Conclude the result**: Since assuming that subsets lack a common element led to a contradiction, it follows that there must indeed be one element, say ( x ), that is present in each subset of ( F ).

Substituting F in the equation, we get: 1/2 * I + 300 + I = 1650 Combining like terms, we get: 3/2 * I + 300 = 1650 Now, let's solve for I: 3/2 * I = 1650 - 300 3/2 * I = 1350 Multiplying both sides by 2/3 to solve for I, we get: I = (2/3) * 1350 I = 900 Now that we have I, we can find F: F = 1/2 * I F = 1/2 * 900 F = 450 Now we have the amounts for Isha (I = 900), Florence (F = 450), and Rene (R = 300).

For statement (2), a smaller |r| implies a weaker, not stronger, degree of correlation; therefore, statement (2) is incorrect. Regarding statement (3), when |r| approaches 0, the linear correlation weakens.

How many miles did James travel in the second hour?","completion":"Let's denote the distance James traveled in the first hour as ( x ) miles. In the second hour, he traveled 20 percent farther than the first hour, so he traveled ( x + 0.20x = 1.20x ) miles. In the third hour, he traveled 25 percent farther than he did in the second hour, so he traveled ( 1.20x + 0.25 cdot 1.20x = 1.20x + 0.30x = 1.50x ) miles.

To address the problem, let us proceed step-by-step: 1. **Identify the roles of the islanders:** Each islander is either a knight, who always tells the truth, or a liar, who always lies. 2. **Identify the statements made by the islanders:** - Islanders at odd-numbered positions (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) say \\"Knight\\" about their neighbor. - Islanders at even-numbered positions (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.) say \\"Liar\\" about their neighbor. 3. **Examine possible scenarios starting with the first position:** **Scenario 1: The first islander is a knight.** - As a knight, the first islander tells the truth, so the 2nd islander is indeed a knight. - The 2nd islander, being a knight, must truthfully call the 3rd islander a “liar.” - The 3rd islander, as a liar, would lie, incorrectly labeling the 4th islander a “knight.” - This alternating pattern continues. Each pair of positions (1-2, 3-4, etc.) consists of a knight followed by a liar. Following through all 50 positions, the pairings would form a repetitive combination every four positions. The sequence appears as: [ text{Knight (K)} - text{Knight (K)} - text{Liar (L)} - text{Liar (L)} - ldots - text{Knight (K)} ] Here, the positions 49 and 50 fall into this cyclical pattern, so if the 49th islander is a knight, the 50th islander would also be a knight. 4. **Examine the other possible scenario where the first islander is a liar:** **Scenario 2: The first islander is a liar.** - As a liar, the first islander would lie, falsely calling the 2nd islander a “knight.” - The 2nd islander (actually a liar) would lie, falsely labeling the 3rd islander a “liar.” - The 3rd islander, actually a liar by previous determination, would truthfully call the 4th islander a “liar.” - This results in alternating pairs of knights and liars. Continuing this sequence through to the 50th position, the pairs would also form a similar pattern, with positions cyclical: [ text{Liar (L)} - text{Liar (L)} - text{Knight (K)} - text{Knight (K)} - ldots - text{Liar (L)} ] Here, the 50th islander would be a knight again following the alternating pattern. 5. **Conclusion:** In both scenarios examined — if the first islander is either a knight or a liar — the last (50th) islander repeats the cyclical sequence ending in a knight.

Thus, when x = 0, y has its minimum value of boxed{0}. (II) Proof: Let h(x) = f(x) - g(x), i.e., h(x) = e^x - kx - 1. Therefore, h'(x) = e^x - k. Setting h'(x) = 0 gives x = ln k (for k > 1). Since k > 1, for x in (0, ln k), we have h'(x) < 0, which means h(x) is monotonically decreasing in (0, ln k). Since h(0) = 0 and h(x) is a continuous function on mathbb{R}, it follows that h(x) < 0 holds in (0, ln k), i.e., f(x) < g(x) holds in (0, ln k).

However, for l to be perpendicular to the plane alpha, it is necessary but not sufficient that l is perpendicular to two lines m and n within alpha. A crucial condition that is missing here is that m and n must intersect, i.e., mcap nneq varnothing. Without this condition, we cannot guarantee that l is perpendicular to every line in alpha, hence making option A incorrect. **Option B**: It suggests that if mbot alpha and lbot m, then lparallel alpha. This statement is flawed because l being perpendicular to m does not imply l is parallel to alpha. In fact, l could very well lie within the plane alpha if it intersects m at the right angle within alpha. Thus, option B is incorrect. **Option C**: This option claims that if mbot alpha and alpha bot beta, then mparallel beta.

(Ⅱ) In triangle triangle ABC, since cos B=-frac{1}{2}, it follows that sin B= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} (as the cosine of angle B is negative and we are assuming that angle B is obtuse, given that the sine is positive for both acute and obtuse angles).

For points of tangency A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}), the equations of the tangents from point P to these points are: [ {l}_{PA}: y=frac{{x}_{1}}{2}x-frac{{{x}_{1}}^{2}}{4} ] [ {l}_{PB}: y=frac{{x}_{2}}{2}x-frac{{{x}_{2}}^{2}}{4} ] This implies that point P has coordinates left(frac{{x}_{1}+{x}_{2}}{2}, frac{{x}_{1}{x}_{2}}{4}right). For the line l_{AB} with equation y=kx+b, solving the parabola equation and eliminating y gives us x^{2}-4kx-4b=0. The discriminant Delta =16k^{2}+16b must be greater than 0, implying k^{2}+b gt 0. We also have x_{1}+x_{2}=4k and x_{1}x_{2}=-4b. Thus, P(2k, -b). The length of AB and the distance from P to AB are given by: [ |AB|=sqrt{1+{k}^{2}}•sqrt{16{k}^{2}+16b} ] [ {d}_{p→AB}=frac{|2{k}^{2}+2b|}{sqrt{{k}^{2}+1}} ] Therefore, the area of triangle PAB is: [ {S}_{△PAB}=frac{1}{2}|AB|•{d}_{p→AB}=4({k}^{2}+b)^{frac{3}{2}} ] Given that point P(2k, -b) lies on the circle M: x^{2}+left(y+4right)^{2}=1, we find: [ {k}^{2}=frac{1-(b-4)^{2}}{4} ] Substituting this into the expression for {S}_{△PAB}, we get: [ {S}_{△PAB}=4left(frac{-{b}^{2}+12b-15}{4}right)^{frac{3}{2}} ] Since y_{p}=-b falls within the interval left[-5,-3right], when b=5, we achieve the maximum area of triangle PAB, which is: [ ({S}_{△PAB})_{max}=20sqrt{5} ] Thus, the maximum area of triangle PAB is boxed{20sqrt{5}}."},{"prompt":"an isosceles triangle, the center of the inscribed circle divides the altitude in a ratio of 12: 5, and the lateral side is equal to 60.

[ AM = frac{5}{17} times CM ] 4. **Using the given side lengths:** * The equal sides of the isosceles triangle are 60, so CM is the height from vertex C perpendicular to base AB. * A is the point where the incircle is tangent to AC, hence AM = frac{5}{12} times 60 = 25. 5. **Finding the Base AB:** * Since AB is bisected by C and M is the midpoint of AB (height in isosceles triangle): [ AB = AC + BC = 25 + 25 = 50 ] 6. **Concluding the Length of the Base AB:** * Finally, we conclude the length of the base AB as: [ boxed{50} ]"},{"prompt":"Ali, Nada, and John have a total of 67 in their wallets.

According to the problem, Ali has 5 less than Nada, so Ali has N - 5. John has 4 times more than Nada, which means John has 4N. The total amount of money they have together is 67, so we can write the equation: N + (N - 5) + 4N = 67 Combining like terms, we get: 6N - 5 = 67 Now, we add 5 to both sides of the equation to solve for N: 6N = 67 + 5 6N = 72 Divide both sides by 6 to find the value of N: N = 72 / 6 N = 12 Now that we know Nada has 12, we can find out how much John has by multiplying Nada's amount by 4: John's amount = 4N John's amount = 4 * 12 John's amount = 48 So, John has boxed{48} ."},{"prompt":"Let ( a, b, c > 0 ) and ( lambda geq 1 ).

To prove the inequality [ sum frac{a^2}{a^2 + lambda ab + b^2} geqslant frac{3}{lambda + 2}, ] first, we need to rewrite the given condition in a more manageable form. 2.

This can be rearranged to [ sum frac{x^4}{x^4 + lambda x^2 yz + y^2z^2} geqslant frac{3}{lambda + 2}. ] 4.

Thus to prove the required inequality, it's sufficient to show that [ frac{(sum x^2)^2}{sum x^4 + sum x^2 y^2 + lambda sum x^2 yz} geqslant frac{3}{lambda + 2}. ] Simplifying this, we get: [ (lambda - 1) sum x^4 + (2lambda + 1) sum x^2 y^2 - 3lambda sum x^2 yz geqslant 0. ] 6.

Square both sides: [ x^2 + 2x + y - 4 = (-x - 1)^2 ] Simplifying, we get: [ x^2 + 2x + y - 4 = x^2 + 2x + 1 ] [ y - 4 = 1 implies y = 5 ] So, the condition ( x leq -1 ) must hold. 2. Substitute ( y = 5 ) into the first equation: [ log _{|x+3|}(a x + 4 a) = 2 log _{|x+3|}(x + 5) ] Using the property of logarithms: [ log _{|x+3|}(a x + 4 a) = log_{|x+3|}((x + 5)^2) ] This implies: [ a x + 4 a = (x + 5)^2 ] Expanding and simplifying: [ ax + 4a = x^2 + 10x + 25 ] Rearranging gives the quadratic equation: [ x^2 + (10 - a)x + (25 - 4a) = 0 ] Analyze the number of solutions: For the equation ( x^2 + (10 - a)x + (25 - 4a) = 0 ) to have two distinct solutions within (-5 < x leq -1) and excluding (x neq -4, x neq -3, x neq -2), the discriminant must be positive: [ D = (10 - a)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (25 - 4a) = 100 - 20a + a^2 - 100 + 16a = a^2 - 4a ] [ D = a(a - 4) ] The discriminant must be greater than zero: [ a(a - 4) > 0 ] Excluding (a = 4.5) because (D = 0) at (a = 4.5), analyze the intervals: [ 0 < a < 4 quad text{or} quad a > 4 ] Within the range (-5 < x leq -1), considering the roots: [ -5 < frac{10 - a - sqrt{D}}{2} < -1 quad text{and} quad -5 < frac{10 - a + sqrt{D}}{2} < -1 ] Evaluating (a = 4): Substitute (a = 4): [ x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0 ] [ (x + 3)^2 = 0 implies x = -3 ] Evaluating (a = 4.5): [ x^2 + 5.5x + 7 = 0 ] [ x = frac{10 - 4.5 pm sqrt{(4.5)^2 - 4(7)}}{2} ] [ x = frac{5.5 pm sqrt{20.25 - 28}}{2} = frac{5.5 pm sqrt{-7.75}}{2} ] Since it has an imaginary part, discard (a = 4.5).

The amount of milk in the initial mixture is: (7/15) * 150 liters = 70 liters The amount of water in the initial mixture is: (3/15) * 150 liters = 30 liters The amount of juice in the initial mixture is: (5/15) * 150 liters = 50 liters Now, 10 liters of each liquid are removed, so the new amounts are: Milk: 70 - 10 = 60 liters Water: 30 - 10 = 20 liters Juice: 50 - 10 = 40 liters The total amount of the new solution is 60 + 20 + 40 = 120 liters.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Define the Objective:** We need to find the distance from the circle to the nearest lattice point and show that this distance can be made arbitrarily small for large enough radii r. 2. **Selection of the Calculations:** We choose lattice points lying on lines parallel to the coordinate axes at integer distances. Without loss of generality, we choose lines parallel to the y-axis. 3. **Distance Calculation:** Let’s consider a line x = u where u is an integer and u satisfies [ u leq r < u + 1. ] This ensures that the line intersects our circle. 4. **Identify Close Lattice Points:** On the line x = u, consider lattice points (u, v) and (u, v + 1) where v is an integer.

What could be the sum of the numbers written at the four vertices of the entire board?","completion":"Step 1: Understanding the Board The board is a grid of size (2016 times 2017) cells, alternatingly colored gold and silver in a checkerboard pattern. Each cell has numbers assigned to its corners (vertices) which are either 0 or 1. Step 2: Summation Conditions Each gold cell must have an even sum of its vertices. Each silver cell must have an odd sum of its vertices. Step 3: Summing Vertices Across the Grid First, consider the total sum of all corners (vertices) in the entire board: 1. The board has (2016) rows and (2017) columns, so it has (2017 times 2018) vertices in total. 2. Each vertex belongs to 2 adjacent cells except for the boundary vertices which belong to only one cell. Summing over all cells, each vertex (corner) is counted multiple times. However, recognizing the sums for all cells combined: - If sums of gold cells are even, and sums of silver cells are odd, the overall sum (considering each vertex multiple times) will be even since even counts plus an odd number of odd counts results overall in an even sum (due to the constraints provided). Step 4: Considering Corner Cells Individually When focusing on the vertices at the corners of the entire grid: - These vertices do not share their values with other cells but will still influence the overall grid based on the given constraints. Step 5: Possible Values of Corner Vertices The vertices at the very edge intersections of the checkerboard pattern cells can be adjusted to ensure the entire grid remains consistent: - Setting all four corner vertices to 0 satisfies the even condition for the total sum across the grid. - Replacing one of the corner 0s with a 1 will make the total sum of the vertices 2. - Replacing all four corners with 1s results in a sum total of 4. Thus, the only possible sums for the vertices at the four corners of the board, while satisfying all constraints, are 0, 2, or 4.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Identify pairs of cards that sum to 11**: We first list the pairs of numbers that add up to 11: [ begin{align*} 1 + 10 &= 11, 2 + 9 &= 11, 3 + 8 &= 11, 4 + 7 &= 11, 5 + 6 &= 11. end{align*} ] There are 5 pairs in total. 2. **Consider the worst-case scenario**: To ensure that at least one such pair is drawn, we must consider the worst-case scenario where the pairs are split as evenly as possible without obtaining a sum of 11. If we pick one card from each pair, we will have picked 5 cards and still might not have a complete pair. For instance, we may pick the cards (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) in the worst case. 3. **Determine the minimum number of cards to ensure a pair**: By picking one more card, we ensure that one of the pairs that sum to 11 is completed.

We know: [ text{Number of girls who do not know how to swim} = frac{x}{6} ] [ text{Number of boys who do not know how to swim} = frac{50 - x}{8} ] So, the equation becomes: [ frac{x}{6} + frac{50 - x}{8} = 7 ] 4. **Solve the equation:** Combine the terms on the left-hand side over a common denominator, which is 24: [ frac{4x}{24} + frac{3(50 - x)}{24} = 7 ] Simplify the equation: [ frac{4x + 150 - 3x}{24} = 7 ] [ frac{x + 150}{24} = 7 ] 5. **Isolate ( x ):** Multiply both sides by 24 to clear the denominator: [ x + 150 = 168 ] Subtract 150 from both sides: [ x = 18 ] 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the number of girls in the camp is ( boxed{18} )."},{"prompt":"One of the asymptotes of a hyperbola has equation y=2x.

Because the map vertices have even degrees, we need to establish how to color such a graph properly with two colors. 2. **Traversal to establish the coloring base:** We can start from an arbitrary country, say S_0, and begin a traversal of the graph, numbering each country we visit in the sequence of the traversal. Since all vertices have even degrees, any closed trail in the graph will also cross each vertex an even number of times, leading all visited vertices within a closed trail to get the same parity labels. 3. **Ensure the coloring condition using parity:** - When moving from one vertex S_i to a neighboring vertex S_j, if this move takes one step, the number p+1 associated with S_j will be odd if p is even and even if p is odd. Hence, adjacent vertices S_i and S_j will always have different parities. - Assign one color to even vertices and another color to odd vertices. Clearly, since adjacent vertices always have different parities, coloring even-labeled vertices with one color and odd-labeled vertices with another results in no two adjacent vertices having the same color. 4. **Conclusion:** With each step increment, ensuring adjacent countries adopt different parities (and thus different colors), we establish a properly colored map using only two colors based on parity.

Since angle ACB = 120^circ and CA = CB, the triangle ABC is isosceles with AB as the base.

Concretely, Q divides CP in the ratio 2:1 from C to P. 7. Since P is on Gamma, drawing a perpendicular from P to AB intersects at point N on AB. Therefore, PN perp AB. 8. Noting that M is the midpoint of AB, line CO perp AB through M implies that CO is parallel to the line from P perpendicular to AB. 9. Since triangle ABC is symmetric around M (i.e., MC = MO), and M is the midpoint of AB, we can determine that M also bisects CO. 10.

Let ( a_1 leqslant a_2 leqslant a_3 ). 2. **Construct the Tetrahedron:** Consider a tetrahedron ( ABCD ) with edges given by: [ AB = a_1, quad AC = BC = a_2, quad AD = BD = CD = a_3 ] Such a tetrahedron exists because we can inscribe it in a sphere such that all vertices lie on the sphere's surface. The center ( O ) of the circumscribed circle of any triangle lies inside the triangle. 3. **Analyze the distances:** Note that: [ OA = OB = OC < a_2 leqslant a_3 ] Therefore, placing the tetrahedron such that points ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) remain outside ( M_3 ) and ( A ), ( B ) remain outside ( M_2 ), ensures the proper construction detailed below. 4. **Place points in sets to create a contradiction:** Place vertex ( D ) in any point of ( M_3 ). If ( M_3 ) is empty, ( A, B, C ) automatically do not belong to ( M_3 ). Similarly, place vertex ( C ) in any point of ( M_2 ). If there are no such points at distance ( a_3 ) from ( D ), ( A, B ) automatically do not belong to ( M_2 ). 5. **Locate remaining points:** Consequently, ( A ) and ( B ) must be in ( M_1 ). Therefore: [ AB = a_1 ] This construction shows that ( M_1 ) contains two points ( A ) and ( B ) whose distance is ( a_1 ). This result contradicts the initial supposition that no distance ( a_1 ) is realized within ( M_1 ). 6. **Conclusion:** Since the assumption leads to a contradiction, it is proven that in any partitioning of space into three sets, at least one of those sets will contain two points between which the distance ( a > 0 ) can be realized. Thus, the statement in the problem is confirmed to be true. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Georgia has 25 pieces of stationery while Lorene has three times as many pieces of stationery as Georgia.

The directrix of the parabola intersects the x-axis at point N, and it is known that angle ANB is bisected by the x-axis. Prove that the line segment AB passes through the focus of the parabola. 1. Assume that the equation of the line (l) is (x = my + a) where (m neq 0). 2. By substituting (x = my + a) into the parabola's equation (y^2 = 2px), we get: [ y^2 = 2p(my + a) ] [ y^2 - 2pmy - 2pa = 0 ] 3. Let (A(x_1, y_1)) and (B(x_2, y_2)) be the points where the line intersects the parabola. Solving for (y) from the quadratic equation, since (A) and (B) are roots: [ y_1 y_2 = -2pa ] Given that (A) and (B) are on different limbs, (y_1) and (y_2) have opposite signs, which implies: [ -2pa < 0 implies a > 0 ] 4. From the properties of the quadratic equation, we know: [ x_1 x_2 = frac{(y_1 y_2)^2}{4p^2} = frac{(-2pa)^2}{4p^2} = a^2 ] Therefore: [ sqrt{x_1 x_2} = a ] 5. Draw perpendiculars from points (A) and (B) to the (x)-axis, which intersect (x)-axis at points (A C) and (B D) respectively. Then: [ tan angle ANC = frac{|AC|}{|NC|} = frac{sqrt{2px_1}}{x_1 + frac{p}{2}} quad text{and} quad tan angle BND = frac{|BD|}{|ND|} = frac{sqrt{2px_2}}{x_2 + frac{p}{2}} ] 6. Given that (angle ANB) is bisected by the (x)-axis, it follows that: [ angle ANC = angle BND ] This implies: [ tan angle ANC = tan angle BND ] Therefore: [ frac{sqrt{2px_1}}{x_1 + frac{p}{2}} = frac{sqrt{2px_2}}{x_2 + frac{p}{2}} ] 7. Equate the two fractions: [ left( sqrt{x_1} - sqrt{x_2} right) left( sqrt{x_1 x_2} - frac{p}{2} right) = 0 ] Since (AB) is not perpendicular to the (x)-axis, we have (x_1 neq x_2) which implies (sqrt{x_1} neq sqrt{x_2}). Thus: [ sqrt{x_1 x_2} = frac{p}{2} ] 8. Since (sqrt{x_1 x_2} = a), it follows that: [ a = frac{p}{2} ] 9. Therefore, the equation of the line (l) becomes: [ x = my + frac{p}{2} ] And this line passes through the point (left( frac{p}{2}, 0 right)), which is the focus of the parabola. # Conclusion: The line segment (AB) passes through the focus of the parabola.

According to the problem, when the last three digits (B) are moved to the front of the number, the resulting number should be six times the original number. 3. Let’s write this down in an equation. The original number can be expressed as: [ 1000A + B ] When the last three digits (B) are placed in front, the number becomes: [ 1000B + A ] 4.

Since ((a + c)) and ((b + c)) are both greater than (c) and hence greater than 1, their product divided by (c) produces a natural number which is a composite number (since both factors are greater than 1). Thus, ( frac{(a+c)(b+c)}{c} ) is always a composite number. **Second Method:** 1.

We need to find the first 10 natural numbers that have an odd number of divisors. 2. Notice that a natural number has an odd number of divisors if and only if it is a perfect square. This fact stems from the property that divisors come in pairs; if a number is a perfect square, it has a divisor that repeats itself (the square root), leading to an odd count of divisors. 3.

This is because divisors come in pairs, and the only number that repeats itself as a divisor in such pairs is the square root of a perfect square. 2. **Proof**: - Let ( n ) be a natural number. - If ( n ) is a perfect square, say ( n = k^2 ), then the divisors of ( n ) occur in pairs ( (d, frac{n}{d}) ), where ( d ) is a divisor of ( n ). The exception is the divisor ( k ), which appears only once. Consequently, the total count of divisors is odd. - Conversely, if ( n ) has an odd number of divisors, then pairs of divisors ( (d, frac{n}{d}) ) imply one divisor must repeat twice. This can only happen if ( n ) is a perfect square because ( k^2 = n ) implies ( k ) is a unique divisor appearing twice. - Therefore, ( n ) has an odd number of divisors if and only if it is a perfect square.

Let E and F be the midpoints of the bases, and P and Q be the midpoints of the diagonals. Since P and Q are equidistant from the bases, they lie on the midline of the trapezoid. 2. **Diagonals in a Circumscribed Circle**: The diagonals of a trapezoid are chords of the circumscribed circle, so their perpendicular bisectors pass through the center of the circle, K. Given that P and Q are on the perpendicular bisectors of the diagonals and are equidistant from the bases, the quadrilateral PKQM is a square because all sides PM and QM are equal and the angles are all right angles. 3. **Midpoints and Distances**: Let L be the midpoint of PQ.

We can add these up to find out how many books were sold on those days: Books sold from Monday to Wednesday and Friday = 75 (Monday) + 50 (Tuesday) + 64 (Wednesday) + 135 (Friday) Books sold from Monday to Wednesday and Friday = 324 Now, we can find out how many books were sold on Thursday by subtracting the number of books sold from Monday to Wednesday and Friday from the total books sold: Books sold on Thursday = Total books sold - Books sold from Monday to Wednesday and Friday Books sold on Thursday = 402 - 324 Books sold on Thursday = 78 John sold boxed{78} books on Thursday."},{"prompt":"Jon drinks a bottle of water that is 16 ounces every 4 hours for some hours he is awake.

Since he drinks two of these larger bottles a day: Total fluid from larger bottles per day = 2 * 20 ounces = 40 ounces Next, let's calculate the total amount of fluid Jon drinks from the regular bottles each day. We know that Jon drinks 728 ounces of fluid a week, and we need to subtract the amount he gets from the larger bottles to find out how much he drinks from the regular bottles. Total fluid from larger bottles per week = 40 ounces/day * 7 days/week = 280 ounces/week Total fluid from regular bottles per week = 728 ounces/week - 280 ounces/week = 448 ounces/week Now, let's find out how many regular bottles Jon drinks per week: Number of regular bottles per week = 448 ounces/week / 16 ounces/bottle = 28 bottles/week Since Jon drinks a regular bottle every 4 hours, we can calculate the number of hours he is awake each day based on the number of regular bottles he drinks per day: Number of regular bottles per day = 28 bottles/week / 7 days/week = 4 bottles/day Hours awake per day (based on regular bottles) = 4 bottles/day * 4 hours/bottle = 16 hours/day Therefore, Jon is awake for boxed{16} hours each day."},{"prompt":"The number K is divisible by 7 and its binary representation is given by: K = 10110101010101xyz110 Determine the digits x, y, and z.","completion":"1. **Expand ( K ) Using Place Values**: We start by expressing ( K ) using its binary place values: [ K = 1 cdot 2^{19} + 0 cdot 2^{18} + 1 cdot 2^{17} + 1 cdot 2^{16} + 0 cdot 2^{15} + 1 cdot 2^{14} + 0 cdot 2^{13} + 1 cdot 2^{12} + 0 cdot 2^{11} + 1 cdot 2^{10} + 0 cdot 2^{9} + 1 cdot 2^{8} + x cdot 2^{7} + y cdot 2^{6} + z cdot 2^{5} + 1 cdot 2^{4} + 1 cdot 2^{3} + 0 cdot 2^{2} + 1 cdot 2^{1} + 0 cdot 2^{0} ] 2. **Simplify the Expression**: Simplify the above expression by factoring out powers of 2: [ K = 2^{19} + 2^{17} + 2^{16} + 2^{14} + 2^{12} + 2^{10} + 2^{8} + 2^6 + x cdot 2^5 + y cdot 2^4 + z cdot 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 ] 3. **Use Induction to Show ( 7 mid (2^{3n} - 1) )**: We need to show that ( 7 mid (8^n - 1) ) for ( n geq 1 ) using induction. - **Base Case (( n = 0 ))**: [ 8^0 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 quad text{(True, since ( 7 mid 0 ))} ] - **Inductive Step**: Assume it holds for ( n-1 ), i.e., ( 8^{n-1} - 1 ) is divisible by 7.

Let P, Q, R, and S be the points of tangency on AB, BC, CD, and DA respectively. 2. We can denote the tangents from each vertex using these points of tangency. Specifically, for vertex A, the tangents to the circle are AP and AS; for vertex B, the tangents are BP and BQ; for vertex C, the tangents are CQ and CR; for vertex D, the tangents are DR and DS. 3. According to the properties of tangents from a common external point, we have the following equalities: [ AP = AS, quad BP = BQ, quad CQ = CR, quad DS = DR ] This ensures that (AP + AS) + (BP + BQ) + (CQ + CR) + (DS + DR) = AB + BC + CD + DA. 4.

There are two scenarios in which player B can take the second shot: 1. Player A takes the first shot and misses. 2. Player B takes the first shot and makes it. Given that player A has a shooting percentage of 0.6, the probability of missing is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. Similarly, player B has a shooting percentage of 0.8, so the probability of making the shot is 0.8. Since the player for the first shot is determined by drawing lots, each player has a probability of 0.5 of taking the first shot. Therefore, we can calculate P as follows: P = 0.5 times 0.4 + 0.5 times 0.8 = 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6 Thus, the probability that player B takes the second shot is boxed{0.6}. Part 2: Probability that Player A Takes the i-th Shot Let P_n be the probability that player A takes the n-th shot. The probability that player A takes the (n+1)-th shot can be determined by considering two scenarios: 1. Player A takes the n-th shot and misses. 2. Player B takes the n-th shot and misses. Given the shooting percentages, we can express P_{n+1} as: P_{n+1} = 0.6P_{n} + 0.2(1 - P_{n}) = 0.4P_{n} + 0.2 To find a general formula for P_n, we notice that: P_{n+1} - frac{1}{3} = 0.4(P_{n} - frac{1}{3}) Given that P_1 = 0.5 (since player A has a 0.5 probability of taking the first shot), we find: P_{1} - frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6} This implies that {P_{n} - frac{1}{3}} forms a geometric sequence with the first term frac{1}{6} and common ratio 0.4. Therefore: P_{n} - frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{n-1} Solving for P_{n} gives us: P_{n} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{n-1} Therefore, the probability that player A takes the i-th shot is boxed{P_{i} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{i-1}}. Part 3: Expected Number of Times Player A Shoots in the First n Shots From Part 2, we know that P_{i} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{i-1}. To find the expected number of times player A shoots in the first n shots, denoted as E(Y), we sum up the probabilities for i from 1 to n: E(Y) = sum_{i=1}^{n} P_{i} = frac{1}{6} sum_{i=1}^{n} left(frac{2}{5}right)^{i-1} + frac{n}{3} The sum of a geometric series is given by frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}, where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. Applying this formula, we get: E(Y) = frac{frac{1}{6}[1 - (frac{2}{5})^{n}]}{1 - frac{2}{5}} + frac{n}{3} = frac{5}{18}[1 - (frac{2}{5})^{n}] + frac{n}{3} Therefore, the expected number of times player A shoots in the first n shots is boxed{E(Y) = frac{5}{18}[1 - (frac{2}{5})^{n}] + frac{n}{3}}, for n in mathbb{N}^{*}."},{"prompt":"James was doing some shopping and saw an offer on shoes that give him a second pair of shoes for half off the original price.

This implies 1 - a is also suitable because we can always reverse the cut's weights. 3. **Determine suitable values by using conversion**: Let's prove that sqrt{a} is also a suitable value. We need to show how dividing a unit piece of cheese into parts with weights a : (1-a) can be achieved by subsequent cuts using the ratio sqrt{a} : (1-sqrt{a}). 4. **Perform initial cut**: After the first cut using sqrt{a}, we get one piece of weight sqrt{a}. Cutting this piece in the ratio sqrt{a} : (1-sqrt{a}) will give two new pieces. One of these pieces will have a weight of a. 5. **Remainder weight calculation**: The remaining pieces from the first and second cuts will sum to 1-a.

Due to similarity, we can set up the following proportion: [ frac{DC}{BC} = frac{CM}{DC}. ] 5. Given ( DC = 1 ), we denote ( BC ) by ( x ). The midpoint ( M ) of ( BC ), implies ( CM = frac{1}{2} BC = frac{x}{2} ). 6. Substituting in the proportion gives: [ frac{1}{x} = frac{frac{x}{2}}{1}. ] 7.

Since ( a ) and ( b ) are both greater than 1, we can write ( a = d cdot x ) and ( b = d cdot y ), where ( d = gcd(a, b) ). Therefore, ( a^n = (d cdot x)^n ) and ( b^n = (d cdot y)^n ). Since ( a^n mid b^n ), it follows that ( (d cdot x)^n mid (d cdot y)^n ). This implies ( x^n mid y^n ), and since ( x ) and ( y ) are integers, ( x mid y ). Hence, ( a mid b ). # Case 2: None of the residues ( r_n ) is zero Assume that there exists a positive integer ( N ) such that ( r_n < frac{2^n}{n} ) for all integers ( n geq N ). Let ( m ) be the smallest natural number such that ( m geq N ) and ( m left( frac{a}{2} right)^m > b ). Such a number ( m ) exists because ( m left( frac{a}{2} right)^m ) is strictly increasing and ( b ) is fixed.

Now, consider the property that if ( x mid y ), then ( y = 0 ) or ( |x| leq |y| ). Suppose there exists an integer ( n geq m ) such that ( a^n leq |r_n b - r_{n+1}| ). We have two cases: Case 2.1: ( r_n b > r_{n+1} ) Then: [ a^n leq r_n b - r_{n+1} < r_n b < b cdot frac{2^n}{n} ] But from ( n geq m ), we have: [ b < n left( frac{a}{2} right)^n ] Hence: [ a^n < b cdot frac{2^n}{n} < n left( frac{a}{2} right)^n cdot frac{2^n}{n} = a^n ] This is a contradiction. Case 2.2: ( r_n b < r_{n+1} ) Then: [ a^n leq r_{n+1} - r_n b < r_{n+1} < frac{2^{n+1}}{n+1} = frac{2}{n+1} cdot 2^n leq a^n ] This is also a contradiction.

Show that ( A, T, X ) are collinear.","completion":"Given the problem, we start by noting the geometric relationships involving the incircle and excircle of triangle ( triangle ABC ). 1. **Dilation Argument**: - Consider a dilation centered at ( A ) which maps the incircle of ( triangle ABC ) to the excircle opposite ( A ). Let's denote this dilation as ( mathcal{D} ). 2. **Transformation of Points**: - A key property of dilation is that it scales distances by a fixed ratio and angles remain unchanged. Therefore, the incircle is transformed into a larger (excircle) with the same center configurations. - The point ( D ), where the incircle touches ( BC ), is transformed to a similar point on the excircle, which we denote as ( D' ). 3. **Transformation of Diameter**: - Let ( D ) be the point of tangency of the incircle with ( BC ), and ( T ) be the point diametrically opposite to ( D ) on the incircle. - Under the dilation ( mathcal{D} ), the diameter ( DT ) of the incircle is mapped to a corresponding diameter of the excircircle. Since diameters are scaled lengths along the same line, ( T ) must transform to a point ( T' ) on the excircle such that ( AT' ) passes through a similar configuration as ( ADT' ). 4. **Identification of Points on the Excircle**: - The diameter of the incircle ( DT ), being a line perpendicular to ( BC ), must transform to a diameter of the excircle that is also perpendicular to ( BC ). - The only such significant diameter through the excircle would correspond to ( ADX ), passing through ( X ) (where ( X ) is the contact point of the excircle on ( BC )). 5. **Collinearity Argument**: - Since the line ( AD ) under the dilation ( mathcal{D} ) transforms to another line that runs through ( A ), ( T ) transforming to ( X ) establishes the path of collinearity. - Therefore, the image point ( T' ) must be ( X ), implying that ( A ), ( T ), and ( X ) are collinear. **Conclusion**: By the properties of dilation and the specific geometric configuration given, we infer that the points ( A ), ( T ), and ( X ) are collinear: [ boxed{textrm{A, T, X are collinear.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let [mathbf{B} = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 0 & 0 & 1 1 & 0 & 0 end{pmatrix}.] Compute (mathbf{B}^{150}).","completion":"First, we compute the first few powers of (mathbf{B}): [ mathbf{B}^2 = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 0 & 0 & 1 1 & 0 & 0 end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 0 & 0 & 1 1 & 0 & 0 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 1 & 0 & 0 0 & 1 & 0 end{pmatrix}, ] [ mathbf{B}^3 = mathbf{B} mathbf{B}^2 = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 0 & 0 & 1 1 & 0 & 0 end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 1 & 0 & 0 0 & 1 & 0 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 0 & 1 & 0 0 & 0 & 1 end{pmatrix} = mathbf{I}. ] Since (mathbf{B}^3 = mathbf{I}), every third power of (mathbf{B}) returns to the identity matrix.

[ frac{1}{left(frac{1}{5}right)} = 5 ] 2. **Determine the value of melting down five quarters:** - Given that melting down the gold can get Carlos 100 per ounce, and since (5) quarters make an ounce, melting down (5) quarters would get him (boxed{100}). 3. **Calculate the value of spending five quarters in a store:** - The value of a quarter when spent is 0.25. Therefore, the value of (5) quarters when spent is: [ 5 times 0.25 = 1.25 ] 4. **Compare the value of melting down to spending:** - To find out how many times more money Carlos would get from melting the quarters down instead of spending them, we divide the value from melting by the value from spending: [ frac{100}{1.25} = 80 ] This means Carlos would get (80) times more money by melting the quarters down than by spending them. Therefore, Carlos would get (boxed{80}) times more money from melting the quarters down instead of spending them in a store."},{"prompt":"Given that x+y = 20 and 2x+y = 27, evaluate (x+y)^2.","completion":"1. **Subtract the first equation from the second:** [ 2x + y - (x + y) = 27 - 20 Rightarrow x = 7. ] 2. **Substitute x = 7 into the first equation to find y:** [ x + y = 20 Rightarrow 7 + y = 20 Rightarrow y = 13. ] 3. **Evaluate (x+y)^2:** [ (x+y)^2 = (7 + 13)^2 = 20^2 = 400. ] Therefore, (x+y)^2 = boxed{400}."},{"prompt":"Given a>0, the function f(x) = x^3 ax is monotonically increasing on the interval [1, +infty).

This distance represents half the period of the sine function because symmetric axes occur at every half period. Therefore, we have: [ frac{4π}{3} - frac{5π}{6} = frac{T}{2} ] Simplifying the left side gives us: [ frac{8π}{6} - frac{5π}{6} = frac{π}{2} = frac{T}{2} ] Since the period T of the sine function f(x) = 4sin(ωx+frac{π}{6}) is given by frac{2π}{ω}, we equate frac{π}{2} to frac{2π}{ω}, leading to: [ frac{π}{2} = frac{2π}{ω} implies ω = 2 ] 2. **Determine the Function g(x)**: With ω = 2, the function f(x) becomes f(x) = 4sin(2x+frac{π}{6}). Shifting this graph to the right by frac{π}{6} units, we adjust the argument of the sine function accordingly: [ g(x) = 4sin(2x+frac{π}{6}-frac{π}{6}) = 4sin(2x-frac{π}{6}) ] 3. **Transform the Function to Find Zeros**: To find the zeros of g(x) in the interval (-m,m), we consider a transformed function h(x) = 4sin x and adjust the interval according to the transformation from g(x) to h(x). This gives us: [ x ∈ (-2m-frac{π}{6}, 2m-frac{π}{6}) ] For h(x) to have three distinct zeros within this interval, we analyze the conditions for the zeros of the sine function. 4. **Solve for m**: The sine function h(x) = 4sin x has zeros at integer multiples of π. Therefore, to have three distinct zeros, the interval must span from just before -pi to just after pi.

First, identify that if the statement holds for (d, 2d, cdots, kd) where (k geqslant 3), then it will also hold for any integers (d_1 = s^2 d) (where (s in mathbb{Z}_+)). Thus, we only need to consider positive integers (d) without square factors. 2. Let us test the simplest case where (d = 1) and (k = 15). The following sequence meets the condition: [ 8, 1, 15, 10, 6, 3, 13, 12, 4, 5, 11, 14, 2, 7, 9 ] For this sequence, every sum of two consecutive terms is a perfect square. Therefore, when (d = 1), the condition is satisfied. 3. We now consider the case where (d > 1). In any sequence of the form (d, 2d, cdots, kd), any two consecutive terms sums being divisible by (d) results in a quadratic number ((dq_i)^2): [ (m + n)d = left(dq_iright)^2 ] 4. As (d) has no square factors, any sum of consecutive terms must necessarily be divisible by (d^2). Thus, we look for a sequence of integers (1, 2, cdots, k) that can be arranged such that: [ begin{aligned} a_i + a_{i+1} &= left(d q_i right)^2, quad i = 1, 2, cdots, k-1, a_i &equiv -a_{i+1} pmod{d}. end{aligned} ] Hence, [ a_{2j} equiv a_{2l} equiv -a_{2l+1} equiv -a_{2j+1} mod d quad (l in mathbb{Z}). ] 5. This implies that modulo (d), there are only two unique values in the sequence, which forces (k = 2) (contradicting (k geq 3)) or (d = 2). 6. Considering (d = 2), checking the sequence for any (a_1, a_2, cdots, a_k) results in all numbers having the same parity (either all even or all odd).

The average speed for the entire journey, {v}_{2}, can be calculated using the total distance covered (which is 2s, up and down) divided by the total time taken (time up plus time down). This gives us {v}_{2}=frac{2s}{frac{s}{a}+frac{s}{b}}=frac{2ab}{a+b}. Therefore, option A, which suggests {v}_{2}=frac{ab}{a+b}, is incorrect because our calculation shows {v}_{2}=frac{2ab}{a+b}.

Multiplying both sides by a (which is positive), we get a(frac{2b}{a+b}-1) > 0, which simplifies to frac{2ab}{a+b} > a. Also, since a+b > 2sqrt{ab} (by the AM-GM inequality, since a neq b), we have frac{2ab}{a+b} < sqrt{ab}.

This means that k should be equal to varphi(p^alpha) where varphi is the Euler's totient function. 2. By Euler's theorem, if x is primitive root modulo p, we must have k divides varphi(p^alpha). 3. Recall that varphi(p^alpha) = p^{alpha-1}(p-1). Therefore, we have: [ k | p^{alpha-1}(p-1) ] This result is from basic number theory, particularly problem 31.12 in our reference. 4. Given the problem, it follows clearly that x^k equiv 1 pmod{p}. This implies that k must divide p-1, because the order of x modulo p must divide varphi(p) = p-1. 5.

Let ( A_2 ) be the vertex that is ( k )-vertices clockwise from ( A_1 ), and ( A_3 ) be the vertex that is ( k )-vertices clockwise from ( A_2 ), and so on, continuing in this manner around the polygon. **3.

Demonstrate distinct labeling:** The numbers ( k ) and ( 2k+1 ) are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). Consequently, the terms ( 1, 1 + k, 1 + 2k, ldots, 1 + ik, ldots ) take distinct values modulo ( 2k + 1 ), This ensures all vertices ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) are labeled uniquely and each vertex will appear exactly once among the ( n ) vertices of the polygon. **5.

Each of these isosceles triangles ( triangle A_iA_{i+1}A_{i+2} ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n-2, n-1 ) has angles less than ( frac{pi}{2} ) (90 degrees) since all interior angles of a regular polygon with more than 3 sides are less than 180 degrees distributed evenly.

Using the Pythagorean identity sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1, we can find cos angle BCD: [cos^2 angle BCD = 1 - sin^2 angle BCD = 1 - left(frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}right)^2] 6.

However, we started our sum from a_{3}, so we need to adjust our equation by subtracting a_{2}: [ (a_{3}+a_{5}+cdots +a_{2021}) = a_{2022} - a_{2} ] Given a_{2}=2, we substitute this value: [ (a_{3}+a_{5}+cdots +a_{2021}) = a_{2022} - 2 ] Since a_{2022}=k, we have: [ (a_{3}+a_{5}+cdots +a_{2021}) = k - 2 ] Therefore, the sum a_{3}+a_{5}+cdots +a_{2021}=boxed{k-2}, which corresponds to choice boxed{D}."},{"prompt":"The equation of the line that passes through point B (3, 0) and is perpendicular to the line 2x+y5=0 is ( ) A: 2xy6=0 B: x2y+3=0 C: x+2y3=0 D: x2y3=0","completion":"Let's assume the equation of the line perpendicular to 2x+y-5=0 is: x-2y+c=0, Substituting point (3, 0) into it, we get 3-0+c=0, Solving for c, we find c=3, Therefore, the equation of the line that passes through point B (3, 0) and is perpendicular to the line 2x+y-5=0 is x-2y+3=0.

We can multiply the first equation by 0.60 to help eliminate one of the variables: 0.60(x + y) = 0.60(280) 0.60x + 0.60y = 168 Now we have: 0.60x + 0.60y = 168 0.60x + 0.25y = 140 Subtract the second equation from the first: (0.60x + 0.60y) - (0.60x + 0.25y) = 168 - 140 0.60x + 0.60y - 0.60x - 0.25y = 28 0.35y = 28 Now divide both sides by 0.35 to solve for y: y = 28 / 0.35 y = 80 So, boxed{80} children attended that day."},{"prompt":"the rectangular coordinate system (xOy), the line l: begin{cases} x=t y= sqrt {3}t end{cases}(t is the parameter ), the curve C_{1}: begin{cases} x=cos theta y=1+sin theta end{cases}(theta is the parameter ), and the curve C_{2} has the equation rho=2cos theta+2 sqrt {3}sin theta in the polar coordinate system with the origin O as the pole and the nonnegative semiaxis of x as the polar axis. 1.

How many different arrangements are possible (arrangements that can be obtained by rotating the circle are considered the same)?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** There are 8 girls and 25 boys arranged in a circle. We need to find the number of different arrangements where between any two girls, there are at least two boys. 2. **Fixing a Reference Point:** To simplify the problem, we assume that one of the girls, say ( A ), is fixed at a point. This reduces the problem to arranging the other 7 girls and 25 boys in a line considering ( A ) as the starting point. By doing this, every rotation that results in the same sequence is considered identical. 3. **Ensuring Separation:** To ensure that there are at least two boys between any two girls, we visualize each girl as taking her position along with the two boys right next to her. For example, if we denote girls by ( bigcirc ) and boys by ( times ), we have the constraint that every pair of adjacent ( bigcirc )'s must be separated by at least two ( times )'s. 4. **Forming Groups with Constraints:** We can therefore group each ( bigcirc ) along with the two immediate ( times )'s next to her, excluding ( A ). Let's use ( oplus ) to represent the group ( bigcirc times times ). Thus, we will have: [ underbrace{bigcirc times times}_{oplus} quad underbrace{bigcirc times times}_{oplus} quad cdots quad underbrace{bigcirc times times}_{oplus} ] These groups consume ( 3 times 7 = 21 ) spots because there are 7 ( bigcirc )'s and each ( bigcirc ) has 2 ( times )'s associated with it. 5. **Accounting for Positions:** Including ( A ), the total spaces in the line become ( (8 + 25) = 33 ). Out of these 33 positions, 21 are already taken by these 7 groups (( oplus )). Thus, we have: [ 33 - 21 - 1 = 16 ] Here the extra (-1) is because ( A ) already occupies 1 position, reducing the total available spots. 6. **Distributing the Remaining Boys:** These remaining ( 16 ) positions can be occupied freely by ( 8 - 1 = 7 ) girls. This is a typical combination problem where we need to choose 16 available spots from the total positions to place 7 girls. This can be calculated using the combination formula ( binom{n}{k} ): [ binom{16}{7} ] 7. **Calculating Permutations:** Each of these 7 girls can be permuted among the 7 positions. This can be achieved by ( 7! ) (since one girl ( A ) is fixed). Similarly, the 25 boys who are to be placed in the remaining positions can be permuted among themselves, giving ( 25! ) ways. Therefore, the total permutations become: [ binom{16}{7} times 7! times 25! ] 8. **Evaluating the Expression:** The expression evaluates into a final form: [ C_{16}^{7} times 7! times 25! = frac{16!}{9!7!} times 7! times 25! = frac{16! times 25!}{9!} ] # Conclusion: The total number of distinct seating arrangements is: [ boxed{frac{16! times 25!}{9!}} ]"},{"prompt":"f x + y = 20 and x y = 36 for integers of x and y, what is the value of x?","completion":"To find the value of x, we can add the two equations together: x + y = 20 x - y = 36 ----------- 2x = 56 Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for x: 2x / 2 = 56 / 2 x = 28 So, the value of x is boxed{28} ."},{"prompt":"Compute (3+7)^2+(3^2+7^2+5^2).","completion":"Follow the order of operations and the algebraic identities.

So, the downstream speed is: Downstream speed = Speed of boat in still water + Speed of stream Downstream speed = 15 kmph + 3 kmph Downstream speed = 18 kmph When the man is rowing upstream (against the current), the effective speed of the boat is the difference between the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the stream.

This results in 4 chosen cells per ( 3 times 3 ) square. - Since there are ( frac{n}{3} times frac{n}{3} = left(frac{n}{3}right)^2 ) such squares, the total number of chosen cells is: [ m = 4 times left(frac{n}{3}right)^2 = frac{4n^2}{9} ] - This ensures that each boat, whether horizontal or vertical, will intersect with at least one chosen cell, allowing Bernardo to determine the orientation and position of the boats. 2. **Case ( n equiv 1 mod 3 ):** - Similar to the previous case, divide the board into ( 3 times 3 ) squares, but there will be an extra row and column. - Use the same strategy for the ( 3 times 3 ) squares, and additionally, choose cells in the extra row and column to ensure coverage. - The total number of chosen cells will be: [ m = leftlceil frac{4n}{3} rightrceil + 1 ] 3. **Case ( n equiv 2 mod 3 ):** - Again, divide the board into ( 3 times 3 ) squares, but there will be two extra rows and columns. - Use the same strategy for the ( 3 times 3 ) squares, and additionally, choose cells in the extra rows and columns to ensure coverage. - The total number of chosen cells will be: [ m = leftlceil frac{4n}{3} rightrceil + 2 ] 4. **Minimality Argument:** - Suppose ( m < leftlceil frac{4n}{3} rightrceil ). Divide the board into ( 3 times n ) horizontal stripes. By the pigeonhole principle, there is at least one stripe with at most 3 marked houses on it. - Similarly, for ( n times 3 ) vertical stripes, there is at least one stripe with at most 3 marked houses on it. - Consider the union of these two chosen stripes. It is impossible for Bernardo to distinguish between two vertical boats inside this union and two horizontal boats inside this union with fewer than ( leftlceil frac{4n}{3} rightrceil ) shots. Thus, the minimal value of ( m ) for which Bernardo can guarantee his victory is: [ m = leftlceil frac{4n}{3} rightrceil + c ] where ( c ) is the remainder of ( n mod 3 ). The final answer is ( boxed{ leftlceil frac{4n}{3} rightrceil + c } )."},{"prompt":"Six standard, sixsided dice are rolled once.

And of chicks?","completion":"Let's solve the problem step by step, breaking down each part carefully: Part (a): We need to represent the conditions algebraically. 1. **Space Condition:** - Each chicken requires 4 , text{m}^2. - Each chick requires 2 , text{m}^2. - The total area available is 240 , text{m}^2. Let's denote the number of chickens by ( x ) and the number of chicks by ( y ). The space condition can be expressed as: [ 4x + 2y = 240 ] Simplifying the equation by dividing through by 2: [ 2x + y = 120 ] 2. **Feed Condition:** - Each chicken eats 160 , text{g} of feed per day. - Each chick eats 40 , text{g} of feed per day. - The maximum daily feed allowed is 8 , text{kg}, which is 8000 , text{g}. The feed condition can be expressed as: [ 160x + 40y leq 8000 ] Simplifying the equation by dividing through by 40: [ 4x + y leq 200 ] In summary, the conditions are: [ begin{cases} 2x + y = 120 4x + y leq 200 end{cases} ] Part (b): We need to represent these conditions graphically on the xy-plane. 1. **Graphing the line ( 2x + y = 120 ):** - The x-intercept occurs when ( y = 0 ): [ 2x + 0 = 120 implies x = 60 ] So, the point is ( (60, 0) ). - The y-intercept occurs when ( x = 0 ): [ 2(0) + y = 120 implies y = 120 ] So, the point is ( (0, 120) ). Therefore, the line ( 2x + y = 120 ) passes through (60,0) and (0,120). 2. **Graphing the line ( 4x + y = 200 ):** - The x-intercept occurs when ( y = 0 ): [ 4x + 0 = 200 implies x = 50 ] So, the point is ( (50, 0) ). - The y-intercept occurs when ( x = 0 ): [ 4(0) + y = 200 implies y = 200 ] So, the point is ( (0, 200) ). Therefore, the line ( 4x + y = 200 ) passes through (50,0) and (0,200). The region to the right of this line represents ( 4x + y leq 200 ). Graph these lines on the xy-plane to visualize the feasible region. Part (c): We need to check if the following pairs (20 chickens, 80 chicks) and (30 chickens, 100 chicks) satisfy the conditions. 1. **Checking (20 chickens and 80 chicks):** - Space Condition: [ 2(20) + 80 = 40 + 80 = 120 quad text{(satisfied)} ] - Feed Condition: [ 4(20) + 80 = 80 + 80 = 160 leq 200 quad text{(satisfied)} ] Therefore, the setup of 20 chickens and 80 chicks is feasible. 2. **Checking (30 chickens and 100 chicks):** - Space Condition: [ 2(30) + 100 = 60 + 100 = 160 quad text{(not satisfied)} ] Therefore, the setup of 30 chickens and 100 chicks is not feasible. Part (d): We need to determine the maximum number of chickens and chicks while respecting the space and feed constraints. 1. **Finding the Maximum Number of Chickens:** - Solving the system of equations: [ begin{cases} 2x + y = 120 4x + y leq 200 end{cases} ] - Solve the first equation for ( y ): [ y = 120 - 2x ] - Substitute into the second inequality: [ 4x + (120 - 2x) leq 200 ] [ 4x + 120 - 2x leq 200 ] [ 2x + 120 leq 200 ] [ 2x leq 80 ] [ x leq 40 ] - When ( x = 40 ), substitute back to find ( y ): [ y = 120 - 2(40) = 120 - 80 = 40 ] Therefore, the maximum number of chickens is 40, and the corresponding number of chicks is also 40. 2. **Finding the Maximum Number of Chicks:** - Set ( x = 0 ) (no chickens): [ 2(0) + y = 120 implies y = 120 ] Therefore, the maximum number of chicks is 120, with no chickens. # Conclusion The solutions to the given parts are: 1. Algebraic conditions: [ boxed{begin{cases} 2x + y = 120 4x + y leq 200 end{cases}} ] 2. From the graph, the intersection and boundary regions are visualized as discussed. 3. (20 chickens, 80 chicks): ( boxed{text{Yes}} ) newline (30 chickens, 100 chicks): ( boxed{text{No}} ) 4. Maximum number of chickens with corresponding chicks: [ boxed{40 text{ chickens and } 40 text{ chicks}} ] Maximum number of chicks with no chickens: [ boxed{120 text{ chicks and } 0 text{ chickens}} ]"},{"prompt":"The instantaneous rate of change of the function y=sqrt{x} at x=1 is ( ) A: 2 B: frac{1}{2} C: frac{1}{2} D: 1","completion":"To find the instantaneous rate of change of the function y=sqrt{x} at x=1, we first need to differentiate y with respect to x. Given y=sqrt{x}, we can rewrite it as y=x^{frac{1}{2}}. Differentiating both sides with respect to x, we get: [y' = frac{d}{dx}(x^{frac{1}{2}}) = frac{1}{2}x^{-frac{1}{2}} = frac{1}{2sqrt{x}}.] Now, to find the instantaneous rate of change at x=1, we substitute x=1 into the derivative: [y' = frac{1}{2sqrt{1}} = frac{1}{2}.] Therefore, the instantaneous rate of change of the function y=sqrt{x} at x=1 is boxed{frac{1}{2}}.
