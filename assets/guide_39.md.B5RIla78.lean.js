Mountains loom in the distance, and the ground is littered with jagged rocks. - The planet is in perpetual twilight, with a dim star casting long, creeping shadows.

It’s known as Forma-5, famous for its inhabitants’ love for art and performance!” Gloopy: “Sounds like a place where I can stretch my… talents! Let’s check it out!” - They land on Forma-5 and are greeted by its geometrically shaped inhabitants, beings who can change colors but not their forms. Scene 2: Discovering Gloopy’s Talent - Gloopy and Glitter visit the central plaza, where locals are showcasing their art.

Child-Like Hexagon: “Look, mom! That stranger can change his shape!” - Soon, a small crowd gathers, marveling at Gloopy’s effortless transformations. Word quickly spreads about the incredible shapeshifting visitor. Scene 3: The Invitation - The mayor of Forma-5, a dignified dodecahedron named Dodecy, approaches Gloopy and Glitter with an offer. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your ability is a gift! We’ve never seen such talent. Would you honor us by performing at our Grand Plaza tonight? Your art could inspire our youth and bring joy to our citizens!” Glitter, beaming with pride: “What do you say, Gloopy?” Gloopy: “I’d be thrilled! Let’s make it a night to remember!” Scene 4: Preparing the Performance - Backstage, Glitter helps Gloopy prepare. She applies a bit of her glitter to make his transformations sparkle in the night. Glitter: “With each shape you make, let’s add a burst of sparkle to illuminate your art even further!” Gloopy: “This is going to be spectacular. I can’t wait to share our sparkle with everyone.” Scene 5: The Grand Performance - As night falls, Gloopy takes center stage under the stars. The plaza is filled with thousands of Forma-5’s inhabitants, eagerly waiting in anticipation. Announcer: “Presenting Gloopy, the Shapeshifting Sensation from the faraway world of Gloopiter!” - With each beat of the cosmic melody, Gloopy transforms. He becomes a star, a bird, an intricate flower blooming—all sparkling under Glitter’s magical touch. His performance tells a story of friendship, adventure, and the beauty of being unique. Scene 6: A Standing Ovation - The crowd is mesmerized. As Gloopy finishes with a grand finale—morphing into a replica of Forma-5 itself, surrounded by miniatures of its inhabitants—the audience erupts into a standing ovation. Gloopy’s shapes, combined with Glitter’s effervescence, have created a dazzling spectacle of light and movement. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your performance was more than art. It was a celebration of what makes each of us unique.” Scene 7: Inspiring a Planet - Inspired by Gloopy, the inhabitants of Forma-5 start experimenting with their own forms of artistic expression beyond color changes. They begin to create sculptures and paintings, trying to capture the essence of Gloopy’s shapeshifting within their static forms. Scene 8: A Heartwarming Farewell - As Gloopy and Glitter prepare to leave, they’re showered with gifts and heartfelt goodbyes. Children mimic Gloopy’s shapes; artists share their Gloopy-inspired art. Gloopy, touched: “I never knew my shapeshifting could bring so much happiness. What an unforgettable experience!” Glitter: “You’ve touched their hearts, Gloopy. Let’s keep spreading joy across the stars.” - They board their blob-mobile, leaving behind a planet now bursting with new forms of expression, a testament to the power of sharing one’s talents. Voiceover: “With Forma-5 in their wake, Gloopy and Glitter continue their cosmic journey, leaving a trail of inspiration and creativity. Wherever they go, they remind us that it’s our unique qualities that truly make us shine.” - The stars twinkle a little brighter as the screen fades to black, the shared laughter of Gloopy and Glitter echoing into the vastness of space. Title: \\"The Mysterious Infinite Mall\\" Scene 1: Glitter’s Mysterious Encounter - Gloopy and Glitter had decided to take a break from their intergalactic adventures and explore a bustling space mall for a change of scenery. As Gloopy headed to the bathroom, Glitter, with her sparkly trail in tow, ventured off on her own. - Lost in the maze-like corridors of the mall, Glitter marveled at the variety of shops and alien species bustling about. Suddenly, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight – a tentacled alien with shimmering purple scales muttering to itself. Alien: “Infinite, forever, never ending. This mall is a maze that traps all who enter. Beware, little glow.” - Intrigued by the cryptic words, Glitter approached the tentacled alien cautiously. Glitter: “Excuse me, kind alien. What do you mean this mall is ‘infinite, forever, never ending’?” Alien (with a hiss): “Ah, little glow, those who wander too far may never find their way out. The walls shift, the paths change. Many have been lost within these halls.” - Filled with concern for Gloopy and herself, Glitter knew she had to find a way out of this strange and foreboding mall maze. Scene 2: Gloopy’s Discovery - Meanwhile, Gloopy finished up in the bathroom and went in search of Glitter. However, with the twisting and turning corridors of the mall, he found himself disoriented and unsure of which way to go. - As he meandered through the maze of shops, Gloopy stumbled upon a group of lost alien children, huddled together in confusion. Alien Child: “Help us, friendly blob! We can’t find our parents, and this mall seems to go on forever.” Gloopy: “Don’t worry, little ones. Gloopy is here to help. Let’s stick together and find a way out.” Scene 3: A Uniting Force - Gloopy and the lost alien children set out to navigate the labyrinthine mall together, using Gloopy’s malleable form and the children’s keen eyes to spot familiar landmarks. - Meanwhile, Glitter and the tentacled alien worked together to decipher the shifting patterns of the mall maze, using Glitter’s sparkling trail as a guiding light. - Despite the challenges and the ever-changing layout of the mall, the two groups slowly made progress towards each other, driven by a shared determination to reunite. Scene 4: A Glittering Resolution - Finally, after what seemed like hours of wandering, Gloopy and Glitter caught sight of each other in the distance, their joyful reunion a beacon of hope amidst the confusing corridors of the mall. - With a few clever twists and turns, Gloopy and Glitter managed to lead the lost children back to their relieved parents, reuniting families and bringing a sense of peace to the mall maze. - As they prepared to leave the mall, the tentacled alien approached Gloopy and Glitter, a gleam in its eyes. Alien: “You have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.” - With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. \'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give \'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.\' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms.

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new. Each show brings something different to the lineup, so let’s keep an open mind. Who knows? We might just find a new favorite among these newcomers!

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right! Write a follow up where 1 new bumper is added to the set (normally the comic bumpers feature characters from Squish, TTG and Johnny Test), state which 3 shows this bumper has Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Bumper Update – A New Addition Joins the Mix!” User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:00 AM Hey, fellow cartoon connoisseurs! Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up. Plus, seeing “Gloopy and Glitter” featured tells us they’re betting on the blobby duo. Exciting times ahead!

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup Promo – Reactions?” User1: ToonMasterJay Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:15 AM Just saw the promo for the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! I’m all hyped up for “Pokémon” and “Sonic X”! And did you guys catch “Ultimate Muscle”? I thought that show was gone forever! What are your thoughts on the shows? User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra! Extra!/The Magic Trick/Treasure Hunt/The Forgotten Memory (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:00 Ultimate Muscle: Making The Cut (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:30 Code Lyoko: Guided Missile - 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown: Finding Omi - 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: The Barren Planet of Shadows/Lost in Gloopiter - 10:00 Sonic X: Satellite Swindle (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya: Un-Reality TV (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 11:00 Johnny Test: Johnny To The Centre of the Earth/Phat Johnny - 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man: Why I Hate Gym Forum Thread Title: “The Shift to CW4KIDS.tv - Observing Website Updates & Pokémon Episode Airings” User1: WebWizKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:47 AM Have you all checked out cw4kids.com lately? Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn\'t confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn\'t World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn\'t premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation. And yes, “The Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” hosted by Gloopy aims to celebrate our new chapter in style! Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu\'s Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are! With the CW4Kids rebrand right around the corner, along with some fantastic new series, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best in animation entertainment. The countdown to the big reveal is on, and we hope you’re all ready for the switchover’s grand finale! User6: AnimationHistorian Posted on March 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s been quite the journey from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids, and I think we’re all curious to see how they’ll stick the landing with this rebrand. Shorts like “The Gees” show an appreciation for variety, and I think it’s a testament to the care put into this transition. Soon, it’ll be the dawn of a whole new day for the network, and I, for one, can’t wait! User7: ToonAdventureSeeker Posted on March 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM I’m loving the build-up to the rebrand with these shorts! “The Gees” are such a wild card, and new music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is always welcome.

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history. Meanwhile, let’s celebrate our top-rated shows—they’re shaping the new legacy of CW4Kids. Keep the conversations and your passion for the toons flowing! User6: AnimationAnalyst Posted on May 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM I’m all for the new wave of shows, but it’s nice to see how ‘Code Lyoko’ continues to capture hearts—even amidst all the flashy newcomers. As the rebrand becomes the norm, I wonder if it’ll maintain its place in the top five. But yes, definitely a moment of silence for our pal Johnny.

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Late-Winter Lineup Change Incoming Feb. 17 – New Shows Alert!” User1: ToonTrendWatcher Posted on February 1, 2024, at 8:15 AM Hey fellow CW4Kids enthusiasts! Big news just dropped about the late-winter lineup change happening on February 17th. We’re getting “GoGoRiki,” “Kirby: Right Back At Ya,” and “Ultimate Muscle” making their debuts! 🎉 And here’s a bit you’ll REALLY find interesting, especially if you were a Kids WB regular late last year: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are coming back! Seems like CW4Kids is mixing nostalgia with fresh new content. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMornSage Posted on February 1, 2024, at 8:45 AM Excited for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” and “Ultimate Muscle” – those are some solid classics! As for “GoGoRiki,” I’m intrigued. But the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”?! That’s unexpected yet pleasantly surprising. It’s great to see CW4Kids bringing back a show that had a rather abrupt ending on Kids WB. Shows there’s a commitment to reviving beloved series alongside introducing new ones. User3: RetroToonRetro Posted on February 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back is a major win for fans of the original run. “GoGoRiki” sounds like it could add some quirky humor to the mix. And “Ultimate Muscle” brings back so many childhood memories of wrestling madness! CW4Kids is really upping its game with this lineup. User4: NewEraNick Posted on February 1, 2024, at 10:00 AM I’m pumped for the new additions, but “Gloopy and Glitter’s” return has me the most excited. It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids not just wiping the slate clean but also honoring some of what made Kids WB special in its final days. Balancing nostalgia with new content could be the key to keeping both old fans and enticing new ones. User5: DigitalDawn Posted on February 1, 2024, at 11:15 AM Honestly, it’s smart of CW4Kids to sprinkle in some modern-nostalgia with “Gloopy and Glitter.” Brings a sense of continuity. “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” are classics that deserve more love, and “GoGoRiki” could be the dark horse that surprises us all. This lineup feels like a rebirth while tipping its hat to its roots. Can’t wait! Moderator: CW4KidsCaretaker Posted on February 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for our upcoming late-winter lineup and the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”!

With CW4Kids transitioning full throttle into a new era, we bid farewell to the iconic shorts “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” These shorts have entertained countless viewers with their unique humor and quirky characters, becoming staples of Saturday morning routines.

This educational and entertaining short provides insights into the characters of “GoGoRiki,” blending knowledge with humor in a format that is both engaging and enlightening.

Also, here\'s the Kids WB ratings from early December Final K6-11 Ratings for Saturday, December 2, 2023 Broadcast Networks only (Live + SD Data): CW (Kids\' WB!) (7a-12p) Squish 0.7, Teen Titans Go 1.6, Xiaolin Showdown 1.0, Ultimate Spider-Man 0.9, Code Lyoko 2.0, Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated 1.2, Batman: The Brave and the Bold 1.6, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 1.2, Johnny Test 1.8, The Hollow 0.9 Forum Thread Title: “From Kids’ WB to CW4Kids – A Ratings Comparison” User1: ToonDataDiver Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:15 AM I’ve been tracking the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids closely, particularly in terms of ratings. Interestingly, some shows remain strong, like “Johnny Test” (still with us until April) showing consistent appeal. Here’s a quick comparison with early March data after the transition: CW4Kids (March 2, 2024) (Live + SD Data): - Pokémon: Indigo League: 1.9 - GoGoRiki: 1.4 - Ultimate Muscle: 1.3 - Code Lyoko: 2.3 - Xiaolin Showdown: 1.2 - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: 1.8 - Sonic X: 2.0 - Kirby: Right Back At Ya!: 1.5 - Johnny Test: 1.7 - Ultimate Spider-Man: 1.1 User2: RetroToonNostalgia Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:45 AM Fascinating to see how the ratings have evolved! Looks like “Code Lyoko” is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And “Sonic X” stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame “Johnny Test” is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM I’m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. “Code Lyoko’s” jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It’s bittersweet, though, regarding “Johnny Test” - it’s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal. User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM The transition strategy from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like “Pokémon: Indigo League” gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” is filling in the comedic gap left by “Johnny Test” pretty well, judging by their ratings. User5: TooniverseTrekker Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s intriguing to contrast these ratings. “Johnny Test” has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It’s a shame we’re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially “Code Lyoko” and newcomers like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X,” suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons. User6: ModernToonMaster Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM True, the increase in ratings for “Code Lyoko” and the successful introduction of refreshes like “Pokémon: Indigo League” speak volumes. While it’s a fond farewell to “Johnny Test,” the data hints at CW4Kids’ potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids’ WB enjoyed. Here’s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving. Moderator: CW4KidsForumMod Posted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM Appreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It’s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we’re indeed saying goodbye to “Johnny Test,” the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Final Days & The CW4Kids Transition: What to Expect” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM So, looks like the Jan 6 schedule for our beloved Kids’ WB isn’t changing at all from what we have now. Seems a bit too quiet for a transition, don’t you think? However, don’t be fooled folks! Word on the street is “GoGoRiki” will make its grand entrance in just a few weeks under the new CW4Kids banner. Any thoughts? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:30 AM Yeah, I was a bit surprised to see the Jan 6 schedule looking so…familiar. But knowing that “GoGoRiki” is on the horizon has me intrigued. It feels like CW4Kids is giving us a soft start before they fully unveil what’s really coming. It’s interesting to see how they’re balancing the old with the new during this transition. User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM I noticed that too! Keeping the schedule unchanged for Jan 6 seems to be a strategic move to ease us into the transition phase. “GoGoRiki” feels like it’ll be the first big test of whether CW4Kids can carry on the Saturday morning tradition we all love. Can’t wait to see how it plays out! User4: AnimationInsider Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 AM This gradual shift strategy is interesting. By not shaking up the Jan 6 schedule too much, they’re likely trying to not rock the boat for viewers who are still adjusting to the CW4Kids idea. But really, I’m looking forward to seeing what “GoGoRiki” brings to the table. It’s going to set the tone for what’s to come under CW4Kids. User5: ModernToonMaster Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 AM I get why they’re doing it, but part of me wishes they’d just rip off the band-aid and bring in the new lineup immediately. That said, introducing “GoGoRiki” is a smart move to start off with, considering its appeal. I’m curious how they’ll balance new shows with the legacy of Kids’ WB. User6: CuriousCartoonist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:30 AM Quick question for @CW4KidsForumMod - With this soft transition and Warner still seemingly having some control for now, are you currently operating under Warner or 4Kids? And when can we expect to see this handover of control reflected in the programming and overall direction of CW4Kids? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 12:00 PM Great question, @CuriousCartoonist. For the moment, Warner Bros is indeed overseeing the transitional period of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids alongside 4Kids Entertainment. This partnership ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday mornings special for our audience. Rest assured, as we move deeper into 2024, you’ll start to see more of 4Kids’ influence in the programming, ushering in new and exciting changes. And yes, “GoGoRiki” is just the beginning! Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience during this exciting time. Write a follow up on January 9 where users are speculating on when GoGoRiki will premiere, and what show it will replace on the lineup, Also by the end of this thread, the Jan 27 schedule is revealed, with Pokemon and Sonic X replacing Squish and Adrenalini, No GoGoRiki yet, but it’s definitely coming on Feb 17, when 4Kids start programming the block, but the presentation (idents, promos) will remain the same till after Easter Forum Thread Title: “GoGoRiki Premiere Speculations & CW4Kids Programming Changes” User1: ToonWatcher101 Posted on January 9, 2024, at 8:57 AM Hey gang! With the buzz around “GoGoRiki” joining CW4Kids, any guesses on when it’ll premiere and which show it might end up replacing? Given the transition, it’s hard to pin down exactly when and what changes will come. Thoughts? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on January 9, 2024, at 9:34 AM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” swooping in sometime mid-February. As for which show it’ll replace, my money’s on something less popular or maybe a show that’s already seen its completion. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” or “Squish” might be on the chopping block. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 9, 2024, at 10:15 AM There’s chatter that “GoGoRiki” will premiere February 17, right when 4Kids begins programming the block. Makes sense for a smooth transition, introducing a fresh face while maintaining the current essence of the lineup. Plus, I heard “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are joining soon, which is super exciting! User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on January 9, 2024, at 11:05 AM Just saw the announcement for the January 27 schedule! “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are replacing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” No sign of “GoGoRiki” yet, but February 17 looks like a solid bet for its debut. Seems like 4Kids is keen on keeping things interesting! User5: AnimationAdmirer Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:00 PM Fascinating developments! “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are classics, and their addition could hint at the direction CW4Kids is headed under 4Kids’ influence. “GoGoRiki” not premiering until February 17 suggests 4Kids is slowly molding the block with its signature. I’m here for it! User6: RetroToonRanger Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:45 PM A little sad to see “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” go, but the inclusion of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” on January 27 is a welcome surprise! As for “GoGoRiki,” waiting until February 17 seems strategic, allowing viewers to adjust. Eager to see how this shapes the CW4Kids landscape. User7: DigitalCartoonist Posted on January 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM Speculating about “GoGoRiki” has been quite the pastime! Mid-February gives CW4Kids a moment to breathe and integrate “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” seamlessly. Really optimistic about the direction we’re heading. Plus, keeping presentations consistent post-Easter shows they’re prioritizing a smooth viewer transition. Smart move! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 9, 2024, at 2:00 PM Appreciate all the speculation and feedback, folks! The decision to bring in “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” on January 27, then debut “GoGoRiki” on February 17, is part of our broader strategy to gradually introduce changes and new content, ensuring the audience gets the best of both worlds—nostalgia and novelty. Rest assured, presentations such as idents and promos will retain their familiar feel until after Easter to help ease the transition. Stay tuned, and thanks for your engagement and excitement during this transformative period for CW4Kids!

It was a nostalgic trip seeing all the current shows celebrated one last time under the Kids’ WB banner. But that ending – they gave us a peek at a new show! Looked exciting but they only teased “Coming Soon” under CW4Kids. Any guesses on what it could be? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:25 PM Caught it! That teaser at the end has my mind racing. Could be the rumored “GoGoRiki” finally making its debut? The clip was too brief to make out much, but the excitement is real. It’s a clever way to keep us hooked for the CW4Kids rebrand. User3: NostalgiaNerd Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:40 PM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” too, given the chatter. But leaving us with just a “Coming Soon” cliffhanger? Classic move to keep us on our toes. The transition feels like the end of an era, yet that teaser has me hopeful for what CW4Kids is cooking up. User4: SaturdaySleuth Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:05 PM That final promo was a mixed bag of emotions – a goodbye paired with a hint of new beginnings. Agree on the “GoGoRiki” speculation; it fits with what’s been floating around. Either way, CW4Kids is setting the stage for some fresh content while paying homage to Kids’ WB’s legacy. User5: ToonTimeTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 PM It really hit me when they said, “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name.” But that sneak peek at the end? Genius way to transition. Whether it’s “GoGoRiki” or something else, CW4Kids seems committed to keeping us entertained and intrigued. User6: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:45 PM Absolutely loved the promo and how they’re handling the transition – respectful yet forward-looking. The teaser has definitely piqued my curiosity. Hoping “GoGoRiki” delivers and becomes a worthy successor to the Kids’ WB lineup we’ve grown to love.

Is it Warner Bros, still overseeing some parts of CW4Kids during this transitional period, or are you directly with 4Kids Entertainment now? The blend of old and new has been fascinating, and I’m just trying to understand from whose perspective we’re seeing these exciting updates! 🙂 CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 2, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hi @DetectiveToon, great question! I’m here representing 4Kids Entertainment. While we’re currently in the midst of this transitional period and working closely with Warner Bros to ensure a smooth handover for CW4Kids, my role is to directly engage with and update our amazing community on behalf of 4Kids Entertainment. We’re committed to maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday morning cartoons special while infusing the lineup with fresh and exciting content. Thanks for your keen interest, and don’t hesitate to reach out with more questions! Forum Thread Title: “The Fate of ‘Squish’ on CW4Kids – Any Hope for a Comeback?” User1: SquishSuperFan Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:05 AM Hey everyone, I’ve been holding onto hope that we might see ‘Squish’ make a grand return to CW4Kids. It had such a unique charm and humor that set it apart. With all the new shows and changes happening, has anyone heard anything about ‘Squish’ coming back? User2: ToonTrackerTina Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:30 AM I totally get where you’re coming from, @SquishSuperFan. ‘Squish’ was a refreshing show, but from what I’ve gathered, there are no plans to bring it back to CW4Kids. The lineup seems pretty set, especially with the new shows they’ve introduced and the direction the network is heading in. It looks like ‘Squish’ won’t fit into their current or future programming slate, unfortunately. User3: AnimationAdmirer Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing. ‘Squish’ offered something different that you don’t see in every cartoon. But CW4Kids seems to be focusing on a specific vibe with their current lineup, leaning more towards action-packed and adventure-driven content with shows like ‘Pokemon Horizons’ and ‘TMNT: Back to the Sewers’. It’s likely ‘Squish’ doesn’t align with their new thematic focus. User4: RetroToonLover Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:45 AM I was holding out hope too, but it makes sense with the direction CW4Kids is taking. The network is probably looking to establish a strong identity post-transition, and unfortunately, ‘Squish’ might not fit into that vision. It’s a shame though; diversity in content is always refreshing. User5: NewEraNick Posted on July 15, 2024, at 11:30 AM While I understand the disappointment, CW4Kids’ lineup has been pretty solid, even without ‘Squish’. They’ve done a good job balancing nostalgia with introducing new and engaging content. Maybe it’s time for us to discover our next favorite show among their offerings? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hey, @SquishSuperFan and everyone else feeling the ‘Squish’ blues! We appreciate your passion for the show and understand your disappointment. Our goal at CW4Kids is to create a diverse and dynamic viewing experience that resonates with our audience’s evolving tastes. While there are no current plans to bring back ‘Squish’, we’re always evaluating our lineup to ensure it delivers the best in animated entertainment. Thank you for your understanding and continued support as we navigate this exciting chapter for CW4Kids! Write a reply from the mod suggesting some alternatives, and saying while the show won’t return anytime soon, here’s some other great stuff CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:30 PM Hey @SquishSuperFan and all our dedicated viewers, I totally hear you on missing ‘Squish’ and the unique flavor it brought to our lineup. While it’s true that ‘Squish’ won’t be returning anytime soon, we’re committed to ensuring our lineup remains filled with shows that capture the imagination, humor, and adventure you loved in ‘Squish’. For those of you looking for something a bit different yet equally captivating, I’d highly recommend giving “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a shot. It’s filled with whimsical stories and vibrant characters that bring a similar charm and creativity to the table. Another show that’s been a hit among our audience is “GoGoRiki.” Its quirky humor and engaging plots offer something for everyone, blending comedy, friendship, and life lessons in a unique way that has resonated with many of our viewers. And, for those who enjoy exploring new worlds and embarking on exciting quests, “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” has been making waves. It introduces fresh adventures and characters that continue to expand the beloved Pokemon universe. We understand that while these alternatives may not replace ‘Squish’, they represent the diverse and entertaining content CW4Kids strives to deliver. Our goal is to fill your Saturday mornings with stories that make you laugh, think, and dream. Thank you again for your understanding, enthusiasm, and support. CW4Kids is here to bring you the very best in animation, and we’re excited to have you with us on this journey!

It was a touching send-off, acknowledging the show’s end on the network. They also suggested four alternatives to fill the Johnny-shaped hole in our hearts. The whole ad had that new CW4Kids tech-themed presentation style, really driving home the transition. Did anyone else catch this? User2: ToonAdventurer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM I saw it too! Really felt the end of an era vibe with that “The lab is now closing” message. The alternatives suggested were “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic,” right? Styled in that sleek, new CW4Kids presentation, it somehow made the farewell a little less bittersweet. I’ll miss “Johnny Test,” but it’s a good nudge to explore the new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:45 PM Certainly a creative way to say goodbye to “Johnny Test” and transition fans to other shows. The CW4Kids presentational style they used was spot on—futuristic and vibrant, fitting the channel’s new direction perfectly. I’ve been a fan of “Johnny Test” for years, but the alternatives they suggested sound promising. Might give “GoGoRiki” a shot next Saturday! User4: NewEraToonGoer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:00 PM It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids handling the transition with such care. “Johnny Test” has been a staple, but the ad’s tech-themed presentation style made the alternatives seem appealing. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” caught my eye; it has that quirky charm “Johnny Test” fans might enjoy. Good on CW4Kids for guiding viewers towards new favorites. User5: DigitalCartoonDiva Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM That “The lab is now closing” ad had me feeling all sorts of emotions. But the way they presented the alternatives, all snazzy and tech-styled, showcased CW4Kids’ commitment to its new era. “Viva Pinata” and “Chaotic” seem like they’ll fill the action-comedy void left by “Johnny Test.” Excited to see what these shows have to offer! User6: RetroToonLover Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:30 PM The farewell ad for “Johnny Test” was a classy move by CW4Kids. Using their new presentation style to introduce alternatives shows they’re serious about keeping viewers hooked with engaging content. “Johnny Test” will be missed, but the network’s new lineup seems ready to take up the mantle. Here’s to new adventures! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:45 PM It’s heartwarming to see the community come together to bid farewell to “Johnny Test.” The “lab is now closing” ad was our way of softly transitioning fans towards our exciting new lineup, rendered in our fresh presentational style. We’re eager for you to dive into the adventures that “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic” have in store.

Gloopy did a fantastic job hosting, giving us insights and laughter throughout. I loved how they acknowledged the journey since “just after Christmas,” making it clear they value the past few months of transition. What did everyone think of the sneak peeks and the overall direction CW4Kids is taking? User2: DigitalDawn Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:15 PM The preview show was nothing short of spectacular! The acknowledgment of the transition period really hit home, showing they care about the seamless shift from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids. Every sneak peek, especially “Pokemon Horizons” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds,” has me hyped for April 13th. Gloopy mentioning the network’s journey since Christmas warmed my heart - a nod to the fans who’ve been here through it all. User3: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:30 PM I appreciated the nod to the transition period—it felt respectful. Gloopy hosting was a stroke of genius; it brought a familiar face to the forefront, bridging old and new. The previews for “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” and “Chaotic” looked promising. CW4Kids seems dedicated to leveraging both nostalgia and innovation, which is exciting! User4: RetroRewind Posted on April 12, 2024, at 8:45 PM The whole event was a classy way to introduce us to the future of CW4Kids. It’s like they’re carefully curating this blend of past favorites and new adventures for us. I was particularly impressed with the sneak peek of “Sonic X” starting from Episode 1 - smart move to draw in a wider audience. Acknowledging the transition gave a sense of continuity and respect for the audience’s journey. User5: AnimationAficionado Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:00 PM There was something very comforting about tonight’s show. Recognizing the time “just after Christmas” until now as a significant period of CW4Kids’ evolution shows they’re thoughtful about this rebranding process. The mix of upcoming shows has me convinced CW4Kids is setting a new standard for Saturday morning lineups. Can’t wait to see where they take us next! User6: NewEraNick Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:15 PM Truly an energizing preview event! Gloopy mentioning the network’s journey “just after Christmas” subtly reassured us that while we’re moving forward, the past months were just as valuable in shaping what CW4Kids is about to become. The diverse range of shows previewed tonight paints a bright future ahead. Excitement is an understatement! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 12, 2024, at 9:30 PM Thrilled to see all the positive feedback from tonight’s Spring Preview Extravaganza! Our aim was to celebrate both the journey we’ve embarked on since “just after Christmas” and the exciting path ahead.

I’ve always enjoyed the quirky adventures and the unique storytelling of the show, but I guess it’s time for something new. Does anyone have the inside scoop on what’s coming next? Hoping for something just as engaging! User2: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 15, 2024, at 10:30 AM Sad to see “Tomodachi Life” go, but I’m curious about what’s replacing it. 4Kids TV has always had a knack for bringing in interesting and diverse content. Maybe we’ll get something fresh that aligns with the innovative direction they’ve been heading in lately, similar to the excitement brewing over at CW4Kids. User3: RetroGamerGeek Posted on April 15, 2024, at 11:00 AM I heard rumors they might be introducing a new game-based animated series. “Tomodachi Life” had its charm with the video game tie-in, so maybe they’re continuing that trend. Whatever it is, hoping it captures the imagination and fun “Tomodachi Life” brought to the table. User4: AnimationEnthusiast Posted on April 15, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s bittersweet for sure. “Tomodachi Life” was a unique blend of humor and video game culture. But considering the evolving landscape of children’s programming, I’m optimistic about the new addition. The folks at 4Kids TV have always surprised us with captivating shows. Fingers crossed for another hit! User5: ToonBingeWatcher Posted on April 15, 2024, at 12:15 PM Change is always a mix of excitement and nostalgia. “Tomodachi Life” was a go-to for laid-back entertainment.

It’s such a small detail but adds so much depth to their characters. The animation team did an impressive job, making their movements feel so fluid and lifelike. It’s these little nuances that really elevate the show for me! User2: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 20, 2024, at 2:25 PM Absolutely, @SlimeFanatic!

Im Kontext des Nationalsozialismus in Deutschland beschreibt der Begriff die komplexe und konkurrierende Machtstruktur innerhalb der NS-Herrschaft. Verschiedene Organisationen und Behörden wie die SS, die Gestapo, die reguläre Armee (Wehrmacht), parteistaatliche Institutionen und persönliche Stäbe von Nazi-Führern hatten oft überlappende Zuständigkeiten und Kompetenzen. Diese Überschneidungen führten zu Machtkämpfen, ineffizienter Verwaltung und einer Art von Chaos in der Führung, das paradoxerweise die Machtbasis von Adolf Hitler stärkte, da er oft als Schlichter zwischen rivalisierenden Gruppen auftrat. \\"Satrapie\\" ist ein Begriff, der ursprünglich aus der persischen Verwaltungsordnung stammt und eine Provinz oder Region bezeichnet, die von einem Satrapen regiert wird, einem Gouverneur oder Protektor. Der Begriff wird im Kontext des Nationalsozialismus selten direkt angewandt, könnte aber metaphorisch verwendet werden, um auf die Herrschaftsweise eines besetzten Gebietes oder einer abhängigen Administration unter dem Nazi-Regime hinzuweisen, das heißt, eine Region, die von einem Nazi-Beamten oder einem Kollaborateur als quasi-autonome Einheit unter den übergeordneten Zielen und Richtlinien der NS-Ideologie verwaltet wird. Diese Verwendung ist jedoch nicht standardmäßig und könnte je nach Kontext variieren. Zusammengefasst beschreibt \\"Polykratie\\" die fragmentierte und konkurrierende Governance-Struktur innerhalb des NS-Regimes, während \\"Satrapie\\", obwohl historisch nicht direkt mit dem Nationalsozialismus verbunden, theoretisch verwendet werden könnte, um die Art der Herrschaft über besetzte oder dominierte Regionen während der NS-Zeit zu beschreiben, wobei der Begriff angepasst und metaphorisch angewandt wird."},{"prompt":"I’m working on a manga and I’d like to tell you about the setting and main character.","completion":"That sounds exciting! I\'d love to hear more about your manga\'s setting and main character. What’s the backdrop of your story, and who\'s leading the adventure?"},{"prompt":"So, the setting takes place in 1998 in New York. It takes place between August and September. It\'s inspired by Drive (2011) and Gone in 60 Seconds. There is a part where our main character ends up working for the police because of a crime, reckless driving and possible drug trafficking.","completion":"Your setting and theme have a gritty, intense feel that immediately grabs attention. The late \'90s New York backdrop adds a distinctive flavor, reflecting an era just before the digital age took full swing, which could lend itself to unique narrative elements, especially in the context of crime and undercover operations. The inspirations from \\"Drive\\" (2011) and \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" suggest a thrilling mix of high-speed chases, stylish action, and perhaps a complex moral landscape where lines between right and wrong are blurred. Your main character seems to be in a compellingly precarious position, working for the police to mitigate or pay for their crimes, which sets up a rich ground for character development. Such a scenario could explore themes of redemption, identity, and morality. I\'m curious about a few things that could further define your story and its direction: 1. **Character Depth**: What drives your main character? Are they seeking redemption, or is their cooperation with the police purely self-serving? Exploring their motivations could add layers to your narrative. 2. **The Moral Compass**: With inspirations like \\"Drive\\" and \\"Gone in 60 Seconds,\\" your story likely navigates through areas with moral ambiguity. How does your main character’s moral compass shift throughout the story, especially as they delve deeper into their undercover role? 3. **Authenticity and Research**: Given the specific time and setting, how are you ensuring the portrayal of 1998 New York, along with its criminal underworld, is authentic? Research into the era, including the technology, slang, and law enforcement techniques of the time, could enrich the story\'s immersive experience. 4. **Secondary Characters**: Who populates the world around your main character? Allies, antagonists, and neutral parties can all significantly impact your protagonist’s journey and growth. Their relationships and conflicts could be pivotal plot elements. 5. **Visual Style**: Since manga often relies heavily on visual storytelling, have you thought about how the styles of your inspirations might translate into your artwork? The way you depict high-speed chases, the grimy cityscape of late \'90s New York, and the intense moments of confrontation could compellingly convey the mood and theme of your story. Opening up your manga with such a dynamic setting and premise sets the stage for an engaging and potentially emotionally resonant story. Your main character’s journey, straddling the line between criminality and law enforcement, could captivate readers, especially if their path is fraught with danger, dilemmas, and the chance for transformation. How does your character evolve in this environment, and what kind of impact does their journey have on the city that never sleeps?"},{"prompt":"ПЕРЕФРАЗИРУЙ СОХРАНЯЯ СМЫСЛ И НАУЧНО-ПУБЛИЦИСТИЧЕСКИЙ СТИЛЬ ТЕКСТА:Теория памяти, которая легла в основу первых классических экспериментальных исследований Г. Эббингауза и его продолжателей (Г.Э. Мюллера, А. Пильцекера, Ф. Шумана и др.), была целиком построена на учении об ассоциациях. Существенным в этой теории является то, что факт внешней смежности впечатлений сам по себе признается достаточным для установления связи между представлениями и для их воспроизведения. Исходя из этого, Эббингауз и построил все свое исследование. Он пользовался рядами бессмысленных слогов, состоящих из трех букв (одной гласной, расположенной между двумя согласными, например туг-фал-дор-сэт), с выключением всех тех комбинаций, которые давали какое-либо осмысленное слово. В подборе такого материала Эббингауз руководился стремлением получить однородный материал и создать единообразные условия для различных испытуемых. Отсутствие осмысленного содержания в заучиваемом материале и смысловых связей в нем было для Эббингауза несущественно, потому что для него процесс воспроизведения определялся фактом создающей ассоциативные связи внешней смежности заучиваемого материала.","completion":"Теоретический фундамент для первоначальных классических экспериментов по изучению памяти, осуществленных Г. Эббингаузом и его последователями, такими как Г.Э. Мюллер, А. Пильцекер, Ф. Шуман и другие, был положен на принципах ассоциативного обучения. Ключевым аспектом данной теории было утверждение, что сама по себе внешняя последовательность впечатлений может служить надежной основой для формирования и воспроизведения связей между различными психическими представлениями. Опираясь на этот принцип, Эббингауз разработал методологию своего исследования, используя в качестве материала ряды бессмысленных слогов. Эти слоги были составлены из трех букв, включая одну гласную, зажатую между двумя согласными (примеры таких слогов: туг-фал-дор-сэт), при этом исключались любые комбинации букв, которые могли сложиться в осмысленные слова. Эббингауз стремился использовать гомогенный материал и обеспечить одинаковые условия для всех участников эксперимента. При этом, для него не имело значения, что заучиваемый материал не несет в себе смыслового содержания и не обладает смысловыми ассоциациями, так как фокусировался он на ассоциативных связях, формируемых благодаря внешней последовательности материала."},{"prompt":".Об этой классической теории, которая попыталась свести память к одним лишь ассоциативным связям, приходится сказать следующее: ассоциативные связи играют, несомненно, значительную роль, особенно в элементарных формах памяти; однако работа памяти в целом, особенно высшие формы памяти у человека, несводимы к одним лишь ассоциациям и не могут быть без остаточно объяснены ассоциативной теорией. Помимо ассоциативных связей по смежности, в работе человеческой памяти, в процессах запоминания, припоминания, воспроизведения существенную роль играют смысловые связи. Память человека носит осмысленный характер. Данные экспериментального исследования отчетливо вскрывают значение смысловых связей для процесса запоминания. Сравнение результатов заучивания бессмысленных слогов и осмысленных слов, затем отдельных осмысленных слов и слов, объединенных в осмысленные предложения связного текста, показало, что работа памяти находится в прямой зависимости от наличия смысловых связей, объединяющих запоминаемый материал в более или менее обширные смысловые целые. По данным ряда исследователей, количество объединенных во фразу слов, которые запоминают испытуемые, в несколько раз превосходит количество запоминаемых ими - при прочих равных условиях - бессвязных слов.","completion":"Относительно этой классической теории, стремящейся объяснить память исключительно через ассоциативные связи, необходимо подчеркнуть: хотя ассоциативное связывание играет важную роль, особенно в простейших формах памяти, общая функциональность памяти, в том числе и ее более сложные формы у человека, не может быть полностью сведена к ассоциациям. Ассоциативная теория не способна полностью объяснить механизмы памяти. В дополнение к ассоциативным связям, важнейшую роль в механизмах человеческой памяти, включая запоминание, вспоминание и воспроизведение, играют смысловые связи. Память человека опирается на осмысленность информации. Экспериментальные исследования ясно демонстрируют важность смысловых связей для процесса запоминания. Сравнение эффективности запоминания бессмысленных слогов и смысловых слов, а также индивидуальных слов и слов, объединенных в осмысленные предложения или текст, выявило, что эффективность памяти напрямую зависит от смысловых связей, связывающих материал в целостные смысловые структуры. Исследования показали, что способность к запоминанию слов, объединенных в предложения, значительно превышает способность запоминать отдельные слова при прочих равных условиях, указывая на значимость смыслового контекста."},{"prompt":"Зависимость воспроизведения от смыслового содержания была выявлена в работе А.Г. Комм особым экспериментальным приемом, заключавшимся в том, что испытуемым предлагалось воспроизвести один и тот же материал по разному плану. Оказалось, что с изменением интерпретации и общего плана рассказа изменяется подбор и воспроизводимых деталей: при одном плане и одной интерпретации воспроизводятся и выпадают одни части, при другом плане и другой интерпретации - другие части. Другой момент, обнаружившийся в тех же опытах, заключается в том, что при воспроизведении осмысленных текстов слова текста (особенно непривычные) и грамматические конструкции, особенно сложные, заменяются при воспроизведении другими, более легкими и привычными, но так, что смысл при этом сохраняется. А. Бине и К. Бюлер делают из этого тот вывод, что запоминаются не столько сами слова и предложения, сколько те мысли, которые ими обозначаются. Из этого вытекает, что хотя запоминание мыслей совершается в речевой форме, однако нельзя сводить смысловую память (запоминание мыслей) к речевой памяти. Но, выдвигая это само по себе правильное положение, Бине и Бюлер в соответствии с общими тенденциями своего учения о «чистой» мысли вовсе разрывают и внешне противопоставляют друг другу запоминание мыслей и запоминание слов, т. е. мышление и речь в процессе запоминания.","completion":"А.Г. Комм выявил зависимость воспроизведения информации от ее смыслового содержания с помощью уникального экспериментального метода, который предусматривал воспроизведение одного и того же текста испытуемыми под различными углами зрения и интерпретациями. Эксперименты показали, что изменение контекста и интерпретации материала влечет за собой изменение в подборе и воспроизведении деталей: определенные аспекты информации могут быть воспроизведены или опущены в зависимости от принятой схемы интерпретации. Дополнительно, в этих же экспериментах обнаружилось, что при попытке воспроизвести осмысленные тексты, слова (особенно те, которые являются непривычными для испытуемого) и сложные грамматические конструкции часто заменяются на более простые и знакомые формулировки без потери первоначального смысла. А. Бине и К. Бюлер сделали из этого вывод, что в процессе запоминания фиксируются не столько конкретные слова и предложения, сколько основные мысли, которые они передают. Это указывает на то, что механизм запоминания мыслей, хоть и осуществляется посредством языка, не должен рассматриваться как идентичный механизму речевой памяти. Однако, даже признавая такую дифференциацию между запоминанием мыслей и слов, Бине и Бюлер пошли дальше, акцентируя на разделении мышления и речи в контексте запоминания, что отражает основные предпосылки их теории о \\"чистом\\" мышлении. Таким образом, они довольно радикально разделяют процессы запоминания мыслей и речевых форм, подчеркивая их автономность в когнитивных процессах человека."},{"prompt":"В памяти выделяются четыре взаимосвязанных процесса: запоминание, сохранение, воспроизведение, а также забывание информации. Запоминание — это процесс памяти, в результате которого происходит «запечатление», закрепление новой информации посредством ее кодирования (в виде «следов памяти») и связывания с приобретенным ранее опытом. Важнейшей особенностью запоминания выступает его избирательность - далеко не вся информация, поступающая в мозг, подлежит запечатлению. Данное свойство непосредственно связано с избирательностью (селективностью) внимания. Запоминание может быть механическим и осмысленным, непроизвольным и произвольным. Сохранение — это процесс удержания информации в памяти, ее переработки и преобразования. Необходимым условием запоминания и сохранения информации является сохранность структур головного мозга. Воспроизведение — это актуализация в сознании ранее сформированного психологического содержания (мысли, образа, чувства) в условиях отсутствия внешних актуально воспринимаемых указателей на это содержание. Различается: Непроизвольное воспроизведение, когда прошлое впечат­ление актуализируется без специальной задачи, и произвольное, обусловленное целями и задачами выполняемой деятельности. Воспроизведение носит избирательный и опосредованный характер, определяется потребностями, направлением деятельности, актуальными переживаниями. При воспроизведении обычно происходит существенная перестройка воспринятого, так что исходное содержание теряет ряд второстепенных деталей и приобретает обобщенную форму, максимально соответствующую решаемым задачам. Процесс воспроизведения имеет несколько разновидностей: узнавание, собственно воспроизведение, припоминание (направляемое волей извлече­ние из долговременной памяти образов прошлого). Забывание - активный процесс, заключающийся в потере доступа к запомненному ранее материалу, в невозможности воспроизвести или узнать то, что было однажды усвоено. Забыванию подвергается прежде всего то, что не отвечает насущным потребностям субъекта и не актуализируется в контексте решаемых им задач. Наиболее интенсивно этот процесс осуществляется сразу после окончания заучивания. При этом лучше всего сохраняется осмысленный и важный материал, приобретающий в процессе хранения более обобщенный и схематичный характер. Второстепенные детали забываются скорее, нежели значимые.","completion":"В структуре памяти выделяют четыре ключевых, тесно взаимосвязанных элемента: процессы запоминания, сохранения, воспроизведения информации и забывание. Запоминание представляет собой этап, на котором происходит фиксация новой информации через ее кодировку в виде \\"следов памяти\\" и ассоциацию с уже имеющимся опытом. Особенностью запоминания является его избирательность, определяемая направленностью внимания, в результате чего из общего потока информации выделяется и закрепляется только часть. Сохранение - это длительное удержание информации в памяти, включающее ее обработку и преобразование, зависящее от стабильности нейронных структур мозга. Воспроизведение означает активацию ранее усвоенной информации без внешних стимулов. Этот процесс может быть как непроизвольным, так и произвольным, управляемым текущими задачами и целями. В процессе воспроизведения информация часто упрощается и обобщается, соответствуя актуальным потребностям и задачам субъекта. Забывание - это процесс утраты доступа к ранее запомненной информации, который чаще всего касается данных, не связанных с текущими потребностями и целями. Интенсивность забывания наиболее высока непосредственно после запоминания, при этом лучше всего сохраняются значимые и осмысленные сведения. Таким образом, эти четыре процесса формируют комплексную систему работы памяти, обеспечивающую возможность накопления, хранения, активации и отсеивания информации, что является ключевым для адаптации и обучения."},{"prompt":"Забывание связано с эффектами проективного и ретро­активного торможения.

This crisis-bound structure of material reproduction was not overcome either by the immense growth in colonial trade, the rise in mining production or the thriving of some branches of manufacture; indeed it took an even sharper form in the second half of the eighteenth century. As a result of inflation and unemployment, refusal to pay taxes became common, along with the fixing of prices by a resisting population, aggressive begging and robbery. Phenomena of this kind were structural features of a society in which the lower orders, if they sought to make their voices heard, had no modes of behaviour open to them that would not be criminalised. If the authorities reacted draconically, this was a structurally typical ruling practice for the ancien régime, and not even the signal of an \'intensifying\' crisis of rule. The second of the great crisis complexes of the French ancien régime resulted from the privatisation of generalised rule. The fact that offices could be bought and inherited limited the crown\'s scope of action, so that it could generally afford strategies of expropriation neither financially nor politically; it provoked conflicts between the \'sword\' and the \'robe\', or at least between particular groups on both sides, and reinforced the crisis-like structure of material reproduction. Offices were a relatively secure investment, and often a reward-ing one. Above all, however, income from office brought social respect. Own-ership of office could provide access to circles that remained closed to mere merchants or artisans, no matter how wealthy they were, and in certain cir-cumstances it opened the way to ennoblement - or, for those already ennobled, integration into the families of the long-established noblesse de robe. In the social conditions of the time, investment in office was a good prospect for all who sought social advance for themselves or their children. For, despite all the criticism made of it - which grew steadily in the eighteenth century - under the ancien régime the nobility remained culturally dominant. There certainly were families of the wealthy bourgeoisie whose strategies of marriage and appropriation were not designed to raise themselves above their station, but on many others the attributes of nobility exercised a considerable force of attraction. For all those set on noble status in ancien-régime France, the route via ownership of office was unavoidable. This meant, however, that a considerable part of accumulated wealth was diverted to unproductive waste. The same was true of investment in state loans. The crown\'s regular financial crises, the high interest payments and the conditions of advance into the nobility, all contributed to reinforcing this pattern of behaviour. This meant the repro-duction of practices of appropriation the very existence of which restricted the possibilities of expanding the basis of material production. This development coincided in time with a dramatic rise in the costs of war and with the power-political strategies of the French crown. The French kings\' advisers were aware that the crisis of generalised power was becoming acute, yet the remedies that most immediately suggested themselves were unavailable. For no matter how powerful the French crown was, it did not have the strength to abolish private ownership of offices and established privileges. All gov-ernment strategies that aimed at making the ‘administration\' an instrument of the crown were undone by demands for fees, competences and pensions. The possibilities of reforming the generalised rule were severely restricted in ancien-régime France. Acute crises of government generally arose when the crown was no longer in a position to more or less satisfy the different interests established in the ‘state apparatus\', or else to play off their representative groups against one another: in times of a king\'s minority, in the case of a fall in the profit from offices and ‘state\' creditors, and also if a king did not ‘enjoy respect\' in his government. That latter observation was made about Louis XVI by Count Mercy-Argentau in a letter of 6 November 1784 to the Austrian state chancellor Kaunitz. The crisis-prone structure of the material reproduction of generalised rule, and the structural obstacles to their adequate reform, were the preconditions for the French Revolution. The question why this Revolution actually occurred demands separate explanation. Chapter Four The French Revolution as Event and Structural Change Digression: The French Revolution as object of dispute between historical schools Nothing need be added here to the many depictions of the French Revolution that historians have offered. We shall confine ourselves to certain aspects of the latest phase in the long struggle over the interpretation of this historical event and along with it the interpretation of the history of the French nation, a struggle also over issues of contemporary political discourse and for academic esteem. It seemed at the end of the 1950s as if, whilst anal-ysis of the Revolution could always be pursued fur-ther, its interpretational framework was now secure. From the time of Aulard, Jaurès and Mathiez, the Jacobin tradition of interpreting the Revolution had been increasingly linked with materialist analytical concepts. Georges Lefebvre had extended this model of interpretation, which was already internally coherent, with a history from below when he drew attention to the revolutionary struggles of the peasantry.1 When Albert Soboul\'s great study of the Paris sans-culottes appeared in 1958, the urban activists from the lower orders had also found their historian. One might have supposed this to be the cornerstone of an analytical framework that could subsequently be applied to ever further areas. Already in the arguments of Jaurès and Mathiez we can rediscover the crude model of historical theory that Marx and Engels had taken over from contemporary political debates about the ‘class struggle\' between bourgeoisie and nobility and used for the propagandist text of the Communist Manifesto. When a particularly confined version of Second-International Marxism spread in France, claiming to be a science of society and its historical development, the materialist interpretation of the Revolution (usually known in France as the ‘social\' interpretation) passed from the heady emotion of the Manifesto to the sorry structural analysis of orthodox Marxism. In this respect as well, Soboul\'s works marked an end-point. Despite being undoubtedly a great historian, even Soboul pressed historical events into a categorical pattern immune to further research. In this interpretation - as can be read for example in his classic work La Révolution française,2 the Revolution was a watershed between feudalism and capitalism. Feudal forms of appropriation, and feudal-aristocratic forms of rule, had been dominant in France up to August 1789, but they were experiencing a profound structural crisis. For this reason, the feudal-aristocratic class in France was no longer able to defend the old system once the crown\'s financial crisis provoked a crisis of rule. Revolutionary consciousness arose spontaneously in this situation, which actualised as it were the inclination to a revolutionary attitude. In the Revolution the feudal- aristocratic class was confronted by a class alliance under the leadership of the bourgeoisie. The threat to the Revolution and the internal contradictions of the class alliance brought a radicalisation. Given the material power position of the bourgeoisie, and the fact that the more radical revolutionaries were trapped in the confined positions of artisans and peasants, the bourgeoisie was able to monopolise the fruits of the Revolution for itself. A whole generation of students interested in politics and history - myself among them - was still marked by this interpretation of the French Revolution, even after its foundations had already been shaken by scholarship. So little now remains of this once dominant position that François Furet no longer even felt the need to mention his long-time scholarly opponent, Albert Soboul, in a recent presentation of the historiography of the French Revolution.3 In point of fact, however, the questions posed by scholars studying the Revolution - including Furet himself - were still governed until very recently by the ‘social interpretation\'. It is only in the last few years that historians have managed to avoid the deep gulfs drawn between the hostile camps. For the sake of simplicity, I shall avoid fine distinctions here and confine myself to sketching out the key points of departure of this criticism. It bears first of all on the preconditions for the Revolution. Since the Marxist explanatory model explained both the content and the effects of the Revolution in terms of these preconditions, a criticism of the thesis that feudal relations still obtained necessarily shakes the basis of the social interpretation. From the time that Alfred Cobban4 asserted that only insignificant residues of feudal lordship remained in the eighteenth century, that capitalisation was already under way before the Revolution and that this was in no way exclusively the work of members of the Third Estate but also of nobles, one side searched everywhere for feudal lords living off their seigneurial revenues, while the other side searched for nobles engaged in manufacture. After examples had been piled up for a good while, Régine Robin, in no way with the agreement of the entire ‘Marxist camp\', drew a courageous line under the question, by accepting the empirical objections to the thesis of feudalism and maintaining that, under the ancien régime, two modes of production had stood in a relationship of interaction.5 The crisis-prone character of this social formation came to the fore when the state apparatus was no longer able to guarantee this contradictory connection. If this did not amount to a theoretical advance (as we have already explained), it did open up the Marxist interpretation to the results of concrete historical research. In the meantime, the dispute over the preconditions has reached the point that in the last few decades we no longer have the situation that Henri Doniol lamented back in 1876, since no one can say any longer that we know nothing about conditions in the year 1788.6”翻译为中文","completion":"\\"法国古代制度的整个历程被危机所主导，这些危机属于古典类型（埃内斯特·拉布鲁斯），即通过面包价格上涨预示的危机，每一次因恶劣收成和投机加剧而导致的供应危机，都会接着引发因需求不足而导致的贸易和制造业危机。这种物质再生产的危机结构并没有因殖民贸易的巨大增长、矿业产量的上升或某些制造业分支的繁荣而得以克服；实际上，在18世纪后半叶，这种情况变得更加严重。由于通货膨胀和失业，拒绝纳税变得普遍，人们抗议物价，公然讨饭和抢劫也随之而来。这类现象是低阶层社会结构特征的一部分，如果他们试图发出自己的声音，没有哪种行为模式不会被定罪。如果权力机构采取严厉反应，这是古代制度典型的统治实践，甚至不是统治危机‘加剧’的信号。 法国古代制度的第二大危机复合体源自于权力私有化。官职能够购买和继承，这限制了王权的行动范围，使得王权在财政上和政治上通常无法采取征收战略；它激发了‘剑’与‘袍’之间，或者至少是双方特定群体之间的冲突，并加剧了物质再生产的危机结构。官职是一项相对安全的投资，往往也是有益的。最重要的是，官职带来的收入赢得了社会尊重。拥有官职可以获得进入那些对普通商人或手艺人无论多富有都保持关闭的圈子的通道，并在某些情况下，它为走向爵位——或者对于那些已经被封为贵族的人，融入长期确立的贵族法袍家族——铺平了道路。在当时的社会条件下，投资官职对所有寻求自身或其子女社会进步的人来说是一个好选择。因为，尽管对此有着越来越多的批评——这在18世纪逐渐增加——在古代制度下，贵族仍然在文化上占据主导地位。的确有一些富裕的资产阶级家庭的婚姻和占有策略并不旨在提升自己的地位，但对许多其他家庭而言，贵族的属性具有相当大的吸引力。对于所有在法国古代制度下追求贵族地位的人来说，通过拥有官职的途径是不可避免的。这意味着，大量积累的财富被用于非生产性浪费。对国家贷款的投资也是如此。王室的定期财政危机、高额的利息支付和晋升贵族身份的条件，都加强了这种行为模式。这意味着再生产了阻碍扩大物质生产基础可能性的占有实践。这一发展与战争成本的戏剧性上升以及法国王冠的权力政治策略同时发生。法国国王的顾问们意识到，权力普遍化的危机正变得尖锐，但是最直接的补救措施却无从谈起。因为无论法国王冠多么强大，它都没有实力废除官职的私有权和既得特权。所有旨在使‘行政’成为王权工具的政府策略，都因费用、职责和养老金的要求而破产。在法国古代制度中，改革普遍化权力的可能性受到了严重限制。 当王冠不再处于能够或多或少满足在‘国家机器’中确立的不同利益的位置，或者无法将其代表团体相互对立时，通常会出现严重的政府危机：在国王年幼、官职利润下降和‘国家’债权人下降的时代，以及如果一个国王在他的政府中‘不受尊重’的情况下。关于后者的观察是Count Mercy-Argentau在1784年11月6日致奥地利国务大臣Kaunitz的一封信中对路易十六的评论。 普遍化权力的物质再生产结构的危机性，以及对其适当改革的结构性障碍，是法国大革命的前提条件。为什么这场革命实际发生的问题需要单独解释。 第四章 法国大革命作为事件和结构变化 题外话：法国大革命作为历史学派争论的对象 这里无需再添加历史学家们已经提供的关于法国大革命的许多描述。我们将限于关注这场历史事件的解释以及与之相关的法国历史解释在长期斗争中的最新阶段，这场斗争也涉及当代政治话语的问题和学术声望的争夺。 似乎在1950年代末，虽然对革命的分析可以进一步进行，但其解释框架现在已经确立。从Aulard，Jaurès和Mathiez时代开始，解释革命的雅各宾传统越来越多地与唯物主义分析概念联系在一起。乔治·勒费弗尔通过从下而上的历史延伸了这种已经内在一致的解释模型，当他关注农民的革命斗争时。当阿尔贝·索布尔关于巴黎无产阶级的重要研究于1958年出版时，下层阶级的城市活动家也找到了他们的历史学家。人们可能会认为这是一个分析框架的基石，随后可以应用到更多领域。 在Jaurès和Mathiez的论点中，我们可以重新发现马克思和恩格斯从当代政治辩论中关于资产阶级和贵族之间的‘阶级斗争’借鉴而来，并用于《共产党宣言》宣传文本的粗糙历史理论模型。当一个特别狭隘版本的第二国际马克思主义在法国传播，宣称是社会及其历史发展的科学时，对革命的唯物主义解释（通常在法国被称为‘社会’解释）从《宣言》的激情转变为正统马克思主义悲惨的结构分析。在这方面，索布尔的著作标志着一个终点。尽管无疑是一位伟大的历史学家，索布尔甚至还将历史事件压缩进一个对进一步研究免疫的范畴模式中。在这种解释中——例如可以在他的经典作品《法国大革命》中读到——革命是封建主义和资本主义之间的分水岭。1789年8月之前，封建占有形式和封建-贵族统治形式在法国占据主导地位，但它们正经历深刻的结构危机。因此，一旦王冠的财政危机引发了统治危机，法国的封建-贵族阶级就无法再捍卫旧有制度。革命意识在这种情况下自发产生，从而实现了一种革命态度的倾向。在革命中，封建-贵族阶级面临着一个在资产阶级领导下的阶级联盟的对抗。对革命的威胁和阶级联盟的内部矛盾带来了激进化。鉴于资产阶级的物质力量地位，以及更激进的革命者被限制在手工艺人和农民的狭窄立场中，资产阶级能够为自己垄断革命的成果。一个代代相传的对政治和历史感兴趣的学生一代——包括我自己——仍然被这种对法国大革命的解释所标记，即使它的基础已经被学术研究所动摇。如今，这一曾经占据主导地位的立场几乎所剩无几，以致于弗朗索瓦·富雷在最近一次关于法国大革命的历史学说述中，甚至不再觉得有必要提及他长期的学术对手阿尔贝·索布尔。实际上，然而，直到最近，研究革命的学者们提出的问题——包括富雷本人——仍然受到‘社会解释’的支配。只是在最近几年，历史学家们才设法避开了敌对阵营之间划定的深渊。为了简单起见，我将避免进行微妙的区分，在这里仅勾勒出这种批评的主要出发点。 它首先关注革命的前提条件。因为马克思主义解释模型根据这些前提条件解释了革命的内容和效果，所以对于封建关系仍然存在的论断的批评必然动摇了社会解释的基础。从阿尔弗雷德·科班声称18世纪只剩下不重要的封建领主残余，资本主义化已经在革命之前开始进行，并且这绝不仅仅是第三等级成员的工作，贵族也参与其中的时刻开始，一方到处寻找靠封建领地收入生活的封建领主，而另一方寻找从事制造业的贵族。在好一阵子堆积了例子之后，雷吉纳·罗宾，并非在整个‘马克思主义阵营’的同意下，勇敢地划了一个界限，在接受对封建主义论断的实证反对意见的同时，认为在古代制度下，两种生产方式处于互动关系中。这种社会形态的危机特征在国家机器不再能够保证这种矛盾联系时显现。如果这并不构成理论的进步（正如我们已经解释的），那么它确实对具体历史研究的结果开放了马克思主义解释。与此同时，对前提条件的争论已经发展到，在过去的几十年中，我们不再处于亨利·多尼奥在1876年抱怨的情况，因为没有人能再说我们对1788年的情况一无所知。"},{"prompt":"The _________ the material to be cut, the harder the cutting tool should be.

Найдите длину большего основания трапеции.","completion":"Площадь прямоугольной трапеции вычисляется по формуле: S = (a + b) * h / 2, где a и b - основания трапеции, h - высота трапеции. Дано, что S = 216 см², KH = NK и ∠KPM = 45°. Из условия задачи следует, что треугольник KHP прямоугольный (так как высота K перпендикулярна к базе MP прямоугольника MNKP). Также, треугольники KNH и KHP подобны по двум углам, так как у них углы ∠KNH и ∠KPH равны, а также у них прямые углы в вершине K. Таким образом, мы знаем, что соотношение сторон KN / KH = NH / HP. Из условия KH = NK следует, что KN / KH = 1, то есть NH / HP = 1. Так как мы знаем, что NH = HP (из условия подобия треугольников KNH и KHP), то NH = HP = x. Теперь найдем длину меньшего основания трапеции: b = KN + NH = KN + HP = KN + x. Так как мы знаем, что KN = KH = x (из условия KH = NK), то b = 2x. Учитывая, что площадь трапеции равна 216 см², получаем: 216 = (a + 2x) * x / 2, 432 = a * x + 2x². Также из задачи нам известно, что трапеция MNKP - прямоугольная, а значит, ∠KNM = 90°. Из этого мы можем найти длину основания a, так как по теореме косинусов: cos(∠KNM) = a / NK, cos(90°) = a / x, 0 = a / x, a = x. Теперь мы можем подставить a = x в уравнение 432 = a * x + 2x²: 432 = x^2 + 2x^2, 432 = 3x^2, x^2 = 432 / 3, x^2 = 144, x = 12.

Это можно сделать, выполнив команду: ```shell sudo ufw logging on ``` Если вы хотите настроить уровень логирования (например, на \\"low\\", \\"medium\\", \\"high\\" или \\"full\\"), используйте команду: ```shell sudo ufw logging LEVEL ``` Где вместо `LEVEL` подставьте нужный уровень. - Для просмотра логов UFW можно использовать команду: ```shell grep UFW /var/log/syslog ``` Это покажет записи, относящиеся к UFW, из файла журнала syslog. Иногда может потребоваться проверить и другие файлы журналов, как `kern.log`, особенно если вы настраивали UFW блокировать пакеты на более низком уровне. - Для более недавних записей используйте команду: ```shell tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep UFW ``` Это позволит вам следить в реальном времени за записями, которые добавляются в журнал `syslog` и связаны с UFW. 2. **Анализ журнала с использованием утилиты `ufw`**: Хотя основные команды `ufw` в основном используются для управления правилами, просмотр логов напрямую через `ufw` не поддерживается. Вся информация о заблокированных подключениях направляется в системные журналы, как описано выше. 3. **Использование утилит для анализа логов**: Если вам необходимо более детально проанализировать логи или вы ищете конкретное заблокированное подключение, вы можете использовать утилиты вроде `logwatch`, `lnav` или `grep` для более глубокого анализа и фильтрации журналов. Например, установка и использование Logwatch: ```shell sudo apt-get install logwatch logwatch --detail High --service ufw --range today ``` Эти способы должны помочь вам найти информацию о заблокированных подключениях из-за фаервола UFW в Ubuntu. Для более специфических задач или настройке логирования UFW под конкретные требования, рекомендуется обратиться к официальной документации UFW или общим руководствам по анализу системных логов Linux."},{"prompt":"как указать правило allow в ufw для докер контейнеров? ведь в них постоянно меняются ip адреса","completion":"Добавление правила в UFW для разрешения трафика до контейнеров Docker может быть непростой задачей, потому что Docker напрямую управляет iptables, обходя UFW, что может приводить к конфликтам в правилах. К тому же, как вы правильно заметили, контейнеры Docker могут получать разные IP-адреса, что делает непрактичным добавление правил в UFW для каждого IP-адреса вручную. Есть несколько подходов, которые можно использовать для решения этой задачи: # 1. Использование Docker с сетевым драйвером macvlan Подход с `macvlan` позволяет присваивать MAC-адреса контейнерам Docker, делая их доступными в локальной сети как отдельные устройства. Это позволяет настроить UFW для работы с конкретными IP-адресами или даже диапазонами IP, если вы настроите DHCP сервер на предоставление IP адресов из определённого диапазона для MAC-адресов контейнеров. # 2. Связывание контейнеров с конкретными внешними портами Если ваши контейнеры Docker прослушивают порты для входящих соединений, вы можете связать эти порты с конкретными портами на хостовой машине. Затем в UFW можно настроить правила для этих внешних портов. Например, добавление правила для разрешения трафика на порт 8080: ```bash sudo ufw allow 8080 ``` # 3. Использование пользовательских сетей Docker Создайте пользовательскую сеть Docker и назначьте ваши контейнеры этой сети. Затем вы можете настроить UFW для работы с IP-диапазоном, выделенным для этой пользовательской сети. ```bash docker network create --subnet=172.28.0.0/16 mynetwork ``` Затем обновите правила UFW, чтобы разрешить весь трафик от этого подсети: ```bash sudo ufw allow from 172.28.0.0/16 ``` # Важные замечания - При работе с Docker и UFW важно помнить, что Docker может вносить изменения в правила iptables, которые могут влиять на поведение или даже обходить правила UFW. - Рассмотрите возможность настройки Docker, чтобы предотвратить автоматическое внесение изменений в iptables. Это можно сделать, добавив `{\\"iptables\\": false}` в файл конфигурации Docker (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`). Однако будьте осторожны: это изменение необходимо делать с пониманием последствий, так как оно может повлиять на связность контейнеров и доступность сервисов. # Заключение Выбор подхода зависит от вашей конкретной ситуации, включая требования к безопасности, структуру сети и как ваши контейнеры используются и общаются внутри вашей инфраструктуры. Не существует универсального решения, но представленные здесь методы предоставляют различные варианты для настройки UFW для работы с Docker."},{"prompt":"Synthesize and tighten into a 200-word paragraph THAT discusses the Coffee Market Trends, challenges, and opportunities in Vietnam: \\"Coffee In Vietnam Dec 2023 KEY DATA FINDINGS Retail value sales grow by 6% in current terms in 2023 to VND11.3 trillion Instant standard coffee is the best-performing category in 2023, with retail value sales rising by 7% in current terms to VND2.9 trillion Nestlé Vietnam Co Ltd is the leading player in 2023, with a retail value share of 38% Retail sales are set to increase at a current value CAGR of 7% (2023 constant value CAGR of 3%) over the forecast period to VND15.8 trillion 2023 DEVELOPMENTS Demand for coffee impacted by a slowdown in the economy and elevated inflation Sales of coffee in Vietnam have seen a small decline in retail volume terms in 2023 with the economic downturn and elevated inflation forcing consumers to show greater caution in their spending. Vietnam’s economy started to struggle in 2023 with lower demand in key export markets weighing on its manufacturing industry, while there was an intense desire to keep the Vietnamese Dong stable at the expense of business borrowing. Thus, Vietnam’s GDP growth is projected to be lower than that seen in 2022. As such, Vietnamese consumers started to tighten their budgets with many people reducing their spending on non-essential products such as coffee. Though consumers have continued to drink coffee some people have been drinking less as a way to save money. In response to the lower demand, key players in coffee such as Masan Group Corp and Nestlé Vietnam Ltd have been constantly deploying discounting activities at modern channels such as supermarkets and hypermarkets and online as a way to simulate consumer demand. When it comes to coffee in Vietnam sales are relatively evenly split between the retail channel and the foodservice channel. During the pandemic sales swung towards the retail channel as consumers were unwilling or unable to venture outside their home for long periods. However, now that the pandemic is over sales have been shifting back towards the foodservice channel. Nonetheless, after seeing double-digit growth in volume terms in 2022, the recovery of foodservice sales has slowed in 2023. Like retail sales, this is in part due to the slowdown in the economy and rising prices. However, foodservice sales have benefited from more consumers returning to the workplace, an increase in social engagements and a recovery in Vietnam’s tourism industry. Production shortfall leads to a sharp rise in the price of coffee beans Coffee production in Vietnam was negatively impacted in 2023 by high temperatures and drought which are linked to the impact of climate change. This is not just a local problem with there being a global shortage of coffee beans in 2023 due to poor yields in key regions such as India and Brazil. As such, this led to a sharp increase in the price of fresh coffee beans but which also put significant pressure on the production cost of fresh ground coffee and instant coffee. With manufacturers also facing an increase in other production costs this came at a challenging time, with there being pressure to contain price rises with locals already facing a sharp rise in the cost of living. The Vietnamese government has reduced the rate of VAT from 10% to 8% from 1 July to 31 December 31, 2023, as part of efforts to support businesses and companies and to ease the pressure on consumers. However, this has not been enough to prevent a significant increase in the price of coffee in 2023. As Vietnamese consumers are quite price-sensitive these price rises have negatively impacted demand in 2023 and therefore players are expected to look to avoid any further significant price increases in coffee, at least in the short term. Coffee continues to benefit from new product innovation Despite the challenges that have faced coffee producers in 2022 and 2023 the market has continued to see various product innovations, with these mostly focusing on flavour. For example, in July 2023, The Coffee Factory, a chain of specialist coffee shops in Vietnam, launched its new mint flavoured range of instant coffee mixes. This new product can be served hot or cold and adds the chain’s existing product lineup in instant coffee mixes which also includes hazelnut and cappuccino options. To help promote its range of instant coffee mixes The Coffee Factory ran various promotions during 2023 including an offer to buy two boxes of its mint and cappuccino instant coffee mixes as a bundle offer for VND99,000. In April 2023, Fes Vietnam Co Ltd added a new fresh ground coffee flavour to its MacCoffee Gold range to provide a stronger coffee taste. Another new launch under the MacCoffee brand in standard fresh ground coffee in 2023 was MacCoffee Cà Phê Ph? Rang Xay (street roasted coffee). Fresh ground coffee is usually sold in 200g or 500g pack sizes in Vietnam but this new product is being sold in single-portion sachets that are designed to be more affordable and convenient for consumers, which has helped to make its coffee more accessible to a wider audience. PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES Coffee is expected to see the better performance over the forecast period Coffee is expected to see a return to growth in retail volume terms over the forecast period while foodservice sales are projected to see a full recovery. Demand is likely to pick up as Vietnam’s economy rebounds and as consumer confidence is restored. Furthermore, sales should also benefit from the recovery of the country’s tourism industry as well as locals returning to more active lives away from the home both for work and leisure. The Vietnamese government is also expected to continue deploying initiatives to boost the economy and to encourage consumers to start spending again. For example, in October 2023 the Ministry of Finance consulted the authorities on making further cuts to VAT for the first six months of 2024, having previously reduced VAT from 10% to 8% for the second half of 2023. Consumers expected to show higher interest in fresh coffee Over the forecast, Vietnamese consumers are expected to show higher interest in fresh coffee including fresh coffee beans and standard fresh ground coffee. More and more fully automated coffee machines are being promoted and sold in electronics and appliance stores and through retail e-commerce platforms such as tiki.vn, Lazada.vn, and shopee.vn. These small appliances are becoming increasingly affordable, with many consumers purchasing these products during special sales events which have become increasingly common in Vietnam. The rising availability of coffee machines has led to a rising demand for the café experience at home, which in turn is boosting sales of fresh coffee. Nonetheless, fresh coffee beans are typically only available in specialist coffee shops, while the presence of these products in the retail channel is limited due to the fact consumers need to grind the beans in small batches for immediate use, which is seen as inconvenient and time consuming. Instead, when it comes to fresh coffee Vietnamese consumers usually purchase standard fresh ground coffee when shopping in the retail channel. As the economy improves consumers are likely to be keen to invest in a higher quality cup of coffee whether at home or in the foodservice channel and thus sales of fresh ground coffee are projected to see strong growth in total volume terms. Limited opportunities expected for pods, but local players and foodservice operators could carve out more share in the market Over the forecast period, the presence of fresh ground coffee pods will likely remain negligible in Vietnam due to the well-established culture and preference for drip coffee. Therefore, there is likely to be a reluctance to embrace more modern approaches such as coffee pods. In addition, when considering the cost per cup, coffee pods tend to be pricier than purchasing fresh coffee beans or standard fresh ground coffee. Moreover, with the widespread availability of specialist coffee shops and a strong coffee culture in Vietnam, consumers can easily purchase fresh coffee drinks in various options from expresso, cappuccino, and latte to drip coffee, all at a cheaper price than purchasing fresh ground coffee pods. The higher cost of these products compared to other coffee options is therefore likely to remain a major deterrent to price-conscious consumers. As Vietnam is able to grow and produce its own raw coffee beans, the forecast period is, however, likely to see the entry of more small domestic players into the market, as exemplified by newcomers such as Mr Viet, Shin Café, and Gunam. These local brands typically focus on distribution within a certain region or a niche segment, in order to differentiate themselves from their larger rivals. Indeed, an increasing demand for speciality coffee, as well as a growing consumer interest in where coffee is grown, should pay dividends for these smaller players. Foodservice operators, such as Phuc Long Coffee & Tea Co Ltd and Viet Thai International JSC (with its Highland brand) are also expected to focus on developing their offerings within their coffee shop outlets, as well as looking to take advantage of their strong brand names to expand further. | RTD Coffee In Vietnam Dec 2023 KEY DATA FINDINGS Off-trade volume sales grow by 4% in 2023 to 3 million litres Ajinomoto Co Inc is the leading player in 2023, with an off-trade volume share of 38% Off-trade volume sales are set to grow at a CAGR of 7% over the forecast period to 4 million litres 2023 DEVELOPMENTS RTD Coffee still has potential for growth in 2023 RTD coffee has continued to see steady growth in off-trade volume terms in 2023. Although RTD coffee is a relatively niche category, especially when compared to similar products such as RTD tea, it nonetheless appears to still have plenty of potential with it seemingly fitting with the increasingly modern lifestyles of Vietnamese consumers. Consumers usually purchase RTD coffee as a convenient and indulgent option to drink at home. However, the fast development and expansion of the convenience stores channel in Vietnam has also created new opportunities for the consumption of RTD coffee. Convenience stores are becoming increasingly popular among the younger generations in Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi. For example, consumers often purchase ready meals and soft drinks from convenience stores to consume when hanging out with friends. Convenience stores also typically operate 24/7 with most stores having a chilled section. As such, many consumers tend to purchase RTD coffee at convenience stores when specialist coffee and tea shops are closed. RTD coffee continues to face still competition fresh coffee Although RTD coffee continues to grow and develop at a steady pace it still faces significant obstacles to wider acceptance. For example, in general, RTD coffee continues to face still competition from cafés, specialist coffee shops and street vendors which benefit from the strong coffee culture in Vietnam. It is easy to buy a fresh coffee in a wide range of options ranging from black coffee to milk coffee, along with hot and iced coffee with these options typically having very affordable prices when purchased from specialist coffee shops and street vendors, which are present on every street corner in Vietnam. In addition, the majority of consumers usually prefer fresh coffee instead of RTD coffee, with the perception being that the former is more natural, healthier, fresher and often tastier. Importantly, RTD coffee is also generally more expensive than fresh coffee, which given the challenging economic environment is a significant obstacle to growth. Therefore, RTD coffee has struggled to win over consumers or capture their attention with most consumers still either opting for fresh coffee or other soft drinks options such as carbonates or RTD tea, for example. Birdy tops the rankings while e-commerce has to bring RTD coffee to a wider audience In terms of the competitive landscape, Ajinomoto Co Inc has extended its lead in RTD coffee in 2023, with its Birdy brand topping the rankings, closely followed by Viet Thai International JSC with its Highlands brand. King Car Co Ltd with Mr Brown and Nestlé Vietnam Co Ltd with Nescafé are the other notable players in what is a highly consolidated category with the remaining players accounting for a combined off-trade volume share of 4% as of 2023. The Birdy brand benefits from its local image with it being made from 100% premium Vietnamese Robusta coffee beans. It has also expanded its reach with its RTD coffee now being available on leading e-commerce platforms. The expansion of retail e-commerce in Vietnam has helped producers of RTD coffee to reach more consumers, with these products still having a limited presence in some areas of the country. During the pandemic more and more consumers became familiar with online shopping and although the pandemic is now over many continue to shop online, including when shopping for RTD coffee. Consumers residing in small cities and rural areas are often unable to purchase RTD coffee in their local stores and thus retail e-commerce platforms such as tiki.vn, Lazada.vn and shopee.vn have helped to expand the potential audience for these products. Many brands have official stores on these platforms through which they offer attractive discounts and promotions to encourage sales. PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES A positive outlook for RTD coffee Over the forecast period, RTD coffee is expected to see a stronger performance in off-trade volume terms compared to the one seen during the review period. This partly based on key players in the market constantly working to improve the taste of their RTD coffee as they look to provide a similar taste to the fresh coffee available from specialist coffee shops. As consumers lead increasingly busy lives and spend more time working there is likely to be a growing demand for the convenience of RTD coffee in Vietnam, which can be purchased on impulse for consumption on the go or stored at home as a quick option. In addition, RTD coffee is still a relatively immature category compared to other soft drinks categories, such as RTD tea and energy drinks, and therefore has much more potential for growth and development. Indeed, the leading players are expected to take advantage of the strong growth opportunities which will likely emerge during the post-COVID-19 period. As the Vietnamese economy rebounds and consumers become more willing to spend money on non-essential items this should encourage more people to buy RTD coffee, which could also find some appeal among tourists. Nonetheless, in actual terms, sales will still likely remain heavily restricted due to the strong competition that these products face from fresh coffee which is more affordable, more widely available and which is generally seen to be healthier and tastier. Health and wellness expected to have a growing influence on new product development Over the forecast period, it is likely that the burgeoning health and wellness trend will start to have a growing influence on RTD coffee. These products typically have a high sugar content and this could prove an obstacle to growth as increasing numbers of Vietnamese consumers start to pay more attention to their overall wellbeing, especially with regard to the amount of sugar they put into their body. Therefore, reduced sugar RTD coffee products are expected to be introduced into the market. In addition, cold brew RTD coffee could be launched in the market backed by the expansion of the convenience stores channel, with these outlets having chilled sections which would be capable of storing these products. Cold brew RTD coffee could appeal to those consumers who are seeking less sweet and more nuanced speciality coffee flavours. Key players focus on product innovation to attract consumers’ interest The demand for coffee in Vietnam is constantly increasing as consumers become increasingly sophisticated and look for a wider range of flavours and experiences. The growing competition being seen in RTD coffee has therefore led companies to prioritise product innovation as they look to stand out on retailers’ shelves. As such, during the forecast period, RTD coffee is anticipated to witness an increase in the introduction of new products looking to cater to the growing demand from consumers with more refined preferences. One potential strategy for RTD coffee brands to consider is offering flavours that are inspired by popular or trendy flavours found in speciality coffee shops. This could include unique options such as salt coffee, mint coffee, coconut coffee, and more. Players are also likely to focus on the quality of the coffee beans used in their RTD coffee, as well as the packaging, as part of efforts to win the attention of consumers. However, with the average unit price of RTD coffee already being relatively high in comparison with other categories in soft drinks, it remains to be seen to what extent consumers will be prepared to pay extra for exotic flavours and other innovations.","completion":"In Vietnam, the coffee market in 2023 has experienced a 6% growth in retail value sales, reaching VND11.3 trillion, with instant standard coffee leading the performance. Despite this positive trend, the market faces challenges such as economic slowdown and inflation, impacting consumer spending habits and forcing a shift towards prudent expenditure, particularly in non-essential products like coffee. Nestlé Vietnam Co Ltd emerged as the market leader, holding a 38% retail value share. The shift in consumer behavior due to the pandemic has seen a temporary pivot towards retail, but as normalcy returns, there\'s a gradual shift back to foodservice channels, despite a slower recovery affected by economic constraints and rising prices. Another significant hurdle has been the production shortfall caused by climate change-induced high temperatures and drought, leading to a sharp rise in coffee bean prices, pressuring production costs amidst mounting living costs. Vietnam\'s government attempted to alleviate pressures by reducing VAT from 10% to 8% temporarily but faced challenges in controlling coffee price hikes. Innovation remains a bright spot, with new flavor introductions aiming to stimulate the market, despite financial difficulties. The forecast period holds optimism for the coffee sector, with expectations of an economic rebound enhancing consumer confidence and potentially boosting both retail and foodservice coffee sales. The trend towards fresh coffee, facilitated by increasingly affordable coffee machines, points to an evolving consumer preference, promising opportunities for growth in the fresh coffee segment. However, coffee pods might see limited growth due to established preferences for traditional coffee forms and perceptions around cost and quality. The entry of local players focusing on niche markets and specialty coffee could enrich the market landscape. Meanwhile, RTD coffee sees steady growth, driven by the convenience it offers amidst busy lifestyles and the expansion of retail e-commerce, presenting an opportunity for further market penetration, despite fresh coffee\'s dominance posing a competitive challenge. The health and wellness trend is expected to influence product innovation in the RTD segment, potentially introducing reduced sugar options and cold brews as brands strive to align with consumer preferences for healthier, yet indulgent coffee experiences."},{"prompt":"Compared to this version, determine which one is better, given that this section is part of a marketing research plan.

Remember focus SOLELY ON market trends, challenges and opportuinies for the VIETNAMESE MARKET: \\"Vietnamese Coffee Market: A Deep Dive into Its Consumers, Challenges, and Prospects September 15, 2023 Posted by Vietnam Briefing Written by Pham Nguyen Reading Time: 5 minutes Vietnam’s coffee industry holds promising opportunities for domestic and foreign firms in both manufacturing and retail. Nevertheless, navigating the Vietnamese coffee market can be demanding, especially when competing with hundreds of local and foreign coffee brands already present in the Vietnam market. With this context in mind, we offer essential insights for newcomers entering the market. Vietnam is the second largest coffee exporter in the world and was ranked first in coffee cultivation yield with 2.4 tons/hectare in the International Coffee Organization’s Annual Review 2021/2022. Those yields were made up of Robusta, Arabica, Cherri, Moka, and Culi beans, which are among the most popular coffee beans farmed in Vietnam. The following year, coffee production in 2022/23 reached 29.75 million bags, of which Robusta accounted for more than 95 percent. Vietnam contributes more than half of the global Robusta supply. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also noted that Vietnam’s coffee export output reached 16.97 million bags in the first half of 2023, with Germany, the United States, and Italy receiving the most. It’s understandable as coffee is a key industrial crop and farmed over 710,000 hectares in Vietnam. Furthermore, the growing demand for specialty coffee and the expansion of many coffee chains is driving Arabica coffee imports into Vietnam. Most of the green coffee imported into Vietnam comes from Indonesia, Brazil, Peru, and Germany, while processed coffee products are imported from Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and Belgium. Key players in the Vietnam coffee market The Vietnamese coffee market is a tough arena for both local and foreign brands. A Mordor Intelligence assessment lists five leading brands in the Vietnam coffee market. These are noted below. Nestlé Nestlé is a well-known brand in the Vietnamese fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. The company has leading instant coffee products under the brand name ‘Nescafé’, which had the highest brand recognition of instant coffee products in Vietnam in 2018. Currently, Nestlé has six plants in Vietnam with roughly 2,300 employees. Bien Hoa Vinacafé Joint Stock Company Bien Hoa Vinacafé is the leading coffee manufacturing company in Vietnam with two signature coffee instant products: Vinacafé and Wake-up. The company has exported its coffee products to more than 20 countries, including major markets in ASEAN and Europe. Starbucks Coffee Company Starbucks is the world’s biggest coffee retailer with more than 30,000 retail stores located in 75 countries. In Vietnam, the company owns 87 stores, which are mainly concentrated in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. According to the CEO of Starbucks Vietnam, the company plans to continue to expand its network in Vietnam and is expected to reach 100 stores this year 2023. Len’s Coffee LLC Len’s Coffee is a family-run coffee-exporting company. The company exports different varieties of coffee to the U.S. from Vietnam, including Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa, and Liberica. Len’s Coffee works with four famous local coffee brands in Vietnam: Trung Nguyen Coffee, Highlands Coffee, Truong Lam Coffee, and Bach Coffee. Phuc Long Trading Production Company Limited Phuc Long Trading Production Company is a pioneer in the Vietnam coffee and tea industry. The company had a total of 132 stores in 2022 and aims to be the largest coffee and tea chain in Vietnam. In addition to offering food and beverage services at stores, Phuc Long also sells packaged coffee and tea products. The company has plans to expand into the global market in 2024. Challenges of foreign investors in the Vietnam coffee market Different customer preferences Vietnamese like the strong and bitter taste of Robusta coffee beans. For Vietnamese consumers, a delicious cup of coffee must be rich in natural flavor, have the right amount of bitterness, and have the soft aroma of wood. However, most foreign coffee brands use Arabica beans that feature a milder taste and are less bitter with the aroma of nuts and fruit. Furthermore, coffee in Vietnam is not a ‘quick drink’ to get a buzz like it often is in Western cultures. Vietnamese people go for coffee for leisure—they like to sit and sip and think. These differences in coffee culture can make foreign brands less attractive than local brands. Vietnamese are price-sensitive Vietnam is one of the most price-sensitive regions in Southeast Asia. According to the Food and Beverage Business Market Report 2022 released by iPOS, most Vietnamese consumers are willing to pay US1.70 to US2.97 for coffee, which is about the mid-range for beverage brands like Highlands Coffee, Phuc Long, and The Coffee House. Only a few consumers are willing to pay for beverages over US2.97. This can make it difficult to penetrate the market for more expensive, foreign coffee chains. Mellower Coffee, a well-known Chinese brand with over 50 locations worldwide, announced its permanent closure in Vietnam after three years of operation, unable to penetrate Vietnam’s coffee market. Other international brands, such as Gloria Jean’s, New York Dessert Coffee, and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, have also suffered the same fate. It seems that it is hard for Vietnamese consumers to commit long-term to a cafe brand that charges an average price of US4.25 for one cup of coffee. Tough competition Foreign brands entering the Vietnam coffee market will experience tough competition from local brands and other foreign brands from coffee-store chains to sidewalk cafes. With roughly 338,600 restaurants and cafes as of the end of 2022, Vietnam is not short of delicious and reasonably priced cafes. In fact, in 2022, Trung Nguyen Coffee was the most recognizable coffee chain among Vietnamese consumers, per a Statista survey. High business operation cost According to the Vietnamese Real Estate Report 2022, the rental price in commercial shopping centers last year was roughly US100 per m2 per month in Hanoi and US130 per m2 per month in Ho Chi Minh City. Coupled with Vietnam’s price-sensitive consumers, this can see foreign brands forced to scale back or even withdraw from the Vietnamese market. Prospects for foreign firms Changing consumer preference According to the Food and Beverage Business Market Report 2022, Vietnamese people aged 23 to 30 are the most likely to buy a beverage, more often. Vietnam’s younger consumers are more open to foreign products, including Arabica beans, and are not averse to seeing coffee culture in Vietnam evolve. Rising demand for instant coffee Busy lifestyles and longer working hours are making the instant coffee market in Vietnam increasingly vibrant and competitive. Many big players in Vietnam’s coffee market have expanded into instant coffee. In 2021, the Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC) and private-label coffee company Instanta signed a joint venture agreement to build an instant coffee factory in Vietnam. A year later, Nestlé and Starbucks launched a new instant coffee product covering the signature flavors of Starbucks coffee: Dark Roast, Caffè Mocha, Caffè Latte, and Caramel Latte. According to Statista, the demand for instant coffee in Vietnam will grow 5.5 percent in 2024. Coffee consumption is expected to increase According to the USDA, Vietnamese coffee consumption is expected to grow by 5 to 10 percent this year. This will likely see manufacturers expanding their range of products and expanding their existing facilities to meet the rapidly growing demand in the domestic market. Investment opportunities Coffee manufacturing and processing facilities With abundant natural resources, a growing skilled workforce, and a low-cost labor force, Vietnam is an attractive destination for foreign enterprises in the coffee processing sector. Nestlé, a leading company in the F&B sector, purchases 20 to 25 percent of Vietnamese coffee each year for processing and then both domestic consumption and export. Foreign enterprises may also benefit from supportive government policies. For example, according to Decree No. 57/2018/ND-CP, the Vietnamese government will support up to 60 percent of the investment budget, capped at US625,000, for enterprises investing in Vietnam’s agriculture sector. Projects linking enterprises and farmers in production and agriculture could also be subsidized under Decree No. 98/2018/ND-CP. Online coffee stores Vietnamese consumers are avid patrons of online retail channels. This is evident in Datareportal’s Digital 2022: Vietnam report, which found rising internet penetration and growing demand for online beverage stores in Vietnam. Looking at 2025, Vietnam’s e-commerce value is expected to reach US39 billion ranking the country second in Southeast Asia in respect of e-commerce growth. However, online retail has not been able to completely displace traditional channels. Businesses may need a good business model combining both online and offline channels to expand and develop sustainably in Vietnam. Conclusion The Vietnamese coffee market may be an attractive option for international investors; however, they should make sure they understand the market well in advance and be prepared to cater to local tastes. This means looking at the types of coffee Vietnamese consumers enjoy, the way they enjoy their coffee, and learning from the experiences of foreign coffee brands that have decided to exit the market.\\"","completion":"In December 2023, Vietnam’s dynamic coffee market showcased a promising 6% growth in retail value sales to VND11.3 trillion, led mainly by instant standard coffee. As the world\'s second-largest coffee exporter and a leader in Robusta production, Vietnam offers fertile opportunities for both domestic and international firms, despite the competition among hundreds of local and foreign brands. Economic downturns and rising inflation have necessitated strategic pricing adaptations by market leaders like Nestlé, which holds a 38% share. The shifting landscape sees gradual returns to foodservice channels post-pandemic, amid the challenges of economic and cost-of-living pressures. Climate change has exacerbated production shortfalls, spiking coffee bean prices and pushing the government to temporarily lower VAT from 10% to 8% to ease consumer and business strains. Yet, demand remains sensitive to price changes. Innovation thrives with the entrance of new players and flavors, catering to a growing appetite for diverse coffee experiences. The market\'s potential recovery is tied to rebounding consumer confidence and economic revitalization. Increased interest in fresh coffee and RTD coffee suggests shifts towards convenient, quality coffee consumption. The coffee sector is poised for more localized, specialized offerings, accentuating trends towards health, wellness, and unique flavors. Meanwhile, challenges persist from varied consumer preferences favoring the robust, bitter taste of Robusta to the price sensitivity that has seen international brands struggle. However, evolving consumer tastes, especially among younger demographics, and a rising demand for instant coffee present opportunities. The expanding coffee consumption anticipates broader product ranges and facility expansions. Foreign investments in coffee manufacturing and processing are encouraged, supported by favorable government policies, and an increasing inclination towards online retail presents a dual strategy insight for sustainable business growth.

The market is expected to resurge as the Vietnamese economy and consumer confidence recover over the forecast period. The increasing affordability of coffee machines and the boom in instant and RTD (Ready-To-Drink) coffee reflect a shift towards convenient, yet high-quality, coffee consumption at home and on-the-go. Furthermore, the coffee sector may witness more localized and specialized offerings, with fresh coffee beans and innovative RTD products catering to evolving consumer preferences for health, wellness, and specialty flavors.\\"","completion":"Euromonitor (2023) highlighted a 6% rise in Vietnam\'s coffee retail value to VND11.3 trillion, propelled by instant standard coffee. Economic downturns and inflation have led to cautious consumer spending, prompting brands like Nestlé to offer strategic discounts. Nevertheless, the foodservice channel is showing signs of recovery from the pandemic\'s impact. Price hikes in coffee beans, caused by climate-related production shortfalls, have increased production expenses. In response, Vietnam temporarily lowered VAT from 10% to 8% towards 2023\'s end, aiming to ease the burden on consumers and businesses, though price sensitivity persists in the market. Innovation thrives with new brands and flavors emerging to meet the increasing demand for varied coffee experiences. As Vietnam\'s economy and consumer confidence are poised for a rebound, the market is anticipated to surge. The growing accessibility of coffee machines and the popularity of instant and RTD coffee signify a trend towards convenient, quality consumption. The sector is also set to see more personalized and unique offerings, with fresh beans and inventive RTD products aligning with consumer interests in health, wellness, and distinct flavors."},{"prompt":"est ce que vous connaissez design expert 13","completion":"Oui, Design Expert 13 est un logiciel de statistiques avancé utilisé pour l\'analyse et la conception d\'expériences dans le domaine de la recherche et du développement.

It was simply explained differently, arising either from the frustration of efforts at social advance on the part of non-noble officials, or from a political crisis. The attack on the content of the thesis of social-structural preconditions - and therefore necessities - initially opened the way to a renascence of political history. This opportunity was used by François Furet and Denis Richet in their history of the Revolution published in 1965, a work that for several decades reclaimed for ‘event history\' the place that structural history had taken. Whilst the radicalisation of the Revolution was still explained in this work in terms of ‘circumstances\' (a much-used topos), i.e. the war that the Revolution\'s opponents waged against the French Republic both externally and from within, Furet radicalised the political content of his interpretation in later publications. No longer were circonstances permitted this role. For Furet, the peaceful bourgeois revolution of 1789-91 was now the work of an enlightened élite, whilst the Terror offered proof that the nation should never have fallen into the hands of the radicals and the mob. What happened after 1791 was a ‘derailment\' of the Revolution, i.e. a departure from the path of peaceful improvement of the world that the nation had properly been prescribed. We can maintain today that though this interpretation led the attack on the social interpretation and also offered the opportunity of marketing scholarly legitimised anecdotal and biographical ‘stories\' of the Revolution that had long been banished to the popular sphere, it was not very significant in terms of genuine scholarly debate. It was countered by the far greater influence that Braudel\'s version of modernisation theory and the entire Annales school exer-cised on the historiography of the Revolution. It was not Furet\'s thesis of the ‘derailment of the Revolution\', but rather Braudel\'s interpretative model of long waves, that provided the guiding thread for scholars seeking a way out of the categories of the ‘social interpretation\'. The model of long waves lacks any theoretical foundation. It asserts a particular structural effect of long-term mentalities and forms of everyday life, a lesser structural effect of conjunctures of economic and social change, and a comparatively minor effect of events. Influences are established between these levels, but there is as little theoretical explanation of their manner and form as there is for the development at the level on which things alter ‘only slowly\'. The great advantage of this interpretative model, however, was that of shifting the Revolution to the topmost, i.e. least important, level, and in this way freeing it of a part of its mythic and emotive ballast. In this way, the longterm changes that had begun before the Revolution and continued after it came into view. Braudel\'s concept of the continuity of mentalities, moreover, also acted as a challenge. Michel Vovelle, for example, was long concerned with the question how the great change was prepared as a possibility in the slow change of life practices such as religious obeisance, and to what extent a breach then occurred that led to people\'s consciousness being different after the Revolution. He thus showed how the study of mentalities could serve to give the questions posed by the social interpretation a new formulation. In recent years, some students of mentalities have followed his lead, though by no means all. Others confine themselves to the coarser aspects of slow developments. In this connection belongs the thesis of the fusion of élites, which has pervaded revisionist literature since Alfred Cobban, and has since been radicalised by Guy Chaussinand-Nogaret to the point that a society of notables supposedly arose not after the Revolution, but rather before it. The critique of works whose authors staunchly maintain that feudalism was abolished in France in the night of 4-5 August 1789, has thus been used to drag the French Revolution, which formerly presented an obstacle, back into modernisation theory. In this context, the problem of a theory of the Revolution is reduced to a mere problem of definition: what amount of change is described as a revolution, and what amount is not? (A similar procedure is characteristically applied to the Industrial Revolution.) In this way, the Revolution as ‘event\' is banished from the realm of scientific analysis and referred to that of ‘revolutionary catechism\', whether of bourgeois-idealist or Marxist provenance. Indeed, if we are to follow modernisation theorists, the transformation of forms of appropriation and production began long before 1789, and capitalism in France did not prevail either in 1789 or 1799. This is also the framework in which René Sédillot maintains, in his account of the Revolution in terms of profit and loss,7 that the only kind of revolution that really counts is the Industrial Revolution, and, in relation to this, the French Revolution was rather an obstruction. This application of bookkeeping to the Revolution - instructive and useful as it may well be in certain details - still operates on that historical residue that survives here and there in French historiography as the ‘birth of the French nation\' and of ‘bourgeois society\', and whose abolition was made so much harder by the social interpretation. It seems that angry destruction of this residue is needed before such simple questions as that of the actual changes in administrative practice can be raised. The Revolution also used to serve in a sense as a definition of the ancien régime, not just the way in which the peasants were exploited, but also the way in which the king ruled. The immense progress that has been made in recent decades in investigation of the ancien régime is one of the side-effects of the dissolution of the established \'truths\' of revolutionary scholarship. Another such effect is the Marxist debate over historical categories. Since the application of a de-historicised model of \'bourgeois revolution\' to the events in France towards the end of the eighteenth century made the errors and weaknesses of such categories unavoidable, the critique of the \'social interpretation\' of the French Revolution also offered the opportunity to elabo-rate theoretical concepts for historical-materialist analysis. It is no accident that the clearest critique of the theoretical foundations of the \'social interpre-tation\' of the French Revolution has been provided by a Marxist.8 a. The rise of a revolutionary public Political events that lead to the collapse of a system of rule never come about without good reason. But reasons alone, no matter how pertinent they may be, cannot explain why, at a certain point in time, many people behave in such a way that the old forms of rule can no longer survive. Historians who are aware of this therefore generally combine analysis of structural preconditions for revolution with narrative. Such depictions of revolution have their convincing effect because in the \'drama of revolution\' (Giddens) years and decades are as it were compressed into days and weeks. Events follow on one another blow upon blow, so the impression is given that a dynamic of revolution develops out of them alone. In actual fact, however, all that happens in this way is that the finalistic teleology of an \'intensifying crisis\' - retrospective signs of which are always to be found - is replaced by the apparent causality of chronology. The \'straight history\' that Betty Behrens recommends for the historiography of revolutions,9 gives no answer as to why time suddenly condenses, and events occur that draw one after the other. If a revolution actually develops from the ‘good reasons\' that underlie it, a specific structure is needed: a revolutionary public. Before a situation arises in which this public claims to serve as the instance by which rule has to be legiti-mised (irrespective of the existing structures of legality), very many people must first have had the courage to act and think in this way. Motivations of this kind are constituted not individually or en famille, but only in a common experience. The drama of a revolution does not come into being simply because people act out with and against one another the interests that they have long already had, but only by some or many of them rising ‘above them-selves\' for a short while, i.e. above their former view of the world and their former interests. The question of the structural preconditions for a revolution is thus only incompletely formulated as long as it does not include the question of the preconditions for the rise of a revolutionary public. This is already to say that even the very course of the revolution does not simply arise from previously existing interests - such as might be deducible for individuals by an analysis of their means (Soboul\'s view).10 It arises, rather, from behavioural motivations that are constituted in connection with specific forms of the public sphere. If a bourgeois society is to emerge from the form of rule of the ancien régime, this requires abolishing not only the legitimacy of noble privileges, but also that of demands of spontaneous manifestation, in other words, an end to the form of motion of the revolution. In the following section we shall sketch out not the full history of the French Revolution, but only this structural change: the rise, change and abolition of a revolutionary public. The revolutionary public of summer 1789 was not the culmination of a long-standing criticism of rule that then expanded qualitatively, but rather a result of the fact that there was not that kind of public in France until 1787, at least not as an element that regular forms of ruling practice had been developed to deal with. It goes without saying that the French crown, just like any other generalised power under the ancien régime, had to take into account opposition tendencies and regular resistance. But, from the start of the seventeenth century, this happened increasingly less in forms of an established public. The crown\'s most important sources of information about the actual state of the country, about popular moods and resistances, were not assemblies, but rather the intendants and parlements. No états généraux had been convened since 1614, and, from the end of the seventeenth century, sessions of the provincial estates came to an end in one pays d\'état after another. After the 1720s, there were no longer any official assemblies of the nobility. These were still held only for the clergy, who decided on the level of their don gratuit to the crown, and on these occasions expressed either directly or - as in 1788 after the partial emancipation of the Protestants - by their refusal of the amount of tax demanded, the demands or protests of the senior clergy. Towns, corporations and provinces negotiated their privileges directly and in mutual competition. These competitive relationships to the generalised power, however, did not sum up to a comprehensive critical public.”翻译为中文","completion":"在批评的第一阶段，革命仍然是一场革命。它只是被不同地解释，要么是由于非贵族官员在社会进步努力上的挫折，要么是由于政治危机。对社会结构先决条件——因此是必然性——的内容攻击最初为政治历史的复兴铺平了道路。弗朗索瓦·富雷（François Furet）和丹尼斯·里谢（Denis Richet）在他们1965年出版的革命史中利用了这个机会，该作品在几十年中为“事件历史”重新夺回了结构史所占据的地位。虽然在这项工作中，革命的激进化仍然是用“情况”（一个常用的主题）来解释的，即革命的对手从外部和内部对法兰西共和国发动的战争，但富雷在后来的出版物中激进化了他对政治内容的解释。不再允许情况发挥这种作用。对于富雷来说，1789-91年的和平资产阶级革命现在是一个开明精英的作品，而恐怖统治证明了这个国家永远不应该落入激进分子和暴民手中。1791年之后发生的事情是革命的“脱轨”，即偏离了国家本应被规定的和平改善世界的道路。我们今天可以说，尽管这种解释领导了对社会解释的攻击，并且还提供了将长期被驱逐到大众领域的革命的轶事和传记“故事”以学术合法化的方式营销的机会，但就真正的学术辩论而言，它并不十分重要。布罗代尔（Braudel）的现代化理论版本和整个安纳尔学派对革命史学的影响远远胜过了这一点。 不是富雷的“革命脱轨”论，而是布罗代尔的长波解释模型，为寻求摆脱“社会解释”范畴的学者提供了指导线索。长波模型没有任何理论基础。它声称长期心态和日常生活形式具有特定的结构效应，经济和社会变化的共同体具有较小的结构效应，而事件的效应相对较小。这些层次之间建立了联系，但对它们的方式和形式以及在这个层次上“仅缓慢变化”的发展没有理论解释。然而，这种解释模型的一大优点是，它将革命提升到最顶层，即最不重要的层次，从而释放了革命的一部分神话和情感负担。通过这种方式，革命前后开始的长期变化进入了视野。布罗代尔关于心态连续性的概念，此外，还提出了挑战。例如，米歇尔·沃韦尔（Michel Vovelle）长时间关注的问题是，这种巨大变化是如何在宗教顺从等生活实践的缓慢变化中作为一种可能性准备的，以及随后发生的断裂导致人们在革命后的意识有何不同。因此，他展示了心态研究如何可以为社会解释提出的问题提供新的表述。近年来，一些心态学生遵循了他的领导，尽管并非所有人都这样做。 其他人则局限于缓慢发展的粗糙方面。在这方面，自阿尔弗雷德·科班以来，精英融合论贯穿了修正主义文献，并且已被盖伊·绍西南-诺加雷 (Guy Chaussinand-Nogaret) 激进到这样一种程度：据说一个显要社会不是在革命之后，而是在革命之前就出现了。因此，批评那些坚决主张封建制度在1789年8月4日至5日的夜晚在法国被废除的作者的作品，已被用来将原本构成障碍的法国革命重新纳入现代化理论。在这种情况下，革命理论的问题被简化为一个纯粹的定义问题：将多少变化描述为革命，而多少则不是？（工业革命也通常采用类似的程序。）通过这种方式，将革命作为“事件”从科学分析的领域中驱逐，并转移到“革命教义”的领域，无论是资产阶级理想主义还是马克思主义。事实上，如果我们要遵循现代化理论家的观点，那么所有权和生产的形式的转变早在1789年之前就开始了，并且资本主义在法国既没有在1789年也没有在1799年占据支配地位。这也是勒内·塞迪洛在以盈亏账的方式论述革命时坚持的框架，他认为唯一真正重要的革命是工业革命，并且就此而言，法国革命相当于是一种障碍。这种对革命进行账目处理的做法——尽管在某些细节上可能既有启发又有用处——仍然运作于在法国史学中零星存留的“法国民族诞生”和“资产阶级社会”的历史残余之上，并且由于社会解释，其废除变得更加困难。在这种情况下，对这些残余进行愤怒的摧毁似乎是提出诸如实际行政实践变化等简单问题之前所需的。革命还曾经在某种意义上用作古制度的定义，不仅是农民如何被剥削，还包括国王如何统治。近几十年来对古制度的调查取得的巨大进步是革命学术界既定“真理”解体的一个副作用之一。 另一个这样的效果是围绕历史范畴的马克思主义辩论。由于将一种去历史化的“资产阶级革命”模型应用于十八世纪末法国的事件使得这些范畴的错误和弱点无法避免，对法国革命的“社会解释”的批评也提供了为历史唯物主义分析制定理论概念的机会。最清晰地批评“社会解释”理论基础的批评恰恰是由一位马克思主义者提供的。 a. 革命公众的崛起 导致统治体系崩溃的政治事件从不无缘无故发生。但是，无论这些理由多么恰当，它们都无法解释为什么在某个特定时刻，许多人的行为方式使得旧的统治形式无法继续存活。意识到这一点的历史学家因此通常将对革命的结构先决条件的分析与叙事结合起来。这样的革命描述之所以具有说服力，是因为在“革命的戏剧”（吉登斯）中，好几年甚至几十年的时间仿佛被压缩成了几天几周。事件接连发生，给人的印象是革命的动态仅由它们自己发展而来。然而，实际上，这样的情况只不过是将“加剧的危机”的最终论替换为了时间顺序的明显因果关系。“直接历史”（贝蒂·贝伦斯推荐用于革命史学）并没有解答时间为何突然凝固，以及一个接一个的事件为何发生的问题。 如果一场革命确实是从其背后的“正当理由”中发展而来的，那么需要一个特定的结构：一个革命公众。在出现这样的情况之前，即这个公众声称要作为合法性的实体（不管现有的合法性结构如何），很多人首先必须有勇气以这种方式行动和思考。这类动机不是个体或家庭构成的，而只能在共同的经验中形成。革命的戏剧并不仅仅是因为人们按照他们长期以来已有的利益相互作用和反抗，而是由于他们中的一些人或许多人在短时间内“超越自我”，即超越了他们以前的世界观和利益。因此，只有当它同时包括对革命公众兴起先决条件的问题时，对革命的结构先决条件的问题才不会被不完整地提出。 这已经说过，革命的真正过程并不仅仅源自先前存在的利益——就像通过分析手段（索布尔的观点）可以为个体推导出的那样。它更多地源自与公共领域的特定形式相联系的行为动机。如果一个资产阶级社会要从古制度的统治形式中产生，这就要求不仅废除贵族特权的合法性，还要结束自发表现的要求，换句话说，结束革命的运动形式。在接下来的部分，我们将勾勒出法国革命的完整历史，而只是这种结构变化：革命公众的兴起、变化和废除。 1789年夏天的革命公众并不是长期批评统治的顶峰，然后定性扩大，而是因为直到1787年，法国还没有那种公众，至少不是作为官方应对的规则形式的公众。不用说，就像古制度下的任何其他普遍权力一样，法国王冠必须考虑到反对趋势和常规的抵抗。但是，从十七世纪开始，这种情况越来越少以建立的公共形式发生。王冠关于国家实际状况、民众情绪和抵抗的最重要信息来源不是议会，而是检察官和法院。自1614年以来未再召开过三级会议，而且从十七世纪末开始，各省省级议会在一个接一个的pays d\'état中停止举行。在1720年代之后，不再举行任何官方的贵族集会。只有神职人员还举行会议，他们在这些场合上决定对王冠的自愿捐赠额，并表达了高级神职人员的要求或抗议，要么是直接的，要么是像在1788年新教徒部分解放后那样，通过拒绝要求的税额。城镇、公会和省份直接并相互竞争地谈判他们的特权。然而，这些与普遍权力的竞争关系并没有加总成一个全面的批评性公众。"},{"prompt":"Following this marking criteria: 1.

Scholarly investigations reveal a multifaceted impact of video games, demonstrating notable effects on cognitive skills such as enhanced attention, problem-solving abilities, and spatial reasoning (Green & Bavelier, 2012; Ferguson, 2020). These cognitive advantages underscore the potential of video games as educational and training tools, illustrating a positive correlation between specific game genres and cognitive enhancement (Granic, Lobel, & Engels, 2014). Emotionally, video games have been implicated in mood regulation and stress reduction, offering players an escape and a medium for emotional expression (Russoniello, O\'Brien, & Parks, 2009). However, concerns about video gaming contributing to adverse outcomes, including addiction and decreased well-being, highlight the nuanced interplay between game mechanisms and psychological health (Anderson et al., 2010). Social consequences of video gaming pivot around community building and social interaction. Multiplayer online games create virtual communities, fostering socialization, and enhancing teamwork skills (Cole & Griffiths, 2007). Despite concerns over social isolation in some contexts, recent studies emphasize how gaming can facilitate social connections, arguing against the stereotype of gaming as an isolating activity (Domenico & Ryan, 2017). In synthesizing these aspects, this research employs a comprehensive review of current literature, extending beyond initial sources to include the latest studies and scholarly reviews. This approach ensures a confident handling of primary sources and a thorough investigation into the cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions of video gaming. **References** - Anderson, C.

If a bourgeois society is to emerge from the form of rule of the ancien régime, this requires abolishing not only the legitimacy of noble privileges, but also that of demands of spontaneous manifestation, in other words, an end to the form of motion of the revolution. In the following section we shall sketch out not the full history of the French Revolution, but only this structural change: the rise, change and abolition of a revolutionary public. The revolutionary public of summer 1789 was not the culmination of a long-standing criticism of rule that then expanded qualitatively, but rather a result of the fact that there was not that kind of public in France until 1787, at least not as an element that regular forms of ruling practice had been developed to deal with. It goes without saying that the French crown, just like any other generalised power under the ancien régime, had to take into account opposition tendencies and regular resistance. But, from the start of the seventeenth century, this happened increasingly less in forms of an established public. The crown\'s most important sources of information about the actual state of the country, about popular moods and resistances, were not assemblies, but rather the intendants and parlements. No états généraux had been convened since 1614, and, from the end of the seventeenth century, sessions of the provincial estates came to an end in one pays d\'état after another. After the 1720s, there were no longer any official assemblies of the nobility. These were still held only for the clergy, who decided on the level of their don gratuit to the crown, and on these occasions expressed either directly or - as in 1788 after the partial emancipation of the Protestants - by their refusal of the amount of tax demanded, the demands or protests of the senior clergy. Towns, corporations and provinces negotiated their privileges directly and in mutual competition. These competitive relationships to the generalised power, however, did not sum up to a comprehensive critical public. It is true that the struggles around Jansenism provoked a tendency critical of the ruling power with a wide reach across the kingdom, but this remained largely confined to the better-off inhabitants of the towns. The same is true of the literary public of the time. As we have already explained, this last was relatively little developed in comparison with England, since publishers of periodicals drew their profit from privilege and did not seek to reach wider circles of readers by dealing with new subjects and reducing their prices. The membership of the académies remained similarly limited, as did to a lesser extent that of the Masonic lodges. From the mid-eighteenth century, newspaper reporting began to change, along with the social composition and social forms of learned societies, and in the 1780s the system of censorship broke down. The idea became widespread among nobles, the ennobled, and wealthy or at least not actually poor non-nobles, that the world could be improved if human reason was allowed to develop without hindrance. This was the context in which a multitude of improvement proposals arose, reaching from the new methods of agricultural production through to the regulation of midwifery, and it was likewise the context of the reform plans that the crown\'s advisers developed and in part even put into practice. In the latter case, this meant the crown acting ‘tyrannically\' against all who had a share in the royal governing power. The practice of rule that historians later described as ‘enlightened absolutism\' produced as much discontent in France as it did, precisely because such enlightened absolutism was ‘more absolute\' than the non-enlightened. The immediate effect of almost all of the crown\'s reform attempts was a bitter opposition from one corporation or other of royal office-holders. During the last two centuries of the ancien régime, the political public whose demands the French crown had to deal with was above all its own government personnel. When the financial crisis reached such a level in the mid- 1780s that the previous practice of attempting reforms and then withdrawing them either entirely or in part in the face of resistance from the parlements and other corporations could no longer be continued, the crown now sought to come to terms with its regular government public by a form of representation - still in the limits of the ‘political public\' of the ancien régime - that had not been made use of since 1626. An assembly of notables was designed to give the crown support against the parlement de Paris - exiled in 1787 - and the other parlements. What the crown saw as ‘public opinion\' at this time, and consequently sought to have represented by the assembly of notables, was socially very restricted. Nonetheless, all estates and nearly all provinces were represented, in other words urban office-holders, magistrates of the royal high courts, members of the higher clergy, the higher noblesse d\'épée and the royal princes. Most of the notables came from provincial towns, and most but not all were either noble or ennobled.11 It is immaterial in the present context whether it could have been foreseen in advance that the notables could not be used for implementing the proposed reforms, and stabilising in this way the entire corrupt financial system - the structure of which had been made particularly clear by the spectacular bank-ruptcies of certain financiers. Even the resignation of Calonne, who had himself profited considerably from the existing financial system, and the appointment of Loménie de Brienne as first minister, need not be gone into here. Only two points have to be emphasised: first, that because the notables refused to act as instruments of the royal reform policy and demanded a reform of ruling practice that would involve the participation of a political public, the crown finally found itself forced to summon the états généraux - initially for 1792, then already for 1789; secondly, that the government received the agreement of the notables for the introduction of a new regional and local administration, and immediately started work on this. The introduction of provincial and municipal assemblies, and the procla-mation of the états généraux, marked the beginning of the development of that public out of which the Revolution arose. It was the French crown itself that set under way the process of constitution of a revolutionary public. This did not arise from the spread of particular demands, but rather from the linking of many particular disputes into a specific political context. From 1787, this process was regularly organised by the crown. The first step was the introduction of provincial, departmental and munici-pal assemblies in the pays d\'élection, half-heartedly and under the constraint of fiscal needs. Half-heartedly, since though representatives of the taxpayers were elected, the local seigneurs and priests were members of the municipal assemblies ex officio. Fiscally and administratively, because the new institu-tions could not even participate in the making of political decisions, but were seen as executive organs that would facilitate the operation of the intendants and make this more effective. The fact of election, however, unavoidably led to a politicisation of administrative practice, an attitude of expectancy that also spread to the pays d\'état, and led there to the recall of the états généraux being demanded - in many cases, successfully. As Rolf Reichardt has shown,12 the reform of local administration was, in many respects, constitutive for the emergence of a revolutionary public. This was firstly because many hopes were bound up with this renovation. True, in many communities scarcely anyone was seriously interested, while in others it was reported that the elections had inflamed passions.13 Reichardt cites as a typical phenomenon the expression of Abbé Périgord (later Talleyrand-Péri- gord): ‘There is nothing that the provincial assemblies can not accomplish, and there is no healing renovation that can be brought about without them\'.14 Secondly, the administrative reform promoted the rise of a revolutionary public because it very quickly emerged that there were quite considerable differences as to what kind of reform should be effected. More than a few provincial nobles saw the new arrangements as an opportunity to carve out a commanding position for themselves, after advance into high positions in the army and \'administration\' had been made much more difficult, and the respect of nobles who had nothing more to their name than their noble status had declined. A Paris police commissioner wrote in 1787 that ambitious peo-ple from the Second Estate viewed the innovation as an opportunity \'de faire enfin un personnage\'.15 According to Reichardt, there were many indications of estate conflict within the provincial assemblies, and he adds that experiences of this kind continued in the subsequent debates over the selection of delegates for the états généraux and the content of the cahiers de doléances that were to be drawn up for the king. Ultimately, the new institutions organised official advice sessions on \'public\' affairs. Even if only a few people were involved in these, a far greater number gained experience in this way of a practice that was new to them, that of formal debate. More than a few of the names that appear in 1787 as members of the departmental assemblies are later to be found among the delegates to the assemblies of baillage which appointed the delegates to the états généraux. And more than a few were among the personnel of the administrative districts created in 1790 - corresponding to the structures that in 1787 were introduced for just two years.”翻译为中文","completion":"这已经意味着革命的过程不仅仅是由先前存在的利益引起的——例如，通过分析个人的手段（索布尔的观点）可以为个人推断出来的。革命更多地是由与公共领域的特定形式相联系的行为动机所构成的。如果资产阶级社会要从旧制度的统治形式中发展出来，这就要求不仅废除贵族特权的合法性，还要废除自发表现要求的合法性，换句话说，终结革命的运动形式。在下一节中，我们将勾勒出法国革命的完整历史，而只是这一结构性变化：革命公共的兴起、变化和废除。 1789年夏天的革命公共并不是长期批评统治的高潮，然后质量上扩大，而是因为直到1787年，在法国还没有那种公共作为一个常规统治实践已经发展出来的要素。不用说，法国王冠，就像旧制度下的任何其他泛化权力一样，必须考虑到反对倾向和常规抵抗。但是，从17世纪开始，这种情况越来越少以建立的公共形式发生。关于国家实际状况、民众情绪和抵抗的最重要信息来源不是议会，而是省长和地方法院。自1614年起没有召开过三级会议，从17世纪末开始，省级议会在一个又一个的省级行政区停止举行。1720年后，不再有官方的贵族集会。这些集会仅限于神职人员，他们决定对王冠的无偿捐赠额，并在这些场合直接或间接地表达了高级神职人员的要求或抗议——就像在1788年部分解放新教徒之后那样通过拒绝要求的税额。城镇、公司和省份直接并相互竞争地谈判他们的特权。然而，这些与泛化权力的竞争关系，并没有构成一个全面的批评性公共。 真的是，围绕耶ansen主义的斗争在王国内激起了一种批判统治权力的倾向，但这主要局限于城镇里较富有的居民中。时代的文学公共也是如此。正如我们已经解释过的，与英国相比，这一后者相对较少发展，因为期刊出版商从特权中获利，并没有通过处理新话题和降低价格来吸引更广泛的读者圈。学术团体的成员资格同样受到限制，马sonic公会也是如此，虽然程度较小。从18世纪中叶开始，随着学术社会的社会组成和社会形式的变化，报纸报道开始改变，并且在1780年代，审查制度崩溃了。贵族、新贵族以及富裕或至少不是贫穷的非贵族之间，普遍认为如果人类理性能够不受阻碍地发展，则世界可以变得更好。这就是许多改进提案产生的背景，从新的农业生产方法到助产法规的制定，并且同样是王冠顾问们开发甚至部分实施的改革计划的背景。在后一种情况下，这意味着王冠‘专制地’反对所有拥有王权的分子。历史学家后来描述的所谓“启蒙绝对主义”的统治实践在法国引发的不满就如同它在其他地方一样，准确地说，因为这样的启蒙绝对主义比非启蒙的“更绝对”。王冠几乎所有改革尝试的直接效果是皇室办公室持有者的某个公司的激烈反对。 在旧制度的最后两个世纪，法国王冠不得不处理的政治公共主要是其自身的政府人员。当财政危机在1780年代中期达到了这样的水平，以至于之前尝试改革然后在面对地方法院和其他公司的抵抗时要么完全要么部分撤回的做法无法继续时，王冠现在寻求通过一种自1626年起就未使用过的代表形式——仍在旧制度的‘政治公共’限制内——与其常规政府公共达成协议。旨在找到一个议会给予王冠支持对抗巴黎地方法院——在1787年被流放——和其他地方法院的贵族大会就此而设计。此时，王冠视为‘公众舆论’的东西，在社会上非常有限。尽管如此，所有阶层和几乎所有省份都得到了代表，换句话说，城市官员、皇家高等法院的法官、高级神职人员、高级贵族和皇家亲王。大多数显贵来自省级城市，大多数但并非全部是贵族或封爵者。 在目前的背景下，显贵是否可以用来实施拟议的改革，并以这种方式稳定整个腐败的财政体系——其结构由某些金融家的惊人破产特别清楚地揭示出来——是无关紧要的。甚至不需要讨论卡隆的辞职，他本人从现有的金融体系中获利颇丰，以及洛梅尼·德·布里恩被任命为首席大臣的事情。只需强调两点：首先，因为显贵们拒绝作为王室改革政策的工具，并要求参与政治公共的统治实践改革，王冠最终发现自己被迫召集三级会议——最初定于1792年，然后已经定于1789年；其次，政府获得了显贵们对引入新的地区和地方行政的同意，并立即开始了这项工作。 省级和市级议会的引入，以及三级会议的宣布，标志着那个革命起源的公共发展的开始。正是法国王冠本身启动了构建革命公共的过程。这并不是由特定要求的传播引起的，而是由许多特定争议链接到一个特定的政治背景中。从1787年开始，这一进程由王冠定期组织。 第一步是在选区国家引入省级、部门级和市级议会，在财政需要的压力下半心半意地进行。半心半意，因为尽管纳税人的代表被选举出来，地方领主和牧师则是市政议会的成员。在财政和行政上，因为新机构甚至不能参与政治决策的制定，但被视为会促进省长运作并使其更有效的执行机构。然而，选举的事实不可避免地导致了行政实践的政治化，这种期待态度也蔓延到了选区国家，并在那里要求召回三级会议——在许多情况下，成功地。 正如罗尔夫·赖夏特所展示的，地方行政改革在许多方面是构建革命公共的基础。首先是因为许多希望与这次创新联系在一起。事实上，在许多社区几乎没有人真正感兴趣，而在其他社区则报告说选举激发了激情。赖夏特引用了阿贝·佩里戈尔（后来的塔雷朗-佩里戈尔）的典型现象：“省级议会无所不能，没有它们就无法实现任何治愈性的更新”。其次，行政改革促进了革命公共的崛起，因为很快就出现了关于应该实施何种改革的相当大的分歧。不少省级贵族将新安排视为为自己争取一个指挥地位的机会，在军队和\'行政\'中晋升到高职位变得更加困难，而仅仅以贵族身份为荣的贵族的尊重已经下降。一位巴黎警察局长在1787年写道，有抱负的第二等级的人看到这项创新是一个机会，\'最终成为一个角色\'。据赖夏特说，有许多迹象表明省级议会内部存在阶层冲突，他补充说，这种类似的经历在随后的为三级会议选举代表以及为国王制定的抱怨册内容的辩论中继续存在。最终，新机构组织了有关\'公共\'事务的官方咨询会议。即使只有少数人参与其中，更多的人通过这种方式获得了对他们而言新的实践经验，即正式辩论的实践。1787年作为部门议会成员出现的不少名字，后来在为三级会议任命代表的地方法院议会中找到，而且不少人在1790年创建的行政区中担任员工——对应于1787年为两年引入的结构。"},{"prompt":"Quels sont les contributions de Michael SADLER dans l\'émergence de l\'éducation comparée ?","completion":"Michael Sadler a joué un rôle important dans l\'émergence de l\'éducation comparée en tant que domaine d\'étude académique distinct.

However, I can provide some insights based on the consistent evolution and aims of the YOLO architecture developed by Ultralytics, which has been at the forefront of pushing the capability of real-time object detection systems. YOLO architectures, including versions leading up to and including hypothetical features we might expect from a YOLOv8, typically focus on the following improvements or features: 1. **Speed and Accuracy**: Each version of YOLO aims to balance the trade-off between speed (how fast the model can perform detection in FPS, or Frames Per Second) and accuracy (how well the model detects objects). A newer version like YOLOv8 would likely aim to push the limits on both fronts, possibly leveraging more efficient backbone networks, better feature integration methods, or novel training techniques. 2. **Enhanced Backbone Networks**: The backbone is the part of the network responsible for feature extraction. YOLOv8 would likely incorporate an even more powerful and efficient backbone network, possibly integrating advancements in neural architecture search (NAS) or custom designs optimized for speed and feature learning. 3. **Improved Object Detection Mechanisms**: This could include better mechanisms for dealing with small objects, overlapping objects, and objects at various scales. Techniques such as better anchor box optimization, spatial pyramid pooling, or enhanced feature aggregation could be employed. 4. **Advanced Training Strategies**: Enhanced versions often utilize novel or improved training strategies such as automatic label smoothing, more effective data augmentation, advanced loss functions to handle class imbalance, and techniques to mitigate overfitting to improve the generalization of the model on unseen data. 5. **Cross-Platform Optimization**: Given the proliferation of edge devices and the need for real-time processing in various conditions, YOLOv8 would likely emphasize optimizations that make it more deployable across different platforms (CPUs, GPUs, and mobile devices) without significant loss in performance. This could include improved model quantization and pruning techniques. 6. **Integration with AI Frameworks**: Ease of use and integration with popular deep learning frameworks and ecosystems (like PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.) are typical focuses. Enhancements might include simplified APIs, better pre-trained models, and more extensive documentation and community resources. 7. **Robustness and Generalization**: Enhancements to model robustness, i.e., its ability to handle diverse and challenging real-world conditions (different lighting conditions, occlusions, etc.), and to generalize well across different datasets and domains. Since the specifics for YOLOv8 from Ultralytics might not be directly available or might evolve, for the latest and most accurate details, visiting the official Ultralytics website or their GitHub repository would provide the most up-to-date information.

In an undirected simple graph (no loops, no multiple edges), the maximum number of edges a vertex can have is with every other vertex in the graph. If there are (n) vertices in the graph, then any given vertex can at most have edges to the other (n-1) vertices, making the adjacency list for that vertex of size (n-1). This is because an adjacency list for a vertex contains all the vertices it\'s directly connected to by an edge. Since a simple graph does not allow a vertex to have an edge to itself (no loop) and does not allow multiple edges between the same two vertices, the maximum number of neighbors (and hence the maximum size of the adjacency list) for a vertex is (n-1), where (n) is the total number of vertices in the graph."},{"prompt":"The BFS shortest distance application finds the shortest distance between any pair of vertices. 1.

For finding the shortest distances between every pair of vertices, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm or Dijkstra\'s algorithm applied from each vertex is generally used."},{"prompt":"The BFS shortest distance application finds the shortest distance between any pair of vertices.","completion":"The BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm is indeed widely used to find the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph or a graph where all edges have the same weight. When using BFS for this purpose, the algorithm explores the graph layer by layer, moving from a selected source vertex to all reachable vertices in the graph. It calculates the shortest distances in terms of the number of edges that must be traversed to reach a vertex from the source. # How BFS Works for Finding Shortest Paths 1. **Start from the Source Vertex**: Initialize the process from the source vertex and consider it at level 0 or distance 0. 2. **Queue Initialization**: BFS uses a queue to maintain the vertices to be visited. Initially, the queue contains just the source vertex. 3. **Exploration of Neighbors**: Remove a vertex from the queue and explore all its adjacent vertices. For any adjacent vertex that has not been visited yet, mark it as visited, update its distance from the source, and add it to the queue. 4. **Repeat Until Queue is Empty**: Continue the process until the queue becomes empty. As BFS ensures that you visit vertices by increasing distance from the source, once you\'ve visited a vertex, you\'ve found the shortest path to it. 5. **Result**: The result is a tree structure (part of the graph) rooted at the source vertex, where the path following the tree edges from the source to any other vertex is the shortest path between those vertices in the graph. # Properties Relevant to Shortest Path Finding - **Unweighted Graphs**: BFS is directly applicable and guarantees the shortest path in unweighted graphs or graphs with uniformly weighted edges. - **Edge Weights**: For graphs with varying edge weights, BFS alone is not suitable. Algorithms like Dijkstra\'s or the A* search algorithm are better suited for such cases. - **Directed and Undirected Graphs**: BFS works for both directed and undirected graphs. - **Connectivity and Components**: Besides finding the shortest path, BFS can also tell if the graph is connected if used from each vertex, or identify connected components within the graph. # Complexity The time complexity of BFS is O(V + E) for a graph represented using an adjacency list, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This makes BFS quite efficient for sparse graphs. In summary, BFS is a foundational method for shortest path finding in unweighted graphs, useful both for its efficiency and for its straightforward implementation."},{"prompt":"If A is an n x n matrix representing an undirected graph then A[i,j] = A[j,i] for every i and j. 1.

They would dare to harbor our princess... or worse?\\" A murmur swept through the chamber, as lords and nobles exchanged wary glances. The very idea that Lemuria, with its towering megafloats and advanced weaponry, might challenge the magic-steeped might of Batlantis was blasphemy. \\"Empress, we must consider the possibility of subterfuge,\\" suggested Lord Valtin, his eyes narrowing. \\"Could this not be a ruse by Lemuria to draw us into conflict?\\" \\"Or a diversion,\\" added Lady Serevia, her voice laced with disdain. \\"While our focus shifts to retrieving the princess, Lemuria could seize the opportunity to further their advancements.\\" Silence fell, as all present pondered the implications. The deteriorating situation on Atlantis, with the Genesis device\'s failing systems turning their once-lush world into a desert, was a closely guarded secret.

Lemuria, with its cutting-edge exoskeletons and drone fleets, had always prided itself on its defensive capabilities. But Batlantis, with its blend of magic and ancient technology, was an unknown variable. \\"We must enhance our defensive postures,\\" Kaiden decided, his voice firm. \\"Activate all megafloat defenses and prepare the Heart Hybrid Gear units. If Batlantis seeks war, they will find Lemuria ready.\\" --- **Chapter 3: The Clash of Worlds** As dawn broke over the dimensional pathway between Atlantis and Lemuria, the air shimmered with the energy of opening gates. The Imperial Batlanis Armed Forces, garbed in their Heart Hybrid Gear armors, stood ready, their expressions a mix of resolve and anticipation. Leading them was Empress Lysia herself, adorned in her regal armor, the gleam of determination in her eyes. \\"For the glory of Batlantis, and for the safe return of our Princess, we march!\\" With a mighty roar, the armored brigades and magical fleets surged forward, crossing the dimensional threshold into Lemuria. The Lemurian defenses sprang to life, megafloats mobilizing into defensive formations as drones and exoskeleton units took to the skies.

Thus, a Hamiltonian path is not a spanning tree, but understanding each concept will clarify their differences. 1. **Hamiltonian Path**: A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. If such a path exists, the graph is said to have a Hamiltonian path. If the path starts and ends at the same vertex, visiting all other vertices exactly once, it is called a Hamiltonian circuit or cycle. 2. **Spanning Tree**: A spanning tree of a graph is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph, is a tree (meaning it has no cycles), and connects all the vertices together with the minimum possible number of edges. In other words, a spanning tree \\"spans\\" the graph it comes from, reaching all vertices without creating any loops and using the fewest edges possible to maintain connectivity. Every connected graph has at least one spanning tree, and it is possible for a graph to have many different spanning trees. **Key Differences**: - **Connectivity and Cycles**: A Hamiltonian path does not necessarily connect all vertices with the minimum number of edges and is more about traversing each vertex exactly once regardless of the total edge count. A spanning tree is explicitly about connecting all vertices with the fewest edges possible, ensuring there are no cycles. - **Purpose**: Hamiltonian paths are about finding a path that visits every vertex once, which can be significant in problems like the traveling salesman problem (where the goal is to find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle). Spanning trees are crucial for creating efficient networks, like electrical grids or computer networks, where the goal is to connect several points in the most efficient (least cost) way possible without creating loops. - **Existence**: Not all graphs have a Hamiltonian path, as the existence depends on the graph\'s structure. However, every connected, undirected graph has at least one spanning tree. So, while both are fundamental concepts in graph theory with applications in various fields, they serve different purposes and are characterized by distinct properties and goals."},{"prompt":"请将“The revolutionary public of summer 1789 was not the culmination of a long-standing criticism of rule that then expanded qualitatively, but rather a result of the fact that there was not that kind of public in France until 1787, at least not as an element that regular forms of ruling practice had been developed to deal with. It goes without saying that the French crown, just like any other generalised power under the ancien régime, had to take into account opposition tendencies and regular resistance. But, from the start of the seventeenth century, this happened increasingly less in forms of an established public. The crown\'s most important sources of information about the actual state of the country, about popular moods and resistances, were not assemblies, but rather the intendants and parlements. No états généraux had been convened since 1614, and, from the end of the seventeenth century, sessions of the provincial estates came to an end in one pays d\'état after another. After the 1720s, there were no longer any official assemblies of the nobility. These were still held only for the clergy, who decided on the level of their don gratuit to the crown, and on these occasions expressed either directly or - as in 1788 after the partial emancipation of the Protestants - by their refusal of the amount of tax demanded, the demands or protests of the senior clergy. Towns, corporations and provinces negotiated their privileges directly and in mutual competition. These competitive relationships to the generalised power, however, did not sum up to a comprehensive critical public. It is true that the struggles around Jansenism provoked a tendency critical of the ruling power with a wide reach across the kingdom, but this remained largely confined to the better-off inhabitants of the towns. The same is true of the literary public of the time. As we have already explained, this last was relatively little developed in comparison with England, since publishers of periodicals drew their profit from privilege and did not seek to reach wider circles of readers by dealing with new subjects and reducing their prices. The membership of the académies remained similarly limited, as did to a lesser extent that of the Masonic lodges. From the mid-eighteenth century, newspaper reporting began to change, along with the social composition and social forms of learned societies, and in the 1780s the system of censorship broke down. The idea became widespread among nobles, the ennobled, and wealthy or at least not actually poor non-nobles, that the world could be improved if human reason was allowed to develop without hindrance. This was the context in which a multitude of improvement proposals arose, reaching from the new methods of agricultural production through to the regulation of midwifery, and it was likewise the context of the reform plans that the crown\'s advisers developed and in part even put into practice. In the latter case, this meant the crown acting ‘tyrannically\' against all who had a share in the royal governing power. The practice of rule that historians later described as ‘enlightened absolutism\' produced as much discontent in France as it did, precisely because such enlightened absolutism was ‘more absolute\' than the non-enlightened. The immediate effect of almost all of the crown\'s reform attempts was a bitter opposition from one corporation or other of royal office-holders. During the last two centuries of the ancien régime, the political public whose demands the French crown had to deal with was above all its own government personnel. When the financial crisis reached such a level in the mid- 1780s that the previous practice of attempting reforms and then withdrawing them either entirely or in part in the face of resistance from the parlements and other corporations could no longer be continued, the crown now sought to come to terms with its regular government public by a form of representation - still in the limits of the ‘political public\' of the ancien régime - that had not been made use of since 1626. An assembly of notables was designed to give the crown support against the parlement de Paris - exiled in 1787 - and the other parlements. What the crown saw as ‘public opinion\' at this time, and consequently sought to have represented by the assembly of notables, was socially very restricted. Nonetheless, all estates and nearly all provinces were represented, in other words urban office-holders, magistrates of the royal high courts, members of the higher clergy, the higher noblesse d\'épée and the royal princes. Most of the notables came from provincial towns, and most but not all were either noble or ennobled.11 It is immaterial in the present context whether it could have been foreseen in advance that the notables could not be used for implementing the proposed reforms, and stabilising in this way the entire corrupt financial system - the structure of which had been made particularly clear by the spectacular bank-ruptcies of certain financiers. Even the resignation of Calonne, who had himself profited considerably from the existing financial system, and the appointment of Loménie de Brienne as first minister, need not be gone into here. Only two points have to be emphasised: first, that because the notables refused to act as instruments of the royal reform policy and demanded a reform of ruling practice that would involve the participation of a political public, the crown finally found itself forced to summon the états généraux - initially for 1792, then already for 1789; secondly, that the government received the agreement of the notables for the introduction of a new regional and local administration, and immediately started work on this. The introduction of provincial and municipal assemblies, and the procla-mation of the états généraux, marked the beginning of the development of that public out of which the Revolution arose. It was the French crown itself that set under way the process of constitution of a revolutionary public. This did not arise from the spread of particular demands, but rather from the linking of many particular disputes into a specific political context. From 1787, this process was regularly organised by the crown. The first step was the introduction of provincial, departmental and munici-pal assemblies in the pays d\'élection, half-heartedly and under the constraint of fiscal needs. Half-heartedly, since though representatives of the taxpayers were elected, the local seigneurs and priests were members of the municipal assemblies ex officio. Fiscally and administratively, because the new institu-tions could not even participate in the making of political decisions, but were seen as executive organs that would facilitate the operation of the intendants and make this more effective. The fact of election, however, unavoidably led to a politicisation of administrative practice, an attitude of expectancy that also spread to the pays d\'état, and led there to the recall of the états généraux being demanded - in many cases, successfully. As Rolf Reichardt has shown,12 the reform of local administration was, in many respects, constitutive for the emergence of a revolutionary public. This was firstly because many hopes were bound up with this renovation. True, in many communities scarcely anyone was seriously interested, while in others it was reported that the elections had inflamed passions.13 Reichardt cites as a typical phenomenon the expression of Abbé Périgord (later Talleyrand-Péri- gord): ‘There is nothing that the provincial assemblies can not accomplish, and there is no healing renovation that can be brought about without them\'.14 Secondly, the administrative reform promoted the rise of a revolutionary public because it very quickly emerged that there were quite considerable differences as to what kind of reform should be effected. More than a few provincial nobles saw the new arrangements as an opportunity to carve out a commanding position for themselves, after advance into high positions in the army and \'administration\' had been made much more difficult, and the respect of nobles who had nothing more to their name than their noble status had declined. A Paris police commissioner wrote in 1787 that ambitious peo-ple from the Second Estate viewed the innovation as an opportunity \'de faire enfin un personnage\'.15 According to Reichardt, there were many indications of estate conflict within the provincial assemblies, and he adds that experiences of this kind continued in the subsequent debates over the selection of delegates for the états généraux and the content of the cahiers de doléances that were to be drawn up for the king. Ultimately, the new institutions organised official advice sessions on \'public\' affairs. Even if only a few people were involved in these, a far greater number gained experience in this way of a practice that was new to them, that of formal debate. More than a few of the names that appear in 1787 as members of the departmental assemblies are later to be found among the delegates to the assemblies of baillage which appointed the delegates to the états généraux. And more than a few were among the personnel of the administrative districts created in 1790 - corresponding to the structures that in 1787 were introduced for just two years.”翻译为中文","completion":"1789年夏天的革命性公众并不是长期存在的批评统治然后在质量上扩展的高潮，而是因为直到至少1787年，法国没有那种公众，至少不是作为一种常规统治实践已经发展出来处理的元素。不用说，法国王室，就像其他任何旧制度下的泛化权力一样，必须考虑到反对趋势和常规抵抗。但是，从17世纪开始，这种情况以一种建立的公众形式越来越少地发生。国王关于国家的实际状况、民众情绪和抵抗的最重要信息来源不是议会，而是总督和国会。自1614年以来，没有召开过三级会议，而从17世纪末起，省级三级会议在一个又一个的省级国家中结束。在1720年代之后，贵族的官方集会不再存在。只有对于神职人员，他们为国王决定他们的无偿捐赠水平，在这些场合上，他们直接或者——就像在1788年新教徒部分获得解放后那样——通过拒绝要求的税额，表达高级神职人员的需求或抗议。城镇、公司和省份直接并相互竞争地谈判他们的特权。然而，这些与泛化权力的竞争关系，并没有总结为一个全面的批评性公众。 诚然，围绕耶ansen主义的斗争激发了一种批判统治权力的趋势，这在王国内部有广泛的影响，但这主要局限于城镇中较富裕的居民。关于当时的文学公众也是如此。正如我们已经解释的，与英国相比，这最后一点发展相对较少，因为期刊的出版商从特权中获得利润，而不是通过处理新主题和降低价格来吸引更广泛的读者圈。学院的成员同样受到限制，就像共济会的成员在某种程度上也是如此。从18世纪中叶开始，报纸报道开始改变，学习社会的社会组成和社会形式也随之改变，并且在1780年代，审查制度崩溃了。贵族、赋予爵位的人以及富裕或至少不贫穷的非贵族之间，普遍传播一种观念：如果允许人类理性无障碍地发展，世界就可以得到改善。这是各种改进提案出现的背景，从农业生产的新方法到助产的规范，并且同样是皇家顾问们制定并部分实践的改革计划的背景。在后一种情况中，这意味着国王“专制地”对所有有份参与皇家统治权力的人行动。历史学家后来描述的“启蒙绝对主义”统治实践正是因为这种启蒙绝对主义比非启蒙的“更绝对”，而在法国产生了和其他地方一样多的不满。国王改革尝试的直接效果，几乎在所有情况下都是一方或另一方的皇家办公人员的强烈反对。 在旧制度的最后两个世纪中，法国王室必须处理的政治公众首先是其自身的政府人员。当财政危机在1780年代中期达到这样的水平，使得之前尝试改革然后在国会和其他团体抵抗面前全面或部分撤回的做法无法继续时，王室现在寻求通过一种代表形式——仍在旧制度的“政治公众”范围内——来达成协议，自1626年以来未曾使用过。一个旨在获得对抗巴黎国会——1787年被放逐——和其他国会支持的贵族集会被设计出来。这个时期，王室将其视为“公共舆论”的东西，因此试图通过贵族集会代表，社会上非常受限。尽管如此，所有阶层几乎所有省份都有代表，换句话说，城市办公人员、皇家高等法院的法官、高级神职人员、高级剑阶贵族和皇家亲王。大多数贵族来自省级城镇，大多数但不全都是贵族或被封爵。 在目前的语境下，是否可以预先预见到贵族不能被用来实施拟议的改革，并以这种方式稳定整个腐败的金融系统——其结构已经通过某些金融家的引人注目的破产清晰地展示出来——这一点并不重要。甚至不需要深入讨论卡隆辞职的事实，他自己从现有的金融体系中获利相当多，以及指派洛梅尼·德·布里安作为首相。只需强调两点：首先，因为贵族拒绝作为皇家改革政策的工具并要求改革统治实践，以涉及政治公众的参与，最终王室发现自己被迫召集三级会议——最初定于1792年，然后已经为1789年；其次，政府获得了贵族对引入新的地区和地方管理的同意，并立即开始了这项工作。 引入省级和市级议会，以及三级会议的宣布，标志着那个革命公众发展的开始，革命即从此公众中产生。正是法国王室本身启动了革命公众形成的过程。这并非源于特定要求的传播，而是源于将许多特定争议联系到一个特定的政治背景中。从1787年开始，这个过程由王室定期组织。 第一步是在选举国引入省级、部门和市级议会，在财政需求的压力下半心半意地进行。半心半意，因为尽管选出了纳税人的代表，但地方领主和神职人员却是市级议会的成员。在财政和行政上，因为新机构甚至不能参与政治决策的制定，而被视为将会促进总督工作并使之更有效的执行机构。然而，选举的事实不可避免地导致了行政实践的政治化，这种期待态度也传播到了省级国家，并在那里导致了成功要求召回三级会议的情况。 正如罗尔夫·赖哈德特(Rolf Reichardt)所示，地方行政改革在许多方面是革命性公众出现的构成因素。这首先是因为许多希望与这一创新联系在一起。诚然，在许多社区几乎没有人真正感兴趣，而在其他社区则报道说选举激起了激情。赖哈德特援引了阿贝·佩里戈尔（后来的塔列朗-佩里戈尔）的一种典型现象：“省级议会无所不能完成，没有他们就无法实现任何治愈性的改革”。其次，行政改革促进了革命性公众的兴起，因为很快就出现了关于应该进行何种改革的相当大的分歧。不少省级贵族将新安排视为为自己争取统治地位的机会，毕竟晋升到军队和行政部门的高职位已变得更加困难，而那些除了贵族身份外什么都没有的贵族的尊重已经下降。一个巴黎警察局长在1787年写道，来自第二等级的雄心勃勃的人将这一创新视为一个“终于能够成为一个人物”的机会。根据赖哈德特的说法，省级议会内部的阶级冲突有很多迹象，他补充说，在随后为国王准备的苦情书中选出代表和讨论内容的辩论中，继续出现了这种经验。最终，新机构组织了官方的“公共”事务咨询会议。即使只有少数人参与其中，但更多的人通过这种方式获得了一种对他们来说新的实践经验，即正式辩论。不少在1787年作为部门议会成员出现的名字，后来被发现在为三级会议指派代表的议会中，以及在1790年创建的行政区中，对应于1787年仅引入了两年的结构。"},{"prompt":"请将“On 8 August 1788, Loménie announced the convocation of the états généraux for 1 May 1789. The news took a while to spread in the conditions of the time, but by winter it had come to the ears of the peasants, who in many parts of the country rebelled against their living conditions. The winter of 1788-9 brought dire distress to very many French people. The early months of 1788 had been dry, then in July and August continuous rain had rotted the meagre grain crop before the harvest. The winter that followed was very cold. In many districts, the winegrowers lost three-quarters of their vines. Collective peasant actions became widespread from the end of the year. In several places, there was just a refusal to pay tax, but elsewhere hedges were torn down, mills and ovens destroyed, and landlords threatened. Even so, none of this was entirely new. What was new in the winter of 1788-9 was that this coincided with the announcement of the états généraux and with it the hope for possible improvement in conditions of life. This situation made the actions into forms of expression of a public that was more than local in scale, and it was seen as such by the lords as well as the peasants. The agricultural crisis did not just affect the peasants, it raised the price of bread and subsequently had an effect also on the employment of artisans. Because the cold winter of 1787-8 had damaged almost all the mulberry trees in Italy, the French silk-weavers had no more work in the summer of 1788. In Lyon alone, 22,000 were unemployed. By the following winter, the crisis had reached almost all branches of production apart from luxury goods. A campaign for \'doubling\' steadily developed. In August, the parlement de Paris had announced that the états généraux would be convened according to the procedure applied in 1614-15. According to this, each estate would be equally represented, the estates would debate separately, and a single cahier de doléances would be compiled on the basis of the complaint books forwarded to them by the provincial assemblies. This cahier would then be sent to the king, who for his part would respond after the sessions ended - if, indeed, he responded at all. In autumn the demand arose that the immensely greater number who belonged to the Third Estate should be represented by at least a double number of delegates. Especially active in this campaign from November on was a political association known as the \'Committee of Thirty\', though it very soon had more members than that. Similar debating circles also emerged in other towns, but the Paris circle not only included members of all three estates, but even some great nobles who were critical of the government. The Committee used the wealth and influence of its members, published and distributed a whole flood of propaganda material, and petitioned the parlement. The petition was banned, along with the further distribution of pamphlets, but at the end of December 1788 the royal council agreed to the doubling, following unrest in Paris - according to Jean Michaud16 - and in January corresponding election procedures were announced. The demand for double representation of the Third Estate did not put in question the existence of the estates as such. It was simply a demand for reform. But it created none the less a political climate in which the text of Sieyès that was written as part of the campaign, though published only after its conclusion, very rapidly found an immense distribution. To the question he posed, \'What is the Third Estate?\' the author answered, with propagandist effectiveness: \'Everything.\'17 In the year of its appearance, Sieyès\'s text already went through four editions. Early in 1789, the political public was decisively expanded, both geographi-cally and socially, by the assemblies that the crown convened to prepare for the états généraux. The privileged estates continued to meet separately for these baillages, to appoint their delegates to the états généraux and write up their doléances. Two things, however, were now apparent: that the members of the lower clergy were not prepared simply to accept their superiors as repre-sentatives - which Rolf Reichardt18 sees as possibly a result of the experience of forms of representation in the provincial assemblies - and that both the First and Second Estates, besides doléances, the stubborn arrogance of which was shortly to be ascribed the rubric \'feudalism\', also formulated demands indicating that there was a considerable basis for the strategies of rectification and rationalisation of rule in which the crown, even by pursuing them half-heartedly, had already come up against the structures of its own ruling apparatus. The nobility could see no society without privileges, but many nobles were ready to renounce certain of their privileges that stood in flagrant contradiction with the changed norms, or brought more hostility than direct advantage.19 There were different modes of procedure for the Third Estate. Besides the special regulations for Paris - where suffrage was on the basis of possession of either an office or a master\'s credentials, or else a capitation tax assessment of at least 6 livres - there was a combination of corporate and numerical rules, and a system of election and debate with either two levels or even three (where several baillages were combined). Apart from in Paris, all free male taxpayers were admitted to the local assemblies. About a third of those allowed actually did attend.20 The elections to the lower assemblies were held publicly, but secret ballots were held for election of the deputies to Versailles. A good half of the rural lower assemblies were led by local judges who exercised seigneurial jurisdiction, or else by royal officials. This was expressed in the formulations of the doléances as well as in the fact that many of those attending profited materially from seigneurial privileges. In some cases, prepared cahiers de doléances were distributed to the assemblies, in other cases, some of those present felt moved to subsequently compile additional cahiers of their own. In the election of deputies in the baillage assemblies, the better- off and more educated had greater weight. In their compilation of the general cahiers, many grievances of the local peasants fell by the wayside. The assembly of the sénéchaussée Villefranche-de-Rouergue, for example, refused to transmit a grievance about the milling monopoly. Rights of this kind, so the delegates from the villages were instructed, were not a matter of privilege but of property, and property had to be respected no matter who owned it.21 Even so, half of the general cahiers demanded the abolition of seigneurial jurisdiction, and over half of them the abolition of seigneurial taxes.22 It has been contested whether these and similar demands heralded the events of the following summer, after George V. Taylor published in 1972 his contention that the cahiers did not have any kind of revolutionary character, since even Enlightenment ideas are hardly present in them. We need not go into this debate here. The public that produced these cahiers, however, was no longer that of the ancien régime. And this was so for reasons based in the specific structure of the ancien régime in France - I return here to the historical dialectic with which I began this chapter. One can scarcely imagine that an English peasant in the late eighteenth century would be unaware what a petition to Parliament meant. But, in France in 1789, it is recorded in many districts that peasants thought that simply recording their grievances in the cahier meant that these would automatically be remedied. They went home believing that they were already free of seigneurial taxes, nobles\' hunting rights, and other exactions. They behaved accordingly until they were instructed differently. It was unclear to many that this was supposed to be no more than a survey of opinion. After all, in living memory there had never been a king who wanted to know what most oppressed ordinary people. How could they assume that this great exercise would not have far-reaching results? Taylor23 and Furet24 have already noted how the stage structure of the assemblies operated as a ‘revolutionary seminar\' for the delegates who were eventually sent to Versailles. For an interpretation that would understand the events of summer and autumn 1789 as the work of a peaceful and educated élite, the preparation of the états généraux plays a particularly significant role, though this is not to be gainsaid even in the context of a different interpretation. It should be borne in mind, however, as Ran Halévie points out,25 that around three-quarters of the delegates of the Third Estate did not take part in elaborating the new constitution and new administrative structures when the états généraux was converted into the Constituent Assembly. Halévie assumes that they were appointed because the decisions of the baillage assemblies still expressed the clientele structure of the ancien régime. Yet Halévie himself emphasises the break that this public made with the established structures of the ancien régime. Thus it was individuals that were elected - sometimes after debate! - rather than corporations, and not even the spokesmen of factions; factions relating to the practice of generalised rule were unknown in France, precisely because there were no structures of regular public participation in this practice. Those who stood for election, or at least some of them, represented views that had long been expressed in reading societies or other debating circles, and found broad distribution in the publications of 1788-9. To many of these deputies, moreover, it must have seemed nonsensical that, after all this expenditure, they were simply to be sent to Versailles on the basis of traditional mandates - as \'emissaries\' - and then to return home. After all these great words, they were to be returned to the situation of 1615, and after such a festive detour, spend their time in Versailles debating on what points the king could most humbly be beseeched.”翻译为中文","completion":"1788年8月8日，洛梅尼宣布召集三级会议于1789年5月1日。这一消息传播需要一段时间，在当时的条件下，但到了冬天，这消息已经传到了农民的耳朵里，他们在许多地区反抗他们的生活条件。1788-1789年冬天给许多法国人带来了极大的困苦。1788年初几个月干旱，然后7月和8月持续的雨水在收获前腐烂了稀少的谷物作物。接下来的冬天非常寒冷。在许多地区，葡萄种植者失去了四分之三的葡萄藤。从年底开始，集体农民行动变得普遍。在一些地方，仅仅是拒绝缴税，但在其他地方，树篱被拆除，磨坊和烤炉被摧毁，地主受到威胁。即便如此，这些都不是完全新鲜的事。1788-1789年冬季的新情况是，这与三级会议的宣布同时发生，伴随着生活条件可能改善的希望。这种情况使行动成为了一种超越当地规模的公众形式的表达，而且被领主和农民都这么看待。 农业危机不仅影响了农民，它还导致了面包价格上涨，随后也影响了手工艺人的就业。因为1787-1788年冬天的寒冷几乎破坏了意大利所有的桑树，1788年夏天法国的丝织工没有活干。仅在里昂，就有22000人失业。到了接下来的冬天，除了奢侈品外，危机几乎波及了所有生产部门。 “翻番”运动稳步发展。8月，巴黎法院宣布，三级会议将根据1614-1615年的程序召开。根据这个程序，每个等级将获得平等的代表，等级将单独"},{"prompt":"In the BFS shortest distance application, the smallest shortest distance is 1. 1.

In your scenario, it sounds like you\'re trying to capture content from a window on your desktop using FFmpeg\'s `x11grab` for X composite on Linux, but the reference to `gdigrab` and `hwnd` seems a bit mixed up, as `gdigrab` is actually a method used on Windows to capture the desktop or a window using a handle (hwnd). For Linux and X composite (which is what your question initially suggests), you\'d use `x11grab`. For capturing a window with a specific window ID on Linux, you\'d somewhat translate the HWND concept from Windows to a window ID on X11. Since there seems to be a bit of confusion between Windows and Linux methods, I\'ll provide examples for both, emphasizing a lossless capture setting with FFmpeg 7.0. # For Linux using `x11grab` To capture a specific window using `x11grab` in a lossless fashion, you first need to know the window ID or the geometry (including position and size) of the window. You can use tools like `xwininfo` to get this information. A typical FFmpeg command for lossless capture from a specific window would look like this, assuming `:0.0+10,20` is your screen and geometry: ```sh ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1024x768 -framerate 25 -i :0.0+10,20 -codec:v libx264rgb -crf 0 -preset ultrafast output.mkv ``` This command captures a 1024x768 area at coordinates 10,20 on the default screen. It uses the `libx264rgb` codec with `-crf 0` for lossless encoding, and `-preset ultrafast` for faster encoding at the cost of increased file size. Change `-video_size` and the screen position (`+10,20`) to match your target window. You might need to adjust the `-framerate` as per your requirement. # For Windows using `gdigrab` To grab a window using its handle (assuming you have the HWND), the command looks a bit different: ```sh ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 25 -i title=\\"Your Window Title\\" -codec:v libx264rgb -crf 0 -preset ultrafast output.mkv ``` Replace `\\"Your Window Title\\"` with the actual title of the window you\'re capturing. Unfortunately, FFmpeg\'s `gdigrab` doesn\'t directly use window handles (HWND), but uses the window title for identification. For lossless capture, similar encoding settings (`libx264rgb`, `-crf 0`, `-preset ultrafast`) are used. Please note, capturing with `-crf 0` produces very large files. Ensure you have enough storage space available. For extended capture sessions or if storage is a concern, consider using a near-lossless setting (e.g., `-crf 17`) or another codec. # Reminder - Adjust the `-framerate`, `-video_size`, and screen position as necessary for your specific requirements. - Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible from your command line. - The method of identifying a window (title for Windows, geometry or ID for X11/Linux) may require preparatory steps (like using `xwininfo`, `wmctrl`, or similar tools on Linux to find window dimensions and ID). The above examples assume you have a brief familiarity with terminal or command prompt usage and basic FFmpeg operation principles."},{"prompt":"how would the arg look with xwininfo on linux use a 1920x1080 example","completion":"To capture a window on Linux by using `xwininfo` to obtain window information for `ffmpeg` with a target capture size of 1920x1080, you essentially perform two steps: first, use `xwininfo` to get the information about the window, including its geometry, and then, plug that information into your `ffmpeg` command to capture the window. # Step 1: Get Window Information with `xwininfo` 1. Open a terminal. 2. Run `xwininfo`, and you will be prompted to select a window by clicking on it. ```bash xwininfo ``` 3. Click on the window you want to capture. `xwininfo` will print detailed information about the window, including its geometry. For example, you might see something like this: ``` Absolute upper-left X: 83 Absolute upper-left Y: 146 Relative upper-left X: 1 Relative upper-left Y: 23 Width: 1024 Height: 768 Depth: 24 ... ``` # Step 2: Use the Information with `ffmpeg` Assuming from the `xwininfo` output your target window starts at coordinates (83,146), and you want to capture it at full resolution (for the sake of illustration, let\'s assume your target or actual window resolution is 1920x1080, though note the example `xwininfo` only shows a window of size 1024x768). Adjust your `ffmpeg` command to something like this: ```bash ffmpeg -f x11grab -r 30 -s 1920x1080 -i :0.0+83,146 -c:v libx264rgb -crf 0 -preset ultrafast output.mkv ``` - `-r 30` specifies the frame rate. - `-s 1920x1080` specifies the capture size. - `-i :0.0+83,146` tells `ffmpeg` to capture from display `:0.0` at offset `83,146`, which corresponds to the upper-left corner of your target window. - `-c:v libx264rgb` specifies to use the `libx264rgb` codec for lossless capture. - `-crf 0` together with `libx264rgb` ensures a lossless capture. - `-preset ultrafast` is recommended to minimize the CPU time used to encode the video, at the expense of creating a bigger file size. # Important Consideration: - The window geometry (`-s 1920x1080 -i :0.0+83,146`) must accurately reflect your targeted capture size and position; adjust as necessary based on the `xwininfo` output. - Ensure the specified capture size does not exceed the actual window or screen size to avoid capturing unintended areas. Remember, capture settings (like `-r` for framerate and `-s` for size) can greatly impact the performance and file size; you might need to tweak these settings based on your actual requirements and system capabilities."},{"prompt":"what those preset placebo mean","completion":"In FFmpeg and video encoding contexts, presets are used to balance the trade-off between the amount of time and computational resources required to encode a video and the size and quality of the output file. The term \\"placebo\\" refers to one of the preset options available in encoders like x264 and x265, which are widely used for H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC video compression standards, respectively. The \\"placebo\\" preset is the most extreme in terms of encoding time and computational effort, designed to provide the best possible compression efficiency and the highest quality at the expense of significantly increased encoding time. However, the term \\"placebo\\" is aptly chosen because the practical benefits over the next fastest preset, \\"veryslow,\\" are often minimal or indistinguishable, especially when compared to the dramatic increase in encoding time. This minimal gain is why it\'s considered a \\"placebo\\" — it might make you feel better because you\'re using the most exhaustive option available, but the observable benefits are often negligible. Here\'s how you might use the \\"placebo\\" preset in an FFmpeg command: ```bash ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset placebo -crf 18 output.mp4 ``` - `-c:v libx264`: This specifies that the video codec (`-c:v`) is `libx264`, which is the encoder for the H.264 video codec. - `-preset placebo`: This applies the \\"placebo\\" preset, indicating that the encoder should use settings that aim for the highest compression efficiency, albeit with a very high computational cost. - `-crf 18`: This sets the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) to 18, which is a quality level for H.264. Lower numbers are higher quality, and 18 is considered visually \\"near lossless\\" but not as large as lossless would be. # Considerations - **Encoding Time**: If you choose the \\"placebo\\" preset, be prepared for the encoding process to take a substantial amount of time, especially on longer videos or on systems with limited processing power. - **Benefits vs. Cost**: Given the diminishing returns on quality and compression ratio when going from \\"veryslow\\" to \\"placebo,\\" it\'s generally recommended for practical purposes to use a less computationally intensive preset unless maximum compression/quality with no regard for time is an absolute requirement. - **Usage Scenario**: The \\"placebo\\" preset might be used in scenarios where the absolute best compression efficiency is needed, and encoding time is not a concern, such as archiving or when preparing a master file for storage when you\'re willing to wait for the best possible outcome. In sum, while \\"placebo\\" represents the peak of encoding effort for minimal gains beyond the \\"veryslow\\" preset, its practical application is limited and often not justified by the slight improvements it offers over faster presets."},{"prompt":"can you show this command with linux args for 2 pass encoding correct for most effecient wat if neccesary:ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1024x768 -framerate 25 -i :0.0+10,20 -codec:v libx264rgb -crf 0 -preset placebo -t 1 -pass 1 -an -f null /dev/null &&","completion":"For two-pass encoding using FFmpeg on Linux, particularly when capturing from the screen with `x11grab`, you\'re looking to balance efficiency with quality. The command you provided initiates a two-pass encoding process but targets a lossless approach (`-crf 0` with `libx264rgb`), which somewhat contradicts the typical use case for two-pass encoding where bitrate or file size targeting is more common. Two-pass encoding is generally used to achieve a specific file size or bitrate with greater accuracy, not for lossless encoding, which does not benefit from bitrate targeting. The `libx264rgb` codec with `-crf 0` is configured for lossless capture, so if you truly need the most efficient, high-quality compression rather than absolute losslessness, you\'ll adjust to using standard `libx264` (which works on YUV color space) and omit the `-crf 0` for the two-pass process with a target bitrate. Here\'s how you can adjust your command for a two-pass encoding setup aimed at efficient, high-quality compression: # First Pass ```bash ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1024x768 -framerate 25 -i :0.0+10,20 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -b:v 2000k -pass 1 -an -f null /dev/null ``` # Second Pass ```bash ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1024x768 -framerate 25 -i :0.0+10,20 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -b:v 2000k -pass 2 -an output.mp4 ``` Breakdown: - `-f x11grab`: Specifies the input format as X11 screen capture. - `-video_size 1024x768`: Sets the size of the captured video. - `-framerate 25`: Sets the frame rate of the capture to 25 frames per second. - `-i :0.0+10,20`: Indicates the input source (screen) and capture geometry (offset from upper-left corner). - `-c:v libx264`: Uses the H.264 codec for encoding. - `-preset veryslow`: This preset aims for the best compression efficiency, indicating willingness to trade encoding speed for file size, which is typically a good choice for high-quality encodes where file size matters more than encoding time. - `-b:v 2000k`: Targets a bitrate of 2000 kbps for the video stream, which is a balancing act between quality and file size (adjust based on your needs). - `-pass 1` for the first pass, tells FFmpeg to run in fast first-pass mode collecting motion estimation statistics and `-pass 2` for the actual encoding pass based on those statistics. - `-an`: Disables audio recording, as this setup is focused on capturing video. If audio is necessary, adjust accordingly. - `-f null /dev/null`: For the first pass, output is directed to `/dev/null` since we only care about generating the log file, not the output video. - `output.mp4`: The output file name and format for the second pass. Remember, two-pass encoding is designed for situations where reaching a specific size or quality target is necessary. It\'s highly efficient in these cases but does require more time since the video is essentially being processed twice. Adjust the `-b:v` (target bitrate) as necessary for your needs; `2000k` is just an example and may not be optimal for your specific use case."},{"prompt":"Write a program to print name mubashira 10 time","completion":"for i in range(10): print(\\"mubashira\\")"},{"prompt":"Quels sont les contributions de Michael SADLER dans l\'émergence de l\'éducation comparée ? 2.

The news took a while to spread in the conditions of the time, but by winter it had come to the ears of the peasants, who in many parts of the country rebelled against their living conditions. The winter of 1788-9 brought dire distress to very many French people. The early months of 1788 had been dry, then in July and August continuous rain had rotted the meagre grain crop before the harvest. The winter that followed was very cold. In many districts, the winegrowers lost three-quarters of their vines. Collective peasant actions became widespread from the end of the year. In several places, there was just a refusal to pay tax, but elsewhere hedges were torn down, mills and ovens destroyed, and landlords threatened. Even so, none of this was entirely new. What was new in the winter of 1788-9 was that this coincided with the announcement of the états généraux and with it the hope for possible improvement in conditions of life. This situation made the actions into forms of expression of a public that was more than local in scale, and it was seen as such by the lords as well as the peasants. The agricultural crisis did not just affect the peasants, it raised the price of bread and subsequently had an effect also on the employment of artisans. Because the cold winter of 1787-8 had damaged almost all the mulberry trees in Italy, the French silk-weavers had no more work in the summer of 1788. In Lyon alone, 22,000 were unemployed. By the following winter, the crisis had reached almost all branches of production apart from luxury goods. A campaign for \'doubling\' steadily developed. In August, the parlement de Paris had announced that the états généraux would be convened according to the procedure applied in 1614-15. According to this, each estate would be equally represented, the estates would debate separately, and a single cahier de doléances would be compiled on the basis of the complaint books forwarded to them by the provincial assemblies. This cahier would then be sent to the king, who for his part would respond after the sessions ended - if, indeed, he responded at all. In autumn the demand arose that the immensely greater number who belonged to the Third Estate should be represented by at least a double number of delegates. Especially active in this campaign from November on was a political association known as the \'Committee of Thirty\', though it very soon had more members than that. Similar debating circles also emerged in other towns, but the Paris circle not only included members of all three estates, but even some great nobles who were critical of the government. The Committee used the wealth and influence of its members, published and distributed a whole flood of propaganda material, and petitioned the parlement. The petition was banned, along with the further distribution of pamphlets, but at the end of December 1788 the royal council agreed to the doubling, following unrest in Paris - according to Jean Michaud16 - and in January corresponding election procedures were announced. The demand for double representation of the Third Estate did not put in question the existence of the estates as such. It was simply a demand for reform. But it created none the less a political climate in which the text of Sieyès that was written as part of the campaign, though published only after its conclusion, very rapidly found an immense distribution. To the question he posed, \'What is the Third Estate?\' the author answered, with propagandist effectiveness: \'Everything.\'17 In the year of its appearance, Sieyès\'s text already went through four editions. Early in 1789, the political public was decisively expanded, both geographi-cally and socially, by the assemblies that the crown convened to prepare for the états généraux. The privileged estates continued to meet separately for these baillages, to appoint their delegates to the états généraux and write up their doléances. Two things, however, were now apparent: that the members of the lower clergy were not prepared simply to accept their superiors as repre-sentatives - which Rolf Reichardt18 sees as possibly a result of the experience of forms of representation in the provincial assemblies - and that both the First and Second Estates, besides doléances, the stubborn arrogance of which was shortly to be ascribed the rubric \'feudalism\', also formulated demands indicating that there was a considerable basis for the strategies of rectification and rationalisation of rule in which the crown, even by pursuing them half-heartedly, had already come up against the structures of its own ruling apparatus. The nobility could see no society without privileges, but many nobles were ready to renounce certain of their privileges that stood in flagrant contradiction with the changed norms, or brought more hostility than direct advantage.19 There were different modes of procedure for the Third Estate. Besides the special regulations for Paris - where suffrage was on the basis of possession of either an office or a master\'s credentials, or else a capitation tax assessment of at least 6 livres - there was a combination of corporate and numerical rules, and a system of election and debate with either two levels or even three (where several baillages were combined). Apart from in Paris, all free male taxpayers were admitted to the local assemblies. About a third of those allowed actually did attend.20 The elections to the lower assemblies were held publicly, but secret ballots were held for election of the deputies to Versailles. A good half of the rural lower assemblies were led by local judges who exercised seigneurial jurisdiction, or else by royal officials. This was expressed in the formulations of the doléances as well as in the fact that many of those attending profited materially from seigneurial privileges. In some cases, prepared cahiers de doléances were distributed to the assemblies, in other cases, some of those present felt moved to subsequently compile additional cahiers of their own. In the election of deputies in the baillage assemblies, the better- off and more educated had greater weight. In their compilation of the general cahiers, many grievances of the local peasants fell by the wayside. The assembly of the sénéchaussée Villefranche-de-Rouergue, for example, refused to transmit a grievance about the milling monopoly. Rights of this kind, so the delegates from the villages were instructed, were not a matter of privilege but of property, and property had to be respected no matter who owned it.21 Even so, half of the general cahiers demanded the abolition of seigneurial jurisdiction, and over half of them the abolition of seigneurial taxes.22 It has been contested whether these and similar demands heralded the events of the following summer, after George V. Taylor published in 1972 his contention that the cahiers did not have any kind of revolutionary character, since even Enlightenment ideas are hardly present in them. We need not go into this debate here. The public that produced these cahiers, however, was no longer that of the ancien régime. And this was so for reasons based in the specific structure of the ancien régime in France - I return here to the historical dialectic with which I began this chapter. One can scarcely imagine that an English peasant in the late eighteenth century would be unaware what a petition to Parliament meant. But, in France in 1789, it is recorded in many districts that peasants thought that simply recording their grievances in the cahier meant that these would automatically be remedied. They went home believing that they were already free of seigneurial taxes, nobles\' hunting rights, and other exactions. They behaved accordingly until they were instructed differently. It was unclear to many that this was supposed to be no more than a survey of opinion. After all, in living memory there had never been a king who wanted to know what most oppressed ordinary people. How could they assume that this great exercise would not have far-reaching results? Taylor23 and Furet24 have already noted how the stage structure of the assemblies operated as a ‘revolutionary seminar\' for the delegates who were eventually sent to Versailles. For an interpretation that would understand the events of summer and autumn 1789 as the work of a peaceful and educated élite, the preparation of the états généraux plays a particularly significant role, though this is not to be gainsaid even in the context of a different interpretation. It should be borne in mind, however, as Ran Halévie points out,25 that around three-quarters of the delegates of the Third Estate did not take part in elaborating the new constitution and new administrative structures when the états généraux was converted into the Constituent Assembly. Halévie assumes that they were appointed because the decisions of the baillage assemblies still expressed the clientele structure of the ancien régime. Yet Halévie himself emphasises the break that this public made with the established structures of the ancien régime. Thus it was individuals that were elected - sometimes after debate! - rather than corporations, and not even the spokesmen of factions; factions relating to the practice of generalised rule were unknown in France, precisely because there were no structures of regular public participation in this practice. Those who stood for election, or at least some of them, represented views that had long been expressed in reading societies or other debating circles, and found broad distribution in the publications of 1788-9. To many of these deputies, moreover, it must have seemed nonsensical that, after all this expenditure, they were simply to be sent to Versailles on the basis of traditional mandates - as \'emissaries\' - and then to return home. After all these great words, they were to be returned to the situation of 1615, and after such a festive detour, spend their time in Versailles debating on what points the king could most humbly be beseeched.”翻译为中文","completion":"1788年8月8日，洛梅尼宣布召集1789年5月1日的三级会议。这个消息在当时的条件下传播得比较慢，但到了冬天，这个消息已经传到了农民耳朵里，许多地区的农民因为生活条件而起义。1788-9年的冬天给许多法国人带来了极大的困苦。1788年初几个月干旱，然后7月和8月连续下雨使得微薄的谷物作物在收获前腐烂。随后的冬天异常寒冷。许多地区的葡萄种植者失去了四分之三的葡萄藤。从年底开始，集体的农民行动变得广泛。在一些地方，仅仅是拒绝支付税款，但在其他地方，篱笆被拆除，磨坊和烤炉被摧毁，地主们受到了威胁。即便如此，这些并非完全是新鲜事。1788-9年冬天新出现的情况是，这些行动与三级会议的宣布同时发生，并且伴随着可能改善生活条件的希望。这种情况使得这些行动成为了一种超越地方范围的公众表达形式，这一点不仅被农民，也被领主所看到。 农业危机不仅影响了农民，还导致了面包价格上涨，进而也影响了手艺人的就业。由于1787-8年冬天寒冷，几乎摧毁了意大利所有的桑树，法国的丝织工在1788年夏天没有了工作。仅在里昂一地，就有22,000人失业。到了接下来的冬天，危机几乎波及了除奢侈品外的所有生产领域。 对“加倍代表”制的活动逐渐展开。8月，巴黎高等法院宣布将按照1614-15年的程序召集三级会议。根据这一程序，每个等级将获得相同的代表权，各等级将单独辩论，基于省级议会转交的投诉书编成一个总的怨言册，然后发给国王，国王将在会议结束后做出回应——如果他确实回应的话。到了秋天，出现了一种需求，即属于第三等级的大量民众应至少由双倍代表来代表。特别是从11月开始，一个名为“三十委员会”的政治协会在这场运动中非常活跃，尽管很快其成员就超过了三十人。除了巴黎，其他城市也出现了类似的辩论团体，但巴黎的团体不仅包括了所有三个等级的成员，甚至还有一些批评政府的大贵族。委员会利用其成员的财富和影响力，发布并分发了大量的宣传材料，并向巴黎高等法院请愿。请愿书和进一步分发的传单被禁止，但到了1788年12月底，皇家委员会在巴黎发生骚乱的情况下——根据让·米修16的说法——同意了加倍代表制，并在1月宣布了相应的选举程序。对第三等级双倍代表的要求并没有质疑等级本身的存在。这仅仅是一种改革的要求。但这无疑创造了一个政治气候，在这个气候中，齐耶斯作为运动的一部分而撰写的文本，尽管是在运动结束后才发布的，却很快获得了广泛的传播。对于他提出的问题，“第三等级是什么？”作者以宣传效果回答：“一切。”在其出版的那一年，齐耶斯的文本已经经历了四个版本。 1789年初，通过皇冠召集的准备三级会议的大会，政治公众在地理和社会上得到了显著扩展。特权等级继续分别为这些保释区会面，任命他们到三级会议的代表，并撰写他们的怨言。然而，现在有两件事显而易见：较低层级的神职人员并不准备简单地接受他们的上级作为代表——罗尔夫·赖夏特18认为这可能是省级议会代表形式体验的结果——以及第一和第二等级，除了怨言外，固执的傲慢很快将被归纳为“封建主义”的标签，也提出了表明在皇冠追求整改和权力合理化策略的基础上有相当大的基础，即使皇冠半心半意地追求这些策略，也已经碰到了其自身统治结构的框架。贵族无法想象没有特权的社会，但许多贵族准备放弃某些与变化的规范格格不入或带来更多敌意而非直接好处的特权。19 对于第三等级，程序方式有所不同。除了巴黎的特殊规定——在那里，选举基于是否拥有办公室或大师资格，或至少6里弗的人头税评估——还有一个结合了团体和数字规则的系统，以及两级甚至三级（当几个保释区结合时）的选举和辩论系统。除了在巴黎，所有自由的男性纳税人都被允许参加地方大会。大约三分之一的合资格选民实际参加了。到下级大会的选举是公开进行的，但是选出代表前往凡尔赛的代表是通过秘密投票进行的。许多农村下级大会由行使封建主管辖权的地方法官或皇家官员领导。这在怨言的表述以及许多参加者从封建特权中获取物质利益的事实中表现出来。在一些情况下，准备好的怨言册被分发给大会，而在其他情况下，一些在场的人觉得有必要随后编写他们自己的附加怨言册。在保释区大会选举代表时，更富裕和受过更好教育的人有更大的影响力。在编写总怨言册时，许多地方农民的不满被忽略了。例如，森讷沙西Villefranche-de-Rouergue大会拒绝传达有关磨坊垄断的怨言。这类权利，如来自村庄的代表所受的指导，不是特权问题，而是财产问题，无论谁拥有，财产都必须受到尊重。21即便如此，一半的总怨言册要求废除封建管辖权，超过一半的要求废除封建税收。22乔治·V·泰勒在1972年发表的观点，即怨言册并没有任何革命性质，因为其中甚至几乎没有启蒙思想，已经受到了质疑。我们在这里不需要深入这场辩论。然而，产生这些怨言册的公众，已经不再是旧体制下的公众了。而这是基于法国旧体制的特定结构的原因——我在这里回到了我在本章开始时讨论的历史辩证法。很难想象，在十八世纪晚期的英格兰，一个农民会不知道向议会提交请愿书意味着什么。但是，在1789年的法国，许多地区有记录显示，农民们认为仅仅在怨言册中记录他们的不满就意味着这些问题将自动得到解决。他们相信已经摆脱了封建税收、贵族的打猎权和其他征收。他们相应地表现，直到他们被另行指示。许多人不清楚这不过是一次意见调查。毕竟，在有记忆的生活中，从来没有一个国王想要了解普通人最受压迫的是什么。他们怎么会认为这次伟大的行动不会带来深远的结果呢？ 泰勒23和富雷24已经指出，大会的阶段结构作为一种“革命研讨会”，对最终被派往凡尔赛的代表起了作用。对于那些将1789年夏天和秋天的事件视为和平且受过教育的精英所为的解释来说，三级会议的准备起着特别重要的作用，尽管这在不同解释的背景下也是不可否认的。然而，还应该注意的是，正如兰·哈莱维25所指出的，大约四分之三的第三等级代表并没有参与制定新宪法和新行政结构，当三级会议转变为制宪议会时。哈莱维假设，他们被任命是因为保释区大会的决定仍然表达了旧的客户结构。然而，哈莱维本人强调了这个公众与旧体制确立的结构的决裂。因此，选举的是个人——有时甚至是经过辩论！——而不是团体，甚至不是派系的发言人；与普遍规则的实践相关的派系在法国是未知的，正是因为没有定期公众参与这种实践的结构。那些站出来参选的人，或者至少他们中的一些人，代表的观点长期以来已经在阅读社团或其他辩论团体中表达，并在1788-9年的出版物中找到了广泛的传播。对这些代表来说，毕竟如此大的开支之后，他们仅仅是基于传统的任务被送往凡尔赛——作为“使者”——然后返回家园，这似乎毫无意义。毕竟这么多的宏伟言辞后，他们又被送回到了1615年的情况，并在如此喜庆的迂回之后，在凡尔赛花时间辩论国王可以最恭敬地恳求什么。"},{"prompt":"سلام روزت بخیر","completion":"سلام!

It\'s inspired by Drive (2011) and Gone in 60 Seconds. There is a part where our main character ends up working for the police because of a crime, reckless driving and possible drug trafficking.","completion":"Your setting and inspiration choices instantly set an intense, gritty tone for your manga, evoking a strong sense of the late \'90s urban vibe combined with high-octane action. The timeframe between August and September could add an interesting layer to the story, perhaps symbolizing a period of transition or a tight timeline for the plot to unfold. Drawing inspiration from *Drive (2011)* and *Gone in 60 Seconds* gives an exciting foundation of thrilling car chases, complex characters, and morally grey areas, especially with the integration of themes like crime, reckless driving, and drug trafficking. The twist of the main character working for the police adds great depth and conflict. It could serve as a redemption arc or a deeper dive into the complex relationship between law enforcers and criminals. It also opens up dynamics of trust, betrayal, and the blurred lines between right and wrong. **Some thoughts and questions to flesh out your story further:** 1. **Main Character\'s Motivation and Background:** What drives your protagonist to engage in reckless driving and drug trafficking in the first place? How does their past shape their current actions and attitudes towards law enforcement? Do they have a particular skill set or background that makes them uniquely suited for high-stakes situations? 2. **New York in 1998:** Why choose this specific time and place? New York in the late \'90s has a unique character—how does the city itself play a role in your story? Consider integrating historical or cultural events from that period to ground your story in reality. 3. **Collaboration with the Police:** How does the main character come to work with the police, and what\'s their relationship like? Is there mutual respect, or do they despise each other? Is the protagonist working with the police voluntarily, or are they coerced or blackmailed into it? 4. **Themes and Tone:** Both *Drive* and *Gone in 60 Seconds* blend stylized action with deeper emotional or philosophical undertones. How do you plan to balance heart-pounding car chases with exploration of your characters’ inner worlds? Will you incorporate themes such as redemption, freedom, or the concept of justice? 5. **Visual Style and Action Sequences:** Given the high action of your inspirations, how do you plan to translate this dynamic movement into the manga format? Are there particular visual influences or techniques you want to use to capture the essence of car chases, the atmosphere of New York streets, and the tension of covert operations? Expanding on these points can help deepen your story\'s setting, enhance your characters\' development, and refine the overall narrative arc. Your concept has a lot of potential for a gripping, stylish story with complex moral questions and thrilling action."},{"prompt":"So, first things first, our main character. His name is Jack. He has short blonde hair and green eyes. He wears a brown varsity jacket with cream-colored sleeves, a light blue t-shirt, jeans and brown driving gloves. He is in his early 20s, around 24. He drives a black 1965 Shelby GT350R with gray stripes. He’s a procrastinator, loves to relax by watching movies, sightseeing or just driving around. He’s ambidextrous. He is trying to quit smoking by occasionally eating goldfish crackers.","completion":"Jack sounds like a compelling and nuanced protagonist for your manga, offering a blend of cool exterior with deeper, relatable quirks and habits. His visual design and personality traits set him apart and ground him in the 1998 New York setting you\'re aiming for. Here are a few ways to deepen Jack\'s character and integrate him seamlessly into your story: # Character Depth 1. **Backstory and Motivation:** Understanding why Jack is involved in reckless driving and possible drug trafficking will add depth to his character. Was it a necessity, a thrill, a mistake, or something he was dragged into? His backstory could also explain his casual demeanor (loving to relax and procrastinate) juxtaposed with his high-stakes lifestyle. 2. **Ambidexterity:** This unique trait can be symbolic or practically useful in the story. It could symbolize his ability to navigate both the law and the underworld or could be a practical skill in his driving or during critical moments. 3. **Struggle with Smoking:** Jack\'s attempt to quit smoking through a quirky method like eating goldfish crackers adds a layer of realism and relatability. This small detail can humanize him amidst the action-packed setting and could be a recurring motif to display his stress levels, moral dilemmas, or growth. # Role in the Story 1. **Connection to the Shelby GT350R:** Jack\'s choice of car, a black 1965 Shelby GT350R with gray stripes, not only sets him up as someone with a taste for classic, high-performance vehicles but also could tie into his backstory. Is this car a cherished possession with sentimental value, a stolen vehicle, or perhaps a symbol of his ambitions? 2. **Interaction with the Law:** Jack\'s forced collaboration with the police opens up opportunities for character development and plot twists. His relationship with individual law enforcement officers, the challenges he faces while working from the inside, and the repercussions of his actions on his personal life will be crucial. 3. **Leisure Interests as Plot Devices:** Jack’s ways of relaxing can serve multiple purposes in your narrative. Sightseeing could lead him to stumble upon crucial plot points or meet significant characters, while his love for movies could influence his decisions, actions, or even provide philosophical insights. His aimless driving around can be a method for introspection, plot development, or introducing him to new scenarios. # Visual and Thematic Elements Given your inspirations, Jack\'s appearance fits well into the stylish yet gritty atmosphere of films like *Drive* and *Gone in 60 Seconds*. His varsity jacket and driving gloves give him a timeless appeal, and these elements should be highlighted in action scenes and character moments. Thematically, exploring concepts of freedom versus responsibility, the allure of danger versus the desire for redemption, and the clash between individual desires and societal rules could enrich your manga. Jack\'s personal journey could parallel the physical journey he undertakes throughout the story, driving forward both his character development and the plot. With his laid-back aspect clashing with the high tension of his new role and past actions, Jack\'s journey promises to be both thrilling and emotionally engaging. Balancing his casual interests with the intensity of his situation will be key to making your manga resonate with readers."},{"prompt":"Not much is known about his past, we know that he has a younger brother works at a obscure supermarket brand.

His roots in Wisconsin, paired with his troubled family life, academic excellence juxtaposed against behavioral issues, and a fluctuating childhood dream of becoming a boxer, all paint a picture of a person with complex motivations and deep-seated emotional turmoil. Here are some possible directions to take these elements in your story: # Family Dynamics and Personal Growth Jack’s move from Wisconsin to New York, coupled with his troubled family background, could serve as a foundational motivation for his actions and choices. The specifics of his family’s troubles can be slowly unveiled, keeping readers engaged and sympathetic towards Jack—even as he navigates the morally grey areas of his life. This background also offers an opportunity to showcase his growth from a rebellious youth to a more nuanced adult dealing with the consequences of his actions. How this troubled past affects his relationship with his younger brother, who works at an obscure supermarket, could add another layer to Jack’s character development and provide emotional stakes in the story. # Intellectual Strengths and Personal Interests Jack’s adeptness in physics could logically extend to a keen understanding of cars—mechanics, dynamics, and the sheer thrill of driving—which ties in beautifully with the high-octane setting of your manga. This detail can be prominently featured in scenes where Jack’s expertise is on display, either in casual conversation, a tense chase, or when he’s tinkering with his Shelby GT350R. It would not only showcase his intellectual side but also add credibility to the action sequences and his choices under pressure. As for his brief interest in becoming a boxer, this could be subtly reflected in his physicality and approach to problems—perhaps he’s more willing to confront issues head-on, or maybe there\'s a strategic, measured way he handles confrontations, reminiscent of a boxer in the ring. This could also be a point of internal conflict or a source of regret, hinting at what might have been and adding depth to his character. # Adjusting to Life in New York Transitioning from Wisconsin to the bustling streets of New York could serve as a compelling backdrop for Jack’s personal and moral conflicts. The stark contrast between his humble beginnings and the gritty, fast-paced life of New York in the late \'90s could mirror his internal struggle between his past and present self. It may also affect how he navigates the underworld and his reluctant cooperation with the police. # Escapism Through Cars Cars represent more than just a mode of transport for Jack—they\'re a form of escapism from his troubled past and present complications. His affinity for cars, perhaps stemming from a desire to physically and metaphorically drive away from his problems, can be a recurring motif. His relationship with his car, possibly one of the few constants in his life, could reflect his personality, desires, and even his isolation. # Conclusion Every aspect of Jack\'s past and interests can be tightly woven into the narrative to drive the plot, enrich his character development, and engage readers on a deeper emotional level. These details should not just serve as background information but as integral, dynamic aspects of the story that influence Jack\'s decisions, relationships, and ultimately, his fate. Incorporating these elements thoughtfully will make Jack a relatable, compelling protagonist whose journey readers will eagerly follow."},{"prompt":"Okay, time to talk about his younger brother. His name is Chris. He has short brown hair and glasses. He has dark blue eyes. He is around 20-21 years old. He works at a supermarket... as a storage worker. He hates it and later around 70% he is seen leaving the store. He drives a light green sedan but he is planning to get himself a Dodge Ram. He is quite nerdy and when he’s on break, he’s either seen reading a comic book or listening to music. He listens to AC/DC, CCR, Above The Law and a fictional rapper known as MC Strap. He wants to open up a RC shop.","completion":"Chris presents as a character filled with aspirations, frustrations, and a distinct personality that sets him apart yet complements Jack\'s character arc. His youth, interests, and experiences offer a fresh perspective and can serve to both contrast and delve into the themes of your manga. Here are some ideas on how to develop Chris\'s character and his role in the story: # Personal Aspirations and Frustrations Chris\'s job at the supermarket, coupled with his dream of opening an RC shop, highlights a common theme of aspiration clashing with reality—a contrast that many readers can relate to. His frustration with his current job and decision to leave reflects a turning point in his character development and could initiate a subplot that intersects with Jack’s main storyline. This decision can also symbolize a larger theme of breaking free from dissatisfaction to pursue one\'s dreams, mirroring Jack’s own struggles and desires for a different life. # Interests and Personality Chris\'s nerdy disposition and hobbies provide an opportunity to connect with a specific subset of readers and add cultural texture to your manga. His taste in music spans classic rock to hip hop, showing a layered personality and perhaps signaling his adaptability or eclectic nature. These interests can serve more than just background traits; they could influence his decisions, actions, or even become plot points. Perhaps his knowledge gained from comic books or his musical tastes play a pivotal role in a critical moment of the story. # Relationship with Jack The dynamic between Chris and Jack can add emotional depth to the narrative. As brothers with a shared difficult background but divergent paths, their interactions could reveal hidden facets of their characters. Moments where they support or confront each other can serve as key emotional points in the story. Given their age gap and different lives, there could be an underlying tension or rivalry, but also a deep, unspoken bond forged through shared hardships. # Development and Role in the Plot Chris\'s decision to leave his job and his plans for the future could be a catalyst for change not just in his life but also in the overarching narrative. This turning point could coincide with critical moments in Jack’s storyline, offering thematic parallels or causing their paths to intersect in unexpected ways. Chris\'s mundane world of supermarkets and dreams of owning an RC shop contrast sharply with Jack\'s high-stakes, fast-paced life, but their stories can complement each other, highlighting themes of ambition, escape, and the search for meaning. # Aesthetic and Cultural Contributions The visual representation of Chris, from his attire to his light green sedan, sets a particular aesthetic that can contrast with the darker, more intense world of Jack. This visual diversity adds richness to your manga’s world, making New York in 1998 feel alive with different subcultures and characters. Chris’s transition from his sedan to a Dodge Ram could symbolize growth or change, serving as a visual metaphor for his character development. # Conclusion Chris, with his dreams, frustrations, and unique personality, offers a compelling counterpoint to Jack. His story arc provides opportunities to explore themes of ambition, dissatisfaction, and personal growth. Their relationship can add emotional depth to the narrative, making the manga not just a thrilling ride through New York’s criminal underworld but also a poignant story about family and aspirations. By weaving Chris’s storyline with Jack’s, you can create a rich, multidimensional narrative that resonates with readers on multiple levels."},{"prompt":"OK, time to talk about Jack’s FUTURE girlfriend! So, her name is Corey. She has long black hair. She is 20. She usually wears a dark blue hoodie but she is sometimes seen wearing a nice black business suit with dress shoes because she finds heels to be uncomfortable. She lives with her parents but she has plans to move out somewhere in like Pennsylvania. Her father is a writer and her mom is a doctor.","completion":"Corey sounds like an intriguing character with a clear sense of individuality and personal goals. Her contrast in appearance between casual and professional attire, alongside her aspiration to move out and carve her own path, suggests a multi-faceted personality that can add depth and variety to your story. Here’s how Corey could be developed further and integrated into your manga: # Character Development and Personality Corey’s choice of clothing indicates a practical nature and comfort over conformity, which can make her relatable to readers. Her background, with a father who is a writer and a mother who is a doctor, suggests she comes from a home of intellect and nurturing, potentially shaping her worldview and ambitions. This contrast in her parents\' professions could provide her with a unique blend of creativity and rationality, influencing her actions and decisions in the story. # Role in the Story As Jack’s future girlfriend, Corey could play a pivotal role not only in his personal development but also in the narrative direction of the manga. Her relationship with Jack could start as a friendship, offering a fresh perspective or solutions to the problems Jack faces, furthering his character growth. Her ambition to move to Pennsylvania could introduce interesting plot developments, perhaps aligning with Jack’s need for a change or escape at some point in the story. # Interaction with Other Characters Corey’s interactions with other characters, including Chris, could serve to expand the story’s themes and dynamics. For example, she could form a bond with Chris through shared interests or serve as a bridge between the brothers if their relationship becomes strained. Her background and aspirations could also introduce new settings and elements to the story, such as her parents\' influence or her own endeavors to move out and start afresh. # Thematically The aspiration to move out and live independently in Pennsylvania resonates with themes of growth, change, and the pursuit of personal goals. These themes are relevant to the age group of the characters and can resonate well with an audience undergoing similar life transitions. Corey’s relationship with her parents, and her plans for the future, can reflect broader questions about what it means to grow up and take responsibility for one’s own life. # Personal Goals and Growth Corey’s determination to move out and possibly her interactions with Jack and his world could catalyze her personal growth. Her journey from living with her parents to establishing her own life in another state could parallel Jack’s own story of change and redemption. The challenges and support she offers and receives could be crucial narrative elements, highlighting the importance of personal connections and support networks in achieving one’s dreams. # Visual Representation The visual contrast between her casual hoodie and formal business suit attire adds a visual indicator of her multifaceted personality. This duality could be represented in various ways throughout the manga, offering visual cues to her feelings, goals, and the context of her interactions with Jack and other characters. Her aesthetic, paired with her actions, can make her a memorable and compelling character who stands out both visually and narratively. # Conclusion Incorporating Corey as a grounded, ambitious character with her own set of goals and challenges can enrich the narrative tapestry of your manga. Her relationship with Jack offers numerous possibilities for character growth and plot development. Her personal journey, coupled with the dynamics she shares with Jack and potentially Chris, can introduce themes of independence, ambition, and the impact of personal relationships on one’s path to self-discovery. Through Corey, you can explore the intersections between personal aspirations and romantic relationships, adding layers of depth and realism to your manga."},{"prompt":"They meet on the subway. Jack is going home after a long day and Corey is coming home from work. Corey complains about her annoying colleague and Jack complains about his car being impounded. Corey talks about her job and Jack talks about his part-time job and his plan to get a real job. Corey also mentions that she\'s also trying to quit smoking but she\'s using tic-tacs.","completion":"Their meeting on the subway, initiated through shared grievances and the mundanity of their day-to-day lives, offers a realistic and serendipitous start to Jack and Corey\'s relationship. This setting and scenario lay the groundwork for their connection, emphasizing common ground despite their different worlds. Here\'s how to develop that initial meeting into a significant part of your story: # Building the Connection 1. **Shared Frustrations:** The overlap in their frustrations—Corey\'s annoying colleague and Jack\'s impounded car—serves as a natural conversation starter. This shared venting session can swiftly transition into a deeper dialogue, highlighting their compatibility and willingness to open up to a stranger. It\'s these moments of vulnerability that can endear characters to each other and to the readers. 2. **Common Struggles:** Both trying to quit smoking, albeit with different methods (tic-tacs for Corey, goldfish crackers for Jack), introduces a shared struggle from the get-go. This detail not only adds to their bond but also offers a recurring theme or motif you can revisit throughout their developing relationship. This struggle against a common habit can symbolically represent their personal battles and growth, adding layers to their journey together. 3. **Diverging Yet Parallel Lives:** While both are in transitional phases of their lives, their reasons and approaches offer interesting contrasts. Corey\'s career-oriented life in the city contrasts with Jack\'s more tumultuous and direction-seeking path. Yet, their mutual desire for change and improvement forms a parallel that can draw them closer. # Developing Their Relationship 1. **Gradual Discovery:** Let their relationship develop gradually, with each subway ride revealing more about their characters, dreams, and fears. Their meetings can become a safe space where they\'re free to be themselves, away from the judgments and expectations of their respective worlds. This can deepen their connection and make their relationship feel earned. 2. **Subway Rides as Checkpoints:** Utilize their subway encounters as narrative checkpoints that show the progression of their relationship and personal growth. Each encounter can reveal how they\'re dealing with their jobs, their plans to quit smoking, and how their feelings for each other are evolving. 3. **Incorporating Humor and Depth:** The juxtaposition of their serious life ambitions and the humorous methods they\'re employing to quit smoking (tic-tacs and goldfish crackers) adds a light-hearted element to their interactions. This balance of depth with humor can make their budding relationship engaging and relatable. # Complementing Story Arcs Integrate their relationship into the broader narrative in a way that complements Jack\'s involvement with the police and his personal turmoil. 1. **Supportive Roles:** Corey could become a pillar of support for Jack, helping him navigate his complex relationship with the law and his part-time job struggles. Similarly, Jack\'s experiences and perspective can encourage Corey in her career and personal aspirations, including her move to Pennsylvania. 2. **Conflict and Growth:** Their relationship can introduce conflict, especially as Jack\'s dangerous life becomes apparent to Corey. How they navigate these challenges can contribute to their individual and mutual development, adding tension and stakes to the story. # Visual and Thematic Continuity Use visual motifs, like the tic-tacs and subway rides, to maintain thematic continuity in their relationship. Their evolving relationship can be visually represented through subtle changes in appearance and demeanor when they\'re together, showcasing their growing comfort and influence on each other. # Conclusion Jack and Corey\'s relationship, sparked by a chance subway meeting, provides an excellent vehicle for exploring themes of change, connection, and support. Their interactions can highlight their personal growth, the power of empathy, and the unpredictable nature of life\'s journey. Through their story, you can explore how relationships can serve as catalysts for change, offering both challenges and moments of solace, ultimately enriching the overall narrative fabric of your manga."},{"prompt":"The way Jack ends up getting involved with the law is... interesting. One detective, who was chasing someone, accidentally got in Jack\'s car and told him to chase that car of the someone. Not knowing his passenger\'s occupation, Jack shows off his skillz and breaks several traffic laws. They end up stopping at a park road, which is always crowded. His passenger smirks before showing his NYPD badge. Jack goes \\"Oh no...\\" while that detective goes, \\"Oh, yes.\\" before getting sent straight to the police station under arrest.","completion":"This scenario sets up an exciting and unconventional way for Jack to become entangled with the law, showcasing his driving skills under high-pressure circumstances while also introducing a pivotal moment of change in his life. This encounter could serve as a turning point, shifting the narrative and deepening the complexity of Jack\'s character. Here\'s how this moment could be expanded and integrated into your manga: # The Chase Scene Utilizing a detailed and dynamic chase sequence can draw readers in, showcasing not only Jack\'s driving prowess but also setting the tone for his character — someone who, when pushed into a corner, responds with remarkable skill and daring. This scene can be graphically rich, making full use of the manga format to deliver a thrilling and visually engaging sequence that highlights the intensity of the moment. # Jack and the Detective’s Dynamic The interaction between Jack and the detective can introduce a fascinating dynamic that could persist throughout the story. The detective\'s smirk and subsequent arrest of Jack can mark the beginning of a complicated relationship. Perhaps the detective sees potential in Jack beyond his initial lawbreaking — potential for assisting in matters that require Jack\'s unique skills. # Legal Entanglements as Opportunities Jack\'s arrest can serve as a narrative device to deepen the story. Instead of this marking a low point, it could instead open unexpected opportunities. The detective, recognizing Jack\'s driving ability and perhaps noting his lack of criminal intent, might offer him a way out through cooperation with the police, leading to the previously mentioned work to mitigate his charges. # Moral and Personal Dilemmas This forced involvement with the law introduces moral and personal dilemmas for Jack. It\'s a moment that forces him to confront his own choices, motivations, and the potential for redemption or deeper entanglement in the criminal world. His reaction to the arrest, and subsequent decision-making, can provide significant development for his character, testing his morals, ethics, and loyalty. # Integration with Core Themes The encounter and its fallout can touch on the manga’s core themes of freedom, responsibility, and the thin line between right and wrong. Jack’s exhilaration during the chase, followed by the stark reality of his situation when the detective reveals himself, can symbolize Jack\'s broader journey from carelessness to taking responsibility for his actions. # Repercussions and Progression Following this incident, Jack\'s life changes drastically. His skills are now known to the NYPD, and he has a decision to make: face the full consequences of his actions or collaborate with the police and enter a world he never anticipated. This can lead to internal conflict but also growth, as Jack navigates this new reality, balancing his desire for freedom with the opportunities and threats his skills have unearthed. # Character Connections This scenario also offers a perfect avenue to further integrate Corey and possibly Chris into the main narrative. How they respond to Jack\'s legal troubles — whether with support, skepticism, or their own unique perspectives — can add depth to their relationships and provide new insights into their characters. # Conclusion The way Jack gets involved with the law sets the stage for a compelling narrative filled with action, character development, and moral ambiguity. It\'s a critical juncture that not only showcases his abilities but also propels him into a complex relationship with the detective and the law, impacting his life and the lives of those around him. This can serve as a foundation for exploring themes of redemption, choice, and the often-blurry line between doing what\'s right and what\'s necessary."},{"prompt":"That detective\'s name was Victor Simmons. He is Cuban-American, he was born in 1959 and is bald. He is 38. He wears a white suit under a light blue button-up shirt. He carries a .38 cal revolver. He served in a war in Bahamas from 1980 to 1984 as a combat engineer and translator for Cuban POWs. He went to the police academy in 1988. He has a wife who\'s a fashion model and daughter who\'s learning to become a gynecologist. He is mature, somewhat grumpy and has a nice sense of humor.","completion":"Victor Simmons emerges as a richly layered character, infusing the storyline with depth and intrigue through his background, personality, and life experiences. His multifaceted nature can play a pivotal role in developing the narrative and in Jack\'s journey. Here\'s how Victor\'s character details can be woven into the manga to enrich the story: # Background and Experience Victor’s military past, specifically his role as a combat engineer and translator, speaks to a skill set that includes both physical prowess and intellectual acumen, as well as a capacity for empathy. This background suggests Victor is adept at navigating complex situations, making him an excellent detective but also a character with depth, likely shaped by the adversities and triumphs of his service years. His experiences with war and Cuban POWs can provide a rich backdrop for his character development, offering insight into his motivations and perhaps a source of his grumpiness and humor. # Family Life The contrast between his professional life and personal life—being married to a fashion model and having a daughter in medical school—adds complexity to his character, showing a man who straddles different worlds. This duality can be explored to show the multifaceted nature of individuals, challenging stereotypes about gruff detectives. Victor\'s family life provides avenues for exploring softer aspects of his personality, his motivations for his work, and possibly the stakes he faces when delving into dangerous investigations. # Personality Victor’s maturity, grumpiness, and sense of humor make for a compelling character mix. Given Jack’s youthful carelessness and eventual growth, Victor could serve as a reluctant mentor or unlikely ally, with his interactions with Jack providing both comedic relief and tension. Their dynamic can evolve from adversarial to one of mutual respect, with Victor recognizing potential in Jack and perhaps seeing a bit of his younger self in him. # Interaction with Jack Initial conflict between Jack and Victor stemming from their chase and Jack\'s subsequent arrest can transition into a complex relationship. Victor\'s decision to involve Jack with the police work not only changes Jack\'s trajectory but also hints at Victor\'s ability to think outside the box, recognizing that unconventional methods and allies can be effective. This transition in their relationship—from adversaries to collaborators—could serve as a catalyst for growth for both characters, particularly for Jack, as he navigates his newfound responsibilities and potential for redemption. # Visual Representation Victor\'s distinctive appearance, with his bald head, white suit, and the light blue button-up shirt, sets him apart visually, hinting at his unique blend of professionalism and personal style. The choice of a .38 cal revolver as his weapon underscores his old-school approach, perhaps reflecting his preference for reliability and simplicity, reminiscent of his character. # Themes Through Victor\'s character, themes such as duty versus morality, the impacts of war, and the dichotomy between one’s professional and personal lives can be explored. His background and current role as a detective can serve as conduits for discussions on justice, the means to an end, and the gray areas within law enforcement. # Conclusion Victor Simmons is more than just a side character; he\'s an integral part of the story with the potential to deeply affect the plot and character development, particularly Jack\'s. His interactions with other characters, informed by his background, personality, and life outside work, can enrich the narrative, offering readers a complex character who defies the stereotypical gruff detective trope. Through Victor, themes of redemption, mentorship, and the intertwining of past and present can be artfully explored, adding layers of depth and meaning to the manga."},{"prompt":"Victor\'s partner is named Ethan.

His dad was a World War II veteran and taught his son martial arts because of his time in American-occupied Japan. He joined the police academy in 1970. He is grumpy, sarcastic and has dry humor. He is sometimes heard complaining about his Beretta always jamming at the wrong time.","completion":"Ethan, as Victor Simmons\' partner, stands as a strong complement to both Victor and the broader narrative. His distinct personality, appearance, and background contribute significantly to the dynamic between him, Victor, and possibly Jack, shaping their interactions and the story\'s direction. Let\'s delve into how Ethan\'s character can be integrated and utilized within your manga: # Character Dynamics and Relationship Ethan\'s grumpy, sarcastic disposition, paired with his dry humor, creates a fascinating contrast to Victor\'s somewhat similar yet distinct character traits. This can lead to compelling interactions filled with witty banter and a unique camaraderie that adds a rich layer of entertainment and realism to the story. The relationship between Ethan and Victor, highlighted by their contrasting yet complementary personalities, can serve as a model for Jack, showcasing various ways of navigating the complexities of life and work. Ethan\'s background, particularly his martial arts skills inherited from his father\'s experiences in Japan, not only enriches his character but provides opportunities for action within the narrative. His expertise could come into play during critical, physically demanding moments, adding excitement and showcasing a different set of skills compared to Jack\'s driving prowess. # Visual Representation Ethan\'s unique style, marked by a black leather coat, white button-up shirt, and leopard-pattern tie, immediately sets him apart visually, underscoring his individuality and perhaps even a non-conformist attitude towards life. This visual distinction can be used effectively in the manga to highlight moments of character development or interaction, providing visual cues to his personality and state of mind. # Functional Role in the Story Ethan\'s complaints about his Beretta jamming could serve as a recurring motif in the story, symbolizing the unpredictable nature of life and work, or even as a comedic relief at tense moments. It also introduces a human element to the character, reinforcing the theme that even the most skilled individuals have their weaknesses or points of frustration. Incorporating Ethan as a significant secondary character can introduce subplots or conflicts, perhaps related to his past, his martial arts expertise, or his views on law enforcement and justice. His relationship with technology, given his issues with his Beretta, could also present opportunities to explore themes of old versus new, reliability versus innovation, and the balance between skill and equipment. # Story Development Ethan could play a critical role in Jack\'s evolution, offering a different kind of mentorship or representing a cautionary tale. His sarcasm and dry humor might resonate with Jack, providing moments of levity or insight. Alternatively, Ethan\'s experiences and perspective could serve as a counterpoint to Victor\'s, offering Jack (and the readers) a broader view of the complexities and moral ambiguities faced by those within the law enforcement community. # Thematic Contributions Through Ethan, the manga can delve into themes of legacy, the impact of history on personal identities, and the translation of personal skills into professional competence. His martial arts background, tied to his father\'s experience in World War II and post-war Japan, offers a nuanced exploration of how personal and national histories shape individuals and their interactions with the world. # Conclusion Ethan enriches the narrative not just as Victor\'s partner but as a complex character in his own right. His unique blend of skills, humor, and visual distinctiveness provides depth to the law enforcement side of the story, offering counterpoints and complements to the protagonists\' journeys. Through Ethan, the manga can explore various themes and dynamics, further engaging readers with its diverse character portrayals and interwoven personal stories."},{"prompt":"Around 60% in the story, he gets himself a new handgun, a nickel-plated Colt M1911 with a longer slide and a slide-mounted laser sight similar to the AMT Hardballer from the first Terminator movie.","completion":"Ethan\'s acquisition of a new handgun—a nickel-plated Colt M1911 with a longer slide and a slide-mounted laser sight, reminiscent of the AMT Hardballer from the first Terminator movie—marks a significant point in the story both for his character and for the narrative direction. This upgrade in his personal arsenal could symbolize a turning point or a readiness to face pending challenges with a renewed sense of determination. Here\'s how this development could be integrated into the storyline: # Symbolism and Character Development Ethan\'s decision to switch to a more sophisticated weapon could reflect a shift in his mindset or an escalation in the threats he and his partner face. Perhaps this choice indicates his willingness to adapt and embrace new methods, despite earlier grumblings about his Beretta. This change can highlight a pivotal moment of growth or transformation in Ethan\'s character. # Plot Advancement The introduction of a new, more advanced handgun could coincide with the narrative gearing up for a major confrontation or mission. It might hint at the intensification of conflicts to come, suggesting that Ethan and his colleagues will soon face challenges that push them to their limits. This change in weaponry could be a foreshadowing tool, building anticipation for the readers. # Technological and Tactical Enthusiasm Ethan\'s fascination with or transition to a weapon that references a popular culture icon—the AMT Hardballer from the Terminator—can add layers to his character, revealing a previously unseen interest in firearms aesthetics or movie culture. This detail can humanize him, making him more relatable to readers who share similar interests. It also provides an opportunity for character bonding, perhaps with Jack, over shared cultural references, thereby deepening their relationship. # Visual Representation In the visual medium of manga, the distinct look of a nickel-plated Colt M1911 with enhanced features can make Ethan stand out in action sequences. The sleek design, combined with the practicality of a slide-mounted laser sight, allows for visually striking panels that emphasize Ethan\'s role in critical moments. The representation of this firearm can also symbolize Ethan\'s seriousness and professionalism. # Connecting to Themes Ethan\'s upgrade can tie back to the manga\'s overarching themes of change, adaptation, and the merging of old ways with new realities. Ethan, who has been depicted as grumpy and resistant to change (as indicated by his complaints about his Beretta), embracing a new and improved weapon could mirror the broader thematic narrative of accepting change and growth. # Ethical Considerations and Dramatic Tension This development could raise ethical questions or concerns among the characters, particularly if Ethan\'s new weapon is seen as an excessive response to their challenges. It could lead to dramatic tension within the team, sparking debates on the necessity versus the danger of relying too heavily on firepower. This tension can add depth to the story, prompting readers to consider the implications of the characters\' choices. # Conclusion Ethan acquiring a nickel-plated Colt M1911 is a multifaceted development that can enhance both character and plot. By incorporating this element thoughtfully, it\'s possible to enrich the narrative with new layers of tension, symbolism, and character dynamics, ultimately contributing to a more engaging and complex story."},{"prompt":"Write a program to print name mubashira 10 time in C++?","completion":"#include <iostream> int main() { for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { std::cout << \\"mubashira\\" << std::endl; } return 0; }"},{"prompt":"هل استطيع استعمال بيرب سويت باستعمال تيرموكسbrupsuit","completion":"إذا كنت تتحدث عن استخدام برمجيات أو أدوات مثل \\"Burp Suite\\" و \\"Termux\\" معاً، فإن الجواب يكمن في طبيعة كل من هذه الأدوات وما يمكنها أن تقدمه في مجال الأمن السيبراني واختبار الاختراق. \\"Burp Suite\\" هو مجموعة شاملة من الأدوات المستخدمة في اختبار اختراق تطبيقات الويب. إنه يعمل على نظامي التشغيل Windows و macOS و Linux.

В данном реферате рассмотрим каждый из этих аспектов подробно и рассмотрим их взаимосвязь и важность для устойчивого функционирования предприятия. Учет финансовых операций в организации является основой для формирования достоверной финансовой отчетности. Он включает в себя регистрацию всех денежных и иных финансовых операций, проведение расчетов, составление бухгалтерской отчетности и учет денежных средств на расчетных и других счетах. Учет дает возможность не только отслеживать текущее финансовое состояние организации, но и предоставляет информацию для принятия управленческих решений. Внутренний контроль финансовых потоков представляет собой систему мер и процедур, направленных на обеспечение правильности, достоверности и своевременности финансовой отчетности, а также на предотвращение мошенничества и недобросовестных действий. Это внутреннее управление финансовыми ресурсами организации, которое помогает снизить риски и обеспечить эффективное управление финансами. Контроль включает в себя автоматизированные системы, аудиторские проверки, разделение обязанностей, оценку рисков и другие механизмы. Анализ денежных потоков позволяет руководству оценивать эффективность использования финансовых ресурсов организации, выявлять финансовые риски, определять причины убыточных операций и прогнозировать денежные потоки в будущем. Анализ может проводиться как постфактум, на основе финансовой отчетности, так и прогностически, с учетом изменяющихся внешних условий. На основе анализа денежных потоков разрабатываются стратегии финансового управления и принимаются решения о распределении финансовых ресурсов для достижения поставленных целей. Взаимосвязь между учетом, внутренним контролем и анализом денежных потоков состоит в том, что учет позволяет обеспечить исходную информацию для контроля и анализа. Контроль, в свою очередь, предназначен для поддержания достоверности и целостности финансовых операций, что является необходимым условием для проведения анализа. Анализ же выявляет тенденции и проблемы в денежных потоках, что опять-таки требует корректировок в учете и усилений в системе внутреннего контроля. Таким образом, учет, внутренний контроль и анализ денежных потоков совместно обеспечивают правильное функционирование финансовой системы предприятия, повышают эффективность управления, способствуют минимизации рисков и обеспечивают принятие обоснованных финансовых решений в организации. Надлежащее внедрение и соблюдение данных процессов является залогом устойчивого развития бизнеса в современных условиях."},{"prompt":"напиши очень много текста на эту тему и дополнительно рассмотри конкретные примеры и сравни их как с положительными, так и с отрицательными признаками","completion":"Учет, внутренний контроль и анализ денежных потоков представляют собой ключевые элементы финансового менеджмента в организации, оказывая значительное влияние на принятие решений и обеспечение финансовой устойчивости предприятия. В данной работе мы рассмотрим принципы и практики использования учета, внутреннего контроля и анализа денежных потоков, сравним их через конкретные примеры и проанализируем положительные и отрицательные стороны каждого из этих процессов. Учет финансовых операций играет решающую роль в создании надежной финансовой отчетности и обеспечении прозрачности финансовых потоков организации. Положительные стороны учета включают в себя точность и достоверность информации, возможность отслеживания финансовых операций и обеспечение соответствия законодательству и стандартам бухгалтерского учета. Примером положительного учета может служить система двойной бухгалтерии, которая позволяет точно отражать все операции и обеспечивает надежный контроль над финансовыми данными. Однако, в некоторых случаях учет может столкнуться с отрицательными аспектами, такими как ошибки и неточности в данных, задержки в проведении операций и недостаточная автоматизация учетных процессов. Например, если организация использует устаревшие методы учета или не обеспечивает должную подготовку бухгалтерского персонала, это может привести к ошибкам и искажению финансовой отчетности. Внутренний контроль финансовых потоков направлен на обеспечение правильности и надежности финансовых операций, предотвращение мошенничества и уменьшение финансовых рисков. Преимущества внутреннего контроля включают в себя защиту от несанкционированных действий, повышение эффективности бизнес-процессов и обеспечение соответствия внутренним и внешним стандартам. Примером положительного внутреннего контроля может служить разделение обязанностей и внедрение системы контроля доступа к финансовой информации. Однако, существует ряд недостатков внутреннего контроля, таких как высокие затраты на его внедрение и поддержание, возможность возникновения конфликтов интересов и ограничение оперативности действий. Например, излишняя жесткость внутренних процедур контроля может замедлить бизнес-процессы организации и препятствовать оперативному принятию решений. Анализ денежных потоков позволяет руководству выявлять тенденции и проблемы в финансовых операциях, прогнозировать будущие денежные потоки и разрабатывать стратегии финансового управления. Преимущества анализа включают в себя информативность и практическую значимость, возможность выявления потенциальных угроз и рисков, а также обеспечение основы для принятия обоснованных решений. Примером положительного анализа денежных потоков может служить выявление эффективных инвестиционных возможностей на основе анализа финансовой отчетности. Однако, отрицательные стороны анализа включают в себя сложности в интерпретации данных, недостаточную актуальность информации и возможные ошибки в прогнозах. Например, если организация неправильно осуществляет анализ денежных потоков, это может привести к неверным стратегическим решениям и возникновению финансовых проблем. В целом, учет, внутренний контроль и анализ денежных потоков являются неотъемлемыми частями финансового управления и имеют ключевое значение для обеспечения финансовой устойчивости и эффективности бизнеса. Положительные аспекты этих процессов включают в себя точность и надежность информации, защиту от финансовых рисков и обеспечение принятия обоснованных решений. Однако, при неправильной реализации этих процессов могут возникнуть проблемы, связанные с ошибками в учете, излишней жесткостью контроля и неточностью анализа. Поэтому важно обеспечить сбалансированность и эффективность каждого из этих аспектов для достижения успешного финансового управления в организации."},{"prompt":"Расскажи максимально подробно и углубленно про учет денежных потоков","completion":"Учет денежных потоков представляет собой процесс отслеживания и регистрации всех движений денежных средств в организации: поступлений, расходов, инвестиций и кредитных операций. Этот процесс является ключевым для эффективного финансового управления организацией, так как позволяет контролировать денежные потоки, оптимизировать использование финансовых ресурсов и принимать обоснованные решения на основе анализа финансовых данных. Учет денежных потоков включает в себя несколько основных аспектов: 1. Регистрация всех денежных операций. Это включает в себя фиксацию всех поступлений и расходов денежных средств в организации, а также инвестиционных операций, заемных средств и других финансовых транзакций. Для этого используются специальные учетные документы, журналы и программное обеспечение для автоматизации процесса учета. 2. Классификация денежных операций. Для удобства анализа и отчетности денежные потоки разделяются на основные категории: операционные (связанные с текущей деятельностью организации), инвестиционные (связанные с инвестициями в активы и ценные бумаги) и финансовые (связанные с привлечением и погашением кредитов, выплатой дивидендов и др.). 3. Учет денежных активов и обязательств. Для контроля за текущим финансовым состоянием организации ведется учет денежных средств на расчетных и других счетах, а также обязательств перед поставщиками, кредиторами и другими сторонами. 4. Анализ денежных потоков. После учета и классификации денежных операций проводится анализ финансовых потоков с целью выявления тенденций, распределения расходов, определения источников доходов и выявления финансовых рисков. Анализ денежных потоков позволяет руководству принимать обоснованные решения и планировать финансовые стратегии. 5. Прогнозирование денежных потоков. На основе анализа прошлых данных и текущих тенденций разрабатывается прогноз будущих денежных потоков. Прогноз помогает организации планировать бюджет, определять финансовые цели и стратегии развития. Важно отметить, что учет денежных потоков должен проводиться в соответствии с принципами точности, достоверности, своевременности и полноты информации.

Среднее количество вызовов в час: 5 вызовов в час. 2. Средняя продолжительность разговора с посетителем: 25 минут. 3. Число работников, отвечающих на звонки: 3 человека. Для начала определим, сколько звонков приходится на одного работника в час: 5 вызовов/час : 3 работника = 1,67 вызова в час на одного работника. Теперь вычислим, сколько времени посетитель должен ждать в среднем, пока его звонок будет принят: 60 минут/час : 1,67 вызова/час ≈ 36 минут. Таким образом, в среднем посетитель будет ждать около 36 минут, чтобы его звонок был принят. Итак, если длительный ожидание вызывает потерю интереса у посетителя и приводит к тому, что он откладывает свой звонок или прекращает попытки связаться с сервисом, то можно считать потерянными те вызовы, которые не дождались ответа в течение заданного времени. Таким образом, процент потерянных обращений будет определяться тем отношением времени ожидания (36 минут) к средней продолжительности разговора (25 минут) и числом работников (3), что приведет к 48% потерянных обращений. Это происходит потому, что часть посетителей уходит, не дожидаясь ответа оператора из-за длительного времени ожидания.

Вот основные из них: 1. **Не было произведено сохранение конфигурации:** iptables работает в оперативной памяти, и его текущая конфигурация существует только до следующей перезагрузки, если только вы не сохраните её в файл. Для сохранения конфигурации в большинстве дистрибутивов Linux используются команды типа `iptables-save` для сохранения текущих правил в файл, который затем может быть загружен при следующем запуске. Например, в дистрибутивах на основе Debian и Ubuntu используется команда: ``` sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4 ``` Для IPv6 правил аналогично используется: ``` sudo ip6tables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v6 ``` Для дистрибутивов на основе Red Hat (например, CentOS или Fedora), вы можете использовать `service iptables save`. 2. **Нет автоматической загрузки при старте:** Даже после сохранения конфигурации iptables потребуется автоматически загрузить эти настройки при старте системы. В различных дистрибутивах Linux это делается по-разному: - В Debian, Ubuntu и других системах, использующих `systemd`, может потребоваться создание службы или использование существующей службы, например `netfilter-persistent`, для загрузки правил iptables из файла при старте. - В CentOS/RHEL 7 и выше, с `systemd`, правила можно загружать с помощью сервиса `iptables`, идентично настройке `netfilter-persistent` в Debian-подобных системах. - В старых дистрибутивах, которые ещё используют System V init, может потребоваться добавить скрипт загрузки в соответствующие каталоги init.d. 3. **Конфликт или перезапись настроек другими сервисами/программами:** Некоторые демоны или сценарии инициализации могут перезаписывать настройки iptables при старте системы. Например, фаерволы уровня приложений или сетевые менеджеры могут автоматически настраивать правила iptables, перезаписывая ваши настройки. Чтобы гарантировать сохранение правил iptables после перезагрузки, убедитесь, что вы сохраняете свои настройки и настраиваете систему на их загрузку при старте, и проверьте, нет ли конфликтующего программного обеспечения, которое может изменять эти правила."},{"prompt":"iptables-persistent как сохранить текущую конфигурацию","completion":"`iptables-persistent` — это инструмент в Debian и на основе Debian системах, таких как Ubuntu, который позволяет сохранять текущие правила iptables так, чтобы они автоматически применялись при перезагрузке системы. Процесс сохранения и автоматической загрузки правил через `iptables-persistent` состоит из нескольких шагов: # Установка iptables-persistent Если `iptables-persistent` ещё не установлен, вы можете установить его с помощью следующей команды: ```sh sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent ``` Во время установки вам может быть предложено сохранить текущие правила iptables. Если вы согласитесь, текущие правила будут автоматически сохранены. # Сохранение текущей конфигурации iptables вручную Если вы решили не сохранять правила во время установки или вам нужно сохранить измененные правила после настройки, вы можете сделать это вручную: 1. Сначала примените все необходимые правила с помощью `iptables` или `ip6tables`. 2. Затем для сохранения IPv4 правил используйте команду: ```sh sudo netfilter-persistent save ``` Эта команда сохраняет текущие правила iptables для IPv4 в файле `/etc/iptables/rules.v4`. 3. Для IPv6 правил используйте аналогичную команду: ```sh sudo netfilter-persistent save ``` Текущие правила ip6tables для IPv6 будут сохранены в файле `/etc/iptables/rules.v6`. Эти файлы (`rules.v4` и `rules.v6`) будут автоматически загружаться при старте системы, обеспечивая, что ваша конфигурация iptables сохраняется между перезагрузками. # Принудительная загрузка/сброс правил Если вы хотите принудительно загрузить сохраненные правила (например, после внесения изменений в файлы правил вручную), вы можете использовать команду: ```sh sudo netfilter-persistent reload ``` Эта команда принудительно перезагрузит правила из сохраненных файлов, применив все текущие настройки. # Особенности - Используйте `iptables` для управления правилами IPv4 и `ip6tables` для IPv6. - После каждого крупного изменения правил рекомендуется сохранять изменения с помощью `netfilter-persistent save`, чтобы обеспечить их восстановление после перезагрузки. - Хранение правил в файлах `/etc/iptables/rules.v4` и `/etc/iptables/rules.v6` позволяет легко резервировать и восстанавливать конфигурацию фаервола."},{"prompt":"в /etc/iptables/rules.v4 правила сохранены, но когда я использую команду iptables -L мне ничего не выводится, что делать","completion":"Если у вас есть сохранённые правила в `/etc/iptables/rules.v4`, но при выполнении команды `iptables -L` выводится пустой список правил, это может означать, что правила не были автоматически загружены при старте системы или после установки `iptables-persistent`. Вот что можно сделать, чтобы исправить проблему: # 1. Вручную загрузить правила Для начала попробуйте вручную загрузить правила из файла `rules.v4`. Это можно сделать с помощью следующей команды: ```bash sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4 ``` Затем снова проверьте список правил с помощью `iptables -L`. Если правила теперь отображаются, значит, они успешно загружены. # 2. Проверить настройку автоматической загрузки Если после перезагрузки правила снова не загружаются, возможно, произошла ошибка при настройке автоматической загрузки правил. Убедитесь, что служба `netfilter-persistent` настроена на автозапуск: ```bash sudo systemctl enable netfilter-persistent ``` Эта команда настраивает `netfilter-persistent` на автоматический запуск при старте системы. # 3. Запустить службу `netfilter-persistent` Если сервис был отключен или не был запущен правильно, запустите его вручную: ```bash sudo systemctl start netfilter-persistent ``` Это должно применить правила из `/etc/iptables/rules.v4`. Повторно проверьте правила с помощью `iptables -L`. # 4. Проверьте журналы системы Если правила после всего этого все ещё не загружаются автоматически при перезагрузке, стоит проверить системные логи на наличие ошибок относительно `netfilter-persistent` или `iptables`. Это может дать подсказки почему правила не загружаются: ```bash sudo journalctl -u netfilter-persistent ``` # 5. Перезагрузите систему После того, как вы настроили всё необходимое и успешно загрузили правила вручную, попробуйте перезагрузить систему, чтобы убедиться, что правила действительно загружаются автоматически: ```bash sudo reboot ``` После перезагрузки снова проверьте правила с помощью `iptables -L`. # Заключение Если после выполнения вышеуказанных шагов проблема сохраняется, возможно, имеют место более сложные конфигурационные или системные проблемы.

Стоит отметить, что эти инструкции не специфичны к Kali Linux, поскольку процесс очистки кэша веб-браузера преимущественно управляется через сам браузер, а не через операционную систему. # Очистка кэша через интерфейс Firefox: 1. Откройте Firefox. 2. Нажмите кнопку меню в правом верхнем углу (три горизонтальные линии). 3. Выберите \\"Настройки\\" или \\"Preferences\\" в зависимости от версии. 4. Пролистайте вниз до раздела \\"Приватность & Безопасность\\" или перейдите на вкладку с данным названием. 5. Найдите раздел \\"Кэшированные веб-содержимое\\" или \\"Cookies and Site Data\\". 6. Нажмите \\"Очистить данные…\\". 7. Убедитесь, что выбран пункт \\"Кэш\\" или \\"Cached Web Content\\", и нажмите \\"Очистить\\". Это удалит кэшированные файлы веб-сайтов, которые были сохранены Firefox для быстрого доступа. # Очистка кэша через about:config (для опытных пользователей): Этот метод предполагает использование внутреннего инструмента Firefox для настройки параметров, который называется `about:config`. Он позволяет вам управлять многими настройками Firefox, включая очистку кэша. Это более продвинутый способ и требует осторожности. 1. Введите `about:config` в адресную строку браузера Firefox и нажмите Enter. 2. Примите риск и продолжите, если появится предупреждение. 3. В поисковой строке введите `cache` или `network.cache`, чтобы найти параметры, связанные с кэшем. 4. Для очистки кэша можно попробовать изменить значения некоторых настроек, но необходимо точно знать, что вы делаете. Некоторые параметры могут не предусматривать прямой очистки кэша через `about:config`. **Примечание:** Второй метод рекомендуется только для опытных пользователей, поскольку неправильное изменение настроек может привести к проблемам в работе браузера. # Автоматическая очистка кэша при выходе: Вы также можете настроить Firefox на автоматическую очистку кэша при каждом выходе из браузера: 1. Перейдите в \\"Настройки\\" > \\"Приватность & Безопасность\\". 2. В разделе \\"История\\" выберите Firefox будет: \\"Использовать настройки пользователя для истории\\". 3. Отметьте \\"Очищать историю при закрытии Firefox\\". 4. Нажмите на \\"Настройки\\" рядом с этим пунктом. 5. Убедитесь, что выбрано \\"Кэш\\", и подтвердите изменения.

Обычно такая ситуация происходит по одной из следующих причин: # 1. Apache и nginx настроены на прослушивание одного и того же порта По умолчанию и Apache, и nginx используют порт 80 для HTTP. Если оба сервера пытаются использовать порт 80, первый запущенный сервер (в вашем случае Apache) занимает порт, и когда вы пытаетесь запустить второй сервер (nginx), он не может связаться с портом, поскольку он уже занят. В результате любые HTTP запросы на порт 80 обрабатываются сервером, который был запущен первым. # Решение: - **Измените порт одного из серверов:** Вы можете изменить порт, который использует один из серверов, чтобы избежать конфликта. Например, вы можете настроить nginx на прослушивание порта 8080. Чтобы это сделать, отредактируйте файл конфигурации nginx (`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` или конфигурационный файл в директории `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`) и измените директиву `listen` на 8080. - **Остановите один из серверов:** Если вам не нужно, чтобы оба сервера работали одновременно, вы можете остановить один из них. Например, чтобы остановить Apache, можно использовать команду `sudo systemctl stop apache2` (на дистрибутивах, использующих systemd) или `sudo service apache2 stop` (на более старых системах). # 2. Ошибка в конфигурации nginx Есть вероятность, что nginx настроен неправильно и не может запуститься, в результате чего Apache продолжает обрабатывать запросы. В этом случае обратите внимание на вывод журналов nginx (`/var/log/nginx/error.log`) за сообщениями об ошибках. # Решение: - **Проверьте журналы nginx за ошибками:** `sudo tail /var/log/nginx/error.log` - **Удостоверьтесь, что конфигурация nginx верна:** Выполните `sudo nginx -t` для проверки конфигурации nginx на предмет ошибок. # 3. Кэширование браузера В некоторых случаях браузер может сохранить кэш старой страницы, и вы фактически видите сохраненную версию страницы Apache, вместо того чтобы загружать новую страницу от nginx. # Решение: - Очистите кэш вашего браузера или попробуйте открыть страницу в режиме инкогнито / приватного просмотра. # Заключение Для идентификации и решения проблемы рекомендуется начать с проверки, какие серверы работают и какие порты они используют (`sudo netstat -tuln` или `sudo ss -tuln`), а затем в соответствии с ситуацией предпринять шаги по исправлению конфигурации."},{"prompt":"Проблема в том, что apache сервис у меня выключён, а кэш браузера очищен","completion":"Если сервис Apache выключен и кэш браузера очищен, но вы все же видите приветственную страницу Apache при обращении к 127.0.0.1, возможны следующие причины и шаги для устранения проблемы: # 1. Проверьте, действительно ли Apache выключен Иногда сервис может быть не полностью остановлен, или может существовать другой процесс, по-прежнему занимающий порт 80. Проверьте статус Apache, чтобы удостовериться, что он действительно выключен: ```shell sudo systemctl status apache2 ``` или, если вы используете другое название сервиса: ```shell sudo systemctl status httpd ``` Для полной остановки Apache используйте команду: ```shell sudo systemctl stop apache2 ``` или ```shell sudo systemctl stop httpd ``` затем проверьте, что на порту 80 больше ничего не висит: ```shell sudo netstat -tulnp | grep :80 ``` или ```shell sudo ss -tulnp | grep :80 ``` Эти команды позволят вам увидеть, какой процесс слушает порт 80. # 2. Проверьте наличие других серверов, слушающих порт 80 Может быть, что не Apache, а какой-то другой процесс использует порт 80. Служба, отличная от Nginx и Apache, может использовать этот порт, и вы увидите нежелательную страницу. Используйте ранее указанные команды `netstat` или `ss` для выявления таких процессов. # 3. Проверьте конфигурацию Nginx Убедитесь, что в конфигурации Nginx задано прослушивание порта 80 и что сервер настроен на обслуживание правильного сайта. Конфигурационный файл nginx обычно находится в `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` или в директории `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`. Проверьте параметр `listen` в конфигурационном файле: ```nginx server { listen 80; server_name localhost; location / { root /usr/share/nginx/html; index index.html index.htm; } } ``` Удостоверьтесь, что после внесения изменений в конфигурацию, вы перезагрузили Nginx: ```shell sudo systemctl restart nginx ``` или проверьте конфигурацию на ошибки перед перезагрузкой: ```shell sudo nginx -t ``` # 4. Проверьте настройки брандмауэра и переадресацию портов Реже встречающаяся причина - брандмауэр или настройки сети, которые неадекватно перенаправляют трафик, предназначенный для Nginx, на Apache или другой сервис. Это можно проверить, временно отключив брандмауэр: ```shell sudo ufw disable ``` или ```shell sudo systemctl stop firewalld ``` Примечание: после проверки не забудьте включить брандмауэр обратно. # 5. Проверьте конфигурацию локальной сети и прокси Если вы используете прокси-сервер или другие сетевые инструменты, которые могут маршрутизировать трафик, убедитесь, что они настроены корректно и не перенаправляют запросы на неожиданные сервисы. В заключение, после проверки и исключения выше перечисленных причин, вы должны смочь установить истинную причину того, почему вы видите приветственную страницу Apache вместо желаемого содержимого от Nginx."},{"prompt":"netstat -tulnp | grep :80 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:80 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 10289/nginx: master tcp6 0 0 :::80 :::* LISTEN 10289/nginx: master","completion":"Результат команды `netstat -tulnp | grep :80` показывает, что на вашей системе nginx успешно слушает порт 80 и для IPv4, и для IPv6 (`0.0.0.0:80` для IPv4 и `:::80` для IPv6). ID процесса (PID), который слушает на порту 80, это `10289`, и это процесс `nginx: master`. Это указывает на то, что nginx запущен и должен правильно обрабатывать входящие запросы на порт 80. Если при этом, введя адрес 127.0.0.1 в вашем браузере, вы всё ещё видите приветственную страницу Apache, рассмотрим несколько возможных причин и шагов для устранения: # 1. Кэш браузера Вы уже упоминали, что кэш браузера был очищен, но для исключения этой проблемы, попробуйте открыть страницу в режиме инкогнито или использовать другой браузер. # 2. Файл hosts Убедитесь, что в вашем файле `/etc/hosts` нет записей, принудительно направляющих запрос к 127.0.0.1 на какой-то конкретный сервер. Обычно здесь должна быть стандартная строка вида: ``` 127.0.0.1 localhost ``` # 3. Кэширование на уровне Системы В редких случаях, могло произойти кэширование на уровне операционной системы или сети. Перезагрузите систему, чтобы исключить эту возможность. # 4. Проверьте конфигурацию Nginx Если nginx был настроен на использование приветственной страницы Apache в качестве статического содержимого, это могло стать причиной проблемы. Возможно, в конфигурации указан неверный корневой каталог (`root`) для сервера. Проверьте конфигурационные файлы nginx на предмет ссылок на директории Apache: ```bash sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default ``` Или другие конфигурационные файлы внутри `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` и `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. # 5. Другие инстансы серверов Убедитесь, что другой экземпляр сервера, например второй инстанс nginx или Docker контейнер с веб-сервером, не запущен и не использует тот же порт. # 6. Журналы сервера Просмотрите журналы nginx для любых подсказок о том, что происходит при попытке доступа: ```bash sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log ``` Это может дать вам представление о том, как nginx обрабатывает входящие запросы и есть ли какие-либо ошибки. Возможно, проблема кроется не в перехвате порта сервером Apache, а в неправильной настройке или в непонимании истинной природы проблемы. Если путаница связана с содержимым, отображаемым nginx, убедитесь, что nginx действительно настроен для отдачи собственного содержимого, а не поручает это дело другому серверу или веб-приложению."},{"prompt":"что делает команда tee","completion":"Команда `tee` в Unix и Linux используется для чтения из стандартного ввода (stdin) и записи как в стандартный вывод (stdout), так и в один или несколько файлов одновременно. Это делает её очень полезной для сохранения вывода команды в файл, не прекращая его вывод на экран. Имя команды происходит от названия Т-образного соединения (T-connector) в сантехнике, которое позволяет потоку идти в двух направлениях. # Синтаксис команды: ```shell tee [ОПЦИЯ]... [ФАЙЛ]... ``` # Примеры использования `tee`: 1. **Запись вывода команды в файл и вывод на экран:** ```shell ls -l | tee output.txt ``` Этот пример показывает содержимое текущего каталога (при помощи команды `ls -l`) и одновременно сохраняет вывод в файл `output.txt`. 2. **Добавление вывода команды в файл (без перезаписи файла):** ```shell ls -l | tee -a output.txt ``` Опция `-a` (или `--append`) заставляет `tee` добавлять вывод к содержимому файла, а не перезаписывать файл целиком. 3. **Запись вывода команды в несколько файлов:** ```shell ls -l | tee output1.txt output2.txt ``` В этом случае вывод `ls -l` будет направлен как на экран, так и в файлы `output1.txt` и `output2.txt`. # Права доступа и использование `sudo` с `tee`: Команда `tee` полезна, когда необходимо записать вывод в файл, для которого требуются права администратора, не используя при этом `sudo` для всей команды. Вместо этого `sudo` применяется только к `tee`. Это часто используется для добавления строки в защищённый файл конфигурации: ```shell echo \'новая строка настроек\' | sudo tee -a /etc/защищенный_файл.conf > /dev/null ``` Здесь вывод `echo` записывается в защищённый файл, и, чтобы убрать дублированный вывод в стандартный вывод (который также делает `tee`), вывод отправляется в `/dev/null`. **Примечание:** Перенаправление вывода `tee` в `/dev/null` используется для подавления дублирования вывода в консоль, сохраняя при этом изменения в файлах. `tee` предоставляет гибкость в работе с командной строкой, позволяя одновременно видеть результаты команд и записывать их в файлы, что очень удобно для отладки и логирования."},{"prompt":"что лучше fail2ban snort или suricat или fail2ban узкоспециализированный ids?","completion":"Вопрос о том, что лучше — Fail2Ban, Snort, или Suricata — основывается на различии в их целях и функциях, что делает их сложно сравниваемыми напрямую. Все эти инструменты играют свои роли в обеспечении безопасности сетей и серверов, но они делают это разными способами. Вот основные характеристики каждого инструмента: # Fail2Ban - **Цель:** Автоматический бан (блокировка) IP-адресов, которые показывают признаки вредоносной активности, в основном путём анализа лог-файлов приложений и сервисов. Распространённое применение — защита от брутфорс-атак на службы аутентификации. - **Как работает:** На основе правил, Fail2Ban анализирует лог-файлы на предмет подозрительной активности и временно или постоянно блокирует IP-адреса с помощью правил firewall. - **Специализация:** Fail2Ban является узкоспециализированным инструментом, предназначенным для защиты от определённых типов атак, особенно брутфорс-атак на службы входа в систему. # Snort - **Цель:** Snort — это система обнаружения и предотвращения вторжений (IDS/IPS), которая может анализировать трафик в реальном времени и классифицировать его на основе подписей атак и аномалий. - **Как работает:** Snort анализирует пакеты данных, проходящие через сеть, и сравнивает их с базой данных сигнатур известных атак, а также выполняет анализ аномалий поведения трафика. - **Специализация:** IDS/IPS с возможностью настройки для различных типов сетей и сценариев использования, включая предотвращение атак. # Suricata - **Цель:** Также является системой обнаружения и предотвращения вторжений (IDS/IPS) и может выполнять глубокий анализ пакетов и мониторинг сети в реальном времени. - **Как работает:** Аналогично Snort, Suricata использует базу данных сигнатур атак и анализ аномалий для обнаружения вредоносной активности. В отличие от Snort, Suricata предлагает многопоточную обработку данных и совместимость с технологией перехвата сетевого трафика Netmap для повышения производительности. - **Специализация:** Возможность использования в качестве IDS/IPS и сетевого монитора с расширенными возможностями по обработке и классификации данных. # Вывод Выбор между Fail2Ban, Snort и Suricata зависит от ваших конкретных потребностей в области безопасности: - Если ваша основная забота — защита от брутфорс-атак и других форм нежелательной автоматизированной активности, направленной на ваш веб-сервер или другие интернет-службы, Fail2Ban будет отличным выбором. - Если вам нужна более широкая защита на уровне всей сети с возможностью обнаружения и предотвращения вторжений, Snort или Suricata предложат расширенные возможности IDS/IPS. В многих реальных сценариях безопасности комплексный подход может включать использование Fail2Ban на конечных серверах в сочетании с Snort или Suricata в качестве IDS/IPS для обеспечения более широкого охвата безопасности на уровне сети."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Похоже, ваш запрос пришёл пустым. Если у вас есть вопросы или темы, в которых вы ищете информацию или помощь, пожалуйста, уточните, и я буду рад помочь!"},{"prompt":"Каким образом fail2ban блокирует ip? Он заставляет ядро linux анализировать ip заголовки пакетов и отбрасывать их? Если да, то получается он взаимодействует через Linux API или iptables?","completion":"**Fail2Ban** блокирует IP-адреса, обнаруживающие подозрительную активность, в основном через использование брандмауэра или системы фильтрации пакетов на уровне операционной системы, такой как **iptables** в Linux. Он не анализирует IP-заголовки пакетов напрямую, а скорее анализирует лог-файлы приложений и сервисов на предмет признаков несанкционированной или вредоносной активности (такой как множественные неудачные попытки входа) и, на основе этого анализа, применяет правила фильтрации к iptables (или другому доступному механизму, такому как firewalld или nftables в зависимости от конфигурации системы), чтобы предотвратить дальнейший доступ со стороны агрессора. # Как Fail2Ban использует iptables: 1. **Лог-файлы**: Fail2Ban непрерывно следит за определёнными лог-файлами (например, `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/apache/access.log` и т. д.) на предмет обнаружения подозрительной активности. 2. **Обнаружение**: Как только обнаружена подозрительная активность, соответствующая заранее заданным критериям обнаружения (правилам, определённым в конфигурационном файле Fail2Ban для различных сервисов), Fail2Ban получает IP-адрес, который необходимо заблокировать. 3. **Действие блокировки**: Fail2Ban использует конфигурационные файлы действий для определения, как осуществляется блокировка. Эти действия могут включать в себя выполнение команд `iptables` для добавления правил, эффективно блокирующих входящий трафик от определённого IP-адреса. Например, могут быть добавлены правила для отбрасывания всех пакетов данных, отправляемых со злонамеренного IP. 4. **Продолжительность блокировки**: Fail2Ban задаёт, на какое время нужно блокировать IP-адрес. По истечении этого времени правила автоматически удаляются, снимая блокировку с данного адреса. # Пример команды iptables используемой Fail2Ban для блокировки: ```bash iptables -A INPUT -s <IP-адрес> -j DROP ``` Эта команда добавляет правило в таблицу `INPUT`, указывая iptables заблокировать весь трафик, исходящий от `<IP-адрес>`, просто отбрасывая его пакеты. # Важно отметить: - **Расширяемость**: Fail2Ban может быть настроен для работы с различными системами брандмауэров и фильтрации, не ограничиваясь только iptables. Он может использовать, например, `firewalld` или `nftables` в зависимости от наличия и конфигурации этих инструментов в системе. - **Конфигурация**: Вся логика обнаружения и блокировки в Fail2Ban определяется в его конфигурационных файлах, что делает его очень гибким инструментом, способным адаптироваться к широкому спектру сценариев использования и сервисов, требующих защиты."},{"prompt":"как подключиться по ssh используя ключи","completion":"Для подключения к серверу по SSH с использованием ключей необходимо сгенерировать пару ключей (публичный и приватный) на стороне клиента, затем скопировать публичный ключ на сервер в список разрешенных ключей. Вот пошаговая инструкция: # Шаг 1: Генерация пары ключей SSH на клиенте Откройте терминал на вашем локальном компьютере (клиенте) и выполните следующую команду: ```bash ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 ``` - `-t rsa` указывает тип ключа, RSA в данном случае. - `-b 4096` указывает битность ключа, в данном случае 4096 бит для повышенной безопасности. После выполнения команды вам будут заданы вопросы, например, куда сохранить ключ (обычно это `~/.ssh/id_rsa` для приватного ключа) и необходимость создания парольной фразы для дополнительной защиты ключа. # Шаг 2: Копирование публичного ключа на сервер Теперь необходимо скопировать публичный ключ (обычно `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) на сервер, чтобы он знал, что разрешить подключение от вас. Это можно сделать несколькими способами, самый простой — использовать команду `ssh-copy-id`: ```bash ssh-copy-id пользователь@адрес_сервера ``` Вам потребуется ввести пароль для вашей учётной записи на сервере. `ssh-copy-id` автоматически добавит ваш публичный ключ в файл `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` на сервере, что разрешит подключения с использованием соответствующего приватного ключа. Если `ssh-copy-id` недоступен или вы хотите сделать это вручную, можно добавить публичный ключ на сервер, скопировав его содержимое и вручную добавив в `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` на сервере (предполагается, что вы имеете доступ к серверу): ```bash cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh пользователь@адрес_сервера \\"mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\\" ``` # Шаг 3: Подключение к серверу с использованием SSH ключа Теперь подключитесь к серверу, используя SSH с вашим приватным ключом: ```bash ssh пользователь@адрес_сервера ``` Если вы использовали парольную фразу при создании ключа, вам может потребоваться ввести её. Если всё настроено правильно, вы будете успешно авторизованы на сервере без необходимости вводить пароль для учётной записи на сервере. # Дополнительные настройки - **Настройка файла `~/.ssh/config`**: Для упрощения подключения можно настроить файл конфигурации SSH на клиенте, чтобы не указывать каждый раз имя пользователя, адрес сервера и используемый ключ. Пример настройки для конкретного сервера: ```bash Host myserver HostName адрес_сервера User пользователь IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa ``` После этого можно будет подключаться, используя просто имя хоста: ```bash ssh myserver ``` Следуя этим шагам, вы сможете безопасно подключаться к серверу по SSH, используя ключевую аутентификацию вместо паролей."},{"prompt":"Как указать путь до папки с authorized keys при подключении с ssh и порт","completion":"Для указания конкретного пути к файлу с авторизованными ключами (`authorized_keys`) и порта при подключении по SSH напрямую через командную строку не работает, потому что SSH клиент и сервер автоматически используют стандартные пути и порты. Файл `authorized_keys` ожидается в папке `~/.ssh/` на стороне сервера, а стандартный порт для SSH — 22. Однако, вы можете указать порт при подключении, а путь к файлу с авторизованными ключами на клиенте можно настроить в файле конфигурации SSH на вашем компьютере, если это необходимо из-за использования нестандартной конфигурации на сервере. # Указание порта при подключении Для подключения к серверу по SSH на нестандартном порту, используйте ключ `-p` в команде `ssh`: ```sh ssh -p номер_порта пользователь@адрес_сервера ``` # Настройка файла конфигурации SSH на клиенте Конфигурационный файл SSH на клиенте, обычно расположенный в `~/.ssh/config`, может быть настроен для использования определённых параметров подключения для разных серверов, включая порт. В этом файле также можно указать путь к приватному ключу для использования при подключении, но изменить путь к `authorized_keys` на сервере через конфигурацию клиента нельзя, так как это управляется конфигурацией самого SSH сервера. Пример настройки для определённого сервера: ```ssh_config Host имя_хоста HostName адрес_сервера Port номер_порта User пользователь IdentityFile ~/.ssh/мой_ключ ``` В этой конфигурации: - `Host имя_хоста` — псевдоним для упрощения команды подключения. - `HostName` — реальный адрес сервера. - `Port` — порт, который нужно использовать для подключения. - `User` — имя пользователя для подключения. - `IdentityFile` — путь к файлу личного ключа для аутентификации. Чтобы изменить путь к файлу `authorized_keys` на сервере, вам нужно будет изменить конфигурацию самого SSH сервера (обычно в файле `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`), указав другой `AuthorizedKeysFile`, но это изменение повлияет на обработку всех ключей авторизации на сервере и должно выполняться с осторожностью."},{"prompt":"SALAM","completion":"Wa Alaikum Assalam!

(Prinzip der Polykratie) Nenne ihre Ämter und wann und wie sie mit ihm konkurriert haben.","completion":"Das NS-Regime in Deutschland, das von 1933 bis 1945 existierte, war geprägt von starkem internen Wettbewerb und Machtkämpfen innerhalb der Führungsriege. Das Prinzip der Polykratie, also der parallelen Existenz mehrerer Machtzentren, führte dazu, dass viele hochrangige NS-Funktionäre miteinander um Einfluss und Zuständigkeiten konkurrierten. Hermann Göring, eine der prominentesten Figuren im Dritten Reich, hatte mehrere Rivalen, die in unterschiedlichen Bereichen mit ihm um Macht und Einfluss ringten. Zu diesen Personen gehörten: 1. **Heinrich Himmler** - Als Reichsführer-SS und Chef der deutschen Polizei hatte Himmler umfangreiche Machtbefugnisse, die in direkter Konkurrenz zu Görings Einflussbereichen standen. Himmlers Rolle bei der Gründung und Ausweitung der SS und seiner Kontrolle über die Gestapo machten ihn zu einem der mächtigsten Männer im NS-Staat. Die Konkurrenz zwischen Himmler und Göring zeigte sich beispielsweise in der Errichtung der Konzentrationslager, die zunächst unter Görings Verantwortung als Preußischer Innenminister fielen, bevor sie in den Zuständigkeitsbereich der SS übergingen. 2. **Joseph Goebbels** - Als Propagandaminister hatte Goebbels maßgeblichen Einfluss auf die öffentliche Meinung und spielte eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Manipulation der Massen im Sinne der NS-Ideologie. Obwohl Goebbels und Göring in einigen Aspekten zusammenarbeiteten, um die Ziele des Regimes zu fördern, gab es auch Konkurrenz um die mediale Darstellung ihrer Person und um Einfluss innerhalb der Partei. 3. **Albert Speer** - Ursprünglich Hitlers Lieblingsarchitekt, stieg Speer später zum Rüstungsminister auf und wurde für die Steigerung der deutschen Kriegsproduktion verantwortlich. Speer konkurrierte mit Göring, der als Beauftragter für den Vierjahresplan ursprünglich für die Steuerung der Kriegswirtschaft zuständig war. Speers Fähigkeit, die Rüstungsproduktion erheblich zu steigern, brachte ihm Hitlers Gunst ein, während Göring an Einfluss verlor. 4. **Martin Bormann** - Als Leiter der Parteikanzlei und einer von Hitlers engsten Vertrauten hatte Bormann großen Einfluss auf den Zugang zu Hitler. Seine Position ermöglichte es ihm, Informationen und Anweisungen zu filtern, was ihm indirekt Macht über andere hohe NS-Funktionäre gab, einschließlich Göring. Bormann nutzte seine Position geschickt, um seinen eigenen Einfluss zu stärken und gleichzeitig den seiner Rivalen, einschließlich Görings, zu schwächen. Diese Dynamik der internen Machtkämpfe und Rivalitäten führte zu einer ineffizienten und teilweise chaotischen Verwaltungsstruktur innerhalb des NS-Staates. Die Konkurrenz zwischen hochrangigen NS-Führern wie Göring und seinen Rivalen war ein charakteristisches Merkmal des Regierungssystems unter Hitler und trug zur allgemeinen Brutalität und zu den

1:24 drahtzieher göring hatte sich chancen 1:26 für die nachfolger ausgerechnet doch 1:29 hitler übernimmt das amt selbst und 1:32 speist seinen machthungrigen basalen mit 1:34 dem titel generalfeldmarschall 1:37 der lässt sich nun in den zwei fronten 1:40 krieg hineinziehen den er eigentlich 1:42 verhindern wollte 1:43 [Musik] 1:48 während seine bombe polen attackieren 1:51

4:03 [Musik] 4:12 in dünkirchen erleidet görings seine 4:15 erste schlappe weil ein ganzes 4:17 britisches chor fast ungeschoren 4:19 entkommen kann 4:22 die versehentliche bombardierung 4:24 rotterdams wird zum fanal für einen 4:27 mörderischen luftkrieg 4:29 doch im freudenrausch des sieges über 4:32 frankreich gehen solche fehlleistungen 4:34 unter göring preist hitler als größten 4:38

oder cranachs vinci 5:29 oder cézanne was ihm gefällt bekommt er 5:32 [Musik] 5:41 schließlich lässt er anweisungen die ihn 5:44 europaweit den jüdischen besitz in die 5:47 hände spielen auch in brüssel und 5:50 amsterdam ist auf interessante objekte 5:52 gestoßen die er sich nicht entgehen 5:54 lassen will 5:55 insgesamt traf der kunstschätze im wert 5:58 von mehreren hundert millionen mark

halbherzigen unternehmen 6:48 das görings flieger völlig überfordert 6:58 london bleibt als ziel zunächst 7:00 ausgespart 7:02 zunächst 7:03 [Musik] 7:06 doch churchill hält dagegen auch wenn 7:09 göring noch so viele bombe staffeln über 7:11 den kanal schickt 7:19 [Musik] 7:28 der traum von der luft herrschaft zur 7:31 platzt unter den primaten der britischen 7:33 ableger 7:34 bis oktober 40

noch so verwegene kampfeinsätze können 8:12 die überlegenheit der britischen 8:13 maschinen nicht wettmachen für den 8:16 pflegern wächst die unzufriedenheit 8:17 [Musik] 8:20 als ich dann raus kam zur front und die 8:22 schlacht von england über den höhepunkt 8:23 eigentlich weg war da fängt man an zu 8:27 zweifeln was ist eigentlich mit unserer 8:29 führung aber wir haben es eigentlich 8:30 nicht in görings angerechnet damals 8:32 sondern wir haben gesagt dass die 8:33 schlechte schlechte militärische führung 8:36 diverse haben dass also alle schiffe die 8:38 kraft von england war echt

Aufgabe ist jetzt: Weise am Beispiel Hermann Görings den Charakter von Satrapie und Polykratie nach! und sage welche Ämter er ab 1933 übernimmt! (alles in stichpunkten) finde Beispiele in hermann görings leben wo er willkür ausübt","completion":"# Hermann Göring und das NS-Regime: Satrapie und Polykratie **Charakter von Satrapie:** - Absolutistische Herrschaft eines Einzelnen innerhalb eines Teilbereichs - Große Autonomie und quasi-monarchische Machtbefugnisse - Willkürliche Ausübung von Macht ohne klare rechtliche oder moralische Grenzen **Charakter von Polykratie:** - Gleichzeitige Existenz mehrerer Machtzentren mit überlappenden Zuständigkeiten - Interner Wettbewerb und Machtkämpfe zwischen Führungsmitgliedern - Fehlende Koordination und Konkurrenz statt kooperativer Entscheidungsfindung **Ämter von Hermann Göring ab 1933:** - Präsident des Reichstags - Ministerpräsident von Preußen - Reichsminister der Luftfahrt - Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe - Beauftragter für den Vierjahresplan - Reichswald- und Reichsjägermeister - Präsident des Preußischen Staatsrats **Beispiele für Görings willkürliche Macht:** 1. **Errichtung der ersten Konzentrationslager:** - Als Preußischer Ministerpräsident die Einrichtung der ersten Konzentrationslager initiiert, oft ohne rechtliche Basis und unter Missachtung von Menschenrechten. 2. **Ausschaltung politischer Gegner:** - Nutzung seines Einflusses und seiner Positionen, um politische Gegner willkürlich zu verfolgen, verhaften und in vielen Fällen ermorden zu lassen. 3. **Raub von Kunst und Eigentum:** - Als begeisterter Sammler von Kunst, nutzte Göring seine Position, um Kunstwerke jüdischer Bürger und besetzter Gebiete für seine Sammlungen zu rauben. 4. **Vierjahresplan:** - Übernahm maßgebliche Kontrolle über die deutsche Wirtschaft mit dem Ziel, Deutschland auf einen Krieg vorzubereiten, inklusive willkürlicher Entscheidungen über Einsatz von Ressourcen. 5. **Willkür in militärischen Entscheidungen:** - Als Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe traf Göring hochriskante und strategisch fragwürdige Entscheidungen, insbesondere während der Luftschlacht um England und der Versorgung der 6. Armee in Stalingrad, oft basierend auf persönlichem Glauben an die eigene Unfehlbarkeit. 6. **Persönliche Bereicherung:** - Nutzte seine vielfältigen Ämter und Einflüsse, um sich persönlich zu bereichern und einen extravaganten Lebensstil zu führen, der sich in seiner Residenz Carinhall und umfangreichen Kunstsammlungen manifestierte. Diese Beispiele zeigen die Merkmale von Satrapie und Polykratie im NS-Regime auf, wo Göring mit extremen Machtfülle ausgestattet war und häufig Willkür ausübte, während das Nebeneinander von Machtzentren zu ineffizienter Führung und brutalen Machtkämpfen führte."},{"prompt":"ich schicke dir 3 teile von einem doku Teil 1: 0:00 wortgewaltiger machtmensch 0:03 rücksichtsloser ämter sammler

Beispiele, die sein willkürliches Handeln im Rahmen seiner vielfältigen Ämter und Machtpositionen im NS-Staat belegen: 1. **Gründung der Gestapo und der ersten Konzentrationslager**: Als Ministerpräsident von Preußen initiierte Göring die Gründung der Geheimen Staatspolizei (Gestapo) und war entscheidend an der Errichtung der ersten Konzentrationslager beteiligt, was seine Bereitschaft zeigt, staatliche Macht missbräuchlich und willkürlich gegen politische Gegner einzusetzen. 2. **Beteiligung am Reichstagsbrand und dessen Folgen**: Görings unmittelbare Involvierung beim Reichstagsbrand und die anschließende willkürliche Verhaftungswelle von Kommunisten und anderen politischen Gegnern unterstreichen sein Machtkalkül, das an keine rechtlichen oder moralischen Grenzen gebunden war. 3. **Missbrauch von Staatsressourcen für persönliche Bereicherung**: Görings extravagantem Lebensstil und seiner Sammelleidenschaft für Kunst und Luxusgüter lag oft die willkürliche Aneignung von Vermögen jüdischer Bürger und aus besetzten Gebieten zugrunde. Er nutzte seine Positionen, um zum einen seine persönliche Kunstsammlung zu mehren und zum anderen seinen Reichtum und seinen Einfluss auszubauen. 4. **Fehlentscheidungen als Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe**: Görings Entscheidungen im Rahmen seiner Rolle als Luftwaffenoberbefehlshaber, insbesondere während der Luftschlacht um England und der missglückten Luftbrücke nach Stalingrad, illustrieren eine Mischung aus Überheblichkeit und strategischer Inkompetenz. Seine Versprechen und Maßnahmen erscheinen oft willkürlich und nicht auf realistischen Einschätzungen beruhend. 5. **Willkürliche politische Entscheidungen und Repressionen**: Görings Aktivitäten als hochrangiger NS-Funktionär, darunter die Verfolgung von Juden und die Einrichtung von Zwangsarbeitslagern, zeigen seine skrupellose Ausübung von Macht, ohne Rücksicht auf Gesetze, Ethik oder die Betroffenen selbst. 6. **Manipulation und Intrigen innerhalb der NSDAP**: Görings Fähigkeit, sich in der NSDAP-Hierarchie durch Intrigen und Machtkämpfe zu behaupten, bezeugt seinen willkürlichen Umgang mit Macht und Einfluss, um seine persönlichen und politischen Ziele durchzusetzen. Diese Beispiele aus der Dokumentation verdeutlichen, dass Görings Handeln in vielen Beziehungen durch eine willkürliche Ausübung von Macht, persönliche Bereicherung und skrupellose Verfolgung seiner Interessen gekennzeichnet war, wodurch die Prinzipien von Satrapie und Polykratie im NS-Regime unterstrichen werden."},{"prompt":"python lexer implemented in rust lang","completion":"Implementing a Python lexer in Rust can be a great way to leverage Rust\'s performance and memory safety features. Here\'s a basic implementation to get you started. This lexer will be simplistic and cover just a fundamental subset of Python\'s syntax, such as integers, floats, identifiers, and a few operators. This example aims to introduce you to the concept rather than providing a full-featured lexer. # Step 1: Define Token Types First, define the types of tokens that the lexer will recognize. This example includes a minimal set for demonstration purposes. ```rust #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)] enum TokenType { Integer(i64), Float(f64), Identifier(String), Plus, Minus, Multiply, Divide, LeftParen, RightParen, Eof, // Add other tokens as needed } #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)] struct Token { token_type: TokenType, lexeme: String, } ``` # Step 2: Implement the Lexer The lexer\'s job is to take a source string and break it down into a list of tokens. ```rust struct Lexer { source: String, current_position: usize, } impl Lexer { fn new(source: String) -> Lexer { Lexer { source, current_position: 0, } } fn is_at_end(&self) -> bool { self.current_position >= self.source.len() } fn advance(&mut self) -> char { let mut iter = self.source[self.current_position..].char_indices(); let (_, current_char) = iter.next().unwrap_or((0, \'0\')); let (next_position, _) = iter.next().unwrap_or((1, \'0\')); self.current_position += next_position; current_char } fn peek(&self) -> char { self.source.chars().nth(self.current_position).unwrap_or(\'0\') } fn create_token(&self, token_type: TokenType) -> Token { Token { token_type, lexeme: String::new(), // For simplicity, not handling lexeme extraction } } fn tokenize(&mut self) -> Vec<Token> { let mut tokens = Vec::new(); while !self.is_at_end() { let c = self.advance(); let token_type = match c { \'+\' => TokenType::Plus, \'-\' => TokenType::Minus, \'*\' => TokenType::Multiply, \'/\' => TokenType::Divide, \'(\' => TokenType::LeftParen, \')\' => TokenType::RightParen, \'0\'..=\'9\' => self.number(), _ if c.is_alphabetic() => self.identifier(), _ => continue, // Skip unrecognized characters or whitespace }; tokens.push(self.create_token(token_type)); } tokens.push(self.create_token(TokenType::Eof)); tokens } fn number(&mut self) -> TokenType { TokenType::Integer(0) // Placeholder, implement numeric parsing } fn identifier(&mut self) -> TokenType { TokenType::Identifier(String::new()) // Placeholder, implement identifier parsing } } ``` # Step 3: Parsing Numbers and Identifiers The `number` and `identifier` functions are placeholders where you should implement the logic for parsing numbers (including handling floats) and identifiers. # Use the Lexer Here\'s how you might use the lexer: ```rust fn main() { let mut lexer = Lexer::new(\\"3 + 4 * (2 - 1)\\".to_string()); let tokens = lexer.tokenize(); println!(\\"{:?}\\", tokens); } ``` This code doesn\'t handle every edge case and doesn\'t implement the parsing of numbers and identifiers completely. The goal is to give you a starting point. Parsing numbers would involve collecting digits (and possibly a decimal point for floats) until a non-digit is encountered, while parsing identifiers would involve collecting alphanumeric characters and underscores. Expanding this lexer into a full-featured Python lexer would require implementing additional states and rules to accurately reflect Python\'s lexical grammar."},{"prompt":"lex type comment in this lexer","completion":"Including the ability to recognize and possibly ignore comments is an important feature for a lexer, especially for programming languages like Python where comments are used extensively for documentation and code explanation. In Python, a comment starts with a `#` and goes until the end of the line. To incorporate comment recognition into our lexer, we can add a method for handling comments and updating the tokenization method to recognize the `#` character as the start of a comment. Let’s extend our example by adding support for comments in the lexer. # Step 1: Update `TokenType` Enum First, you might want to consider how you\'ll handle comments. For simplicity, in this example, we\'ll just skip over them, but you could also add a `Comment(String)` variant to the `TokenType` enum if you want the lexer to emit tokens for comments. ```rust #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)] enum TokenType { // Previous token types Comment, // If you decide to keep comments as tokens //... } ``` For our purpose here, we won’t emit tokens for comments, so no changes to `TokenType` are required. # Step 2: Add Comment Handling to the Lexer We’ll add a method to the `Lexer` struct to handle comments. This method will consume characters until it reaches the end of a line, effectively skipping over the comment. ```rust impl Lexer { // Previous methods fn skip_comment(&mut self) { while self.peek() != \'n\' && !self.is_at_end() { self.advance(); } } // Update tokenize method fn tokenize(&mut self) -> Vec<Token> { let mut tokens = Vec::new(); while !self.is_at_end() { let c = self.advance(); let token_type = match c { \'#\' => { self.skip_comment(); continue; // Skip directly to the next iteration }, \'+\' => TokenType::Plus, \'-\' => TokenType::Minus, \'*\' => TokenType::Multiply, \'/\' => TokenType::Divide, \'(\' => TokenType::LeftParen, \')\' => TokenType::RightParen, \'0\'..=\'9\' => self.number(), _ if c.is_alphabetic() => self.identifier(), _ => continue, // Skip unrecognized characters or whitespace }; tokens.push(self.create_token(token_type)); } tokens.push(self.create_token(TokenType::Eof)); tokens } // Placeholder implementations of number() and identifier()... } ``` # Further Considerations In a more complex lexer, you might want more sophisticated handling of different types of comments (e.g., block comments if they were part of the language), or you might even want to capture comment content as tokens for use by a later stage of processing, such as generating documentation from source code comments. However, in Python, comments are straightforward: they start with `#` and continue to the end of the line. With the `skip_comment` method, the lexer will now properly ignore these. Remember, the above implementation does not yet fully parse numbers and identifiers; those functions are placeholders for you to fill in based on how deeply you want to parse different types of numeric literals (e.g., integers, floats) and the specific rules for identifiers in your target language or dialect of Python."},{"prompt":"add support for python \'type comment\'","completion":"In Python, type comments are a special kind of comment used for type hinting, especially before Python 3.5 when type annotations were introduced. They follow the form of a comment that starts with `# type:`. For example: ```python x = some_function() # type: int ``` Even though Python now supports inline type hints, type comments are still in use, especially in codebases that aim to be compatible with older versions of Python. To add support for recognizing type comments specifically in our lexer example, we can modify the `skip_comment` method to differentiate between regular comments and type comments. However, given that typically lexers and parsers (which operate at a higher level) handle semantics such as type hinting, we might just tokenise them differently to ensure they\'re not lost, allowing a parser to handle the specifics. For demonstration purposes, let\'s see how we could adjust our lexer to recognize and emit tokens for type comments: # Step 1: Update `TokenType` Enum First, let\'s add a variant for type comments: ```rust #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)] enum TokenType { // Previous tokens TypeComment(String), Comment(String), // Let\'s also capture regular comments for completeness //... } ``` # Step 2: Distinguish Type Comments in Lexing Update the comment handling in the lexer to differentiate type comments from regular comments. ```rust impl Lexer { // Other methods... fn skip_or_capture_comment(&mut self) -> Option<TokenType> { let start_pos = self.current_position; while self.peek() != \'n\' && !self.is_at_end() { self.advance(); } // Capture the comment content let comment_text = self.source[start_pos..self.current_position].trim().to_string(); if comment_text.starts_with(\\"type:\\") { Some(TokenType::TypeComment(comment_text)) } else { Some(TokenType::Comment(comment_text)) } } fn tokenize(&mut self) -> Vec<Token> { let mut tokens = Vec::new(); while !self.is_at_end() { let c = self.advance(); match c { \'#\' => { if let Some(token_type) = self.skip_or_capture_comment() { tokens.push(self.create_token(token_type, String::new())); // In a real scenario, you might want to store the comment text in the token. } }, // Handle other cases... _ => continue, // Skip unrecognized characters or whitespace } } tokens.push(self.create_token(TokenType::Eof, String::new())); tokens } fn create_token(&self, token_type: TokenType, lexeme: String) -> Token { Token { token_type, lexeme } } // Placeholder implementations of number(), identifier(), etc... } ``` # Adjustments for Lexing Comments This modification to the `skip_or_capture_comment` method distinguishes between type comments and regular comments by checking if the comment starts with `type:`. It then generates tokens accordingly. # Further Considerations Remember, a lexer\'s primary responsibility is to tokenize input text. Handling the semantics of different tokens (like understanding what a type comment implies about subsequent code) is generally handled at the parsing or semantic analysis stage. This example shows how you might begin to tokenize these comments differently, laying groundwork for more sophisticated handling in later stages of a compiler or interpreter. Capturing the entire comment content in the token\'s `lexeme` field (not fully implemented in the snippets above, which just use `String::new()`) would allow a parser or later stage to inspect the comment\'s content for type information or other purposes."},{"prompt":"Pourquoi les chats aiment-ils faire tomber des objets","completion":"Les chats aiment faire tomber des objets pour plusieurs raisons, reflétant leur comportement naturel et leurs instincts. Voici les principales raisons : 1. **Curiosité et Exploration** : Les chats sont des créatures très curieuses. Ils explorent le monde autour d\'eux principalement à travers le senti et le toucher. Pousser des objets leur permet de voir comment ces derniers réagissent, ce qui peut être très stimulant pour leur curiosité. 2. **Comportement de Chasse** : Ce comportement peut également être lié à leurs instincts de chasse. Pousser et faire tomber des objets peut simuler l\'action de traquer et de jouer avec une proie. Cela leur permet d\'exercer leurs compétences de chasse, même dans un environnement domestique. 3. **Attention** : Les chats ont vite appris que faire tomber des objets est une manière quasi infaillible d\'attirer l\'attention de leurs propriétaires. Si faire tomber quelque chose les amène à interagir avec vous, ils pourraient être motivés à répéter ce comportement. 4. **Ennui** : Les chats qui n\'ont pas assez de stimulation ou de jouets peuvent se tourner vers leurs environnements immédiats pour se divertir. Faire tomber des objets peut être une manière pour eux de se distraire et de passer le temps. 5. **Marquage de Territoire** : Les pattes des chats ont des glandes qui sécrètent des phéromones, et en touchant des objets, ils peuvent laisser ces marqueurs olfactifs comme une manière de marquer leur territoire. 6. **Réaction Naturelle** : Parfois, le mouvement d\'un objet peut déclencher la réaction naturelle d\'un chat à poursuivre ou à frapper, surtout si l\'objet bouge d\'une manière qui imite une proie. Bien que ce comportement puisse être amusant ou mignon, il peut parfois causer des problèmes si les objets en question sont fragiles ou dangereux. Fournir suffisamment de jouets, d\'activités et de temps de jeu peut aider à prévenir ce comportement en offrant aux chats des alternatives plus sûres et appropriées pour leur curiosité et leur besoin d\'activité."},{"prompt":"请将“Courage was needed by all who set this development in motion, if it was not to be restricted in this way. But when they found this courage, they acted in the context of a political public that had developed in March and April of this year. If the announcement of the états généraux in 1789 had a different effect than in 1615, this was not only due to the specific election procedure and the struc-tural crisis of generalised power, but also to the - above mentioned - actual generalisation of rule, the improved possibility of distributing information and the content of contemporary debates over \'good order\'. The organisation of a political public, however, was not least among the structural preconditions for the Revolution. Altogether, over 100,000 men took part in the election of deputies to the états généraux, some 60,000 of these being members of the Third Estate.26 It would be risky to estimate how many of these latter had taken part in the assemblies. It will suffice here to establish that, in March and April 1789, a large public consultation of the king\'s subjects was held. This was directed at ‘everyone\' - excluding women, servants, the unfree, the mad and the very poor. But even the grievances of the excluded were sometimes made known in the spring and summer of this year. There appeared cahiers of the ‘fourth estate\' and of ‘women\', no matter who their authors were. Many of these cahiers make abundantly clear the structural change in the public sphere. They are directed no longer at the government, but rather at the political public. In June and again in August, two decisive new structural features of this public became clear: the public demonstrations in Versailles and Paris, and the loss of the power basis that could have hemmed it in. Jean Michaud27 per-tinently indicated the importance of the former. According to him, as early as June 1789 there were debates in Versailles in which a wide public took part. Inhabitants of the town were present, but many came each day from Paris, some in carriages but most on foot.28 The crown sought to obstruct this expression, but the guards regiments did not stop anyone from arriving in Versailles. The attendance at these assemblies was not just a passive audience, but, rather, an element of the social context in which the delegates developed their arguments. This manifest and active public created a framework of thinking and action in which ideas previously unheard were expressed for the first time, even if they had already been thought. This meant, however, that even the delegates were no longer mere bearers of those interests that they and their electors would have recognised as their own some months or even weeks before. If the delegates had just soberly considered their material interests, they would scarcely have decided to attack the foundations of former legality - in the revolutionary vocabulary, the ‘abolition of feudalism\' - that they decided on the night of 4-5 August 1789. True, news of the peasant disturbances29 in various districts had given new urgency to demands already contained in the cahiers, and led many to consider whether some of their former privileges might not have to be sacrificed; the session of 4 August had also been previously discussed in the Club Breton. But no one could have foreseen that such a large number of the pillars of the ancien régime would be overthrown in a single sitting, lasting from eight in the evening to two the next morning, to cheers and acclamation. It was quite in the style of the time - precisely when Mesmer\'s electrical apparatus had become the fashion - that Mirabeau told his voters that the process was the result of an electrical frenzy. Without a break, one electrical shock followed another in the Assembly.30 It was one of those situations in which speech is no longer just a means of expression, but a political event that creates facts. When the deputies woke up from their sleep and considered the reaction of their electors, this intoxication evaporated. As the results of the session of 4 August had to be made into formal decisions in the course of the following days, attempts were made to tone them down. Thus ‘feudal\' dues were still ‘abolished\', but only in so far as those who had previously had to pay them now received the right to buy their release from them. Other things, however, such as the purchase of office and the right to inherit offices, the privilege of multiple sinecures in the church, the nobles\' hunting privileges and the tax privileges of towns - privileges that had been hardly won and bitterly defended - were abandoned without contradiction to the applause of the assembly. This ‘noble rush of joy\' (Mirabeau) developed in a public that had been revolutionised in the process of its constitution. The mode of operation of this new social organ can be seen for example in the report of an English doctor. Dr Rigby had arrived in Paris in July 1789, and explained in a letter to his family of 11 August the happenings in Paris and Versailles: We had not been long in Paris when we found that the Palais Royal, a large square lately built by the Duke of Orleans, was the place where all political intelligence was to be obtained; for it was here all persons assembled who took a part in the great political drama - here that political questions were first discussed - and popular resolutions formed and arrangements made; here, as well, that the earliest communications from the National Assembly, which holds its sittings at Versailles, twelve miles from Paris, were received, and that the printed debates of the Assembly were first circulated The address of the Assembly to the King had just been read when we entered the square, and also the spirited debate on the King\'s answer. Mirabeau had been distinguished in both of these, and especially in the latter; the whole place resounded with his praise, and the warmest tribute of applause was 31 paid to the Assembly for its firmness. Rigby mentions an important innovation in this letter. Already in the first few weeks of the Revolution, not only had the number of press organs dramatically risen - a total of 135 new papers were established in Paris alone in the course of the year - not only were new leaflets and posters printed, but the beginning was made of printing at night so as to appear on sale the next morning. During the Revolution, the purchasers of printed matter changed, and with them the marketing strategies of the publishers, but what changed above all was the relationship between press and readership. Because press and public merged into a unity of action, the least events were publicised, and it was left up to readers to assess their significance.32 News spread throughout the kingdom by way of the press, reports of depu-ties, and chance sources of information. This does not mean, however, that the public for social transformation was constituted on the basis of Versailles and Paris. It was, above all, in the countryside that the hopes that had arisen in the previous winter and new year developed from rumour and as a continuation of the resistance of the winter months into a dynamic that was not indepen-dent of the centre, but had its own autonomy. Differently from in the towns, the public in the countryside initially followed quite traditional forms. Even the Great Fear, which led peasants in the Franche-Comté, and then in adjacent regions to the south-east and south-west, to take up arms in late July and early August, was nothing new. This time, however, peasants feared an aristocratic plot - after rumours reached them of the beginnings of emigration - by which all the changes that had been won or were still hoped for would be brought to naught. The Great Fear is also indicative of the structures of the public sphere, showing how in summer 1789 many peasants still received news of the events in Versailles and Paris initially by way of rumour. The revolutionary public was constituted in a variety of different forms. Everywhere, however, this was still without barricades. Paris had seen bar-ricades in 1588, but in 1789 these appeared only for a few hours on 13 July. This fact is immensely significant, showing how ‘the public\' could \'make\' the Revolution because the old system was undefended. This had held already in the spring and summer for the peasant resistance and bread revolts, and in summer and autumn it held for the foundation of the National Assembly and the municipal revolution in Paris. More than a few historians have been led by this to conclude that revolutions led by the bourgeoisie are overwhelmingly peaceful, while those forced by the popular masses are violent. For François Furet and Denis Richet, the period from 1789 to 1791 saw the victories of the eighteenth century, by which they mean that the liberal revolution was the work of an enlightened intellectual élite. Only the popular revolution of 10 August 1792: and the war against Prussia and Austria had brought a temporary halt to the great advance of the bourgeoisie that was eventually to lead to the peaceful [sic] liberalism of the nineteenth century.33 Even if we leave aside here whether the so-called journées of the Revolution, the threat and sometimes reality of violent action in which many people par-ticipated, were indispensable elements of political development or not, it need not be underlined here that the \'liberal revolution\' was able to remain peaceful only because it did not come against violent opposition. The debates of the Constituante could abolish the ancien régime because the streets belonged to the revolutionary public. This predominance did not need to be either won or defended on the barricades.”翻译为中文","completion":"所有启动这一发展的人都需要勇气，如果不想让它受到限制的话。但当他们找到了这种勇气，他们的行动是在当年3月和4月发展起来的政治公众的背景下进行的。 如果1789年三级会议的宣布与1615年有着不同的效果，这不仅是因为特定的选举程序和普遍权力结构危机，还因为规则的实际普及化——上述的——改善了信息分发的可能性以及关于“良序”的当代辩论内容。然而，政治公众的组织无疑是革命结构前提之一。总共，超过100,000名男性参加了三级会议代表的选举，其中约60,000名是第三等级的成员。要估计这些人中有多少人参加了集会是冒险的。在这里足以确定的是，在1789年3月和4月，举行了针对国王臣民的大型公众咨询。这是针对“每个人”的——排除了女性、仆人、非自由人、疯子和非常贫穷的人。但即便如此，被排除者的不满在这一年的春夏之间有时也被人所知。出现了“第四等级”和“女性”的意见书，不管它们的作者是谁。这些意见书充分表明了公共领域的结构性变化。它们不再面向政府，而是面向政治公众。 到了6月和再次到了8月，这个公众的两个决定性新的结构特征变得明确：凡尔赛和巴黎的公共示威活动，以及可能将其限制的权力基础的丧失。让·米尚很恰当地指出了前者的重要性。据他说，早在1789年6月，就在凡尔赛举行了广泛公众参与的辩论。镇上的居民在场，但许多人每天都从巴黎来，一些人坐马车，但大多数人步行。皇室试图阻止这种表达，但卫队没有阻止任何人到达凡尔赛。这些集会的参加者不仅仅是被动的观众，而是，在代表们发展他们的论点的社会背景中的一个元素。这个明显并且活跃的公众创造了一个思考和行动的框架，在这个框架中，以前未曾听闻的想法首次被表达出来，即使它们之前已经被想到。然而，这意味着，即便是代表们也不再仅仅是那些利益的承载者，这些利益是他们和他们的选民几个月甚至几周前还会认为是他们自己的。如果代表们只是冷静地考虑他们的物质利益，他们就几乎不会决定攻击前法律的基础——在革命词汇中，即“废除封建制度”——他们在1789年8月4日至5日的夜间决定了这一点。 的确，各地区农民骚动的消息给意见书中已包含的要求带来了新的紧迫性，并导致许多人考虑是否一些他们以前的特权可能不得不被牺牲；8月4日的会议也曾在布列塔尼俱乐部之前讨论过。但没有人能预见到在一次从傍晚八点持续到第二天凌晨两点的会议中，如此多的古制度的支柱会在欢呼和喝彩中被推翻。这完全是当时的风格——正当梅斯默的电器成为时尚之时——米拉波对他的选民说，这个过程是电磁狂热的结果。在大会上，一个接一个的电击毫不停歇。这是那些情况之一，在这些情况下，言论不再仅仅是表达的手段，而是创造事实的政治事件。当代表们从睡梦中醒来，考虑他们的选民的反应时，这种陶醉消散了。由于接下来的几天中8月4日会议的结果必须被制定成正式的决定，人们试图给它们降调。因此，“封建”义务仍然被“废除”，但只是在那些以前必须支付它们的人现在获得了购买自己解脱它们的权利的程度上。然而，其他事情，例如购买官职和官职继承权、教会中多项闲职的特权、贵族的狩猎特权和城镇的税收特权——这些曾经艰难获得并被苦苦捍卫的特权——都毫无矛盾地被大会的掌声所放弃。在其构成过程中被革命化的公众中发展出的这种“高贵的喜悦冲动”（米拉波）。 这个新的社会器官的操作方式可以从一位英国医生的报告中看出。里格比医生于1789年7月到达巴黎，并在8月11日给他的家人的信中解释了巴黎和凡尔赛的事件： 我们刚到巴黎不久，就发现奥尔良公爵新近建造的一个大广场，皇家宫殿，是获得所有政治情报的地方；因为是在这里，所有参与这场伟大政治戏剧的人聚集在一起——这里首先讨论政治问题——并形成流行的决议和安排；也是在这里，从国民议会那里收到的最早的通讯被接收，而国民议会的会议就在离巴黎十二英里的凡尔赛举行，印刷的辩论稿也是在这里首先流传的 当我们进入广场时，刚刚宣读了议会对国王的呼吁，以及对国王回答的激烈辩论。米拉波在这两个方面都很突出，尤其是在后者中；整个地方充满了对他的赞扬，对议会坚定性的最热烈的称赞也因此而来。 里格比在这封信中提到了一个重要的创新。在革命的最初几周，不仅巴黎 alone 总共有135份新报纸创立——总计，在这一年内，不仅新的传单和海报被印刷出来，而且开始了夜间印刷，以便第二天早上出售。 在革命期间，印刷品的购买者发生了变化，与之相伴的是出版商的市场策略，但最重要的是，出版社和读者之间的关系发生了变化。因为出版社和公众融为一体，成为行动的统一体，最小的事件都被公开，并且留给读者来评估它们的意义。 新闻通过报纸、代表的报告和偶然的信息来源在整个王国内传播。然而，这并不意味着，社会转型的公众是基于凡尔赛和巴黎建立的。最重要的是，在农村，之前冬天和新年里产生的希望从谣言中发展出来，并作为冬季月份抵抗的延续发展成了一种动力，这种动力虽然不独立于中心，但拥有自己的自治性。与城镇不同，农村的公众最初遵循相当传统的形式。即使是导致法兰西-孔泰地区的农民在7月末和8月初拿起武器，然后在东南和西南相邻地区的大恐惧，也并不是新鲜事。不过，这一次，农民们担心贵族阴谋——在他们听到开始移民的谣言后——通过这种方式，所有已经赢得或仍然希望获得的变化都将化为乌有。大恐惧还反映了公共领域的结构，表明在1789年夏天，许多农民最初是通过谣言获知凡尔赛和巴黎事件的消息。革命公众以多种不同的形式构成。 然而，到处都还没有设立路障。巴黎在1588年见过路障，但在1789年，这些只在7月13日出现了几个小时。这一事实极其重要，显示了“公众”是如何“制造”革命的，因为旧制度是无防备的。这已经在春季和夏季对于农民抵抗和面包暴动如此，在夏季和秋季对于国民议会的建立和巴黎市政革命如此。不少历史学家由此得出结论，由资产阶级领导的革命大都是和平的，而由平民阶级强迫的革命是暴力的。对于弗朗索瓦·富雷和丹尼斯·里谢来说，1789年至1791年的时期见证了十八世纪的胜利，他们的意思是，自由主义革命是由一个开明的知识分子精英完成的。只有1792年8月10日的人民革命： 和对普鲁士和奥地利的战争才暂时中断了资产阶级的伟大进步，这最终将导致十九世纪的和平[引用]自由主义。即使我们在这里暂且不论所谓的革命日子，其中很多人参与的威胁甚至暴力行动是政治发展不可或缺的元素与否，也无需强调，‘自由主义革命’之所以能够保持和平，仅仅是因为它没有遇到暴力反对。立宪议会的辩论之所以能够废除旧制度，是因为街道属于革命公众。这种优势无需在路障上赢得或防守。"},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Currency exchange rates fluctuate due to various factors, including economic indicators, market speculation, and changes in supply and demand.

However, this specific range does not capture the full extent of the EUR/USD exchange rate movements over that period. The historical EUR/USD exchange rate has varied widely due to numerous factors such as economic policies, inflation rates, interest rate differentials between the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, political stability, and global economic conditions. The highest historical exchange rate for the EUR/USD pair occurred in the years following its inception (the Euro was introduced in 1999) and reached its peak value above 1.50 in 2008. Conversely, the lowest points were closer to 0.82-0.85, seen in the early 2000s. Given the broad swings, stating an average exchange rate over 20 years requires calculating the mean of daily, monthly, or yearly closing rates over that period. While the range you’ve asked about (i.e., 0.92 to 0.96 EUR for 1 USD) is certainly within the historical fluctuation spectrum, the true average would likely be higher considering periods when the Euro was stronger against the Dollar. In general, for an accurate average, one would need to accumulate all the relevant data points over the selected period and calculate the mean. Given the Euro\'s strength against the Dollar has often been above parity (1.00) throughout its history, the average over the last 20 years would likely reflect this, potentially positioning the average exchange rate somewhat above 1.00 EUR for 1 USD, rather than within the 0.92 to 0.96 range. For precise analysis or specific financial calculations, accessing historical exchange rate databases or financial analysis platforms would be necessary for the detailed data."},{"prompt":"can you proofread this for me please and remove things which do not make sense or are repeated. Once finished please list the word count at the end with initial and final count:Abstract Since video games are becoming an increasingly important part of modern culture, academics are focusing their attention on the psychological dynamics that are inherent in the medium. Examining the psychological, emotional, and social effects of gaming, this dissertation explores the complex interaction between video games and human psychology. In line with theories like Self-Determination Theory, it explores the dual nature of video gaming, acknowledging its capacity to satisfy the basic psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and social connection. At the same time, it looks at the range of psychological effects that gaming can have, from positive effects like enhanced problem-solving and spatial awareness to negative effects like addiction and social isolation. A particular focus is on video gaming in therapeutic settings, emphasising the imaginative use of gamification and serious games to treat mental health conditions, improve cognitive abilities, and improve emotional wellbeing. Furthermore, it investigates how technology developments such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) can improve the therapeutic efficacy of game-based interventions and deepen the level of game immersion. This dissertation contributes to a balanced discourse on integrating video games into therapeutic landscapes and highlights their potential as sophisticated tools for bolstering psychological resilience and well-being. It advocates for a nuanced and informed approach to video gaming, emphasising the importance of leveraging its psychological benefits while remaining cautious of its dangers. Objectives The objectives of this research are to: • Completing a thorough review of the body of research on the psychological effects of video games, emphasising the social, emotional, and cognitive aspects. • Utilising a multifaceted framework and well-established psychological theories such as Uses and Gratifications Theory and Self-Determination Theory to investigate the core motivations underlying video gaming. • Examining the conflicting findings of video games, with a focus on cognitive improvements and a recognition of possible negative effects such gaming addiction and its effects on relationships with others and physical health. • Studying how new technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) might improve immersive gaming experiences and have a significant effect on psychiatric therapies. • Highlighting the distinctive characteristics that distinguish video gaming as a field of research in human psychology by drawing comparisons and contrasts between the psychological effects of gaming and other digital interactions. Preface To comprehend the profound impact of video games on human psychology, two fundamental questions must be addressed sequentially: first, do the interactive and immersive environments of video games could influence and modify human cognitive functions, emotional states, and social behaviours? Second, do these influences manifest themselves in people’s daily lives and psychological well-being? Unless the first question is answered completely, delving into the effects of the second remains an abstract endeavour. My goal when I started this dissertation was to investigate video gaming, which is a prevalent aspect of modern society and daily existence. Under the research emphasis “The Interplay of Video Games and Human Psychology: Insights into Motivations, Effects, and Therapeutic Potentials,” I set out to unravel the complexity of the dynamic interaction between psychology and video games. My inspiration came from my fascination with the ways in which virtual environments affect behaviour, cognition, and emotional health as well as my desire to provide a thorough analysis that considers psychological reasons for gaming, its effects, and its emerging role in therapeutic settings. My academic and personal interests in video games, together with the debates about their advantages and disadvantages, motivated me to add to the continuing discussion about video games and psychology. This dissertation addresses knowledge gaps, aims to clarify the complex links between video gaming and psychological effects, and lays the foundation for future study by combining theoretical inquiry with a thorough evaluation of previous studies. The goal of this in-depth analysis is to provide fresh perspectives on the complex relationships between human psychology and video games. This dissertation combines theoretical concepts and analysis with a comprehensive evaluation of recent research to shed light on the complex relationships between video gaming and psychological impacts. It seeks to fill in knowledge gaps and synthesise existing knowledge to pave the way for future study. The pieces are arranged according to several main themes: Understanding Player Motivation: In general, studies on player motivation point to a wide range of variables that affect gamers’ engagement with video games. The research describes how video games fulfil basic human needs by offering a platform for enjoyment, escape, and a sense of success. It builds on psychology theories of motivation. It also shows how these digital platforms satisfy the basic psychological needs of players for competence, which is achieved through mastery of skills and challenges; autonomy, which gives players control over their actions and environment; and social connection, which is achieved through relationship-building and group experiences. This section suggests complex factors that drive players to video games beyond basic entertainment, such as the complicated psychological areas where real-life wants and aspirations could be addressed and fulfilled. Effects of Video Gaming on Mental Health: Examining how gaming affects mental health, this dissertation offers a fair analysis that highlights the conflicting effects of gaming. It includes a review of the literature that highlights the psychological benefits of video gaming, such as lowered stress levels, higher mood, and cognitive benefits like longer attention spans, sharper problem-solving skills, and greater mental flexibility. On the other hand, it also draws attention to the negative consequences that could arise, such as addiction, behavioural problems, and social isolation, emphasising the wide range of individual reactions to gaming. To provide a coherent knowledge of the diverse consequences of gaming, this critical research supports a detailed interpretation of how video games affect mental health, merging the positive with the negative. The Impact of Gaming on Emotions and Cognitive Development: This dissertation delves deeper into the topic of video games as powerful tools for emotional involvement and cognitive development. It describes how playing video games may be a rich source of emotional development, empathy, and resilience because they provide a platform for players to feel, express, and control their feelings. Additionally, it looks at how games test and improve cognitive processes, showing how they can improve cognitive abilities including attention, memory, and spatial awareness. In this section, it is recommended that video games, because of their interactive nature, can have a substantial impact on psychological development and serve as dynamic venues for emotional exploration and intellectual advancement. Therapeutic Applications and Potentials: This section of the dissertation describes how video games are being included in mental health therapies more and more, providing a convincing analysis of therapeutic aspects. It covers a wide range of therapeutic applications, such as social skills development for autism spectrum disorders and cognitive-behavioural techniques targeted at psychiatric concerns or physical injury rehabilitation. The research highlights how adaptable video games may be as therapeutic tools, providing fresh approaches to involvement, education, and recovery. Ethical Considerations and Future Directions: Finally, the dissertation discusses the ethical implications of video games in psychological settings. It emphasises the importance of ethical mindfulness, particularly when dealing with vulnerable populations, in preventing exploitation and ensuring the good use of video games. It also speculates on video games’ future trajectories in sociological, technological, and psychological areas, promoting more research to better comprehend and utilise their potential. The dissertation weaves together various aspects to form a detailed portrayal of the video gaming phenomenon: motivation, mental health, emotional and cognitive impact, therapeutic applications, and ethical implications. It presents video games as diverse tools with important psychological ramifications for people, offering a fundamental tool that emphasises the close relationship between virtual gaming environments and mental health, growth, and innovative treatment approaches. Introduction Background of the Study The complex interplay of video games and human psychology spans numerous aspects, including motives, impacts, and potential for therapy. This investigation takes place during the dawn of a new digital era, in which video games go beyond mere amusement and have a substantial impact on the cognitive, emotional, and social aspects of the human experience (Granic, Lobel, and Engels, 2014). The growing interest in this interplay is not unjustified, as the global increase in video game usage necessitates a more in-depth investigation of their impact on human behaviour, mental health, and psychological wellbeing. The motivational reasons that drive people to participate in video games are central to the investigation. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) provides a solid framework for understanding these reasons, arguing that video games provide core psychological demands for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, impacting well-being and engagement (Ryan, Rigby, and Przybylski, 2006). This consistency with intrinsic needs emphasises the profound psychological roots of gaming incentives and opens possibilities for using these processes in supportive or therapeutic settings. Video games have a wide range of effects on human psychology, contradicting simplistic narratives that have traditionally portrayed video games negatively. Recent research suggests that video games can improve cognitive skills such as problem-solving, spatial navigation, and multitasking (Bavelier, Green, Pouget, and Schrater, 2012). Furthermore, video games provide unique social integration opportunities, which may build a sense of community and belonging among players (Domahidi, Festl, and Quandt, 2014). However, given the limitations of existing information, it is critical to balance this viewpoint by recognising the potential risks and negative impacts of excessive gaming, such as addiction and the displacement of real-life interactions (Kuss & Griffiths, 2012). The therapeutic potential of video games represents a new frontier in psychological intervention. The concept of “serious games” - video games created for objectives other than pleasure, such as education, health improvement, or therapy - has received significant attention (Connolly et al., 2012). These games are increasingly recognised for their ability to serve as new tools in cognitive-behavioural therapy, rehabilitation, and social skills training, providing entertaining, cost-effective, and accessible answers to a wide range of psychological difficulties (Fleming et al., 2017). An in-depth study of the relationship between video games and psychology necessitates a foundation based on current research and complex expertise. This means engaging with both scholarly evaluations and primary sources, delving beyond the available literature to discover the intricacies of this relationship. In this way, the study is consistent with current research procedures, employing both quantitative and qualitative approaches to gain a thorough understanding of the occurrences under consideration (Bryant, 2015). In conclusion, the relationship between video games and human psychology presents a substantial area for academic exploration, encompassing drives, outcomes, and therapeutic opportunities. This study intends to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role of video games in modern society by incorporating motivational theories, acknowledging gaming’s multiple effects, and recognising its potential for therapeutic intervention. In doing so, it acknowledges the limitations of current knowledge while setting the way for future research areas that bridge the gap between theory and practice. Purpose of The Project This research project seeks to delve deeply into the complex interaction between video games and human psychology, unveiling the numerous motivations for gaming, its various effects on individuals, and its promising therapeutic potentials. This project aims to find unique insights into gamers’ psychological driving forces and the potential of video games as therapeutic tools by researching how psychological principles impact gaming habits and how video games can improve mental health and behavioural results. Furthermore, it attempts to question generally accepted assumptions about video gaming by delving into its intricacies beyond simply amusement, with the goal of achieving a thorough understanding that bridges the gap between theory and practical application in therapeutic settings. Structure of the Dissertation This research will begin by establishing theoretical frameworks that connect video game mechanics to psychological theories, beginning with an examination of the psychological reasons driving gaming. It will investigate the psychological effects of video games on individuals, both positive and negative, using cognitive, behavioural, and affective perspectives. The research will continue to investigate video game’s therapeutic potentials, focusing on how they are being integrated into mental health initiatives and treatment regimens. A critical examination of approaches used to examine the relationship between video games and psychology will follow, highlighting the project’s use of both qualitative and quantitative research methods. The dissertation will examine recent developments in the field, compare theoretical understanding with empirical findings, and consider future options for incorporating video games into psychological well-being before concluding. Throughout, the project seeks to provide novel understandings, supported by thorough investigation and thorough comprehension, into the intricate dynamics of human psychology and video games. Methodology Research Design To provide a thorough understanding of how video games affect human psychology, the underlying motivations for their use, and any potential therapeutic benefits, the research design for this dissertation project, “The Interplay of Video Games and Human Psychology: An Insight into Motivations, Effects, and Therapeutic Potentials,” is primarily exploratory and integrative. It makes use of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Surveys that are given to players across a range of demographics will be used to collect quantitative data on gaming habits, psychological affects, and perceived motivational elements. Semi-structured interviews with gaming psychologists, therapists who use video games in treatment, and gamers who have suffered from the psychological effects of gaming will provide qualitative insights. Using personal narratives, the mixed-methods approach enables a robust analysis that not only reveals statistical significance but also humanises the data. In addition, the research will incorporate a methodical examination of current literature, covering academic publications and primary sources, to guarantee an extensive inquiry beyond the materials supplied, in accordance with contemporary research patterns and sophisticated scholarship in the domain. This design considers the intricacy of the topic, guaranteeing appropriate communication of the results and consistent advancement of the discourse about video games and psychology. Data Collection Methods A variety of data gathering techniques are used to guarantee a thorough comprehension of the subject matter. The main techniques employed are semi-structured interviews and focus groups. These methods provide a thorough investigation of player motivations, the psychological toll that gaming takes, and possible therapeutic advantages. To guarantee a diversity of viewpoints, participants are chosen based on their different gaming experiences. Furthermore, larger-scale data collection is accomplished using quantitative techniques like surveys and questionnaires, which allow for the identification of trends and patterns in the psychological reactions of players. These techniques are enhanced by data from original sources and scholarly evaluations on gaming psychology, which offer a strong basis for study. By integrating factual data with first-hand accounts, this mixed-methods approach enhances the study and advances the project’s objectives of properly examining the complex relationship between video games and human psychology. Evaluation of Literature To create a well-rounded argument when examining the relationship between video games and human psychology, particularly regarding motivations, impacts, and therapeutic potentials, it is essential to read a wide range of academic publications. One key study, by Przybylski (2014), who had his findings published in the American Psychologist, offers a thorough analysis of the psychological processes behind video game participation and how they affect player’s mental health. This study provides a strong basis for comprehending the motivations of gamers by clarifying how intrinsic desires satisfaction predicts game motivation and, in turn, affects psychological results (Przybylski, 2014). Kühn et al. (2018)‘s work further expands this discussion to include cognitive consequences. Their research, which was published in Molecular Psychiatry, offers empirical information about the structural alterations in the brain linked to prolonged video gaming, pointing to potential underlying processes for the reported cognitive improvements (Kühn et al., 2018). Together, this chosen research highlight how complicated the psychological consequences of video games are on people. Every article offers a different perspective on the reasons people play games, the psychological and therapeutic effects, and the theoretical foundations that relate video games to psychological functions. It is imperative to acknowledge the constraints present in contemporary research, including the prevalence of brief studies and the difficulty in converting laboratory results into practical applications. Data Analysis Procedures Ethical Considerations When researching the relationship between video games and human psychology, it is crucial to take ethical issues into account, particularly when considering the games’ history, impact, and potential therapeutic benefits. The principles of informed consent must be followed to all research participants, who must be fully informed about the study’s goal, methodology, and any effects on their privacy and mental health. This project must consider the possibility that viewing certain video game content could aggravate psychological issues or cause discomfort. In addition, it is imperative to uphold the absolute confidentiality of participant data, implementing procedures to secure and anonymise personal data, thereby safeguarding participant’s identities and any sensitive information shared throughout the research. This is especially important for studies that look at psychological issues because sharing personal information on feelings or experiences could endanger the subjects. A fair portrayal of video games is also necessary for research in this field, considering both the hazards associated with excessive or unbalanced use as well as the potential therapeutic advantages. To assess the psychological impacts of video gaming objectively and prevent the stigma or prejudices around gamers from spreading, objectivity is necessary. Finally, by offering knowledge that can guide ethical standards for both game development and therapeutic use, the findings should positively impact the conversation surrounding video games and mental health. Literature Review Evolution of Video Games Since their creation, video games have experienced significant evolution, going from simple pixelated pictures to intricate, narratively-driven settings that appeal to millions of people worldwide. This progress has psychological as well as technological implications, impacting behaviours and motivations and possibly holding the possibility of therapeutic benefits. The evolution of video games from straightforward titles like “Pong” in the 1970s to complex narrative-driven games and immersive virtual realities today demonstrates the mutually beneficial interaction between video games and human psychology. Although they were simplistic in design, the first video games, including “Space Invaders” (1978) and “Pac-Man” (1980), set the foundation for interactive entertainment (Kent, 2001). Even though these games are simple by today’s standards, they appealed to two basic psychological needs: the need for escape and the drive for achievement (finishing levels and getting high scores). Malone (1981) asserts that the reason these early video games were successful was because they had distinct objectives, quick feedback, and a hard but manageable difficulty level. Video game complexity increased along with technology, resulting in increasingly complex storylines and gameplay. In addition to providing an escape from reality, role-playing games (RPGs) like the “Final Fantasy” and “The Elder Scrolls” series allowed players to interact with well-developed characters, explore intricate tales, and make decisions that affected the progression of the game. These games increase engagement and happiness by meeting basic psychological demands including relatedness, competence, and autonomy—all of which are elements of the Self-Determination Theory (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Video games gained a new dimension with the introduction of internet gaming, which turned them into virtual social networks where users could communicate with one other anywhere in the world. This advancement satisfies people’s natural desire for social interaction and has significant psychological ramifications for humans. According to Cole and Griffiths’ (2007) research, conventional beliefs about the social impact of gaming are challenged by the fact that massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like “World of Warcraft” foster meaningful social interactions that can be just as rewarding as in-person relationships. Moreover, video games are being acknowledged for their therapeutic potential rather than just being a source of amusement. According to McGonigal (2012), playing games like “SuperBetter,” which are created with psychological concepts in mind, can help people deal with anxiety and depression as well as heal from physical wounds more quickly. By embracing the idea of “positive psychology,” these games leverage the potential of video games to inspire and involve players in their own healing. Nonetheless, there are several difficulties and complexity in the connection between human psychology and video games. There are constant discussions in academic and popular discourse on addiction, violence, and the effects of gaming on social development and attention span. Nuanced insights are provided by research in this field, which suggests that individual characteristics among players as well as game types and motivations may have an impact on the interaction between video games and psychological effects (Anderson & Bushman, 2001). In conclusion, the development of video games from straightforward amusement to intricate storylines and online communities illustrates how psychology interacts with them. In addition to satisfying a variety of psychological demands, including those for accomplishment, escape, and social contact, video games can present novel therapeutic approaches. Future developments in video gaming promise more integration with psychological motivations and therapeutic potentials as technology and psychological understanding evolve, highlighting the significance of ongoing research in this dynamic and quickly developing subject. Psychological Consequences of Video Gaming Cognitive Aspects The psychological society has paid a great deal of attention to the cognitive effects of video gaming, which can have both positive and negative outcomes. It has been demonstrated that playing video games, especially those that call for rapid reflexes, strategic thinking, and problem-solving, improves cognitive skills including multitasking, attention, and spatial awareness (Green & Bavelier, 2012). According to Green and Bavelier’s study, action video games are beneficial for tasks involving visuospatial ability and attentional control. This suggests that action video games can be useful training aids for cognitive skills. On the other hand, excessive video gaming has been connected to detrimental effects on cognition, especially when it comes to addiction. According to a study by Kuss and Griffiths (2012), people who are addicted to video games may have cognitive impairment in areas including memory and attention span. This contradiction highlights the intricate psychological ramifications of video gaming and necessitates a comprehensive comprehension of its impact. The increasing realism and complexity of video games demands research on the relationship between gaming and cognitive development. Gentile et al. (2013) makes a strong case that, depending on the content, setting, and amount of play, video games can have a good or harmful impact on cognitive development. These results point to the necessity of conducting additional empirical research to investigate the boundaries around which video games have the most influence on cognition. It’s important to distinguish between using video games to improve cognitive abilities and possibly worsening cognitive deficiencies when thinking about the therapeutic possibilities of these devices. It is therefore necessary to take a balanced approach to integrating the cognitive features of gaming into psychological study and practice, since they offer a wealth of opportunities for both beneficial and cautionary tale applications. Emotional Impacts Video games have become a major part of modern society, impacting a lot of the population all over the world. This broad participation calls for an important examination of its psychological foundations and implications, especially regarding emotional effects. It is critical to acknowledge the two-edged character of video gaming: although it has been linked to benefits like enhanced cognitive abilities (Green & Bavelier, 2012), it also carries the risk of negative psychological impacts like addiction and changed emotional states (Kuss & Griffiths, 2012). Playing video games can lead to a state of flow, which is defined as fully immersed delight and involvement (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). This condition may make it difficult to distinguish between appropriate gaming involvement and compulsive gaming behaviours, even if it is good for mental health and wellbeing because it encourages relaxation and stress alleviation (Skoric, Teo, & Neo, 2009). The American Psychiatric Association (2013) has designated “Internet Gaming Disorder,” which is characterised by video game addiction. This highlights the significance of assessing the emotional effects of gaming properly. Moreover, it has been suggested that video games influence how players develop emotionally. The possibility that violent video games could encourage hostility and desensitisation to violence has generated a great deal of discussion (Anderson & Bushman, 2001). Nonetheless, the intricate relationship between video game content and personal psychological traits suggests that not everyone is impacted in the same way (Ferguson & Kilburn, 2009). It’s important to pay attention to the therapeutic potential of video games in treating mental disorders. Research suggests that specific games can function as useful tools in cognitive-behavioural therapy, supporting the development of resilience and emotion control (Granic, Lobel, & Engels, 2014). This dual viewpoint draws attention to the urgent need for a sophisticated understanding of the ways in which video games affect mental health and calls for a fair and balanced conversation that considers the benefits and drawbacks of video gaming for human psychology. Social Consequences Video games have a wide range of social effects on people, including social structures and human interactions. Granic, Lobel, and Engels (2014) draw attention to the possibility that video games can promote social interactions by stating that multiplayer games offer a setting for teamwork, communication, and the improvement of social skills. Research demonstrates that video games can help marginalised groups socially connect and feel like they belong, providing a sense of community and support (Kowert, Domahidi, & Quandt, 2014). On the other hand, excessive gaming might result in a decrease in interpersonal ties and social isolation (Kuss & Griffiths, 2012). The delicate balance that exists between possible social isolation and constructive social integration depends on a variety of variables, including the kind of games that are played and how each person plays them. Greitemeyer and Osswald (2010) have shown that prosocial games can boost players’ empathy and willingness to act kindly towards others, further illustrating the social influence of gaming on the development of empathy and prosocial behaviour. Moreover, video games have significant therapeutic potential in social settings. There may be a useful connection between video gaming and social therapeutic interventions since research suggests that games created with therapeutic goals can help people with autism spectrum disorders develop their social skills (Ferguson & Olson, 2013). Theoretical Perspectives on Gaming Motivations Self-Determination Theory The study of gaming incentives using the structure of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) provides significant understanding of the psychological requirements influencing video game involvement. According to this theory, human motivation originates from the needs for relatedness, competence, and autonomy, which, when met, promote intrinsic motivation and psychological health (Ryan & Deci, 2000). SDT clarifies how these needs are met by video games in the context of play, encouraging prolonged and meaningful participation. The relevance of SDT to gaming is demonstrated by Przybylski, Rigby, and Ryan (2010), who show that players’ intrinsic drive to play games and their overall well-being can be predicted based on how well they feel about autonomy, competence, and relatedness in game contexts. These results challenge narratives that perceive gaming as just escapist or problematic by highlighting the intrinsic importance of gaming as a way of satisfying basic psychological needs. Further support for SDT in gaming comes from research conducted in 2007 by Rigby and Ryan, who hypothesise that video games are ideally suited to address SDT’s requirements. This can improve players’ psychological wellbeing and encourage prolonged participation. This connection between SDT and the motivations behind gaming not only emphasises how crucial it is to comprehend the psychological bases of gaming behaviours, but it also raises the possibility of creating intentionally psychologically beneficial game designs. Uses and Gratifications Theory A solid basis for analysing gaming motivations is provided by the Uses and Gratifications Theory, a key concept in the psychology of media consumption. It is significant because it turns the discussion from what the media does to people to what people do with the media. According to this theory, people are engaged consumers who look for media to satisfy a range of demands, including those for identity validation, amusement, and social engagement (Ruggiero, 2000). This hypothesis explains how people play video games to meet psychological or emotional demands. For example, studies have shown that emotional and cognitive rewards such as the need for escape, competitiveness, and achievement can serve as driving forces behind gaming (Yee, 2006). To meet these demands, games provide an interactive setting where users can investigate different worlds, feel a sense of achievement, and build social bonds. Expanding upon these results, more recent research indicates that gaming incentives are dynamic and ever-changing, keeping pace with advances in gaming technology and platforms (Ryan, Rigby, & Przybylski, 2006). Moreover, the Uses and Gratifications Theory has implications for comprehending problematic gaming behaviour and creating therapeutic interventions that use gaming aspects to meet psychological needs when applied to gaming research (Snodgrass et al., 2018). The Dual Nature of Gaming Outcomes Cognitive Enhancements The dual nature of video game results—especially when it comes to cognitive gains—offers an intriguing field of research that combines interactive media with human psychology. Video games can affect cognitive processes including attention, memory, and executive function in both positive and negative ways, according to research. Action video games can enhance visual attention and spatial cognition, according to Green and Bavelier (2012). This suggests that interactive entertainment like this can be used for cognitive enhancement in addition to being a kind of leisure. Their research, which was published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience, highlights how playing action video games might help players perform better on tasks that call for visual tracking and wide-ranging attention distribution (Green & Bavelier, 2012). On the other hand, study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology by Gentile (2009) highlights the detrimental effects of excessive video game playing, including attentional issues and deteriorated social functioning. This highlights the significance of moderation and the genre selectivity of video games. These results highlight the complexity of the relationship between video games and cognitive processes and the need for a more sophisticated understanding of those relationships. Adverse Effects: Addiction, Social, and Health Concerns A thorough analysis of the psychological effects of video games is required given their growing popularity in modern culture, especially regarding addiction, social dynamics, and health issues. The DSM-5 classifies video game addiction as “Internet Gaming Disorder,” highlighting the possible negative consequences of excessive gaming (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). With symptoms like withdrawal, tolerance, and a disregard for daily activities, this addiction is like substance-related diseases (Petry & O’Brien, 2013). According to Anderson, Gentile, and Buckley (2007), there are social repercussions associated with excessive gaming, such as social skill reduction, isolation, and strained relationships in real life. Although social relationships can be assisted by online gaming environments, they may also lead to a preference for digital over real-life connectivity, which could hinder the development of social interactions (Cole & Griffiths, 2007). Prolonged gaming sessions have also been connected to several health issues, including poor posture-related musculoskeletal disorders (Eichenbaum, 2015), prolonged screen exposure-related vision problems, and a lack of physical activity that increases the risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease (Weinstein et al., 2017). In conclusion, even though video games have the potential to be therapeutic and informative tools, it’s important to detect and minimise any negative effects they may have. Further research into these dynamics should remain, guaranteeing that games are employed in manners that promote wellness. Summary and Gaps in Literature Summary Video games have dynamically evolved from basic entertainment to intricate, narrative-driven experiences with profound psychological effects, according to the literature. Early video games, such as Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and Pong, cultivated the fundamental psychological desires of achievement and escape. Video games have developed into complex storylines and immersive virtual worlds because of technological advancements. They now serve a variety of psychological purposes, such as promoting social connections, autonomy, competence, and the healing of mental health conditions. The rise in popularity of online gaming disproved the belief that video games are essentially antisocial by turning them into virtual social networks. Video games with therapeutic potential can be found in titles like “SuperBetter,” which use positive psychology to support mental health recovery. Gaps There are several significant gaps in the literature that require attention, even though it offers a strong basis for understanding how video games and human psychology interact. The absence of longitudinal studies, which is essential for determining the long-term impacts of video gaming on psychological development, is one important issue. Individual characteristics, such as personality features and pre-existing mental health issues, that may alter how players engage with and are influenced by video games are frequently overlooked in current investigations. Moreover, research on the psychological effects of these novel gaming experiences has found it difficult to keep up with the rapid evolution of video game technology, particularly virtual and augmented reality. The ways in which video games might serve as therapeutic aids are yet another undiscovered field. Extensive research is required to determine the precise aspects of game design that support psychological health. Furthermore, despite the possibility that cultural norms and societal expectations may have a substantial impact on gaming activities and their psychological consequences, the cultural and social contexts in which video gaming takes place are frequently disregarded. More thorough empirical research is also required in the field of how video games can promote prosocial behaviour and empathy. Analysis and Findings Cognitive, Emotional, and Social Consequences of Video Gaming The study of the social, emotional, and cognitive consequences associated with gaming behaviours is supported by the relationship between human psychology and video gaming. Academic studies indicate that video games have a complex effect on cognitive capacities, including improved attention, problem-solving, and spatial thinking (Green & Bavelier, 2012; Ferguson, 2020). Based on the beneficial relationship between game genres and cognitive enhancement, these cognitive benefits highlight the potential of video games as training and educational resources (Granic, Lobel, & Engels, 2014). Video games provide players with an emotional outlet and a means of expressing their emotions, and they have been linked to mood management and stress reduction on an emotional level (Russoniello, O’Brien, & Parks, 2009). Nonetheless, concerns that video games can lead to negative consequences including addiction and diminished wellbeing draw attention to the complex relationship between game mechanics and mental health (Anderson et al., 2010). The social effects of video games are centred on encouraging social interaction and communities. According to Cole and Griffiths (2007), multiplayer online games build virtual communities that promote socialisation and improve cooperation. Recent research debunks the myth that gaming is an isolated hobby by highlighting how it may encourage social relationships despite worries about social isolation in particular situations (Domenico & Ryan, 2017). This study uses a thorough analysis of recent literature to summarise these elements; it goes beyond the primary sources to include academic reviews and the most recent studies. This approach guarantees an effective management of primary sources and a thorough exploration of the social, emotional, and cognitive aspects of video gaming. Motivations Behind Video Gaming: A Multidimensional Analysis The study delves at the many reasons people play video games, looking at aspects including achievement, social connection, escape, and self-improvement. This study explores how and why people play video games, utilising psychological theories and frameworks to provide insight into the motives behind these behaviours and their effects on behaviour and mental health. Using both quantitative and qualitative data, the analysis combines the results of recent research with primary source observations to provide a thorough knowledge of the motivational components in video games. A significant finding supports Deci and Ryan’s (2000) Self-Determination Theory by highlighting the relationship between video gaming and intrinsic motivational elements such the need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness (Ryan, R.M. & Deci, E.L., 2000). Additionally, this study highlights the therapeutic potential of video games, demonstrating their usefulness as tools for enhancing psychological resilience and well-being. This is backed up by Griffiths, Kuss, and Ortiz de Gortari (2017), who talk about the advantages of video games in emotional regulation and cognitive training (Griffiths, M.D., Kuss, D.J., & Ortiz de Gortari, A.B., 2017). This comprehensive analysis also examines the consequences of excessive gaming, highlighting its drawbacks and the need for a fair assessment of the reasons people play video games. In the end, this study advances knowledge about the function of video games in modern culture by fostering a thoughtful debate about their psychological effects and potential as a therapeutic approach. Video Gaming Outcomes: Cognitive Skills Improvement vs. Negative Consequences This section uses a balanced viewpoint supported by recent research to objectively assess the dual benefits of video gaming on improving cognitive skills and potential drawbacks. It has been demonstrated that playing video games improves cognitive skills like decision-making, problem-solving, and spatial awareness. Action video games, for example, have been shown to enhance visual-spatial skills (Green & Bavelier, 2012), indicating a direct relationship between gaming and cognitive enhancement. Furthermore, Granic, Lobel, and Engels (2014) argue that video games improve human psychology by providing emotional, motivational, and social benefits (Granic, I., Lobel, A., & Engels, R.C.M.E., 2014). On the other hand, playing video games too much can have detrimental effects like addiction, social disengagement, and poorer academic performance. According to Gentile (2009), there is a need to exercise caution when it comes to gaming habits because of the scientific evidence that links video gaming to harmful behaviours. The study emphasises how crucial it is to moderate video gaming to maximise its positive cognitive effects and minimise its negative ones. A healthy gaming habit can be attained by utilising ideas of self-regulation and moderation, which highlight the complex relationship between video gaming and cognitive development.","completion":"Your request involves proofreading and restructuring the text to remove redundancies and clarify the content, followed by providing word counts.

Examining the psychological, emotional, and social effects of gaming, this dissertation explores the complex interaction between video games and human psychology. In line with theories like Self-Determination Theory, it explores the dual nature of video gaming, acknowledging its capacity to satisfy the basic psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and social connection. At the same time, it looks at the range of psychological effects that gaming can have, from positive effects like enhanced problem-solving and spatial awareness to negative effects like addiction and social isolation. A particular focus is on video gaming in therapeutic settings, emphasising the imaginative use of gamification and serious games to treat mental health conditions, improve cognitive abilities, and improve emotional wellbeing. Furthermore, it investigates how technology developments such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) can improve the therapeutic efficacy of game-based interventions and deepen the level of game immersion. This dissertation contributes to a balanced discourse on integrating video games into therapeutic landscapes and highlights their potential as sophisticated tools for bolstering psychological resilience and well-being. It advocates for a nuanced and informed approach to video gaming, emphasising the importance of leveraging its psychological benefits while remaining cautious of its dangers. Objectives The objectives of this research are to: • Completing a thorough review of the body of research on the psychological effects of video games, emphasising the social, emotional, and cognitive aspects. • Utilising a multifaceted framework and well-established psychological theories such as Uses and Gratifications Theory and Self-Determination Theory to investigate the core motivations underlying video gaming. • Examining the conflicting findings of video games, with a focus on cognitive improvements and a recognition of possible negative effects such gaming addiction and its effects on relationships with others and physical health. • Studying how new technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) might improve immersive gaming experiences and have a significant effect on psychiatric therapies. • Highlighting the distinctive characteristics that distinguish video gaming as a field of research in human psychology by drawing comparisons and contrasts between the psychological effects of gaming and other digital interactions. Preface To comprehend the profound impact of video games on human psychology, two fundamental questions must be addressed sequentially: first, do the interactive and immersive environments of video games could influence and modify human cognitive functions, emotional states, and social behaviours? Second, do these influences manifest themselves in people’s daily lives and psychological well-being? Unless the first question is answered completely, delving into the effects of the second remains an abstract endeavour. My goal when I started this dissertation was to investigate video gaming, which is a prevalent aspect of modern society and daily existence. Under the research emphasis “The Interplay of Video Games and Human Psychology: Insights into Motivations, Effects, and Therapeutic Potentials,” I set out to unravel the complexity of the dynamic interaction between psychology and video games. My inspiration came from my fascination with the ways in which virtual environments affect behaviour, cognition, and emotional health as well as my desire to provide a thorough analysis that considers psychological reasons for gaming, its effects, and its emerging role in therapeutic settings. My academic and personal interests in video games, together with the debates about their advantages and disadvantages, motivated me to add to the continuing discussion about video games and psychology. This dissertation addresses knowledge gaps, aims to clarify the complex links between video gaming and psychological effects, and lays the foundation for future study by combining theoretical inquiry with a thorough evaluation of previous studies. The goal of this in-depth analysis is to provide fresh perspectives on the complex relationships between human psychology and video games. This dissertation combines theoretical concepts and analysis with a comprehensive evaluation of recent research to shed light on the complex relationships between video gaming and psychological impacts. It seeks to fill in knowledge gaps and synthesise existing knowledge to pave the way for future study. The pieces are arranged according to several main themes: Understanding Player Motivation: In general, studies on player motivation point to a wide range of variables that affect gamers’ engagement with video games. The research describes how video games fulfil basic human needs by offering a platform for enjoyment, escape, and a sense of success. It builds on psychology theories of motivation. It also shows how these digital platforms satisfy the basic psychological needs of players for competence, which is achieved through mastery of skills and challenges; autonomy, which gives players control over their actions and environment; and social connection, which is achieved through relationship-building and group experiences. This section suggests complex factors that drive players to video games beyond basic entertainment, such as the complicated psychological areas where real-life wants and aspirations could be addressed and fulfilled. Effects of Video Gaming on Mental Health: Examining how gaming affects mental health, this dissertation offers a fair analysis that highlights the conflicting effects of gaming. It includes a review of the literature that highlights the psychological benefits of video gaming, such as lowered stress levels, higher mood, and cognitive benefits like longer attention spans, sharper problem-solving skills, and greater mental flexibility. On the other hand, it also draws attention to the negative consequences that could arise, such as addiction, behavioural problems, and social isolation, emphasising the wide range of individual reactions to gaming. To provide a coherent knowledge of the diverse consequences of gaming, this critical research supports a detailed interpretation of how video games affect mental health, merging the positive with the negative. The Impact of Gaming on Emotions and Cognitive Development: This dissertation delves deeper into the topic of video games as powerful tools for emotional involvement and cognitive development. It describes how playing video games may be a rich source of emotional development, empathy, and resilience because they provide a platform for players to feel, express, and control their feelings. Additionally, it looks at how games test and improve cognitive processes, showing how they can improve cognitive abilities including attention, memory, and spatial awareness. In this section, it is recommended that video games, because of their interactive nature, can have a substantial impact on psychological development and serve as dynamic venues for emotional exploration and intellectual advancement. Therapeutic Applications and Potentials: This section of the dissertation describes how video games are being included in mental health therapies more and more, providing a convincing analysis of therapeutic aspects. It covers a wide range of therapeutic applications, such as social skills development for autism spectrum disorders and cognitive-behavioural techniques targeted at psychiatric concerns or physical injury rehabilitation. The research highlights how adaptable video games may be as therapeutic tools, providing fresh approaches to involvement, education, and recovery. Ethical Considerations and Future Directions: Finally, the dissertation discusses the ethical implications of video games in psychological settings. It emphasises the importance of ethical mindfulness, particularly when dealing with vulnerable populations, in preventing exploitation and ensuring the good use of video games. It also speculates on video games’ future trajectories in sociological, technological, and psychological areas, promoting more research to better comprehend and utilise their potential. The dissertation weaves together various aspects to form a detailed portrayal of the video gaming phenomenon: motivation, mental health, emotional and cognitive impact, therapeutic applications, and ethical implications. It presents video games as diverse tools with important psychological ramifications for people, offering a fundamental tool that emphasises the close relationship between virtual gaming environments and mental health, growth, and innovative treatment approaches. Introduction Background of the Study The complex interplay of video games and human psychology spans numerous aspects, including motives, impacts, and potential for therapy. This investigation takes place during the dawn of a new digital era, in which video games go beyond mere amusement and have a substantial impact on the cognitive, emotional, and social aspects of the human experience (Granic, Lobel, and Engels, 2014). The growing interest in this interplay is not unjustified, as the global increase in video game usage necessitates a more in-depth investigation of their impact on human behaviour, mental health, and psychological wellbeing. The motivational reasons that drive people to participate in video games are central to the investigation. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) provides a solid framework for understanding these reasons, arguing that video games provide core psychological demands for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, impacting well-being and engagement (Ryan, Rigby, and Przybylski, 2006). This consistency with intrinsic needs emphasises the profound psychological roots of gaming incentives and opens possibilities for using these processes in supportive or therapeutic settings. Video games have a wide range of effects on human psychology, contradicting simplistic narratives that have traditionally portrayed video games negatively. Recent research suggests that video games can improve cognitive skills such as problem-solving, spatial navigation, and multitasking (Bavelier, Green, Pouget, and Schrater, 2012). Furthermore, video games provide unique social integration opportunities, which may build a sense of community and belonging among players (Domahidi, Festl, and Quandt, 2014). However, given the limitations of existing information, it is critical to balance this viewpoint by recognising the potential risks and negative impacts of excessive gaming, such as addiction and the displacement of real-life interactions (Kuss & Griffiths, 2012). The therapeutic potential of video games represents a new frontier in psychological intervention. The concept of “serious games” - video games created for objectives other than pleasure, such as education, health improvement, or therapy - has received significant attention (Connolly et al., 2012). These games are increasingly recognised for their ability to serve as new tools in cognitive-behavioural therapy, rehabilitation, and social skills training, providing entertaining, cost-effective, and accessible answers to a wide range of psychological difficulties (Fleming et al., 2017). An in-depth study of the relationship between video games and psychology necessitates a foundation based on current research and complex expertise. This means engaging with both scholarly evaluations and primary sources, delving beyond the available literature to discover the intricacies of this relationship. In this way, the study is consistent with current research procedures, employing both quantitative and qualitative approaches to gain a thorough understanding of the occurrences under consideration (Bryant, 2015). In conclusion, the relationship between video games and human psychology presents a substantial area for academic exploration, encompassing drives, outcomes, and therapeutic opportunities. This study intends to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role of video games in modern society by incorporating motivational theories, acknowledging gaming’s multiple effects, and recognising its potential for therapeutic intervention. In doing so, it acknowledges the limitations of current knowledge while setting the way for future research areas that bridge the gap between theory and practice. Purpose of The Project This research project seeks to delve deeply into the complex interaction between video games and human psychology, unveiling the numerous motivations for gaming, its various effects on individuals, and its promising therapeutic potentials. This project aims to find unique insights into gamers’ psychological driving forces and the potential of video games as therapeutic tools by researching how psychological principles impact gaming habits and how video games can improve mental health and behavioural results. Furthermore, it attempts to question generally accepted assumptions about video gaming by delving into its intricacies beyond simply amusement, with the goal of achieving a thorough understanding that bridges the gap between theory and practical application in therapeutic settings. Structure of the Dissertation This research will begin by establishing theoretical frameworks that connect video game mechanics to psychological theories, beginning with an examination of the psychological reasons driving gaming. It will investigate the psychological effects of video games on individuals, both positive and negative, using cognitive, behavioural, and affective perspectives. The research will continue to investigate video game’s therapeutic potentials, focusing on how they are being integrated into mental health initiatives and treatment regimens. A critical examination of approaches used to examine the relationship between video games and psychology will follow, highlighting the project’s use of both qualitative and quantitative research methods. The dissertation will examine recent developments in the field, compare theoretical understanding with empirical findings, and consider future options for incorporating video games into psychological well-being before concluding. Throughout, the project seeks to provide novel understandings, supported by thorough investigation and thorough comprehension, into the intricate dynamics of human psychology and video games. Methodology Research Design To provide a thorough understanding of how video games affect human psychology, the underlying motivations for their use, and any potential therapeutic benefits, the research design for this dissertation project, “The Interplay of Video Games and Human Psychology: An Insight into Motivations, Effects, and Therapeutic Potentials,” is primarily exploratory and integrative. It makes use of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Surveys that are given to players across a range of demographics will be used to collect quantitative data on gaming habits, psychological affects, and perceived motivational elements. Semi-structured interviews with gaming psychologists, therapists who use video games in treatment, and gamers who have suffered from the psychological effects of gaming will provide qualitative insights. Using personal narratives, the mixed-methods approach enables a robust analysis that not only reveals statistical significance but also humanises the data. In addition, the research will incorporate a methodical examination of current literature, covering academic publications and primary sources, to guarantee an extensive inquiry beyond the materials supplied, in accordance with contemporary research patterns and sophisticated scholarship in the domain. This design considers the intricacy of the topic, guaranteeing appropriate communication of the results and consistent advancement of the discourse about video games and psychology. Data Collection Methods A variety of data gathering techniques are used to guarantee a thorough comprehension of the subject matter. The main techniques employed are semi-structured interviews and focus groups. These methods provide a thorough investigation of player motivations, the psychological toll that gaming takes, and possible therapeutic advantages. To guarantee a diversity of viewpoints, participants are chosen based on their different gaming experiences. Furthermore, larger-scale data collection is accomplished using quantitative techniques like surveys and questionnaires, which allow for the identification of trends and patterns in the psychological reactions of players. These techniques are enhanced by data from original sources and scholarly evaluations on gaming psychology, which offer a strong basis for study. By integrating factual data with first-hand accounts, this mixed-methods approach enhances the study and advances the project’s objectives of properly examining the complex relationship between video games and human psychology. Evaluation of Literature To create a well-rounded argument when examining the relationship between video games and human psychology, particularly regarding motivations, impacts, and therapeutic potentials, it is essential to read a wide range of academic publications. One key study, by Przybylski (2014), who had his findings published in the American Psychologist, offers a thorough analysis of the psychological processes behind video game participation and how they affect player’s mental health. This study provides a strong basis for comprehending the motivations of gamers by clarifying how intrinsic desires satisfaction predicts game motivation and, in turn, affects psychological results (Przybylski, 2014). Kühn et al. (2018)‘s work further expands this discussion to include cognitive consequences. Their research, which was published in Molecular Psychiatry, offers empirical information about the structural alterations in the brain linked to prolonged video gaming, pointing to potential underlying processes for the reported cognitive improvements (Kühn et al., 2018). Together, this chosen research highlight how complicated the psychological consequences of video games are on people. Every article offers a different perspective on the reasons people play games, the psychological and therapeutic effects, and the theoretical foundations that relate video games to psychological functions. It is imperative to acknowledge the constraints present in contemporary research, including the prevalence of brief studies and the difficulty in converting laboratory results into practical applications. Data Analysis Procedures Ethical Considerations When researching the relationship between video games and human psychology, it is crucial to take ethical issues into account, particularly when considering the games’ history, impact, and potential therapeutic benefits. The principles of informed consent must be followed to all research participants, who must be fully informed about the study’s goal, methodology, and any effects on their privacy and mental health. This project must consider the possibility that viewing certain video game content could aggravate psychological issues or cause discomfort. In addition, it is imperative to uphold the absolute confidentiality of participant data, implementing procedures to secure and anonymise personal data, thereby safeguarding participant’s identities and any sensitive information shared throughout the research. This is especially important for studies that look at psychological issues because sharing personal information on feelings or experiences could endanger the subjects. A fair portrayal of video games is also necessary for research in this field, considering both the hazards associated with excessive or unbalanced use as well as the potential therapeutic advantages. To assess the psychological impacts of video gaming objectively and prevent the stigma or prejudices around gamers from spreading, objectivity is necessary. Finally, by offering knowledge that can guide ethical standards for both game development and therapeutic use, the findings should positively impact the conversation surrounding video games and mental health. Literature Review Evolution of Video Games Since their creation, video games have experienced significant evolution, going from simple pixelated pictures to intricate, narratively-driven settings that appeal to millions of people worldwide. This progress has psychological as well as technological implications, impacting behaviours and motivations and possibly holding the possibility of therapeutic benefits. The evolution of video games from straightforward titles like “Pong” in the 1970s to complex narrative-driven games and immersive virtual realities today demonstrates the mutually beneficial interaction between video games and human psychology. Although they were simplistic in design, the first video games, including “Space Invaders” (1978) and “Pac-Man” (1980), set the foundation for interactive entertainment (Kent, 2001). Even though these games are simple by today’s standards, they appealed to two basic psychological needs: the need for escape and the drive for achievement (finishing levels and getting high scores). Malone (1981) asserts that the reason these early video games were successful was because they had distinct objectives, quick feedback, and a hard but manageable difficulty level. Video game complexity increased along with technology, resulting in increasingly complex storylines and gameplay. In addition to providing an escape from reality, role-playing games (RPGs) like the “Final Fantasy” and “The Elder Scrolls” series allowed players to interact with well-developed characters, explore intricate tales, and make decisions that affected the progression of the game. These games increase engagement and happiness by meeting basic psychological demands including relatedness, competence, and autonomy—all of which are elements of the Self-Determination Theory (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Video games gained a new dimension with the introduction of internet gaming, which turned them into virtual social networks where users could communicate with one other anywhere in the world. This advancement satisfies people’s natural desire for social interaction and has significant psychological ramifications for humans. According to Cole and Griffiths’ (2007) research, conventional beliefs about the social impact of gaming are challenged by the fact that massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like “World of Warcraft” foster meaningful social interactions that can be just as rewarding as in-person relationships. Moreover, video games are being acknowledged for their therapeutic potential rather than just being a source of amusement. According to McGonigal (2012), playing games like “SuperBetter,” which are created with psychological concepts in mind, can help people deal with anxiety and depression as well as heal from physical wounds more quickly. By embracing the idea of “positive psychology,” these games leverage the potential of video games to inspire and involve players in their own healing. Nonetheless, there are several difficulties and complexity in the connection between human psychology and video games. There are constant discussions in academic and popular discourse on addiction, violence, and the effects of gaming on social development and attention span. Nuanced insights are provided by research in this field, which suggests that individual characteristics among players as well as game types and motivations may have an impact on the interaction between video games and psychological effects (Anderson & Bushman, 2001). In conclusion, the development of video games from straightforward amusement to intricate storylines and online communities illustrates how psychology interacts with them. In addition to satisfying a variety of psychological demands, including those for accomplishment, escape, and social contact, video games can present novel therapeutic approaches. Future developments in video gaming promise more integration with psychological motivations and therapeutic potentials as technology and psychological understanding evolve, highlighting the significance of ongoing research in this dynamic and quickly developing subject. Psychological Consequences of Video Gaming Cognitive Aspects The psychological society has paid a great deal of attention to the cognitive effects of video gaming, which can have both positive and negative outcomes. It has been demonstrated that playing video games, especially those that call for rapid reflexes, strategic thinking, and problem-solving, improves cognitive skills including multitasking, attention, and spatial awareness (Green & Bavelier, 2012). According to Green and Bavelier’s study, action video games are beneficial for tasks involving visuospatial ability and attentional control. This suggests that action video games can be useful training aids for cognitive skills. On the other hand, excessive video gaming has been connected to detrimental effects on cognition, especially when it comes to addiction. According to a study by Kuss and Griffiths (2012), people who are addicted to video games may have cognitive impairment in areas including memory and attention span. This contradiction highlights the intricate psychological ramifications of video gaming and necessitates a comprehensive comprehension of its impact. The increasing realism and complexity of video games demands research on the relationship between gaming and cognitive development. Gentile et al. (2013) makes a strong case that, depending on the content, setting, and amount of play, video games can have a good or harmful impact on cognitive development. These results point to the necessity of conducting additional empirical research to investigate the boundaries around which video games have the most influence on cognition. It’s important to distinguish between using video games to improve cognitive abilities and possibly worsening cognitive deficiencies when thinking about the therapeutic possibilities of these devices. It is therefore necessary to take a balanced approach to integrating the cognitive features of gaming into psychological study and practice, since they offer a wealth of opportunities for both beneficial and cautionary tale applications. Emotional Impacts Video games have become a major part of modern society, impacting a lot of the population all over the world. This broad participation calls for an important examination of its psychological foundations and implications, especially regarding emotional effects. It is critical to acknowledge the two-edged character of video gaming: although it has been linked to benefits like enhanced cognitive abilities (Green & Bavelier, 2012), it also carries the risk of negative psychological impacts like addiction and changed emotional states (Kuss & Griffiths, 2012). Playing video games can lead to a state of flow, which is defined as fully immersed delight and involvement (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). This condition may make it difficult to distinguish between appropriate gaming involvement and compulsive gaming behaviours, even if it is good for mental health and wellbeing because it encourages relaxation and stress alleviation (Skoric, Teo, & Neo, 2009). The American Psychiatric Association (2013) has designated “Internet Gaming Disorder,” which is characterised by video game addiction. This highlights the significance of assessing the emotional effects of gaming properly. Moreover, it has been suggested that video games influence how players develop emotionally. The possibility that violent video games could encourage hostility and desensitisation to violence has generated a great deal of discussion (Anderson & Bushman, 2001). Nonetheless, the intricate relationship between video game content and personal psychological traits suggests that not everyone is impacted in the same way (Ferguson & Kilburn, 2009). It’s important to pay attention to the therapeutic potential of video games in treating mental disorders. Research suggests that specific games can function as useful tools in cognitive-behavioural therapy, supporting the development of resilience and emotion control (Granic, Lobel, & Engels, 2014). This dual viewpoint draws attention to the urgent need for a sophisticated understanding of the ways in which video games affect mental health and calls for a fair and balanced conversation that considers the benefits and drawbacks of video gaming for human psychology. Social Consequences Video games have a wide range of social effects on people, including social structures and human interactions. Granic, Lobel, and Engels (2014) draw attention to the possibility that video games can promote social interactions by stating that multiplayer games offer a setting for teamwork, communication, and the improvement of social skills. Research demonstrates that video games can help marginalised groups socially connect and feel like they belong, providing a sense of community and support (Kowert, Domahidi, & Quandt, 2014). On the other hand, excessive gaming might result in a decrease in interpersonal ties and social isolation (Kuss & Griffiths, 2012). The delicate balance that exists between possible social isolation and constructive social integration depends on a variety of variables, including the kind of games that are played and how each person plays them. Greitemeyer and Osswald (2010) have shown that prosocial games can boost players’ empathy and willingness to act kindly towards others, further illustrating the social influence of gaming on the development of empathy and prosocial behaviour. Moreover, video games have significant therapeutic potential in social settings. There may be a useful connection between video gaming and social therapeutic interventions since research suggests that games created with therapeutic goals can help people with autism spectrum disorders develop their social skills (Ferguson & Olson, 2013). Theoretical Perspectives on Gaming Motivations Self-Determination Theory The study of gaming incentives using the structure of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) provides significant understanding of the psychological requirements influencing video game involvement. According to this theory, human motivation originates from the needs for relatedness, competence, and autonomy, which, when met, promote intrinsic motivation and psychological health (Ryan & Deci, 2000). SDT clarifies how these needs are met by video games in the context of play, encouraging prolonged and meaningful participation. The relevance of SDT to gaming is demonstrated by Przybylski, Rigby, and Ryan (2010), who show that players’ intrinsic drive to play games and their overall well-being can be predicted based on how well they feel about autonomy, competence, and relatedness in game contexts. These results challenge narratives that perceive gaming as just escapist or problematic by highlighting the intrinsic importance of gaming as a way of satisfying basic psychological needs. Further support for SDT in gaming comes from research conducted in 2007 by Rigby and Ryan, who hypothesise that video games are ideally suited to address SDT’s requirements. This can improve players’ psychological wellbeing and encourage prolonged participation. This connection between SDT and the motivations behind gaming not only emphasises how crucial it is to comprehend the psychological bases of gaming behaviours, but it also raises the possibility of creating intentionally psychologically beneficial game designs. Uses and Gratifications Theory A solid basis for analysing gaming motivations is provided by the Uses and Gratifications Theory, a key concept in the psychology of media consumption. It is significant because it turns the discussion from what the media does to people to what people do with the media. According to this theory, people are engaged consumers who look for media to satisfy a range of demands, including those for identity validation, amusement, and social engagement (Ruggiero, 2000). This hypothesis explains how people play video games to meet psychological or emotional demands. For example, studies have shown that emotional and cognitive rewards such as the need for escape, competitiveness, and achievement can serve as driving forces behind gaming (Yee, 2006). To meet these demands, games provide an interactive setting where users can investigate different worlds, feel a sense of achievement, and build social bonds. Expanding upon these results, more recent research indicates that gaming incentives are dynamic and ever-changing, keeping pace with advances in gaming technology and platforms (Ryan, Rigby, & Przybylski, 2006). Moreover, the Uses and Gratifications Theory has implications for comprehending problematic gaming behaviour and creating therapeutic interventions that use gaming aspects to meet psychological needs when applied to gaming research (Snodgrass et al., 2018). The Dual Nature of Gaming Outcomes Cognitive Enhancements The dual nature of video game results—especially when it comes to cognitive gains—offers an intriguing field of research that combines interactive media with human psychology. Video games can affect cognitive processes including attention, memory, and executive function in both positive and negative ways, according to research. Action video games can enhance visual attention and spatial cognition, according to Green and Bavelier (2012). This suggests that interactive entertainment like this can be used for cognitive enhancement in addition to being a kind of leisure. Their research, which was published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience, highlights how playing action video games might help players perform better on tasks that call for visual tracking and wide-ranging attention distribution (Green & Bavelier, 2012). On the other hand, study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology by Gentile (2009) highlights the detrimental effects of excessive video game playing, including attentional issues and deteriorated social functioning. This highlights the significance of moderation and the genre selectivity of video games. These results highlight the complexity of the relationship between video games and cognitive processes and the need for a more sophisticated understanding of those relationships. Adverse Effects: Addiction, Social, and Health Concerns A thorough analysis of the psychological effects of video games is required given their growing popularity in modern culture, especially regarding addiction, social dynamics, and health issues. The DSM-5 classifies video game addiction as “Internet Gaming Disorder,” highlighting the possible negative consequences of excessive gaming (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). With symptoms like withdrawal, tolerance, and a disregard for daily activities, this addiction is like substance-related diseases (Petry & O’Brien, 2013). According to Anderson, Gentile, and Buckley (2007), there are social repercussions associated with excessive gaming, such as social skill reduction, isolation, and strained relationships in real life. Although social relationships can be assisted by online gaming environments, they may also lead to a preference for digital over real-life connectivity, which could hinder the development of social interactions (Cole & Griffiths, 2007). Prolonged gaming sessions have also been connected to several health issues, including poor posture-related musculoskeletal disorders (Eichenbaum, 2015), prolonged screen exposure-related vision problems, and a lack of physical activity that increases the risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease (Weinstein et al., 2017). In conclusion, even though video games have the potential to be therapeutic and informative tools, it’s important to detect and minimise any negative effects they may have. Further research into these dynamics should remain, guaranteeing that games are employed in manners that promote wellness. Summary and Gaps in Literature Summary Video games have dynamically evolved from basic entertainment to intricate, narrative-driven experiences with profound psychological effects, according to the literature. Early video games, such as Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and Pong, cultivated the fundamental psychological desires of achievement and escape. Video games have developed into complex storylines and immersive virtual worlds because of technological advancements. They now serve a variety of psychological purposes, such as promoting social connections, autonomy, competence, and the healing of mental health conditions. The rise in popularity of online gaming disproved the belief that video games are essentially antisocial by turning them into virtual social networks. Video games with therapeutic potential can be found in titles like “SuperBetter,” which use positive psychology to support mental health recovery. Gaps There are several significant gaps in the literature that require attention, even though it offers a strong basis for understanding how video games and human psychology interact. The absence of longitudinal studies, which is essential for determining the long-term impacts of video gaming on psychological development, is one important issue. Individual characteristics, such as personality features and pre-existing mental health issues, that may alter how players engage with and are influenced by video games are frequently overlooked in current investigations. Moreover, research on the psychological effects of these novel gaming experiences has found it difficult to keep up with the rapid evolution of video game technology, particularly virtual and augmented reality. The ways in which video games might serve as therapeutic aids are yet another undiscovered field. Extensive research is required to determine the precise aspects of game design that support psychological health. Furthermore, despite the possibility that cultural norms and societal expectations may have a substantial impact on gaming activities and their psychological consequences, the cultural and social contexts in which video gaming takes place are frequently disregarded. More thorough empirical research is also required in the field of how video games can promote prosocial behaviour and empathy. Analysis and Findings Cognitive, Emotional, and Social Consequences of Video Gaming The study of the social, emotional, and cognitive consequences associated with gaming behaviours is supported by the relationship between human psychology and video gaming. Academic studies indicate that video games have a complex effect on cognitive capacities, including improved attention, problem-solving, and spatial thinking (Green & Bavelier, 2012; Ferguson, 2020). Based on the beneficial relationship between game genres and cognitive enhancement, these cognitive benefits highlight the potential of video games as training and educational resources (Granic, Lobel, & Engels, 2014). Video games provide players with an emotional outlet and a means of expressing their emotions, and they have been linked to mood management and stress reduction on an emotional level (Russoniello, O’Brien, & Parks, 2009). Nonetheless, concerns that video games can lead to negative consequences including addiction and diminished wellbeing draw attention to the complex relationship between game mechanics and mental health (Anderson et al., 2010). The social effects of video games are centred on encouraging social interaction and communities. According to Cole and Griffiths (2007), multiplayer online games build virtual communities that promote socialisation and improve cooperation. Recent research debunks the myth that gaming is an isolated hobby by highlighting how it may encourage social relationships despite worries about social isolation in particular situations (Domenico & Ryan, 2017). This study uses a thorough analysis of recent literature to summarise these elements; it goes beyond the primary sources to include academic reviews and the most recent studies. This approach guarantees an effective management of primary sources and a thorough exploration of the social, emotional, and cognitive aspects of video gaming. Motivations Behind Video Gaming: A Multidimensional Analysis The study delves at the many reasons people play video games, looking at aspects including achievement, social connection, escape, and self-improvement. This study explores how and why people play video games, utilising psychological theories and frameworks to provide insight into the motives behind these behaviours and their effects on behaviour and mental health. Using both quantitative and qualitative data, the analysis combines the results of recent research with primary source observations to provide a thorough knowledge of the motivational components in video games. A significant finding supports Deci and Ryan’s (2000) Self-Determination Theory by highlighting the relationship between video gaming and intrinsic motivational elements such the need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness (Ryan, R.M. & Deci, E.L., 2000). Additionally, this study highlights the therapeutic potential of video games, demonstrating their usefulness as tools for enhancing psychological resilience and well-being. This is backed up by Griffiths, Kuss, and Ortiz de Gortari (2017), who talk about the advantages of video games in emotional regulation and cognitive training (Griffiths, M.D., Kuss, D.J., & Ortiz de Gortari, A.B., 2017). This comprehensive analysis also examines the consequences of excessive gaming, highlighting its drawbacks and the need for a fair assessment of the reasons people play video games. In the end, this study advances knowledge about the function of video games in modern culture by fostering a thoughtful debate about their psychological effects and potential as a therapeutic approach. Video Gaming Outcomes: Cognitive Skills Improvement vs. Negative Consequences This section uses a balanced viewpoint supported by recent research to objectively assess the dual benefits of video gaming on improving cognitive skills and potential drawbacks. It has been demonstrated that playing video games improves cognitive skills like decision-making, problem-solving, and spatial awareness. Action video games, for example, have been shown to enhance visual-spatial skills (Green & Bavelier, 2012), indicating a direct relationship between gaming and cognitive enhancement. Furthermore, Granic, Lobel, and Engels (2014) argue that video games improve human psychology by providing emotional, motivational, and social benefits (Granic, I., Lobel, A., & Engels, R.C.M.E., 2014). On the other hand, playing video games too much can have detrimental effects like addiction, social disengagement, and poorer academic performance. According to Gentile (2009), there is a need to exercise caution when it comes to gaming habits because of the scientific evidence that links video gaming to harmful behaviours. The study emphasises how crucial it is to moderate video gaming to maximise its positive cognitive effects and minimise its negative ones. A healthy gaming habit can be attained by utilising ideas of self-regulation and moderation, which highlight the complex relationship between video gaming and cognitive development.","completion":"The provided text is quite extensive and contains a considerable amount of content that repeats ideas or could be condensed for clarity.

Introduction Under homogeneous conditions, there are many conditions in which it is not possible to perform all runs in a 2 k factorial experiment. For example, a single group of raw materials may not be sufficient to make other requirements in process. There are many case where it may be desirable to vary the experimental conditions to ensure that treatments are equally effective in many situations, likely to come into practice. For example, an engineer may run a pilot plant experiment with multiple batches of raw materials as he knows quality grades of raw materials that are likely to be used in the process. Bloacking is a design tehcnique that can be used in these situations. It is a method of dealing controllable nuisance variables. 13.1.2. Blocking a Replicated 2 k Factorial Design Suppose the 2 k factorial design is repeated n times. In case, there exist n replicas, then every non-homogeneous conditions defines a block, and each replication is run in a block. The replicates (or runs) in each block will be created randomly. Design analysis is similar to any blocked factorial experiment. Example 1: Let us suppose that the chemical process experiment. Consider that only four experimental tests can be conducted from a single batch of raw materials. Thus, three batches would be required to run all three replicates. Table 13.1 illustrates the design, where every batch of raw materials matches to one block. Table 13.1:Chemical Process Experiment in Three Blocks Block 1 Block 2 Block 3 (1) = 28 a = 36 b = 18 (D = 25 a = 32 b = 19 (1) = 27 a = 32 b = 23 ab = 31 ab = 30 ab = 29 Block Totals B| = 113 B2 = 106 B3= lll For this blocking design, the analysis of variance is shown in table 13.2. 268 Biostatistics & Research Methodology Table 13.2: Analysis of Variance for the Chemical Process Experiment in Three Blocks Source of Variation Sum of Squares Degrees of Freedom Mean Square F.

From the block sum, the sum of squares for a block is calculated.

Table 13.2 shows that the summary from this analysis, the design was run in blocks and the block effect is relatively small. 13.1.3. Confounding in the 2 k Factorial Design There are many situations where it is not possible to perform a complete replication of a factorial design in a block. Confounding is a design technique in which complete factorial experiment is arranged in blocks and the block size is smaller than the number of treatment combinations in one replica. The technique causes information about certain treatment effects to be confounded with block. For 2 k factorial design, we typically focus on confounding systems. Sometimes the designs shown are incomplete block designs as every block does not include all treatments combinations. The particular structure of a 2 k factorial system permits a simple method of analysis. We generally focus on design and analysis of 2 k factorial design in 2 P incomplete blocks having condition, p < k. These designs can be generally run with two blocks, four blocks, eight blocks and so on. 13.1.4. Confounding the 2 k Factorial Design in Two Blocks Assume that someone wants to run a single replica of 22 designs. Each of the 22 = 4 treatment combinations needs the same amount of raw material. For example, each batch of raw materials is sufficient to test two treatment combinations. Therefore, two batches of raw materials are needed. In case, batches of raw materials are taken as blocks, we must specify two of four treatment combinations in every block. For this problem,figure 13.1 shows a possible design. Figure 13.1a shows the geometric view and indicates that the treatment combination is assigned to different blocks on opposing diagonals. Figure 13.1b shows that that Block 1 contains the treatment combination ( 1 ) and ab and Block 2 contains q and b. The order is Blocking and Confounding System (Chapter 13) 269 randomly defined for running treatment combinations within a block. The block which to run first is decided by random manner. We estimate the main effects of A and B by assuming that there is no blocking. We get: A=- ^ [ab+a -b-(l)] B=- ^ [ab+ b-a-(l)] We see that both A and B are not affected by blocking as each estimate has a plus and a minus treatment combination from every block. This means that there is no difference between Block 1 and Block 2. Let us assume that we have AB interaction: ^ AB = [ab+(l)-a -b] The two treatment with the minus sign (A and B) are in block 2 and the two with the plus sign [Ab and (1)] are in block 1, the block effect and AB interaction are the identical. This shows that AB is confounded with blocks. The reason is shown in the table of plus and minus signs for 22 designs. It is illustrated in table 13.3. In table, we see that all treatment combinations with a plus sign on AB are assigned to block 1. Similarly, all treatment combinations with a minus sign on AB are placed in block 2. This method can be used to confound any effect A, B, or AB with blocks. For example, in case, (1) and b are assigned to block 1 and a and ab to block 2, then the main effect A will be confounded with block. +<> Block 1 Block 2 ( 1 ) a B ab b A + b) Assignment of the Four •= Run in block 1 Runs to Two Blocks o — Run in block 2 a) Geometric View Figure 13.1: A 21 Design in Two Blocks Table 13.3: Table of Plus and Minus Signs for the 21 Design Treatnient Combination Factorial Effect 1 A B AB ( 1 ) + a + + b + + ab + + + + This method can be very useful to confound any 2 k design in two blocks. For example, let us assume that a 23 design run in two blocks. Let we confound the three-factor interaction ABC with blocks. Table 13.4 shows plus and minus signs. 270 Biostatistics & Research Methodology We assign treatment combinations of minus to block 1 on ABC and plus to block on ABC.

The method applies linear combination: L = aiXi + (X2X2 + + akxk, . . (1) Where, Xj = The level of i ,h factor in a specific treatment combination a = Exponent appearing on the ilh factor in the effect to be confounded. Note: For the 2 k system, we have a. = 0 or 1 and x, = 0 (low level) or x4 = 1 (high level). Equation 1 is known as defining contrast. Treatment combinations that give the similar value of L (mod 2) will be assigned in the similar block. Since 0 and 1 are the only possible values of L (mod 2), it will specify 2k treatment combinations in exactly two segments. To see the approach, assume 23 designs with ABC, confounded by blocks. Where Xi corresponds to A, x2 to B, X3 to C, and oil = 012 = 013 = 1 . Therefore, the contrast corresponding to ABC is as follows: L = X|+ X2 + X3 The treatment combination ( 1 ) is written 000 in the (0, 1 ) notation, thus we get: L = 1 (0) + 1 (0) + 1(0) = 0 = 0 (mod 2) Blocking and Confounding System (Chapter 13) 271 Similarly, the treatment combination is 100, obtaining: L = 1(1) + 1(0) + 1 (0) = 1 = 1 (mod 2) Thus, (1) and \'a\' will be run in different blocks. For the remaining treatment combinations, we get: b: L = 1(0) + 1(1) + 1(0) = 1 = 1 (mod 2) ab: L = 1(1) + 1(1) + 1(0) = 2 = 0 (mod 2) c: L = 1(0) + 1(0) + 1(1) = 1 = 1 (mod 2) ac: L = 1 (1) + 1(0) + 1(1 ) = 2 = 0 (mod 2) be: L = 1(0) + 1(1) + 1(1) = 2 = 0 (mod 2) abc: L = 1(1) + 1(1) + 1(1 ) = 3 = 1 (mod 2) Thus (1), ab, ac, and be are run in blocks 1 and a, b, c. abc are run in block 2.This is the same design shown in Figure 13.3, which originated from the table of plus and minussigns. Additional methods can be used to make these designs. The block containing the treatment combination (1) is known as the principal block. This block has a useful group-theoretic property in treatment combinations. That is, they form a group against the multiplication modulus. This implies that if good quality material was used then any element except the original (1 ) would be principal. Figure 13.3b shows the resulting responses. These can be found by subtracting the block effect from the original observations. This shows that the original response to treatment combination ( 1) was 45, and it was calculated (1) = 25 ( = 45 - 20) in figure 13.3b. Other responses can also be obtained in this block. After being tested in block 1, block 2 performed eight trials. D + Block 1 Block 2 a = 71 b = 48 c = 68 d = 43 abc = 65 bed = 86 abd = 86 abd = ( 1 ) = 25 ab = 45 ac = 40 be = 60 ad = 80 bd = 25 cd = 55 abed = 76 104 # = Runs in block 1 C b) Assignment of the 16 Runs to Two O = Blocks Runs in block 2 a) Geometric View Figure 13J: 24 Design in Two Blocks Table 13.5 shows the effect estimates for this “modified” version. The estimates of 4 main effects, 6 two-factor interactions, and 4 three-factor interactions are similar to affect estimates where there was no block effect. Similar to the original experiment, the factors A, C, D and AC and AD interactions emerge as significant effects when a normal probability of effect estimates is constructed. In the original experiment, this effect was estimated as ABCD = 1.375. In this example, the estimate of the ABCD = -18.625. Since ABCD is confounded with blocks, the ABCD interaction estimates the original interaction effect (1.375) with addition to the block effect (-20), hence ABCD = 1.375 + (-20) =-18.625. 272 Biostatistics & Research Methodology Table 13.5: Effect Estimates for the Blocked 24 Design Regression Coefficient Sum of Squares Per cent Contribution Model Term Effect Estimate 21.625 3.125 9.875 14.625 0.125 -18.125 16.625 2.375 -0.375 -1.125 1.875 4.125 -1.625 -2.625 -18.625 1870.5625 39.0625 390.0625 855.5625 0.0625 1314.0625 1105.5625 22.5625 0.5625 5.0625 14.0625 68.0625 10.5625 27.5625 1387.5625 A 10.81 26.30 B 1.56 0.55 C 4.94 5.49 7.31 12.03 <0.01 18.48 15.55 D 0.062 -9.06 AB AC AD 8.31 BC 1.19 0.32 BD -0.19 -0.56 <0.01 CD 0.07 ABC 0.94 0.20 ABD 2.06 0.96 ACD -0.81 -1.31 0.15 BCD 0.39 Blocks (ABCD) 19.51 The block effect can be calculated between two blocks as follows: Block Effect -y Block! -y Block2 406 555 -149 8 ~~ 8 ” 8 =-18.625 These effects are estimates as Block + ABCD.

Note that in case, the experiment was not run in blocks, and in case the magnitude (-20) had affected the first eight trials, then the results vary. Blocking and Confounding System (Chapter 13) 13.1.5. Confounding the 2 k Factorial Design in Four Blocks A 2 k factorial design confounded in four sections of 2 k‘2 observations can be constructed easily. These designs are useful when the number of factors is moderately large (k > 4), and the block sizes are very small. For example, assume 25 designs. In case, each block would have only eight runs, then four blocks would be useful. This design can be constructed in straightforward. Assume two effects confounded with blocks, according to ADE and BCE. Such effects have two defining contrasts associated with them. L, = x, + x4 + x5 Li = x2 + x3 + x5 273 Every treatment combination will give a particular values of Li (mod 2) and L2 (mod 2) like (L|, L2 ) = (0, 0), (0, 1 ) ( 1 , 0), or ( 1 , 1 ). The treatment combinations having the same values are assigned to a single block. In this example we get: Li = 0, L2 = 0 For ( 1 ), ad, be, abed, abe, ace, ede, bde L| = 1 , Li = 0 For a, d, abc, bed, be, abde, ce, aede Li = 0, L2= 1 For b, abd, c, acd, ae, de, abce, bede L, = 1 , L2 = 1 For e, ade, bee, abede, ab, bd, ac, cd The above combinations will be assigned to different blocks. Figure 13.4 shows the complete design. Block 1 L, = 1 Lz = l Block 1 L, = 0 L2 = 0 Block 1 L, = 1 Lj= 0 Block 1 L, = 0 L2 = 1 (1 ) abc be e abede a b abce ad ace d abde ade bd abd ae be ede bee ac abc ce c bede abed bde bed aede ab cd acd de Figure 13.4: 25 Design in Four Blocks with ADE, BCE and ABCD Confounded In addition to ADE and BCE, another effect must be confounded with the block. Another effect of one degree of freedom must be confounded because there are four blocks of three degrees of freedom between them and because ADE and BCE each have only one degree of freedom. This effect is the generalised form of ADE and BCE and can be determined by product of ADE and BCE modulus 2. Therefore generalised interaction (ADE) (BCE) = ABCDE2 = ABCD is also confounded with blocks. This can be easily verified for 25 designs, like a table of plus and minus signs. The treatment combination assigned to blocks is shown in the table below: Treatment Combinations In Sign on ADE Sign on BCE Sign on ABCD Block 1 Block 2 Block 3 Block 4 + + + + + + The product of the signs of any two effects for a block (e.g., ADE and BCE) gives additional effects for that block (ABCD). Therefore, ADE, BCE and ABCD are all confounded with blocks. 274 Biostatistics & Research Methodology The group-theory properties of principal block also hold. For example, the product of principal block of the two treatment combination gives another element of the principal block. This gives: ad • be = abed and abe • bde = ab2 =de2 = ad and so on. To design another block, we have to select that treatment combination that is not in the principal block such as b and multiply b by all the treatment combinations in the principal block. It provides: b (1) = b b • ad = abd b • be = b 2 c = c b • abed = ab2 cd = acd And so on, that is, it would produce eight treatment combinations in block 3. The principal blocks can be derived from the defined contrasts and group-theoretic property. The remaining blocks can be determined from these treatment combinations by the method given above. The typical process of building a 2 k design divided into four segments is to select two effects to make blocks, automatically confounding a third effect which is a generalized form of the first two. Then, the design is constructed using the group-theory properties of the principal block and two defined contrasts (L| , Li). To select confounded effects with blocks, precaution must be done to obtain a design that does not confound effects that may be of interest. For example, in 25 designs, we may select ABCDE and ABD, which automatically confounds CE, an effect of interest. A best option is to confound ADE and BCE, which confounds ABCD automatically. It is preferable to focus on three-factor interactions ADE and BCE rather than two-factor interaction CE.","completion":"Blocking and confounding are both statistical techniques used in experimental design to reduce variability and avoid misleading conclusions, particularly useful in two-level factorial designs where it\'s not feasible to run all experiments under uniform conditions. Blocking is used to group experimental runs into blocks to handle controllable nuisance variables, whereas confounding involves arranging the experiment in such a way that the effects of some factors are intentionally mixed (or confounded) with block effects, making it difficult to distinguish between them. **Example of Blocking:** Consider a chemical process experiment needing multiple batches of raw materials, implying that different batches may lead to variations in the experiment. If one needs to test the process three times (three replicates) but can only conduct four tests per batch of raw materials, three batches would be needed, forming three blocks. The analysis will consider these blocks, helping to isolate the variability due to batch differences from the factors being studied. In the provided example, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) table illustrates how the blocks have relatively small effects, indicating that the variability between batches (blocks) does not significantly impact the experiment\'s outcome. This separation allows for clearer analysis on the factors of interest. **Example of Confounding:** For a 2^2 design requiring the same amount of material for four treatments but only having enough material for two treatments per batch, you would end up needing two batches. If these batches are then treated as blocks, you can confound some effects with the blocks. In this scenario, the AB interaction gets confounded with the blocks, implying that the difference between blocks might also represent the AB interaction effect, complicating the analysis since the effects of AB and the block effects are indistinguishable. A detailed example illustrates how to confound a 2^3 design in two blocks by confounding the ABC interaction with the block effect. This approach is extended to more complex designs (e.g., 2^5 design confounded in four blocks), where the selection of effects to confound (e.g., ADE and BCE) directly influences the analysis and interpretation of results. It\'s crucial to carefully choose which effects to confound to avoid obscuring important interactions. The method of confounding is further detailed through mathematical modeling, showing how defining contrasts can determine which treatment combinations are assigned to which blocks. This sophisticated approach enables strategic blocking that can significantly aid in managing experimental variability and ensuring more reliable interpretations of the data. Lastly, an example is provided on how block effect can be quantified and analyzed within the framework of an ANOVA, emphasizing the importance of considering these effects in experimental design and analysis to draw accurate conclusions."},{"prompt":"I\'m working on a manga and I\'d like to tell you about its setting, tone and premise.","completion":"Sure, I\'d love to hear about it!

The use of Tokyo as a setting, particularly in 2012, adds an interesting temporal dimension, possibly leveraging the pre-Olympics anticipation or the aftermath of significant events like the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in broader Japan. The late autumn transitioning into colder, less predictable weather mirrors a gradual shift in mood or tension within the story. It\'s a smart way to use the environment to enhance storytelling, reflecting or contrasting the internal states of characters and the progression of the plot. Comparing it to \\"Hard Rain\\" and \\"V for Vendetta\\" suggests an action-packed narrative that might involve a significant amount of suspense, stealth, perhaps dealing with natural or man-made disasters (akin to \\"Hard Rain\\") while embracing the dramatic flair and mystery of \\"V for Vendetta.\\" The decision to steer away from direct political themes while potentially retaining that tense, insurgent atmosphere could open up a wide array of character-focused, psychological, or even speculative storytelling paths. Given this mix, the manga might carry a tone that balances between gritty realism and stylized noir, with the weather playing a crucial role in setting the scene for key narrative shifts. It leaves a lot of room for character development, particularly if the characters are navigating personal vendettas, natural elements, or societal undercurrents without the overt political commentary. The premise invites multiple layers of conflict—against self, against nature, and against societal norms—exploring themes of resilience, identity, and perhaps hidden truths. It would be fascinating to see how the characters evolve in such a charged yet understatedly complex setting.

Si deseas tener un margen de ganancia del 50%, calcularías el precio de venta de la siguiente manera: - Costo por unidad: 9.50 - Precio de venta sugerido (para un margen del 50%): 9.50 / (1 - 0.50) = 19 # Paso 6: Ganancia por Día/Horas/Minutos de Trabajo Si puedes hacer 8 llaveros en una hora (7.5 minutos por llavero): - Ganancia por llavero: 19 - 9.50 = 9.50 - Ganancia por hora (8 llaveros): 8 * 9.50 = 76 - Si trabajas 8 horas al día, tu ganancia sería: 8 * 76 = 608 Recuerda que estos cálculos son ejemplos y deben ser ajustados según tus costos reales de materiales, mano de obra, y otros gastos indirectos. Además, el precio de venta puede fluctuar basado en tu mercado objetivo, competencia, y la percepción de valor del cliente."},{"prompt":"Citez les différentes périodes dans l\'évolution de l\'éducation comparée et expliquer la troisième période ?","completion":"1.

[Pre-Chorus] Woe to those who\'ve never tasted the might, Of the cheese that turns the blackest night, Into a feast of unparalleled delight. [Chorus] Gouda, oh Gouda, in your whey, we\'re baptized, In the Thrones of the Lactose Dominion, our appetites maximized. A kingdom of creaminess, where the tangy rivers flow, Underneath the rinds of time, the seeds of flavor grow. [Verse 2] Behold the artisans, the keepers of the craft, In their hands, the curds and whey, deftly daft. Through the salt and brine, the ritual unfolds, In wooden molds, the sacred shape it holds. Bacteria and enzymes, in alchemy unite, In the chambers of aging, away from the light. Months to years, a vigil kept with care, Till the moment of unveiling, when all shall share. [Pre-Chorus] Cursed are the tongues that never savor, The depth of Gouda, the pinnacle of flavor. A testament to time, in every bite enthroned, In the empire of cheese, its dominion owned.

Для удаления кластера Proxmox VE (PVE) необходимо выполнить несколько шагов, чтобы убедиться, что все компоненты кластера будут корректно удалены. Отмечу, что после удаления кластера вся информация, связанная с кластером, будет потеряна. Перед удалением кластера рекомендуется сделать резервные копии всех важных данных. # Предупреждение: Перед выполнением следующих шагов убедитесь, что вы полностью понимаете последствия и имеете резервные копии всех важных данных. Следуйте инструкциям на свой страх и риск. # Действия по удалению кластера в Proxmox VE: 1. **Остановите все запущенные виртуальные машины и контейнеры** на всех узлах кластера. Это можно сделать через графический интерфейс Proxmox VE или с помощью командной строки, используя команды `qm stop <VMID>` для виртуальных машин и `pct stop <CTID>` для контейнеров. 2. **Удалите все узлы из кластера, кроме одного.** Это делается через графический интерфейс Proxmox VE в разделе \\"Datacenter\\" -> \\"Cluster\\" -> выберите узел -> \\"Remove node\\". Удаление должно производиться с каждым узлом кроме того, с которого вы собираетесь выполнять удаление кластера. 3. После того как в кластере останется только один узел, выполните следующие команды на этом узле через командную строку для окончательного удаления кластера: ```bash pvecm expected 1 systemctl stop pve-cluster systemctl stop corosync systemctl stop pve-corosync rm -rf /etc/pve/corosync.conf rm -rf /etc/pve/nodes/ rm -rf /etc/pve/.rrd rm -rf /etc/pve/.rrd.lck rm -rf /etc/pve/priv rm -rf /etc/corosync/* pvecm create <clustername> ``` **Примечание**: В последней команде `<clustername>` — это имя нового кластера, на случай если вы планируете создать новый кластер. Если вы не планируете создавать новый кластер, эту команду выполнять не обязательно. 4. После выполнения этих шагов, кластер будет удален. Вы можете перезагрузить узел, чтобы убедиться, что все службы перезапущены корректно. # Важно: - Убедитесь, что у вас есть физический или удаленный доступ к серверам, в случае если что-то пойдет не так и вам потребуется восстановить доступ к системе. - Проверьте файл `/etc/hosts` и убедитесь, что в нем нет записей, относящихся к удаленным узлам кластера. Если есть, их следует удалить. Это базовая процедура удаления кластера Proxmox VE. В зависимости от вашей конкретной конфигурации и используемых хранилищ могут потребоваться дополнительные шаги."},{"prompt":"я добавил в vmbr0 сетевую, видно что присвоен ip адресс, но этот ip не пингуется куда стоит смотреть чтобы проверить работоспособность","completion":"Если вы добавили сетевой интерфейс к `vmbr0` в вашей Proxmox VE (PVE) среде и присвоили ему IP-адрес, но этот адрес не отвечает на пинг, следует проверить несколько вещей для диагностики проблемы. Вот основные шаги, которые помогут вам проверить и устранить возможные неполадки: 1. **Проверьте конфигурацию сети на хосте Proxmox** - Убедитесь, что конфигурация сетевого интерфейса выполнена правильно. Можно проверить конфигурацию в файле `/etc/network/interfaces` или через веб-интерфейс Proxmox VE. Убедитесь, что заданы правильные настройки шлюза и подсети. 2. **Проверка состояния сетевого интерфейса** - Выполните команду `ip a` или `ifconfig` для просмотра статуса всех сетевых интерфейсов. Убедитесь, что интерфейс включен (помечен как `UP`) и имеет правильный IP-адрес. 3. **Проверка физического подключения** - Если интерфейс подключен через физический сетевой адаптер, убедитесь, что кабель подключен правильно и свитч, к которому вы подключены, работает нормально. 4. **Проверьте настройки брандмауэра** - Возможно, брандмауэр блокирует ICMP-эхо запросы (пинги). Проверьте настройки брандмауэра как на хостовой системе, так и на уровне виртуальных машин (если это применимо). 5. **Проверьте таблицу маршрутизации** - Выполните `ip route` или `route -n`, чтобы увидеть таблицу маршрутизации и убедиться, что маршруты настроены правильно, и трафик может должным образом выйти из сети и вернуться обратно. 6. **Проверьте ARP таблицы** - Используйте `arp -a` для проверки ARP таблицы и убедитесь, что MAC-адрес, соответствующий IP-адресу, отображается корректно. 7. **Используйте утилиту traceroute или tracert** - Эти утилиты могут помочь отследить путь пакетов до целевого IP-адреса и выявить на каком этапе происходит потеря пакетов. 8. **Проверьте журналы системы** - Проверьте системные журналы на наличие сообщений, касающихся сетевой активности или ошибок. Журналы можно просмотреть с помощью команд `dmesg`, `journalctl`, или проверки файлов журналов в `/var/log/`. Если проверка всех этих пунктов не помогла обнаружить проблему, рассмотрите возможность временного отключения брандмауэра или SELinux/AppArmor (если они включены) для исключения их влияния на сетевую активность. Также рекомендуется проверить конфигурацию на сторонних маршрутизаторах или свитчах, поскольку проблема может быть связана с настройками на этих устройствах."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

Из других родственников у Карташова были только сын от первого брака и 38-летняя жена. Кто будет призван к наследованию и на каком основании? Какие лица могут быть наследниками по завещанию? Кто унаследует гараж после смерти Карташова?","completion":"В случае смерти Карташова, наследование его имущества будет происходить в соответствии с нормами Гражданского кодекса Российской Федерации. Учитывая представленную ситуацию, разберем все вопросы по порядку: 1. **Кто будет призван к наследованию и на каком основании?** Наследование делится на два основных вида: по завещанию и по закону. Поскольку автомобиль был упомянут в завещание и отходит сестре Карташова, это показывает использование завещательного приказа для раздела данной части имущества. Однако поскольку о гараже ничего не сказано в завещании, он будет наследоваться по закону. Наследники по закону делятся на очереди. В первую очередь входят дети наследодателя, супруг и родители. Следовательно, сын от первого брака и 38-летняя жена Карташова призываются к наследованию гаража как наследники первой очереди по закону. 2. **Какие лица могут быть наследниками по завещанию?** В завещание могут быть включены любые лица, как родственники, так и третьи лица. То есть, наследниками по завещанию могут быть указаны любые физические и юридические лица, которым наследодатель желал оставить часть своего имущества. В данном случае, сестра Карташова является наследником по завещанию в отношении автомобиля. 3. **Кто унаследует гараж после смерти Карташова?** Гараж, который не был упомянут в завещании, будет наследоваться по закону. Таким образом, его наследниками будут сын Карташова от первого брака и его 38-летняя жена как наследники первой очереди. Раздел имущества между наследниками первой очереди обычно происходит в равных долях, если не установлено иное договоренностями между ними или особыми условиями завещания (которое в данном случае не затрагивает гараж). Таким образом, гараж будет разделен между сыном и женой Карташова, за неимением иной установки через завещательные документы или договоренности."},{"prompt":"3. В январе 2017 года Штарков Алексей обратился в суд с иском к племянникам Штаркову Евгению и Балабановой Юлии о признании права собственности на квартиру в порядке наследования по закону. Ранее квартира принадлежала матери истца, умершей в 2015 году. Свои требования истец обосновал тем, что он фактически принял наследство в виде квартиры, так как проживал совместно с матерью на момент смерти, производит оплату коммунальных услуг, забрал и использует принадлежащий матери холодильники просит признать за ним право собственности на указанную квартиру. В свою очередь ответчики во встречном иске требовали восстановления срока для принятия наследства, пропущенного по уважительной причине, в связи с тем, что родственные связи с бабушкой были утрачены после расторжения брака между их матерью и отцом Штарковым Олегом. А родственные связи с другими родственниками отца ими не поддерживались. В судебном заседании было установлено, что наследниками первой очереди по закону являются Штарков Алексей - сын умершей, Штарков Евгенийи Балабанова Юлия - дети скончавшегося до открытия наследства сына умершей- Олега Штаркова, которые наследуют по праву представления. Истец в судебном заседании заявленные исковые требования поддержал в полном объеме, встречные исковые требования не признал, в обоснование своих возражений ссылался на то, что никто не чинил племянникам препятствий в общении с бабушкой, однако, они не изъявляли желания общаться и видеться. У ответчиков после смерти отца остался мобильный телефон со всеми контактами родственников, в том числе его, Штаркова, и умершей. Племянникам о смерти18бабушки он сообщил в ходе телефонного разговора с последними, но они на данное сообщение никак не прореагировали. Допрошенные в качестве свидетелей соседи пояснили, что после смерти их соседки во владение и управление принадлежащим ей имуществом вступил сын умершей Штарков Алексей, который принял меры по сохранению наследственного имущества в виде квартиры, производит коммунальные платежи за содержание жилья и предоставляемые услуги.

Что такое фактическое принятие наследства? Должен ли быть восстановлен срок для принятия наследства Штаркову Евгению и Балабановой Юлии?","completion":"1. **Какое решение должен принять суд?** Суд должен рассмотреть доказательства фактического принятия наследства Штарковым Алексеем, а также аргументы и обстоятельства, представленные ответчиками - Штарковым Евгением и Балабановой Юлией относительно восстановления срока для принятия наследства. Учитывая нормы Гражданского кодекса РФ, суд, вероятно, установит, что Штарков Алексей фактически принял наследство, учитывая его действия по уходу за умершей матерью, оплату коммунальных расходов и сохранение имущества. Однако суд также должен учесть законные права Евгения и Юлии как наследников первой очереди, которые имеют право на свою долю в наследстве. Суд должен взвесить все факты и обстоятельства дела, включая представленные доказательства и аргументы обеих сторон. 2. **Что такое фактическое принятие наследства?** Фактическое принятие наследства – это действия, свидетельствующие о желании наследника принять наследство и осуществить свои права на него. Такие действия включают в себя оплату расходов, связанных с наследственным имуществом, занятие, использование или уход за имуществом наследодателя и т.д., которые должны производиться наследником после смерти наследодателя. Важным аспектом является то, что такие действия должны быть совершены в срок, установленный для принятия наследства, то есть в течение шести месяцев после даты смерти. 3. **Должен ли быть восстановлен срок для принятия наследства Штаркову Евгению и Балабановой Юлии?** Восстановление срока для принятия наследства возможно, если пропуск срока произошел по уважительной причине. В данном случае, Евгений и Юлия указывают на утрату родственных связей после развода родителей как причину своего непринятия наследства в установленный срок. Суду необходимо оценить представленные доказательства, включая обстоятельства утраты связи с бабушкой, и решить, является ли данная причина уважительной для пропуска срока принятия наследства. Если суд признает причины уважительными, ему следует восстановить срок для принятия наследства ответчиками. Тем не менее, конечное решение зависит от полноты и достоверности представленных доказательств, а также от того, как суд оценит аргументы всех сторон и применит действующее законодательство."},{"prompt":"4. Шаля обратилась в суд с иском к Павловой о толковании завещания и признании права собственности на денежные вклады в порядке наследования по завещанию. Требования Шаля мотивированы тем, что 15 февраля 2017 года умерла ее тетя по мужу - Трегулова. После смерти Трегуловой открылось наследство, состоящее из двух денежных вкладов, находящихся в ПАО «Сбербанк» на общую сумму 2 млн. рублей. Ответчик Павлова является наследницей второй очереди по закону по праву представления (племянница Трегуловой), которая также претендует на наследство, открывшееся после смерти последней. 10 марта 2016 года Трегуловой было составлено завещание вклада, по которому принадлежащие ей права на денежные средства со всеми процентами и компенсациями последняя завещала истице. Будучи обеспокоенной судьбой, принадлежащей ей на праве собственности квартиры, Трегулова также приняла решение ее завещать. Так, 25 апреля 2016 года Трегуловой было составлено завещание, по условиям которого принадлежащую ей на праве собственности квартиру последняя завещала Шале, Павловой, Смирновой и Иванову в равных долях. В дальнейшем, желая изменить условия указанного выше завещания от 25.04.2016 г.., Трегулова составила новое завещание от 18.06.2016 г., по условиям которого принадлежащую ей квартиру завещала только Шаля и Павловой по 1/2 доле каждой. При этом ранее составленное завещание, которым принцип наследования квартиры был иным, Трегулова отменила. Дословно запись об этом в завещании выглядела следующим образом: «Ранее составленное завещание настоящим завещанием отменено». На основании договора дарения в январе 2017 года принадлежащую ей на праве собственности квартиру Трегулова подарила истице и Павловой по 1/2доле каждой. После смерти Трегуловой в установленный законом срок и в установленном законом порядке Шаля обратилась к нотариусу с заявлением о принятии в порядке наследования по завещанию наследства, открывшегося после смерти Трегуловой, в виде денежных средств, находящихся на вкладах, предъявив при этом завещание вклада. Однако нотариус посчитал, что содержание завещания нуждается в толковании и в выдаче свидетельства о праве на наследство вкладов отказал. Может ли завещатель распорядиться своим имуществом, составив несколько завещаний? Вправе ли завещатель отменить или изменить составленное им завещание? В какое время? Необходимо ли указывать причины его отмены или изменения? Может ли завещатель посредством нового завещания отменить прежнее завещание в целом либо изменить его посредством отмены или изменения отдельных, содержащихся в нем завещательных распоряжений? Какое решение должен принять суд?","completion":"1. **Может ли завещатель распорядиться своим имуществом, составив несколько завещаний?** Да, завещатель вправе составлять несколько завещаний. Важно понимать, что последнее по времени завещание отменяет предыдущие в той части, в которой они противоречат друг другу. Завещатель имеет полную свободу в распоряжении своим имуществом и может изменять условия распоряжения этим имуществом, составляя новые завещания на протяжении своей жизни. 2. **Вправе ли завещатель отменить или изменить составленное им завещание? В какое время? Необходимо ли указывать причины его отмены или изменения?** Завещатель вправе в любой момент отменить или изменить составленное им завещание, не обязан приводить причины отмены или изменений. Изменение или отмена завещания происходит путем составления нового завещания, в котором указаны изменения, или которое полностью отменяет предыдущее. Не существует законного требования предоставлять причины отмены или изменения завещания. 3. **Может ли завещатель посредством нового завещания отменить прежнее завещание в целом либо изменить его посредством отмены или изменения отдельных, содержащихся в нем завещательных распоряжений?** Да, завещатель может через новое завещание отменить предшествующее завещание в целом или изменить его, отменяя или изменяя отдельные распоряжения, содержавшиеся в прежнем завещании. Это позволяет завещателю адаптировать свои последние волеизъявления к изменяющимся жизненным обстоятельствам или решениям. 4. **Какое решение должен принять суд?** В данном случае, суд должен опираться на принципы наследственного права РФ и факты дела при его рассмотрении. Суду необходимо толковать завещание(я) в соответствии с истинными намерениями завещателя на основании представленных документов и доказательств. Поскольку в последнем завещании отдельно указано, что предыдущее завещание отменено, суд должен признать волеизъявление Трегуловой, выраженное в последнем завещании, как действительное и окончательное в отношении квартиры. Таким образом, суд должен признать право Шаля на денежные вклады в соответствии с завещанием вклада от 10 марта 2016 года, так как оно прямо передает ей права на указанные денежные средства. Что касается недвижимости, последнее завещание от 18.06.2016 года, в котором квартира завещается Шале и Павловой по 1/2 доле каждой, должно рассматриваться как окончательное волеизъявление Трегуловой по этому вопросу, если только не будет представлено доказательств последующего изменения или отмены этого завещания, например, через договор дарения. В любом случае, суд должен взять в расчет все юридически значимые события и документы, предшествовавшие и последовавшие за составлением завещаний, включая договор дарения квартиры."},{"prompt":"Задание 1.

Подпись: Иванько З.П.","completion":"При составлении завещания были допущены следующие ошибки: 1. **Завещание на имущество, принадлежащее на правах совместной собственности супругов.** Квартира, указанная в завещании, принадлежит Иванько и его супруге. В Российском законодательстве прямо указано, что завещать можно только долю в праве совместной собственности, если иное не урегулировано согласием второго супруга. 2. **Завещание на имущество, не принадлежащее завещателю.** Указание в завещании денежных средств, находящихся на вкладе, открытом на имя супруги завещателя, является ошибкой, поскольку эти средства принадлежат не ему, а его супруге. Завещать можно только свое имущество. 3. **Ошибочное указание права на земельный участок.** В завещании указано, что земельный участок принадлежит на праве постоянного (бессрочного) пользования, однако в современном российском законодательстве такое право на землю не предусмотрено. Вероятно, имелось в виду право пожизненного наследуемого владения или право собственности. 4. **Неточности и опущения.** В завещании не указаны дополнительные данные о завещателе и свидетелях завещания, что может вызвать вопросы при подтверждении подлинности документа. Также нет упоминания о том, что сделано с предыдущими завещаниями, если они имелись. 5. **Неоднозначное формулирование относительно наследования животного.** Хотя на практике в завещание можно включать распоряжения о судьбе домашних животных, следует точно указать, кто будет заботиться о животном, чтобы избежать неоднозначного толкования данного пункта завещания. Итак, при составлении завещания важно четко и грамотно формулировать свои волеизъявления, учитывая действующее законодательство и указывать только то имущество, которым завещатель вправе распоряжаться."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

Here lived a young girl, known by the call-sign \\"Red\\" for her crimson space-suit. Red had one crucial mission: to deliver a package of rare medicinal nanites to her grandmother, living in isolation on the moon Enceladus. Armed with her AI-powered hood that protected her from cosmic elements and enhanced her senses, Red set off in her sleek spacecraft, the Vermilion Arrow. The journey required a trip through the Asteroid Belt of Shadows, a treacherous path known for its pirate drones and gravitational anomalies. **Part II: Encounter with the Cyber Wolf** As Red navigated the belt, her ship\'s sensors picked up an anomaly: a distress signal emanating from a nearby asteroid. Upon landing, she encountered a strangely charismatic cyborg, known in the cybernetic underworld as the \\"Wolf.\\" This Wolf, once a feared bounty hunter, now lay in ruins from a battle, pleading for assistance. Red, wary yet compassionate, offered minimal aid but refused to divulge the nature of her mission or her destination. However, the cunning Wolf, with cybernetic enhancements for hacking and manipulation, covertly extracted this information during their interaction. **Part III: The Race Against Time** Red, unaware of the Wolf\'s deceit, continued her journey. Meanwhile, the Wolf, now partially repaired, raced ahead, intending to seize Red\'s cargo for himself. Utilizing black-market tech, he arrived at Enceladus first, employing a holographic disguise to impersonate Red\'s grandmother. Upon landing, Red sensed something amiss through the subtle alerts from her AI hood. She approached her grandmother\'s dome with caution, the comforting glow of the homestead belying the danger within. **Part IV: The Confrontation** Confronted by the disguised Wolf, Red\'s combat training kicked in. A tense battle ensued, blending physical prowess with technological warfare. Just when the Wolf seemed to gain the upper hand, Red\'s AI hood unleashed a countermeasure never before activated—the Galactic Howl, a sonic weapon of immense power. The Howl disrupted the Wolf\'s cybernetic systems, revealing his true form. In the ensuing chaos, Red managed to secure the nanites, but not before the Wolf, in a final act of desperation, triggered a self-destruct sequence in the dome. **Part V: The Legacy of the Eden Core** With mere seconds to spare, Red, carrying her injured grandmother, fled to the Vermilion Arrow. They launched into space as the explosion illuminated Enceladus\' icy surface. Safe aboard her ship, Red administered the nanites, healing her grandmother. The true value of Red’s cargo was then revealed—a piece of the legendary Eden Core, capable of generating life-sustaining environments, promising to transform barren worlds into vibrant ecosystems. The tale of Red\'s bravery spread across the galaxy, inspiring songs and stories. She didn\'t just deliver a package; she carried hope. And the Wolf? His wreckage became a beacon, warning those who would prey upon the weak that courage and compassion could overcome the greatest of threats. **Epilogue: A New Dawn** With the Eden Core now being used to terraform dead planets, Red and her grandmother embarked on a new mission: to spread life throughout the cosmos, ensuring that the legacy of their adventure would bloom in the form of new worlds, teeming with life and possibilities. Thus, the fable of Red Apex not only became a tale of caution but also of wonder, showcasing that even in the vastness of space, bravery, and goodness could light the darkest corners of the galaxy."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

The indicator is licensed under Mozilla Public License 2.0. It utilizes John Ehlers’ Gaussian Filter method, combined with lag reduction and filtered true range to identify and signal trend activities on trading charts. Let’s break it down step by step: 1. **Introduction and License:** The script begins with a header mentioning the copyright and license (Mozilla Public License 2.0), followed by the ASCII art styled title. 2. **Study Declaration:** It uses the `study` function to define the script as an indicator, setting its title, short title, and specifying that it will be plotted on the price chart (`overlay=true`). 3. **Conceptual Overview:** The indicator description explains that it experiments with Ehlers Gaussian Filter technique, aiming to reduce lag and analyze trend activity through the calculation of a moving average applied multiple times. It also mentions the inclusion of custom bar colors and a shoutout to another developer who helped improve the calculation method. 4. **Functions Declaration:** - **`f_filt9x`:** A function designed to calculate the Gaussian Filter based on alpha (_a), source (_s), and number of poles (_i). This function calculates the filter through a series of weighted averages and historical data. - **`f_pole`:** It\'s used to declare multiple filters for up to 9 poles, applying the `f_filt9x` function with varying pole numbers to generate different filtered outputs. 5. **Inputs:** These are user-defined parameters that allow customization of the indicator, including the source data (`src`), the number of poles (`N`), the sampling period (`per`), the multiplier for the filtered true range (`mult`), and options for lag reduction and fast response. 6. **Definitions and Calculations:** - **Beta and Alpha Components:** It begins by calculating values for `beta` and `alpha`, which are crucial for determining the weight and smoothing of the Gaussian Filter. - **Data Preparation:** Adjusts the source (`srcdata`) and true range (`trdata`) data considering if lag reduction mode is enabled. - **Filtered Values Calculation:** Uses the previously defined `f_pole` function to calculate the filtered values for both the source data and the true range, with adjustments for lag reduction mode. - **Band Calculations:** Determines the upper (`hband`) and lower (`lband`) bands of the channel by adding and subtracting the filtered true range from the filtered source data. 7. **Outputs:** - **Filter and Band Plots:** Plots the main filter line and the upper and lower bands of the channel. - **Channel Fill:** Fills the area between the upper and lower bands for visual emphasis. - **Bar Coloring:** Customizes the color of price bars based on their position relative to the filter and channel bands to indicate market trend direction. The script is structured to offer flexibility and customization, allowing users to tweak the poles, sampling period, and other parameters to fit various trading strategies and timeframes. The inclusion of lag reduction and fast response options aims to provide more accurate and timely signals by minimizing the inherent delay in moving average-based indicators."},{"prompt":"explain all the details eg what is the gaussian filter and truerange and also f_filt9x and f_pole: works and elaborate what is a pole that explain all this like you are teaching a beginner","completion":"Let\'s break down some of the complex concepts mentioned in the provided Pine Script code, aiming at a beginner\'s level of understanding. We\'ll tackle key terms like the Gaussian Filter, True Range, and the workings of functions like `f_filt9x` and `f_pole`. We\'ll also explain what a \\"pole\\" refers to in this context. # What is a Gaussian Filter? A Gaussian Filter is a way to smooth out data, helping to reduce noise and highlight trends within a data set. It\'s named after the Gaussian (normal) distribution, a bell-shaped curve often used in statistics for probability distributions. In the context of this trading script, the Gaussian Filter is applied to market data (like stock prices) to help traders identify underlying trends by smoothing out daily price fluctuations. The concept of applying the filter multiple times, introducing multiple poles, is to further refine the smoothing effect. # What is True Range? True Range is a measure used in trading to understand the volatility of a stock or asset. It\'s calculated by taking the greatest of the following three values: 1. The difference between the current high and the current low. 2. The difference between the previous close and the current high. 3. The difference between the previous close and the current low. This measurement is particularly useful for ensuring that the trading indicator accurately reflects the asset\'s volatility when drawing the Gaussian Channel. # How `f_filt9x` Works The `f_filt9x` function within the script is designed to calculate the Gaussian Filter based on three inputs: alpha (_a, a smoothing factor), source (_s, the market data), and number of poles (_i). Without delving too deeply into the mathematical details, it uses these inputs to progressively smooth the data. The process involves applying weighted averages on the source data, where the weights (like _m2, _m3..._m9) are dependent on the number of poles used. Multiple applications of these weights (via powers of _x, which is derived from alpha) progressively refine the smoothness of the filter. # Understanding Poles In signal processing and the context of this trading indicator, a \\"pole\\" essentially refers to the complexity of the filter—the more poles, the smoother the resulting data, because the filter is applied multiple times. You can think of each \\"pole\\" as an additional layer of smoothing, with nine poles being the maximum in this specific script. More poles lead to a smoother data line, but also introduce more lag, which means the indicator might react slower to real-time price changes. # How `f_pole` Functions The `f_pole` function is where the application of the previously defined `f_filt9x` happens for a specific number of poles. It selects how many filters (up to nine, based on _i) to apply to the data. If a user selects 4 poles (N = 4), it calculates four layers of smoothing on the source data (_s) using the alpha value (_a) to adjust the smoothing degree each time. This function organizes the application of `f_filt9x` across varying pole conditions to produce the final smoothed data (filter) for plotting. # In Summary - A **Gaussian Filter** is used for smoothing market data to highlight trends by mimicking a bell-shaped curve\'s properties. - **True Range** calculates the volatility of an asset, important for adjusting the Gaussian Channel\'s sensitivity to market movements. - **`f_filt9x`** is a function that calculates the smoothing of the data based on specified parameters, influenced heavily by the \\"pole\\" concept. - **Poles** determine the level of smoothing by indicating how many times the Gaussian Filter is applied—the more poles, the smoother (but possibly lagging) the output. - **`f_pole`** organizes the entire smoothing process, determining how many times (based on the number of poles) to apply `f_filt9x` for final plotting on the chart. By combining these elements, traders can visualize smoothed market trends within a specified channel, aiding in their decision-making process by using historical volatility and trend analysis."},{"prompt":"now explain to me the mathematical intricasies of the f_pole and how it is applied to the source data","completion":"To understand the mathematical intricacies of the `f_pole` function and its application to source data, let\'s delve deeper into how it\'s structured and works in the context of the given Pine Script.

The number of poles (`_i` in the code) directly influences the degree of smoothing: more poles mean more layers of filtering, which results in smoother but potentially more lagging output. # Understanding the `f_filt9x` Function The work of `f_pole` is heavily based on `f_filt9x`, which is the core function performing the Gaussian filtering with adjustments for poles. The function `f_filt9x` employs a mathematical formula that involves recursive calculations based on weights derived from the alpha (`_a`) parameter and the data to be filtered (`_s`). # Formula Breakdown The core of `f_filt9x` processes input data `_s` and a smoothing factor `_a` through a sophisticated weighted sum that includes: - **Alpha (`_a`):** A coefficient that determines the extent of smoothing, derived from the input parameters beta and the number of poles. This factor controls how much of the current value and past values influence the filter output. - **Source Data (`_s`):** The market data to be filtered, which could be price or any other relevant trading data. - **Recursive Component:** The function uses the filter\'s previous outputs (e.g., `_f[1]`, `_f[2]`, ... `_f[9]`) in its calculation, making it recursive. This recursion is essential for applying the multiple layers of smoothing inherent to the concept of poles. # Poles and Weighting In `f_filt9x`, the application of weights (like `_m2`, `_m3`, `_m9`) is determined by the pole count. These weights influence how much each layer of smoothing (each additional pole) contributes to the final output. The weights and their exponential adjustments against the recursive components ensure that the smoothing becomes increasingly refined with more poles, but without an abrupt loss of data integrity. # The Mathematical Process of `f_pole` When `f_pole` calls `f_filt9x`, it iteratively applies the filtering based on the specified number of poles (`_i`). Here\'s a simplified breakdown: 1. **Initialize Filtering:** For each pole (from 1 up to 9 as specified), it applies `f_filt9x`, which incorporates the market data (`_s`), alpha (`_a`), and recursive smoothing through weighted contributions of past filtered values. 2. **Layered Application:** Each pole represents an additional layer of filtering. For example, with 4 poles, the data is smoothed four times, each time applying `f_filt9x` with the current output serving as input for the next layer. 3. **Compilation of Outputs:** The function ultimately provides a set of filtered outputs, each corresponding to the degree of smoothing from 1 pole up to the specified number of poles. This allows for comparison or further processing, such as averaging or adjusting based on additional criteria. Through this process, `f_pole` meticulously applies progressively refined layers of smoothing to the input data, helping to filter out noise and reveal underlying trends in the market data with varying degrees of lag and smoothness. Whether implementing for financial data analysis, signal processing, or any application requiring nuanced data smoothing, understanding and applying concepts like Gaussian filters and recursive weighting with careful consideration of the impact of parameters like alpha and pole count are key to achieving desired outcomes."},{"prompt":"Proyecto: hacer llaveros con resina , sacar costo de venta con materiales, mano de obra, costó por unidad, tiempo de elaboración, valor de la unidad, ganancia día horas y minutos que me gaste haciendo los llaveros con resina","completion":"Calcular el costo de venta de llaveros de resina incluye varios factores, cada uno de los cuales debe cuantificarse y valorarse para determinar el precio de venta adecuado y la ganancia esperada. A continuación, se desglosa un esquema general que puedes adaptar según los costos específicos y el tiempo invertido en tu proyecto. # 1. Costos de Materiales Para calcular esto, suma el costo de todos los materiales utilizados en la producción de los llaveros, incluyendo la resina, los moldes (si se amortizan por cantidad de usos), colorantes, inclusiónes como flores o brillos, cadenas o anillos de llavero, y cualquier otro material consumido. **Ejemplo:** - Resina: 10 (por la cantidad usada por llavero) - Colorantes e inclusiones: 2 - Cadena o anillo de llavero: 1 - **Total materiales por unidad: 13** # 2. Costos de Mano de Obra Determina cuánto tiempo te lleva hacer un solo llavero y decide cuánto quieres ganar por hora. Luego, divide ese número por la cantidad de llaveros que puedes hacer en una hora para encontrar el costo de mano de obra por unidad. **Ejemplo:** - Tiempo por llavero: 10 minutos - Costo deseado por hora de trabajo: 20 - Llaveros por hora: 6 - **Costo de mano de obra por unidad: 3.33** (20/6) # 3. Costos Indirectos Incluye gastos como electricidad, alquiler del espacio de trabajo, etc. Esto puede ser complicado de dividir por unidad, pero intenta hacer un estimado razonable. **Ejemplo:** - Costo mensual de gastos indirectos: 100 - Llaveros producidos en el mes: 200 - **Costo indirecto por unidad: 0.50** (100/200) # 4. Tiempo de Elaboración Es importante tener un cálculo del tiempo total de elaboración para planificar la producción y el precio adecuadamente. **Ejemplo:** - Tiempo por llavero: 10 minutos - Si se hacen 60 en un día: 10 horas # 5. Costo por Unidad Suma los costos anteriores para obtener el costo total por unidad. **Ejemplo:** - Materiales: 13 - Mano de obra: 3.33 - Costos indirectos: 0.50 - **Costo total por unidad: 16.83** # 6. Precio de Venta y Ganancia El precio de venta debe cubrir el costo por unidad y añadir un margen de beneficio deseado. **Ejemplo:** - Margen de beneficio deseado: 50% sobre el costo - Precio de venta sugerido por unidad: 16.83 * 1.5 = 25.25 - Ganancia por unidad: 25.25 - 16.83 = 8.42 # 7. Cálculo de Ganancias por Tiempo Dependiendo de cuántos llaveros vendas y el tiempo invertido, puedes calcular tus ganancias por día, hora o minuto. **Ejemplo:** - Si vendes 10 llaveros en un día: 10 * 8.42 = 84.20 de ganancia al día - Ganancia por hora (asumiendo 10 horas de trabajo): 84.20/10 = 8.42 por hora - Ganancia por minuto: 8.42/60 = aproximadamente 0.14 por minuto Este es solo un ejemplo simple y deberías adaptar los cálculos a tus costos reales y al precio de mercado de productos similares en tu área. También considera que los precios de los materiales y otros costos pueden variar, y es importante mantener estos cálculos actualizados."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

Happy coding!"},{"prompt":"python split and return first array","completion":"If you\'re looking to split a string in Python and return the first item (or array in other programming languages, but in Python, it would be referred to as a \\"list\\" after splitting), you can easily do this using the `.split()` method. The `.split()` method divides a string into a list where each word is a list item. The default separator is any whitespace, but you can specify any string as the separator. Here\'s a basic example: ```python # A sample string my_string = \\"Hello World Python Programming\\" # Splitting the string into a list of words words = my_string.split() # \'words\' is now [\\"Hello\\", \\"World\\", \\"Python\\", \\"Programming\\"] # To get the first element of the list first_word = words[0] print(first_word) # Output: Hello ``` If you want to split by a different character, like a comma, you just need to pass that character to the `.split()` method. Here\'s an example where the string is delimited by commas: ```python my_string = \\"Hello,World,Python,Programming\\" # Splitting the string into a list of words by comma words = my_string.split(\',\') first_word = words[0] print(first_word) # Output: Hello ``` In the context of getting the \\"first array,\\" it\'s worth noting that after splitting a string in Python, you\'re working with a list. If you\'re coming from another programming language, this might seem a bit different since Python doesn\'t have a built-in array type in the same way as languages like JavaScript. The list is Python\'s version of an array and is very flexible and powerful. To further clarify, if you\'re expecting to split into two or more lists based on a more complex structure, you\'d typically first split your string into the primary list (as shown above) and then possibly split further or process those elements depending on your specific requirements. Remember, when working with `.split()`, if you don\'t specify a separator, it will default to split by any whitespace. This feature is handy for quickly breaking up sentences into words, as in the first example."},{"prompt":"how to build vpn server on ubuntu","completion":"Building a VPN server on Ubuntu can provide a secure way to connect to your network from remote locations. A popular software to achieve this is OpenVPN, a robust and highly flexible VPN daemon. This guide will provide a high-level overview of setting up an OpenVPN server on an Ubuntu machine. Please note that this guide assumes you\'re using Ubuntu 20.04 or later. # Step 1: Install OpenVPN and Easy-RSA First, you need to install the OpenVPN software and Easy-RSA, a small RSA key management package used for generating SSL certificates. Open a terminal and run: ```bash sudo apt update sudo apt install openvpn easy-rsa ``` # Step 2: Set Up the Certificate Authority The Certificate Authority (CA) is responsible for creating and managing digital certificates. It will allow your VPN client and server to authenticate one another. 1. Make a directory for your CA: ```bash make-cadir ~/openvpn-ca cd ~/openvpn-ca ``` 2. You\'ll need to modify the `vars` file to customize your certificates. Open the file with your preferred editor: ```bash nano vars ``` Find and modify the `KEY_*` variables (e.g., `KEY_COUNTRY`, `KEY_PROVINCE`, `KEY_CITY`, `KEY_ORG`, `KEY_EMAIL`) to match your organization\'s details. 3. After saving and closing the file, source the vars file and build your CA: ```bash source vars ./clean-all ./build-ca ``` # Step 3: Create the Server Certificate, Key, and Encryption Files 1. First, source the vars file if you\'ve not already: ```bash source vars ``` 2. Then, build the server certificate and key: ```bash ./build-key-server server ``` Follow the on-screen prompts. The defaults should be fine if you\'ve correctly edited the `vars` file in the previous step. 3. Generate the Diffie-Hellman key exchange file: ```bash ./build-dh ``` 4. Generate an HMAC signature to strengthen the server\'s TLS integrity verification capabilities: ```bash openvpn --genkey --secret keys/ta.key ``` # Step 4: Configure the OpenVPN Service 1. Copy the example server configuration file to the OpenVPN directory: ```bash sudo cp /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/server.conf.gz /etc/openvpn/ cd /etc/openvpn sudo gzip -d server.conf.gz ``` 2. Edit the configuration file: ```bash sudo nano server.conf ``` Un-comment and adjust the lines: - `ca ca.crt` - `cert server.crt` - `key server.key` - `dh dh.pem` Also, the path might need adjustment depending on where your CA is located. 3. Copy the server keys and certificates into the OpenVPN directory: ```bash sudo cp ~/openvpn-ca/keys/{server.crt,server.key,ca.crt,dh2048.pem,ta.key} /etc/openvpn/ ``` # Step 5: Adjust the Network Configuration 1. Allow IP forwarding by editing the `sysctl.conf` file: ```bash sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf ``` Find and uncomment the line `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`. Apply the changes: ```bash sudo sysctl -p ``` 2. Configure `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) to allow the VPN traffic: Adjust your `ufw` settings accordingly, allowing UDP traffic on the OpenVPN port (default 1194) and configuring NAT forwarding. # Step 6: Starting OpenVPN Start the OpenVPN server by: ```bash sudo systemctl start openvpn@server ``` Enable it to start at boot: ```bash sudo systemctl enable openvpn@server ``` # Step 7: Creating Client Configuration Files You\'ll then need to create configuration files for each client. This process involves generating client certificates and keys, modifying client configuration samples, and ensuring the client is configured to connect to your server\'s public IP. Remember, this guide provides a high-level overview. Each of these steps involves deeper considerations, especially related to security settings and firewalls. Always refer to the latest OpenVPN documentation and Ubuntu security guidelines when configuring your VPN."},{"prompt":"Christian Vaughn is the newest member of a group of con-artists.

The allure of the criminal underworld had dazzled him at first, especially when he’d managed to impress Thomas, the enigmatic leader of the group of con artists he’d fallen in with. However, the reality of his new life, woven with danger and deceit, quickly began to loom over him like a dark cloud. The group was a motley crew of outlaws, each more cunning and dangerous than the next, but none was as perilous or as captivating as Selina. With her beauty that seemed to shimmer in the moonlight and a smile that hinted at secrets darker than the night, she was a living enigma. Yet, beneath that seductive exterior was a viper ready to strike, and Christian had seen enough to know he needed to escape before he found himself in a situation he couldn’t charm his way out of. Under the guise of night, Christian packed the few belongings he had. His heart pounded against his chest, not just from the fear of leaving but from the exhilaration of outsmarting a group of con artists. He tiptoed past the rooms of his slumbering comrades, each step a silent prayer not to awake the predators that lurked in the shadows. Just as he reached the door, a voice, smooth as silk yet charged with danger, stopped him in his tracks. “Running away, Christian?” Selina’s words slithered into his ears, wrapping around his mind like a vice. “I just need some air,” Christian lied, his voice betraying a hint of the panic that fluttered in his chest. Selina tilted her head, her lips curling into a knowing smile. “Air, hmm? And here I thought you were smarter than the rest. But go ahead, leave if you must. Though, I must warn you, you\'ll regret it for the rest of your life.” Christian swallowed hard, the ominous edge in Selina’s voice sending shivers down his spine. Determination fueled his resolve, and he made to step past her, only to be caught in her grasp like a fly in a spider’s web. In an instant, Selina was upon him, her arms snaking around his neck and her legs coiling around his body with the agility of a panther. He gasped, struggling against her hold, but it was futile. Selina’s strength was surprising, her grip tightening playfully yet with enough force to let him know she wasn’t to be trifled with. “Let’s not make this difficult, darling,” she whispered into his ear, a hint of menace laced with her seductive charm. Christian’s vision blurred as he felt the darkness envelop him, Selina’s playful chokehold proving too much for him. His last conscious thought was a mix of regret and a begrudging admiration for the woman who had bested him. He awoke with a start, confusion clouding his mind as he found himself back in his room, the morning light aggressively intruding through the curtains. His attempts to move were futile; he was tied to his bed, a realization that made his heart sink. As he lay there, trying to process the events, a note caught his eye. Picking it up with trembling hands, he read the elegantly written words that sealed his fate: “Consider this a friendly warning, my dear Christian. In our world, running isn’t an option. Welcome to the family, truly. -Selina” The reality of his situation settled in the pits of his stomach like a stone. Christian knew then that he was trapped in a web far more intricate and dangerous than any con he had ever pulled. Selina’s intervention was not just a lesson in loyalty; it was a stark reminder of the consequences of betrayal within their ranks. With a mix of fear and fascination, he realized his life would never be the same again."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Yet, the journey of an entrepreneur is fraught with challenges, with one of the most significant being the procurement and maintenance of business infrastructure. Let\'s delve into how micro business parks, highlighted by initiatives such as the FCJ/JBDC partnership, are emerging as a transformative solution for MSMEs. # Understanding the Hurdle Infrastructure – the physical space to innovate, produce, store, and sell – is the backbone of any business operation. However, for many MSMEs, the cost and commitment involved in acquiring such spaces pose a considerable barrier. These issues are compounded by the competitive real estate markets in urban centers, where location can make or break a business. High upfront costs, maintenance expenses, long lease terms, and the financial risk associated with expansion are some of the daunting challenges faced by MSMEs. # The Rise of Micro Business Parks Enter the concept of micro business parks – a transformative solution designed to address the key concerns surrounding infrastructure for MSMEs. But what is a micro business park? In essence, it\'s a compact, comprehensive business ecosystem that provides affordable, scalable, and versatile workspaces tailored to the needs of small and micro enterprises. These parks aggregate multiple businesses in a shared environment, reducing costs through economies of scale, and offering flexible lease agreements that align with the growth pace of MSMEs. # The FCJ/JBDC Partnership: A Beacon for Entrepreneurs A prime example of this innovative approach to supporting MSMEs is the partnership between the Factories Corporation of Jamaica (FCJ) and the Jamaica Business Development Corporation (JBDC). This collaboration aims to develop and promote micro business parks as incubators for entrepreneurship, creativity, and economic development. By offering affordable, flexible workspaces and a range of support services, this partnership encapsulates the very essence of what micro business parks can offer to the entrepreneurial community. # How MSMEs Stand to Benefit 1. **Affordability**: Micro business parks offer cost-effective rental options, reducing the financial burden on startups and growing businesses. 2. **Flexibility**: With scalable spaces, businesses can expand or downsize within the park in response to their growth, avoiding the inflexibility of traditional commercial leases. 3. **Networking Opportunities**: Being part of a business park community fosters networking, collaborations, and partnerships, propelling business growth through shared resources and knowledge. 4. **Access to Support Services**: Many micro business parks, through partnerships like FCJ/JBDC, provide access to business development services, training, and mentorship programs, which are crucial for navigating the entrepreneurial landscape. 5. **Strategic Location**: Usually situated in or near urban centers, these parks provide businesses with access to a larger market base, efficient logistics, and visibility. # In Conclusion Micro business parks and strategic partnerships, like that of the FCJ and JBDC, herald a new era for MSMEs, where the daunting challenge of securing and maintaining business infrastructure is significantly mitigated. By embracing this innovative model, entrepreneurs are positioned not just to survive but to thrive, driving forward the economic and social fabric of their communities. As the world continues to evolve, the agility, community, and support offered by micro business parks will undoubtedly become cornerstones of entrepreneurial success. For every entrepreneur out there grappling with infrastructure challenges, the message is clear: in the ecosystem of micro business parks, there lies a pathway to growth, sustainability, and endless possibilities."},{"prompt":"Expand on the advantages outlined above","completion":"Certainly! Expanding on the advantages of micro business parks can provide more insights into how these innovative ecosystems serve as a powerful springboard for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). # 1. Affordability The cost-saving potential of micro business parks cannot be overstated. For many MSMEs, the initial investment and ongoing expenses associated with securing a business location can be prohibitively expensive. In addition to affordable rent, micro business parks often include shared services such as utilities, security, and Wi-Fi, spreading out the costs among all tenants. This collective approach allows businesses to allocate more resources towards growth, research and development, and other critical operational areas rather than being bogged down by hefty overhead costs. # 2. Flexibility The flexible nature of micro business parks addresses one of the main pain points for fast-growing or fluctuating businesses. Traditional leases can lock businesses into contracts that either constrain their growth or leave them paying for unused space. In contrast, micro business parks offer various space configurations and lease terms that can be adjusted based on the specific needs and growth trajectory of each enterprise. This adaptability ensures that businesses aren’t hindered by their physical space and can react dynamically to market demands and opportunities. # 3. Networking Opportunities The communal atmosphere of micro business parks cultivates a rich environment for networking and collaboration. Businesses operating out of these parks are often complementary, allowing for a synergistic relationship between different entities. This enables startups and small businesses to forge partnerships, collaborate on projects, leverage each other\'s strengths, and share insights and strategies. Moreover, the shared space fosters a sense of community and mutual support, encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation. # 4. Access to Support Services One of the standout features of micro business parks, especially those formed through partnerships like FCJ/JBDC, is the availability of tailored support services. These can range from business development programs, administrative support, to mentoring and access to financing options. Having these resources at hand helps businesses navigate the early and often volatile stages of establishment and growth. It equips entrepreneurs with the tools and knowledge to make informed decisions, develop robust business strategies, and build sustainable enterprises. # 5. Strategic Location The strategic placement of micro business parks typically in or near urban centers provides businesses with several logistical and market advantages. Access to a larger customer base allows for better market testing and customer engagement opportunities. Furthermore, proximity to suppliers and distributors reduces logistics costs and simplifies supply chain management. The visibility and accessibility afforded by these strategic locations can substantially enhance brand recognition and attract foot traffic, which is crucial for retail and customer-facing businesses. # Conclusion Micro business parks represent a paradigm shift in how we think about support infrastructure for MSMEs. By emphasizing affordability, flexibility, community, and support, these parks are not just locations but ecosystems where businesses can thrive. The FCJ/JBDC partnership in Jamaica is a testament to the potential impact such initiatives can have on fostering sustainable business growth and economic development. As the global business landscape becomes increasingly competitive, micro business parks offer a beacon of hope for entrepreneurs seeking to innovate, expand, and succeed."},{"prompt":"Диалог:USER: Реши: \\"\\"\\" Вопрос 1 В группу старых отраслей промышленности относится: Варианты ответов • автомобилестроение • металлургия • микроэлектроника • производство пластмасс Вопрос 2 К новым отраслям промышленности относится: Варианты ответов • судостроение • роботостроение • выплавка алюминия • микробиологическая промышленность Вопрос 3 Мировое производство и потребление первичных энергоресурсов...

Some of the deputies promoted it directly, by admitting the public into the états généraux and the Constituante, by taking part in the storming of the Bastille, distributing leaflets to the regiments and other acts. In July, the crown ordered 17,000 men of the regular army to Versailles. It may be that the king refrained from using them because he was generally hesitant in the use of force.34 But this particular restraint was actually suggested to him. On 16 July, the minister of war informed the king that senior officers advised against the use of the regiments, as they doubted their loyalty. This concern, in the view of Samuel F. Scott,35 had only a partial basis in fact. In this case, the most important reason for the refusal to defend the old order by force of arms lay in the structure of the army, something we have already discussed above. Since the officers actually stayed with their regiments only very rarely, and knew nothing of the soldiers who served under them, they could only speculate as to their behaviour. It was decided on 16 July that most of the regiments should be sent back to their garrisons. In the main, those kept in Versailles were the guards regiments, which were manned overwhelmingly by foreigners. Since the king no longer dared to rely on the army for support, he had in practice no power independent of the Constituante. The personal character of the royal power was thus already abolished de facto at this point in time. The constitution subsequently did no more than legalise this situation. To avoid attempts to revise this state of affairs, the National Assembly decided in August that officers as well as all other soldiers had to swear an oath to the nation, the king and the law, and additionally swear never to use their soldiers against the civilian population unless they were ordered to by the representative organs of the people. In October, a commission began work on the reform of the army. b. The struggle for a new order The years of revolution saw struggles over the determination of the consti-tution, over electoral laws, the redemption of feudal dues, the right to pray to the Virgin Mary and the way in which the nationalised possessions of the church and emigrants were to be transferred to private individuals. There were also bitter conflicts over the covering of paper currency, as the constant new issue of assignats resulted in serious devaluation, and finally the convertibility of this revolutionary currency into gold and silver. According to Ferenc Fehér, the whole history of the Revolution can be written as a history of the assignats.36 Moreover, all these struggles took place in the context of war, both an external one and at times also a bloody and gruesome internal one. We will not deal with all this here, but only a single cross-section of the process by which the rule of the ancien régime was revolutionised into a bourgeois state and bourgeois society: the struggles over the structure of the political public. This aspect, however, is central to the constitution of bourgeois state power, more important indeed than any constitutional provisions. For every form of bourgeois state power is based in a concrete form of political public, even if this is apathetic, intimidated and institutionally quite disempowered. Only part of the population were active in the revolutionary public. They were overwhelmingly male, in the electoral assemblies and later on in the sections they were chiefly middle-aged, while on the streets and above all in the big towns they were younger. This does not mean that only these people lived the Revolution, nor that they were alone in experiencing that it was pos-sible to implement a political practice that many people desired. Even those who had not read Rousseau and had not even heard of the Encyclopédie, could come to the conclusion from their experiences in 1789 that disputes between reasoning individuals provided the best possible basis for deciding political questions. The good of society, according to this theory of the public sphere, had its starting point in individuals linked with one another by communica-tive structures not dominated by power, and public opinion should not be a component of rule - as it was under the ancien régime - but rather an eman-cipatory instance of society that is critical of any rule. One of the structural contradictions of any kind of politics aiming to stabi-lise the results of the Revolution was contained in this assertion. For a struc-ture of the public sphere that ascribed reason to \'all\' - though for the lumières themselves, as is well known, it went without saying that those \'without a will of their own\', the economically dependent, and thus women, were provision-ally excluded - and thus allowed \'all\' to participate in the public processes of opinion formation, contained a revolutionary moment. Taken to its logical conclusion, it led at the very least to Thomas Jefferson\'s postulate of the right of each generation to its own revolution - thus to the constant potential instability of the order to be newly established. The public was indispensable as an instance of legitimisation, once the divine legitimisation of personal rule had been challenged by revolution, but it still had to be made into an instance of order. Today this is effected, as Jürgen Habermas has shown,37 by the public sphere that has acquired this legitimising character being, to a large extent, reduced to the form of existence of a legal fiction. In the process of constituting a new political order in France, on the other hand, the dispute over concrete forms of public was unavoidable, because this new order owed its existence to a temporary coincidence between the reality and the theory of the bourgeois public. Already at this time, however, the fundamental contradiction between emancipation and order was contained both in conceptions of the public and in its practical forms. For this reason, all struggles over the further develop-ment of the Revolution and the new society were, at the same time, struggles over the structure and function of the public. The political strategies developed in this context were partly formulated in these terms and reflected theoretically, and partly developed as forms of collective practice; their strategic character cannot be deduced from formulations of conscious intention, as it was brought into being by collective practice and completely contained within this. If we treat specific political practices with the analytical instrumentarium of formal typology, leaving out of consideration for the moment both the social contents of the politics pursued at the time as well as the temporal overlap-pings, coincidences and contradictions, there are three forms of public sphere and corresponding strategies towards it that can be distinguished in the era of the Revolution and its bourgeois consolidation, each of these dominant at different times. This first of these is the public sphere as form of motion of a self-revolutionising society. This characterised the summer of 1789 and then again the beginning of the movement of the sans-culottes from summer to win-ter 1792, and is also to be found in the political practice of counter-revolution. For the latter developed domestically largely independent of the strategies of émigré circles.38 In its early phase, at least, the forms of counter-revolution were similar to those of the revolutionary public. It organised the commonality of all those who stood for the just cause. Later on these forms only persisted in the chouannerie, those revolts in which the peasants expressed their estrangement from the Revolution that they had initially welcomed. The second type of public sphere is that of an institutional separation of the public legitimised for political decision. At issue here are the model and strat-egies of representation. In the French Revolution, this type of public sphere was linked with freedom for a literary public (only restricted in emergency conditions), and with systematic control if not oppression of any spontaneous public manifestation of the common people. This type of public sphere was institutionalised in the constitution of 1792; it dominated Thermidor and especially the Directory. The third form of public sphere, that of the Jacobin dictatorship, arose his-torically by a spontaneous and manifest public being renewed as a form of motion and instance of legitimisation. This public, developed in a revolution-ary sense by the sans-culottes and Jacobins, was already different in Year II of the new calendar as far as its political content was concerned, although its forms persisted unchanged. The public sphere developed here from an instance of criticism into an instrument of social control. This - revolutionarily motivated - self-disciplining of the public deprived spontaneous expressions of their legitimation. The public could therefore be interpreted as an organ for acclaiming a rational politics developed in its name, and thus once more became a component of rule - if with a different content from under the ancien régime. Even Napoleon oriented himself to this kind of disempowered public, as long as he still deemed it necessary to have his policies acclaimed. The forms of public sphere sketched out above do not appear as pure types in the concrete struggles of the revolutionary era, but their contours are not hard to discern. They were even regularly staged in the revolutionary festivals. Many of these developed spontaneously, such as the jubilant enthusiasm of some of the journées, the evening dances in the city squares on the Feast of the Federation on 14 July 1790, or the banquets that the sans-culottes held in the open air in Year II of the new calendar. But, alongside these, there were carefully staged festivals expressing the victorious \'interpretation\' of the Revolution.39 Varied as these festivals were, they had two notable common features. None of the official stagings, no matter how theatrical these were, involved masks or the kind of theatrical machinery that was commonplace at that time; and they equally lacked any carnivalesque forms. The object of celebration was not a world turned upside down, but rather a new world, and the organisers were, as Mona Ozouf writes, regular ‘enthusiasts of pure form\'.40 The common people were also absent from all official stagings, being simply ascribed the role of audience. The way that this happened regularly displayed the strategy towards the public sphere that was dominant at the time. We shall now present the struggle for the new order only in respect to this single structural element of the new society, the political public.”翻译为中文","completion":"“革命至少同样是由街头上的人民以及国王的士兵（在他们没有阻碍革命的情况下）推动的，而不仅仅是由议会中的代表推动的。一些代表通过允许公众进入三级会议和立宪会议、参与巴士底狱的攻占、向团队分发传单等行为直接促进了革命。7月，王室命令常规军队的17,000名士兵前往凡尔赛。可能是因为国王通常在使用武力方面犹豫不决，他没有利用这些士兵。34但实际上是有人向他建议这种克制的。7月16日，战争部长告知国王，高级军官建议不使用这些团队，因为他们对其忠诚度表示怀疑。根据塞缪尔·F·斯科特的观点，35这种关切事实上只有部分依据。在这种情况下，拒绝用武力维护旧秩序的最重要原因在于军队的结构，这是我们上面已经讨论过的。由于军官实际上很少与他们的团队呆在一起，对在他们麾下服役的士兵一无所知，他们只能推测士兵的行为。7月16日决定大部分团队应该被送回他们的驻地。主要留在凡尔赛的是由外国人为主的卫队团。 由于国王不再敢于依靠军队支持，他实际上没有独立于立宪会议的权力。因此，在这个时间点上，王权的个人性质实际上已经被废除。随后的宪法不过是使这种情况合法化。为了避免试图修改这种状态，国民议会在8月决定官兵以及所有其他士兵必须向国家、国王和法律宣誓，并额外宣誓除非得到人民代表机构的命令，否则永不使用他们的士兵对付平民。10月，一个委员会开始着手军队改革工作。 b. 争取新秩序的斗争 革命年代见证了对宪法确定、选举法、封建义务赎回、向圣母玛利亚祈祷的权利以及国有化的教会和移民财产如何转移给个人的争论。还有关于纸币覆盖的激烈冲突，因为不断发行的法币导致了严重的货币贬值，最终这种革命货币兑换成金银变得困难。根据费伦茨·费赫尔的说法，整个革命的历史可以写作法币的历史。36此外，所有这些斗争都发生在战争的背景下，既有外部战争，也有时而发生的血腥和残酷的内部战争。我们在这里不会讨论所有这些，而只是单独探讨一个过程的横截面——通过这个过程，旧制度被革命为资产阶级国家和资产阶级社会：关于政治公众结构的斗争。然而，这个方面对于资产阶级国家权力的构成更为重要，事实上比任何宪法条款都重要。因为每一种形式的资产阶级国家权力都基于一种具体形式的政治公众，即使这种政治公众是冷漠的、被吓倒的，机构上完全无力。 只有部分人口在革命公众中活跃。他们主要是男性，在选举大会和后来的区域大会中主要是中年人，而在街头，尤其是在大城市中，则更年轻。这并不意味着只有这些人经历了革命，或者他们是唯一经历了实施许多人渴望的政治实践的可能性的人。即使那些没有阅读卢梭的作品、甚至没听说过《百科全书》的人，也可能从1789年的经历中得出结论，认为理性个体之间的争论为决定政治问题提供了最佳的基础。根据这个公共领域理论，社会的利益起始于通过非强权主导的沟通结构相互联系的个体，而公众舆论不应该是一种统治成分——就像在旧制度下那样——而应该是一个对任何统治都持批判态度的社会解放实例。 这个主张中包含了稳定革命成果的任何政治目标中的一个结构性矛盾。因为一个将理性归于“所有人”的公共领域结构——尽管对于启蒙者自己而言，众所周知，那些“没有自己的意志”、经济上依赖他人的人，因此妇女被暂时排除在外——从而允许“所有人”参与舆论形成的公共过程，包含了一种革命性的时刻。这种结构如果被逻辑上地推到极致，至少会导致托马斯·杰斐逊的一代人有权进行自己的革命的主张——从而导致新建立的秩序持续潜在的不稳定。一旦通过革命挑战了个人统治的神圣合法性，公众就不可或缺作为一种合法性实例，但它仍然需要被制定为一种秩序实例。如今，正如尤尔根·哈贝马斯所展示的，37通过极大程度上将获得这种合法性特征的公共领域降为法律虚构的存在形式，实现了这一点。另一方面，在法国构建新政治秩序的过程中，由于这个新秩培养的存在暂时与资产阶级公众的理论相符，因此不可避免地会对具体公众形式产生争议。 然而，即便在这个时候，激进和秩序之间的根本矛盾既体现在公众观念中，也体现在其实践形式中。因此，所有关于革命和新社会进一步发展的斗争，同时也是关于公众结构和功能的斗争。在这个背景下发展的政治策略部分以这些术语来表述并得到理论反思，部分作为集体实践形式发展；它们的策略性质不能从有意识意图的表述中推断出来，因为它是通过集体实践产生的并完全包含在这种实践中。 如果我们使用形式类型学的分析工具来处理具体的政治实践，暂时不考虑当时所追求的政治的社会内容以及时间上的重叠、巧合和矛盾，可以在革命及其资产阶级巩固时期区分出与公共领域相对应的三种形式和策略，每种在不同时间占据主导。第一种是作为自我革命化社会运动形态的公共领域。这特征于1789年夏天，然后是从夏天到冬天1792年无产阶级运动的开始，并且也可以在反革命的政治实践中找到。因为后者在国内的发展在很大程度上独立于流亡者圈子的策略。38至少在早期，反革命的形式类似于革命公众的形式。它组织了所有为正义事业而站的人的共同体。后来，这些形式只在乔安内里中持续存在，那些表达对革命的疏远的农民起义曾最初欢迎这场革命。 第二种公共领域是政治决策合法化的公众与机构分离。这里涉及的是代表模型和策略。在法国大革命中，这种类型的公共领域与文学公众的自由（仅在紧急状态下受到限制）相联系，并且如果不是压制，则是对任何普通人的自发公共表现进行系统控制。这种类型的公共领域在1792年的宪法中得到了制度化；它主导了热月政变尤其是执政府时期。 第三种公共领域形式，即雅各宾专政，是通过将自发和明显的公共作为运动形态和合法化实例重新出现而历史性地产生的。无产阶级和雅各宾派以革命性方式发展的这种公共，在新历年II以其政治内容而言已经有所不同，尽管其形式保持不变。在这里，公共领域从批评实例发展成为社会控制的工具。这种革命性动机下的公共自律剥夺了自发表达的合法性。因此，公众可以被解释为一个为其所称颂的理性政治欢呼的器官，并因此再次成为统治的一部分——尽管内容不同于旧制度下。即便拿破仑也是以这种失去权力的公众为导向的，只要他还认为有必要让他的政策得到称颂。 上述勾勒出的公共领域形式在革命时代的具体斗争中并不以纯粹的类型出现，但其轮廓并不难以辨认。它们甚至在革命节日中定期上演。许多这样的节日是自发发展的，比如一些日子的欢欣鼓舞，1790年7月14日联邦节在城市广场上的晚间舞会，或是新历年II中无产阶级在户外举行的宴会。但是，这些节日中也有精心策划的庆典，表达了对革命的“胜利解释”。39尽管这些节日各不相同，但它们有两个显著的共同特点。所有官方策划的节日，无论这些有多么戏剧性，都不涉及面具或当时普遍的那种戏剧机械；它们同样缺乏任何狂欢节形式。庆祝的对象不是一个颠倒的世界，而是一个新世界，正如莫娜·奥祖夫所写，组织者是纯粹形式的“热情追随者”。40普通民众也缺席于所有官方策划中，仅被赋予观众的角色。这种定期发生的情况展示了当时占主导地位的对待公共领域的策略。我们现在将只就这个新社会的单一结构元素，政治公众展示对新秩序的斗争。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

We have 450 Texas families divided into those who eat turkey, those who eat ham, and those who eat neither at holiday meals. Specifically, we know that: - 163 families eat turkey. - There are families that eat both turkey and ham, but we’re not given the total number of families that eat just ham. - 79 families eat both turkey and ham. - 81 families eat neither turkey nor ham. The first step is to subtract the families that eat neither from the total to find how many families eat either turkey or ham or both. That is 450 - 81 = 369 families. From the 163 families that eat turkey, 79 of them also eat ham, which is represented as the intersection between the turkey and ham groups in the Venn diagram. To construct the Venn diagram, follow these steps: (Note: This is a textual description, not an actual diagram.) 1. **Draw two overlapping circles** within a larger rectangle. The rectangle represents all 450 families surveyed. Label one circle \\"Turkey\\" for the families that eat turkey and the other circle \\"Ham\\" for the families that eat ham. 2. **Label the intersection**: The area where the two circles overlap represents families that eat both turkey and ham. Write \\"79\\" in this overlapping area. 3. **Calculate exclusive groups**: - To find the number of families that exclusively eat turkey (i.e., only turkey and not ham), subtract the number of families that eat both from the total number that eats turkey: 163 - 79 = 84. Write this number in the part of the turkey circle that does not overlap with the ham circle. - We’re not directly given the total number of families that eat ham, so we can’t directly calculate the exclusive ham-eaters this way. However, knowing the total number of families consuming either or both (369 families) helps us infer the next steps. 4. **Calculate the number of families eating Ham only**, though we don\'t have the direct number of Ham eaters, we can work backwards: - Add the exclusive turkey eaters (84) and those that eat both (79), then subtract this from the total that eat either or both (369) to find the exclusive ham eaters plus those that eat neither: 369 - (84 + 79) = 369 - 163 = 206. This 206 includes families that exclusively eat ham and those that eat neither, which we already know. 5. Since we\'ve misinterpreted the 206 calculation (it actually includes those who just eat Ham and those who eat Turkey, including their intersection), we need direct information about Ham eaters that isn\'t provided. Thus, without the total Ham (only), we\'re unable to accurately calculate or represent Ham only; the number was to illustrate the calculation with the data given. 6. **Label the area outside the circles but within the rectangle**: Write \\"81\\" in the rectangle outside the circles to represent families that eat neither turkey nor ham. Given the lapse in direct ham only data clarification, please note, for an accurate depiction, data such as the total families eating Ham would be necessary. Without it, these instructions guide you through understanding the setup and limitations based on the provided information."},{"prompt":"I\'m working on a manga and I\'d like to tell you about its setting, tone and premise.","completion":"Absolutely, I\'d be delighted to hear about it! Please share the details of your manga\'s setting, the tone you\'re aiming for, and the premise of your story. If you\'re looking for feedback, advice, or have any specific questions, feel free to mention that as well."},{"prompt":"The setting takes place in Tokyo in 2012 during the late autumn. It\'s sunny but cold around 20% through the story but after that, it either switches between overcast or snowy. The best way I could describe this manga is it\'s a combination of Heavy Rain and V for Vendetta but without its political themes.","completion":"Your manga\'s setting and tonal aspirations paint a vivid picture that immediately sets the stage for a gripping narrative. Setting your story in Tokyo in late autumn of 2012 offers a rich backdrop, full of cultural depth and a specific sense of time. The transition from sunny to overcast and snowy weather throughout the story could serve as a compelling metaphor for the narrative\'s progression, perhaps reflecting the inner journey of the characters or the intensification of the plot. The comparison to \\"Heavy Rain\\" suggests a story steeped in mystery, suspense, and emotional depth, focusing on intricate personal stories intertwined with a broader, possibly noir or thriller, narrative. This game is known for its interactive storyline and complex character development, hinting that your manga may similarly prioritize character-driven plots and moral dilemmas, with a strong emphasis on the emotional stakes at play. On the other hand, drawing inspiration from \\"V for Vendetta\\" (but without the political themes) might mean you\'re leaning towards a narrative that includes elements of rebellion, the fight against oppression, and the quest for personal freedom or justice. Since you\'re steering away from the political themes, it\'s intriguing to think about what elements you are interested in exploring. It might be the individual\'s struggle against a larger, perhaps more abstract, antagonist or societal expectation, or the focus could be on the psychological aspects of rebellion and identity. Based on the setting, tone, and influences, here are a few suggestions and considerations for your manga: 1. **Character Development**: Given your inspirations, your characters\' background stories, motivations, and growth will likely be central to your manga\'s appeal. Consider how each character\'s personal journey ties back to the overarching narrative and how their interactions drive the plot forward. 2. **Atmospheric Storytelling**: The changing weather in your setting can be a powerful storytelling tool. Use it to reflect or contrast the internal states of your characters or to foreshadow events. For example, the transition from sunny to snowy could mirror the plot\'s progression from a seemingly straightforward situation to a more complicated and \\"colder\\" reality. 3. **Mystery and Suspense**: To capture the essence of \\"Heavy Rain,\\" consider how you can weave mystery and suspense into your narrative. This could involve a central mystery that drives the plot, with multiple layers and perspectives that offer readers a rich, engaging experience. 4. **Themes**: While you\'re avoiding political themes, there are many other themes you could explore, such as the nature of justice, the concept of identity, the effects of trauma, and the idea of personal versus societal responsibility. These themes can provide depth to your story and resonate with your readers on a personal level. 5. **Art Style**: The visuals will play a vital role in conveying the tone and setting of your story. Think about how the art can reflect the emotional landscape of your characters and the overall mood of the manga. Using the weather and the diverse urban landscape of Tokyo, you can create striking visuals that enhance your storytelling. I hope these suggestions prove helpful! If you have more details or need further assistance, feel free to share. Your manga concept sounds intriguing, and I wish you the best of luck with your project."},{"prompt":"Resume the following sentence and make it shorter and easier to read: The Big Bang is a physical theory that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature.[1] It was first proposed in 1927 by Roman Catholic priest and physicist Georges Lemaître.

This isn\'t the story as it was once known on old Earth, but a tale that has morphed with the stars, taking on new life and danger in the form of distant worlds and alien threats. Crimson, named after the red nano-fabric cloak she wears—a marvel of engineering that can adapt to any environment, cloaking her from predators—lives in a small settlement called New Eden. This enclave of humanity has carved out a niche on Argentum, a world teeming with alien flora and fauna, some beautiful, and some deadly. In this tale, the wolf is not as the stories of old Earth depicted. This wolf is a xenomorph, a creature from the nightmares of those who traverse the space lanes. Escaped from a derelict spacecraft, the xenomorph found its way to Argentum, adapting, evolving, and beginning to terrorize the outskirts of human settlements. One day, Little Crimson Hood is tasked with delivering a package to her grandmother, who lives in another settlement just beyond the dark, bio-luminescent forest—a forest now haunted by the xenomorph. Before leaving, her mother warns her to stay on the path and not to remove her cloak, for it is designed to mask her heat signature from the predatory eyes that lurk within the darkness. As Crimson makes her journey, she marvels at the beauty of Argentum, the way the plants seem to glow with an inner light, casting eerie shadows along the path. Unknown to her, the xenomorph watches, its acidic blood coursing through its veins, its mind singularly focused on this new prey. But this creature, this wolf among the stars, has not encountered a human like Crimson before. For within her cloak lies not just the marvels of human engineering but the heart of a warrior, trained in the ancient arts and the modern weaponry of a civilization that has learned to survive among the stars. As she nears her grandmother\'s settlement, the xenomorph strikes, swift as the nightmares that have traveled across the stars. But Crimson is ready. She sheds her cloak, revealing an armor lined with glowing runes, a shield generated from the very fabric of her cloak, and a sword that hums with the power of a miniature star. What follows is not a simple tale of prey and predator, but a battle that would be told across Argentum, a dance of life and death illuminated by the bio-luminescent forest. In the end, the xenomorph lies defeated, not just by the weapons wielded by a girl in a red cloak, but by the human spirit\'s indomitable will to survive and protect what is dear. Little Crimson Hood makes it to her grandmother\'s house, her package delivered, her mission complete. Yet, this encounter becomes a part of her, a story of bravery and survival against the cosmic horrors that dwell in the dark spaces of the galaxy. Thus, the tale of Little Crimson Hood and the xenomorph spreads, a beacon of humanity\'s resilience, a warning to the creatures that lurk in the shadows of space, and a testament to the spirit of those who wear the red cloak, guardians of the human colonies among the stars."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

This condition can be triggered by various factors such as colds, flu, allergies, sinus infections, or environmental irritants. When you use a nasal spray, depending on the type, it helps alleviate nasal congestion through different mechanisms: 1. **Saline Nasal Sprays**: These sprays use a simple saltwater solution to moisten the nasal passages, which can help to thin the mucus, making it easier to drain. This can reduce the feeling of congestion. 2. **Decongestant Nasal Sprays**: These contain medications such as oxymetazoline or phenylephrine, which work by constricting blood vessels in the lining of the nasal passages. The constricted blood vessels reduce the swelling of the nasal tissue, effectively opening up the nasal passages and allowing for easier breathing. 3. **Steroid Nasal Sprays**: Nasal sprays containing corticosteroids such as fluticasone or budesonide are designed to reduce inflammation in the nasal passages. They are particularly effective for allergic rhinitis or chronic sinusitis. The anti-inflammatory effect helps decrease nasal swelling and mucus production, leading to improved airflow. 4. **Antihistamine Nasal Sprays**: In cases where allergies are the cause of nasal congestion, antihistamine nasal sprays (like azelastine) can be helpful. They work by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical that the body releases in response to allergens, which reduces symptoms such as nasal swelling and congestion. It\'s important to use these nasal sprays as directed, as overuse, especially of decongestant nasal sprays, can lead to a rebound effect where nasal congestion worsens, known as rhinitis medicamentosa.

Cette phrase soulève la question de la relation entre la science et la morale, entre la connaissance et la conscience. Elle suggère que la science seule, sans éthique ni conscience, peut avoir des conséquences destructrices et néfastes pour l\'humanité. La science est indéniablement un outil puissant et essentiel pour comprendre le monde qui nous entoure, pour améliorer notre qualité de vie et pour progresser en tant que société. Cependant, lorsqu\'elle est dissociée de toute réflexion éthique, elle peut être détournée à des fins destructrices et être utilisée à des fins immorales. C\'est ce que la citation de Rabelais met en lumière en comparant la science à une drogue qui peut corrompre l\'âme si elle est utilisée de manière irresponsable. Un exemple contemporain de cette idée est l\'utilisation de la technologie dans le domaine de l\'armement. La science a permis le développement de missiles et de bombes toujours plus puissants, mais sans une éthique et une conscience qui guident leur utilisation, ces armes peuvent causer des souffrances et des destructions massives. De même, l\'avancée de la recherche génétique soulève des questions éthiques complexes, notamment en matière de manipulation génétique à des fins eugénistes. Cependant, la science peut aussi être une force positive pour l\'humanité lorsqu\'elle est encadrée par des valeurs éthiques et morales. Par exemple, la recherche médicale a permis de sauver des millions de vies, de vaincre des maladies mortelles et de soulager la souffrance humaine. La technologie permet également de connecter les individus à travers le monde, de favoriser le partage des connaissances et de promouvoir le progrès social. En conclusion, la citation de Rabelais souligne l\'importance de combiner la science avec une conscience éthique pour garantir son utilisation bénéfique et respectueuse de l\'humanité. La recherche scientifique doit être guidée par des principes moraux et des considérations éthiques afin de prévenir les dérives potentielles et de promouvoir le bien-être de tous. Ainsi, la science, lorsqu\'elle est pratiquée avec conscience, peut être une source de progrès et de développement durable pour l\'ensemble de la société."},{"prompt":"Quels sont les comtributions de Michaël sandrer dans l\'emergence de l\'éducation comparée ?","completion":"Michaël Sadler, un éducateur et théoricien de l\'éducation britannique du XIXe siècle, a apporté plusieurs contributions significatives à l\'émergence de l\'éducation comparée.

La première période - Période des Pionniers (XIXe siècle) : Cette période a été marquée par les débuts de l\'éducation comparée en tant que discipline académique. Les premiers pionniers tels que Marc-Antoine Jullien de Paris en France et Friedrich Schleiermacher en Allemagne ont jeté les bases de l\'éducation comparée en s\'intéressant aux différences entre les systèmes éducatifs nationaux. Les préoccupations principales étaient d\'établir des comparaisons entre les systèmes éducatifs pour identifier les bonnes pratiques et les innovations. 2. La deuxième période - Période de la Méthodologie (début du XXe siècle) : Cette période a été caractérisée par le développement de méthodologies de recherche comparée plus rigoureuses et scientifiques. Les chercheurs ont commencé à utiliser des approches plus systématiques pour collecter et analyser des données comparatives sur les systèmes éducatifs. Des théoriciens comme George Z. F. Bereday ont joué un rôle majeur dans l\'élaboration de méthodes de recherche comparée et la consolidation de l\'éducation comparée en tant que champ d\'étude distinct. 3. La troisième période - Période de la Globalisation (fin du XXe siècle à nos jours) : Cette période est marquée par une orientation plus globale de l\'éducation comparée, notamment en réponse à la mondialisation et à l\'interconnexion croissante des systèmes éducatifs à l\'échelle internationale. Les chercheurs s\'intéressent de plus en plus aux questions d\'équité, de diversité culturelle, de migration, de développement durable et de politiques éducatives mondiales. Les études comparées se concentrent également sur les défis communs auxquels sont confrontés les systèmes éducatifs à l\'échelle mondiale et sur la recherche de solutions collaboratives. Dans cette troisième période, l\'éducation comparée élargit son champ d\'analyse pour inclure des questions contemporaines telles que l\'éducation inclusive, l\'éducation numérique, l\'apprentissage tout au long de la vie, et les politiques d\'éducation internationales. Cette approche globale encourage la collaboration et l\'échange d\'expériences entre les pays pour promouvoir l\'amélioration de l\'éducation à l\'échelle mondiale."},{"prompt":"Définissez les taux d\'accès à l\'enseignement supérieur","completion":"Les taux d\'accès à l\'enseignement supérieur font référence à la mesure du pourcentage de personnes d\'une certaine tranche d\'âge ou d\'une population donnée qui ont accès et sont inscrites dans des établissements d\'enseignement supérieur, tels que les universités, les instituts ou les écoles supérieures. Ces taux sont souvent utilisés pour évaluer le niveau de participation et de réussite des individus dans l\'enseignement supérieur au sein d\'une société donnée. Les taux d\'accès à l\'enseignement supérieur peuvent varier d\'un pays à l\'autre en fonction de différents facteurs tels que les politiques gouvernementales en matière d\'éducation, le coût de l\'enseignement supérieur, la disponibilité des places dans les établissements d\'enseignement, les préférences culturelles, les niveaux de développement économique, et les valeurs sociales. Un taux d\'accès élevé à l\'enseignement supérieur est souvent considéré comme un indicateur de développement social et économique, car il peut contribuer à l\'élévation du niveau d\'éducation de la population, à l\'amélioration des compétences des individus, et au renforcement de la main-d\'œuvre qualifiée. Cependant, il est également important de veiller à ce que l\'accès à l\'enseignement supérieur soit équitable et inclusif, de manière à ce que tous les individus aient la possibilité d\'accéder à l\'enseignement supérieur, quelle que soit leur origine socio-économique, leur genre ou leur origine ethnique. En résumé, les taux d\'accès à l\'enseignement supérieur sont un indicateur clé pour évaluer l\'accessibilité, l\'équité et la qualité de l\'éducation supérieure dans une société donnée, et pour évaluer les progrès vers l\'atteinte des objectifs nationaux et internationaux en matière d\'éducation et de développement."},{"prompt":"Définissez le taux d\'alphabétisation","completion":"Le taux d\'alphabétisation est un indicateur statistique qui mesure la proportion de personnes capables de lire et d\'écrire dans une population donnée, généralement exprimée en pourcentage. Un individu est considéré comme alphabétisé s\'il est capable de lire et de comprendre un texte simple, d\'écrire un message court et de réaliser des opérations de base en mathématiques. Le taux d\'alphabétisation est souvent utilisé comme un indicateur clé du niveau d\'éducation d\'une population. Il permet d\'évaluer la capacité des individus à acquérir des connaissances, à communiquer efficacement, à participer à la vie sociale et économique et à exercer leur citoyenneté de manière informée. Un taux d\'alphabétisation élevé est généralement associé à un meilleur développement social, économique et culturel, car il est lié à une amélioration de la santé, à une réduction de la pauvreté, à une augmentation de la participation à la vie démocratique et à une amélioration des perspectives économiques. En revanche, un faible taux d\'alphabétisation peut être un obstacle au développement et à l\'épanouissement des individus, car il limite l\'accès à l\'information, à l\'éducation et à l\'emploi. Il est important de noter que le taux d\'alphabétisation peut varier en fonction de divers facteurs tels que le niveau de développement économique, les inégalités sociales, l\'accès à l\'éducation, les politiques d\'alphabétisation et les spécificités culturelles. Par conséquent, il est essentiel de promouvoir l\'alphabétisation pour tous, en mettant en place des politiques éducatives inclusives et en encourageant l\'apprentissage tout au long de la vie."},{"prompt":"Quelle est la fonctionnement de l\'éducation comparée dans les enjeux actuels de l\'éducation","completion":"L\'éducation comparée joue un rôle essentiel dans les enjeux actuels de l\'éducation en tant qu\'outil permettant d\'analyser, de comparer et d\'évaluer les politiques éducatives, les pratiques pédagogiques et les résultats des systèmes éducatifs à l\'échelle internationale. Voici quelques-uns des principaux aspects du fonctionnement de l\'éducation comparée dans les enjeux actuels de l\'éducation : 1. Analyse des politiques éducatives : L\'éducation comparée permet d\'analyser les politiques éducatives mises en œuvre dans différents pays pour identifier les bonnes pratiques, les défis communs et les stratégies efficaces pour améliorer la qualité et l\'équité de l\'éducation. Cette analyse contribue à l\'élaboration de politiques éducatives plus efficaces et adaptées aux besoins spécifiques de chaque contexte. 2. Evaluation des performances des systèmes éducatifs : L\'éducation comparée permet d\'évaluer les performances des systèmes éducatifs à travers des indicateurs tels que le taux d\'alphabétisation, le taux d\'accès à l\'enseignement supérieur, les résultats des élèves aux évaluations internationales, etc. Cette évaluation comparative aide à identifier les forces et les faiblesses des systèmes éducatifs et à orienter les réformes nécessaires. 3. Promotion de l\'échange et de la collaboration : L\'éducation comparée favorise l\'échange d\'expériences et de bonnes pratiques entre les pays, les chercheurs et les praticiens de l\'éducation. Cette collaboration internationale permet de partager les connaissances, de stimuler l\'innovation pédagogique et de renforcer la coopération pour relever les défis communs en matière d\'éducation. 4. Réflexion sur les enjeux mondiaux de l\'éducation : L\'éducation comparée permet d\'aborder les enjeux mondiaux de l\'éducation tels que l\'éducation inclusive, l\'éducation numérique, l\'apprentissage tout au long de la vie, la citoyenneté mondiale, etc. en mettant en lumière les pratiques prometteuses et les solutions innovantes à ces défis complexes. En somme, l\'éducation comparée joue un rôle important dans la compréhension, l\'amélioration et l\'innovation des systèmes éducatifs à l\'échelle mondiale. En répondant aux enjeux actuels de l\'éducation, elle contribue à promouvoir une éducation de qualité, équitable, inclusive et adaptée aux besoins des apprenants du XXIe siècle."},{"prompt":"Expliquer la période de la globalisation","completion":"La période de la globalisation dans l\'éducation comparée est caractérisée par une orientation plus globale de la recherche et de l\'analyse des systèmes éducatifs à l\'échelle internationale.

Voici quelques aspects clés de la période de la globalisation dans l\'éducation comparée : 1. Interconnexion des systèmes éducatifs : Avec l\'avènement des technologies de communication et des échanges internationaux croissants, les systèmes éducatifs sont de plus en plus interconnectés et interdépendants. Les tendances éducatives, les politiques et les réformes se propagent rapidement à travers les frontières, ce qui nécessite une approche plus globale de l\'éducation comparée. 2. Comparaison des pratiques internationales : La période de la globalisation encourage la comparaison des pratiques éducatives et des politiques à l\'échelle internationale pour identifier les tendances communes, les innovations et les défis partagés. Les études comparées portent souvent sur des questions mondiales telles que l\'éducation inclusive, l\'apprentissage interculturel, les compétences du XXIe siècle et les politiques d\'éducation durable. 3. Collaboration et échange d\'expériences : La globalisation favorise la collaboration entre les chercheurs, les praticiens et les décideurs politiques de l\'éducation à travers le monde.

Given your choices, we have: - **2 types of Bread**: White, Wheat - **2 types of Meat**: Beef, Salami - **3 types of Cheese**: Cheddar, Swiss, Colby-Jack To visualize the tree, you start with your first choice (Bread) and branch out to your second choice (Meat), and from each of those options, you branch out again to your third choice (Cheese). Here\'s a textual representation: 1. **Bread:** - White - Beef - Cheddar - Swiss - Colby-Jack - Salami - Cheddar - Swiss - Colby-Jack - Wheat - Beef - Cheddar - Swiss - Colby-Jack - Salami - Cheddar - Swiss - Colby-Jack In total, you\'d have **12 possible choices** of sandwich types, as you have 2 options for bread, which leads to 4 options when combined with the 2 meat options, which in turn leads to 12 when each of those is combined with the 3 cheese options (2 x 2 x 3 = 12). Visualizing it as an actual tree diagram would involve drawing a starting point (labeled \\"Start\\"), branching out into 2 lines for your bread options, then from each bread option, drawing another 2 lines representing the meat options, and finally, from each meat option, you\'d branch out into 3 more lines for the cheese options, labeling each accordingly."},{"prompt":"How many different sandwiches are available in the sample space?","completion":"Based on the options provided, we can calculate the total number of different sandwiches available in the sample space by multiplying the number of choices in each category. - **Bread:** 2 choices (White, Wheat) - **Meat:** 2 choices (Beef, Salami) - **Cheese:** 3 choices (Cheddar, Swiss, Colby-Jack) So, the total number of different sandwiches available is calculated by multiplying the number of options in each category: [ text{Total sandwiches} = text{Bread choices} times text{Meat choices} times text{Cheese choices} ] [ text{Total sandwiches} = 2 times 2 times 3 = 12 ] Thus, there are **12 different sandwiches** available in the sample space."},{"prompt":"Draw an area model to represent this scenario.","completion":"Drawing an area model or a graphical representation in text format is inherently limiting, but I can guide you through how you might visualize or even draw it yourself on paper or using a digital tool. An area model for this scenario helps visualize the multiplication of choices leading to the total number of sandwich combinations. # Steps to Draw an Area Model: 1. **Draw a Rectangle:** Start by drawing a large rectangle. This rectangle represents the total sample space of sandwich combinations. 2. **Divide by Bread Type:** Divide this rectangle vertically into 2 equal parts to represent the 2 choices of bread (since each choice is equally likely). Label one side \\"White\\" and the other \\"Wheat\\". 3. **Divide by Meat Type:** Then, divide each of these sections horizontally into 2 equal parts to represent the meat choices (Beef and Salami). Now your rectangle is divided into 4 smaller rectangles. Label the top half (in both the \\"White\\" and \\"Wheat\\" sections) as \\"Beef\\" and the bottom half as \\"Salami\\". 4. **Divide by Cheese Type:** Finally, divide each of the 4 smaller rectangles into 3 equal parts to represent the cheese choices (Cheddar, Swiss, Colby-Jack). This final division results in 12 sections within your original rectangle. 5. **Label Cheese Choices:** Label the sections within each meat type with the cheese choices. You\'ll do this 4 times total (once for each bread and meat combination), labeling a section for Cheddar, one for Swiss, and one for Colby-Jack, in all four of the subdivisions. # Outcome: - The rectangle is divided vertically to represent the choice of bread: 2 sections (for White and Wheat). - Each bread section is further divided horizontally for meat choices: 2 sections within each, making 4 (for Beef and Salami). - Each meat section within the type of bread is then divided into 3 parts for the cheese choices, resulting in 12 smaller sections in total. You would end up with a large rectangle divided into 12 smaller, equally sized sections, each one representing a unique combination based on your selections: Bread (2) x Meat (2) x Cheese (3). This model visually demonstrates the total number of unique sandwich combinations you can create from the given options, revealing the multiplicative relationship between the choices. Each section is a possible sandwich combination, making it clear there are 12 different sandwiches you can choose from, corresponding to the calculation we did earlier."},{"prompt":"How many rows are in the area model? make your response short","completion":"The area model would have 4 rows."},{"prompt":"How many of the equal-sized parts are on each row? make your response short","completion":"3 equal-sized parts on each row."},{"prompt":"How many equal-sized parts are there total in the area model?","completion":"There are 12 equal-sized parts total in the area model."},{"prompt":"write fully responsive blogging website code in nextjs to host it on github","completion":"Creating a fully-responsive blogging website with Next.js is an enriching project, but it\'s quite extensive. Given the constraints here, I\'ll guide you through creating a basic but scalable blogging platform that you can customize and expand according to your needs. We\'ll focus on setting up a Next.js project with simple blog functionality, including markdown support for posts, and preparing it for deployment on GitHub Pages. # 1. Setup Next.js Project First, ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. Then, create a new Next.js app by running the following commands in your terminal: ```bash npx create-next-app nextjs-blog cd nextjs-blog ``` # 2. Install Dependencies For Markdown files support, you\'ll need `gray-matter` and `remark` along with its HTML plugin: ```bash npm install gray-matter remark remark-html ``` # 3. Setup Blog Posts with Markdown Create a `posts` directory in your project root to store your Markdown files (.md). Each post should be a separate `.md` file. **Example: `posts/first-post.md`** ```markdown --- title: \\"First Post\\" date: \\"2023-01-01\\" --- Hello, this is my first post on this blog! ``` # 4. Create a Library to Fetch Blog Posts In your project, create a new file `lib/posts.js`. This file will contain functions to fetch and parse blog posts. ```javascript import fs from \'fs\'; import path from \'path\'; import matter from \'gray-matter\'; import { remark } from \'remark\'; import html from \'remark-html\'; const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), \'posts\'); export async function getSortedPostsData() { // Get file names under /posts const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory); const allPostsData = fileNames.map(fileName => { const id = fileName.replace(/.md/, \'\'); const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, fileName); const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, \'utf8\'); const matterResult = matter(fileContents); return { id, ...matterResult.data }; }); return allPostsData.sort((a, b) => { if (a.date < b.date) { return 1; } else { return -1; } }); } export async function getPostData(id) { const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `{id}.md`); const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, \'utf8\'); const matterResult = matter(fileContents); const processedContent = await remark() .use(html) .process(matterResult.content); const contentHtml = processedContent.toString(); return { id, contentHtml, ...matterResult.data, }; } ``` # 5. Create Pages for Blogging Next.js uses the `pages` directory for its routing. We will create a couple of pages for listing posts and individual posts. - **List Posts**: Create `pages/index.js`. Use `getStaticProps` to fetch posts at build time. - **Individual Post**: Create `pages/posts/[id].js`. This is a dynamic route in Next.js. Use `getStaticPaths` to define which paths to pre-render at build time, and `getStaticProps` to fetch necessary data for each post. Due to the extensive code involved, especially for setting up dynamic pages and rendering, I recommend referring to the Next.js official documentation or a detailed blog tutorial for these specific parts. # 6. Styling and Responsiveness You can use CSS Modules or styled-jsx (comes built-in with Next.js) to style your components. To ensure responsiveness, use CSS media queries or a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS that supports responsive design out of the box. # 7. Deploy on GitHub Pages First, make sure your project is a Git repository and connected to a GitHub repository. To deploy your Next.js app to GitHub Pages, you can use the `gh-pages` package. 1. Install `gh-pages`: ```bash npm install --save-dev gh-pages ``` 2. Add deployment scripts to your `package.json`: ```json \\"scripts\\": { \\"export\\": \\"next build && next export\\", \\"deploy\\": \\"npm run export && gh-pages -d out\\" } ``` 3. Run the deployment script: ```bash npm run deploy ``` This will build your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages. Make sure you\'ve configured your GitHub repository settings to serve GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch. # Next Steps: - Expand the blog features, like adding categories, tags, or a search function. - Integrate a CMS for a more dynamic blog. - Improve SEO by using Next.js\'s Head component to manage meta tags. Remember, this is a foundational setup. For a fully-featured, production-ready blog, you\'ll need to build more features and perhaps include a backend or a headless CMS for easier content management."},{"prompt":"Proyecto: hacer llaveros con resina , sacar costo de venta con materiales, mano de obra, costó por unidad, tiempo de elaboración, valor de la unidad, ganancia día horas y minutos que me gaste haciendo los llaveros con resina","completion":"Crear un proyecto para hacer llaveros con resina y calcular el costo de venta implica tener en consideración varios factores, incluyendo el costo de los materiales, la mano de obra, el tiempo de elaboración, y la ganancia deseada. Aquí te detallo un ejemplo de cómo podrías calcular estos costos. Para simplificar, vamos a suponer que haremos un lote de 10 llaveros. # Materiales: 1. Resina Epoxi: 20 USD por 500ml, se utilizarán 100ml. Costo: 4 USD 2. Colorantes: 5 USD, muy poca cantidad por llavero, estimemos 0.50 USD por los 10 llaveros. 3. Moldes reutilizables: 15 USD (costo dividido entre la cantidad de producción antes de reemplazar), supongamos que se pueden usar para 100 llaveros. Costo por 10 llaveros: 1.50 USD. 4. Mosquetones o anillas para llaveros: 3 USD por 20 unidades. Costo por 10 llaveros: 1.50 USD. 5. Otros (abrasivos, palillos para mezclar, guantes): 2 USD por los 10 llaveros. # Costo total de materiales por 10 llaveros - Resina: 4 USD - Colorantes: 0.50 USD - Moldes: 1.50 USD - Mosquetones: 1.50 USD - Otros: 2 USD - **Total: 9.50 USD** # Mano de obra: Supongamos que tardas 30 minutos en hacer un lote de 10 llaveros (esto sin contar tiempos de secado ya que puedes hacer otras cosas mientras). Si quieres pagar a alguien (o a ti mismo) 15 USD la hora por el trabajo: - **Costo de mano de obra por 10 llaveros**: 7.50 USD. # Costo por Unidad y Tiempo de Elaboración: - **Costo total por 10 llaveros:** 9.50 (materiales) + 7.50 (mano de obra) = 17 USD. - **Costo por unidad:** 17 / 10 = 1.70 USD por llavero. - **Tiempo de elaboración total:** 30 minutos por 10 llaveros. # Valor de la Unidad y Ganancia: Supongamos que quieres tener una ganancia del 100% sobre el costo. Entonces, el valor de venta por unidad sería el doble del costo. - **Valor de venta por unidad:** 1.70 * 2 = 3.40 USD. Para calcular la ganancia por día, horas y minutos, necesitaríamos saber cuántos llaveros puedes vender en esos periodos y a qué ritmo puedes producir más allá de los 10 iniciales, tomando en cuenta el tiempo de secado de la resina y preparación. Suponiendo que puedas vender 20 llaveros en un día y producir esa cantidad sin aumentar significativamente el tiempo de trabajo: - **Ganancia por 20 llaveros vendidos:** (3.40 - 1.70) * 20 = 34 USD por día. Este cálculo es bastante simplificado y debe ajustarse según tus costos exactos, el tiempo de trabajo real, y el precio de mercado en tu zona. Además, considera que, al principio, la inversión en herramientas o mejoras en el proceso puede variar tus costos, pero a medida que te establezcas, podrás optimizar los pasos y costos para aumentar tu ganancia."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short episode transcript (with only Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic much-loved fearless pup with the puppy power who always never fails and is the best friend to all, Scrappy-Doo!

At one end of the elongated table, cloaked in the obscurity provided by low-hanging shadows, sat Captain John \\"Soap\\" MacTavish of the British SAS, his steely gaze fixed on the holographic display before them. Adjacent to him was Kaito Hida, a seasoned operator from the Imperial Batlanis Armed Forces (IBAF), his Heart Hybrid Gear at the ready, a testament to the unusual alliance formed under dire circumstances. \\"Soap\\" broke the silence, \\"We\'ve got a narrow window to strike. The IBAF checkpoints are heavily fortified, but our intel suggests there\'s a weakness in their air defenses.\\" Kaito nodded, his expression unreadable. \\"Our Heart Hybrid Gears will give us the edge we need in the skies. But remember, we\'re dealing with a force unlike any other. The Batlantis Empire isn\'t just another enemy. They wield magic and their tech is... different.\\" Across from them, Sam Fisher of Third Echelon, interjected, \\"Magic or not, they\'re not ready for what we bring. Our SIGINT capabilities have already identified key vulnerabilities in their communication networks. We exploit those, and we cripple their ability to respond.\\" As the strategy session continued, far from the clandestine meeting, Cordis Die members in the dense urban sprawls of South America worked feverishly, their screens flickering with data. \\"We\'re close,\\" whispered a voice, its owner shrouded in the glow of a computer screen. \\"The world needs to know the truth about Batlantis and what it\'s done to Lemuria.\\" In a stark contrast, Artemis Global Security’s HQ was a hive of activity, with engineers and technicians poring over the latest decrypted Lemurian tech, oblivious to the moral quandary their actions presented. \\"This tech could revolutionize warfare,\\" boasted one engineer, unaware of the looming catastrophe their betrayal could unleash. Back at the makeshift base, the operators prepared for deployment. Ghost Recon\'s Scott Mitchell assessed their troop readiness, \\"This isn\'t just another op. We\'re going against an empire that has conquered worlds with magic and dragons. But we\'ve faced down terrorists and rogue states. We adapt, we overcome.\\" \\"Remember, we\'re not just fighting for Lemuria or to avenge the fallen,\\" said Hida, clasping his Heart Hybrid Gear. \\"We\'re fighting for the future of every world that Batlantis sets its sights on. We either stand together now, or we fall separately.\\" As they geared up, a silent agreement was reached amongst them; their differences, their pasts, none of it mattered. In this moment, they were united: a tumultuous coalition of Earth\'s finest and Atlantis\' defiant, ready to carve out a semblance of hope in a seemingly insurmountable war. The Lemurian skies darkened as fleets of IBAF ships hovered ominously. Below them, the combined forces of Ghost Recon, Delta Company, Third Echelon, and the renegade operators from Batlantis launched their assault. It was a stunning mosaic of 21st-century military prowess intertwined with the arcane power of the Heart Hybrid Gear users, a testament to the desperation and unity born from conflict. The battlefield was a cacophony of gunfire, magical blasts, and the roar of engines. Amidst this chaos, a voice echoed, not in the field, but across the networks and onto the screens of millions worldwide. It was Cordis Die, unveiling the stark truth of the world\'s dire predicament. As the conflict reached its zenith, with the Enclave\'s shadowy figures watching from their secure Megafloats, a sense of unease spread among them. The world they knew, the balance of power, had shifted dramatically. In facing the threat of Batlantis, they had unintentionally sown the seeds for a new world order, one where the old mechanisms of power and domination were rendered obsolete by an alliance forged in the crucible of war. And as the dust settled, with Batlantis reeling from an unexpected, formidable resistance, it became evident that the war was far from over. Yet, a message had been sent, resonating through the halls of power across dimensions: when faced with tyranny, regardless of its form or might, unity and courage were not just virtues but necessities for survival. The world was watching, learning, and, most importantly, beginning to hope again."},{"prompt":"in a random order give me a random stanza from each poem but don\'t tell me the title of the poem or the author.

The tide is full, the moon lies fair Upon the straits; on the French coast the light Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand, Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay. Come to the window, sweet is the night-air! Only, from the long line of spray Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land, Listen! you hear the grating roar Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling, At their return, up the high strand, Begin, and cease, and then again begin, With tremulous cadence slow, and bring The eternal note of sadness in. Sophocles long ago Heard it on the Ægean, and it brought Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow Of human misery; we Find also in the sound a thought, Hearing it by this distant northern sea. The Sea of Faith Was once, too, at the full, and round earth’s shore Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled. But now I only hear Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar, Retreating, to the breath Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear And naked shingles of the world. Ah, love, let us be true To one another! for the world, which seems To lie before us like a land of dreams, So various, so beautiful, so new, Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light, Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; And we are here as on a darkling plain Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, Where ignorant armies clash by night. Eternity William Blake - 1757-1827 He who binds to himself a joy Does the winged life destroy He who kisses the joy as it flies Lives in eternity\'s sunrise Resilience BY KIMIKO HAHN A single drop of rain can weigh fifty times as much as a mosquito and yet the insect flies through a downpour without injury. Rather than resist the impact, they \\"go with the flow\\"— like a boyfriend who trained in aikido— and when there\'s a direct hit the long wings and legs act \\"like a kite with a lengthy tail\\" so the insect can pull through the globule before it splats on the ground. Moreover, when such resilience is used as a model for robots we learn: \\"If you make it very, very small, you basically don\'t have to do anything else to make it survive.\\" A tough exoskeleton helps. Also a happy-go-lucky heart even though his mother was strangled when he was seven. Yet Do I Marvel BY COUNTEE CULLEN I doubt not God is good, well-meaning, kind, And did He stoop to quibble could tell why The little buried mole continues blind, Why flesh that mirrors Him must some day die, Make plain the reason tortured Tantalus Is baited by the fickle fruit, declare If merely brute caprice dooms Sisyphus To struggle up a never-ending stair. Inscrutable His ways are, and immune To catechism by a mind too strewn With petty cares to slightly understand What awful brain compels His awful hand. Yet do I marvel at this curious thing: To make a poet black, and bid him sing! The Flea BY JOHN DONNE Mark but this flea, and mark in this, How little that which thou deniest me is; It sucked me first, and now sucks thee, And in this flea our two bloods mingled be; Thou know’st that this cannot be said A sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead, Yet this enjoys before it woo, And pampered swells with one blood made of two, And this, alas, is more than we would do. Oh stay, three lives in one flea spare, Where we almost, nay more than married are. This flea is you and I, and this Our marriage bed, and marriage temple is; Though parents grudge, and you, w\'are met, And cloistered in these living walls of jet. Though use make you apt to kill me, Let not to that, self-murder added be, And sacrilege, three sins in killing three. Cruel and sudden, hast thou since Purpled thy nail, in blood of innocence? Wherein could this flea guilty be, Except in that drop which it sucked from thee? Yet thou triumph’st, and say\'st that thou Find’st not thy self, nor me the weaker now; ’Tis true; then learn how false, fears be: Just so much honor, when thou yield’st to me, Will waste, as this flea’s death took life from thee. The Embrace Mark Doty - 1953- You weren\'t well or really ill yet either; just a little tired, your handsomeness tinged by grief or anticipation, which brought to your face a thoughtful, deepening grace. I didn\'t for a moment doubt you were dead. I knew that to be true still, even in the dream. You\'d been out—at work maybe?— having a good day, almost energetic. We seemed to be moving from some old house where we\'d lived, boxes everywhere, things in disarray: that was the story of my dream, but even asleep I was shocked out of the narrative by your face, the physical fact of your face: inches from mine, smooth-shaven, loving, alert. Why so difficult, remembering the actual look of you? Without a photograph, without strain? So when I saw your unguarded, reliable face, your unmistakable gaze opening all the warmth and clarity of —warm brown tea—we held each other for the time the dream allowed. Bless you. You came back, so I could see you once more, plainly, so I could rest against you without thinking this happiness lessened anything, without thinking you were alive again. The Rhodora Ralph Waldo Emerson 1803-1882 In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes, I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods, Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook, To please the desert and the sluggish brook. The purple petals fallen in the pool Made the black water with their beauty gay; Here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool, And court the flower that cheapens his array. Rhodora! if the sages ask thee why This charm is wasted on the earth and sky, Tell them, dear, that, if eyes were made for seeing, Then beauty is its own excuse for Being; Why thou wert there, O rival of the rose! I never thought to ask; I never knew; But in my simple ignorance suppose The self-same power that brought me there, brought you. Monet\'s Waterlilies Robert Hayden Today as the news from Selma and Saigon poisons the air like fallout, I come again to see the serene, great picture that I love. Here space and time exist in light the eye like the eye of faith believes. The seen, the known dissolve in iridescence, become illusive flesh of light that was not, was, forever is. O light beheld as through refracting tears. Here is the aura of that world each of us has lost. Here is the shadow of its joy. The Darkling Thrush BY THOMAS HARDY I leant upon a coppice gate When Frost was spectre-grey, And Winter\'s dregs made desolate The weakening eye of day. The tangled bine-stems scored the sky Like strings of broken lyres, And all mankind that haunted nigh Had sought their household fires. The land\'s sharp features seemed to be The Century\'s corpse outleant, His crypt the cloudy canopy, The wind his death-lament. The ancient pulse of germ and birth Was shrunken hard and dry, And every spirit upon earth Seemed fervourless as I. At once a voice arose among The bleak twigs overhead In a full-hearted evensong Of joy illimited; An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small, In blast-beruffled plume, Had chosen thus to fling his soul Upon the growing gloom. So little cause for carolings Of such ecstatic sound Was written on terrestrial things Afar or nigh around, That I could think there trembled through His happy good-night air Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew And I was unaware. Meditation at Lagunitas BY ROBERT HASS All the new thinking is about loss. In this it resembles all the old thinking. The idea, for example, that each particular erases the luminous clarity of a general idea. That the clown- faced woodpecker probing the dead sculpted trunk of that black birch is, by his presence, some tragic falling off from a first world of undivided light. Or the other notion that, because there is in this world no one thing to which the bramble of blackberry corresponds, a word is elegy to what it signifies. We talked about it late last night and in the voice of my friend, there was a thin wire of grief, a tone almost querulous. After a while I understood that, talking this way, everything dissolves: justice, pine, hair, woman, you and I. There was a woman I made love to and I remembered how, holding her small shoulders in my hands sometimes, I felt a violent wonder at her presence like a thirst for salt, for my childhood river with its island willows, silly music from the pleasure boat, muddy places where we caught the little orange-silver fish called pumpkinseed. It hardly had to do with her. Longing, we say, because desire is full of endless distances. I must have been the same to her. But I remember so much, the way her hands dismantled bread, the thing her father said that hurt her, what she dreamed. There are moments when the body is as numinous as words, days that are the good flesh continuing. Such tenderness, those afternoons and evenings, saying blackberry, blackberry, blackberry. Blame It On Summer BY LINDA RODRIGUEZ that I smile too widely, grinning really, and laugh too loud and often; that I walk with spring and sensual sway; that I stretch myself and twist like a cat baking in the backyard brightness; that my brain is sun-bleached, all rule and thought boiled away, leaving only sensory steam; that my feverish eyes see strange dancing flames in afternoon shadows along the sides of streets and Bedouin oases, fragrant with dates and goats and acrid desert waters, in every suburban garden we pass while you argue and drive and I stare, heavy-brained with heat and too aware of my own body and every other; that I take a lover, brazenly, crazily, too sun-stupid to be careful, in my dreams. Instructions on Not Giving Up by Ada Limón More than the fuchsia funnels breaking out of the crabapple tree, more than the neighbor’s almost obscene display of cherry limbs shoving their cotton candy-colored blossoms to the slate sky of Spring rains, it’s the greening of the trees that really gets to me. When all the shock of white and taffy, the world’s baubles and trinkets, leave the pavement strewn with the confetti of aftermath, the leaves come. Patient, plodding, a green skin growing over whatever winter did to us, a return to the strange idea of continuous living despite the mess of us, the hurt, the empty. Fine then, I’ll take it, the tree seems to say, a new slick leaf unfurling like a fist to an open palm, I’ll take it all. The Windhover BY GERARD MANLEY HOPKINS To Christ our Lord I caught this morning morning\'s minion, king- dom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing, As a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding Stirred for a bird, – the achieve of, the mastery of the thing! Brute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion Times told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier! No wonder of it: shéer plód makes plough down sillion Shine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear, Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermilion. Sonnet VII John Keats (1795-1821) O Solitude! if I must with thee dwell, Let it not be among the jumbled heap Of murky buildings; climb with me the steep,— Nature’s observatory—whence the dell, Its flowery slopes, its river’s crystal swell, May seem a span; let me thy vigils keep ’Mongst boughs pavillion’d, where the deer’s swift leap Startles the wild bee from the fox-glove bell. But though I’ll gladly trace these scenes with thee, Yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind, Whose words are images of thoughts refin’d, Is my soul’s pleasure; and it sure must be Almost the highest bliss of human-kind, When to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee. The Snow Man BY WALLACE STEVENS One must have a mind of winter To regard the frost and the boughs Of the pine-trees crusted with snow; And have been cold a long time To behold the junipers shagged with ice, The spruces rough in the distant glitter Of the January sun; and not to think Of any misery in the sound of the wind, In the sound of a few leaves, Which is the sound of the land Full of the same wind That is blowing in the same bare place For the listener, who listens in the snow, And, nothing himself, beholds Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is. Paradoxes and Oxymorons BY JOHN ASHBERY This poem is concerned with language on a very plain level. Look at it talking to you. You look out a window Or pretend to fidget. You have it but you don’t have it. You miss it, it misses you. You miss each other. The poem is sad because it wants to be yours, and cannot. What’s a plain level? It is that and other things, Bringing a system of them into play. Play? Well, actually, yes, but I consider play to be A deeper outside thing, a dreamed role-pattern, As in the division of grace these long August days Without proof. Open-ended. And before you know It gets lost in the steam and chatter of typewriters. It has been played once more. I think you exist only To tease me into doing it, on your level, and then you aren’t there Or have adopted a different attitude. And the poem Has set me softly down beside you. The poem is you. Ulysses BY ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON It little profits that an idle king, By this still hearth, among these barren crags, Match\'d with an aged wife, I mete and dole Unequal laws unto a savage race, That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me. I cannot rest from travel: I will drink Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy\'d Greatly, have suffer\'d greatly, both with those That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when Thro\' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades Vext the dim sea: I am become a name; For always roaming with a hungry heart Much have I seen and known; cities of men And manners, climates, councils, governments, Myself not least, but honour\'d of them all; And drunk delight of battle with my peers, Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. I am a part of all that I have met; Yet all experience is an arch wherethro\' Gleams that untravell\'d world whose margin fades For ever and forever when I move. How dull it is to pause, to make an end, To rust unburnish\'d, not to shine in use! As tho\' to breathe were life! Life piled on life Were all too little, and of one to me Little remains: but every hour is saved From that eternal silence, something more, A bringer of new things; and vile it were For some three suns to store and hoard myself, And this gray spirit yearning in desire To follow knowledge like a sinking star, Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. This is my son, mine own Telemachus, To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,— Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil This labour, by slow prudence to make mild A rugged people, and thro\' soft degrees Subdue them to the useful and the good. Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere Of common duties, decent not to fail In offices of tenderness, and pay Meet adoration to my household gods, When I am gone. He works his work, I mine. There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail: There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners, Souls that have toil\'d, and wrought, and thought with me— That ever with a frolic welcome took The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed Free hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old; Old age hath yet his honour and his toil; Death closes all: but something ere the end, Some work of noble note, may yet be done, Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods. The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks: The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends, \'T is not too late to seek a newer world. Push off, and sitting well in order smite The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars, until I die. It may be that the gulfs will wash us down: It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. Tho\' much is taken, much abides; and tho\' We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are; One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. True Fresh BY GENEVIEVE ARLIE The geometer wishes he were David cut from stone by lightning, his mind gyring wide into figures of space out of time, ever gauging the shock of the word for the pathos, ever slinging the rock of his wound at the sugared glass of me. I\'d rather be the artist himself, arms overhead atop a scaffold I built to the heavens and still immortal, than perfect frozen in stone, however larger than life in the image of God, the shepherd who slew the enemy of art with the dead aim of righteousness, the rightful king by love who would anoint a covenant he too could not keep and too late beg forgiveness. But I always felt beautiful by comparison. Need feels that way at first. Finally the harp grows weary of other viscera wound to snap across its polished body, the ceaseless plucking of its chords as if in play, turtle shell weeping hollow with the psalmist\'s ancient grief four thousand years of liturgy could not unspool. Finally the harp would string its own guts, would sing itself to sleep, like the artist\'s breastbone pressed flush against the ceiling, plaster still wet for the color. Vest By Jane Hirschfield I put on again the vest of many pockets. It is easy to forget which holds the reading glasses, which the small pen, which the house keys, the compass and whistle, the passport. To forget at last for weeks even the pocket holding the day of digging a place for my sister’s ashes, the one holding the day where someone will soon enough put my own. To misplace the pocket of touching the walls at Auschwitz would seem impossible. It is not. To misplace, for a decade, the pocket of tears. I rummage and rummage— transfers for Munich, for Melbourne, to Oslo. A receipt for a Singapore kopi. A device holding music: Bach, Garcia, Richter, Porter, Pärt. A woman long dead now gave me, when I told her I could not sing, a kazoo. Now in a pocket. Somewhere, a pocket holding a Steinway. Somewhere, a pocket holding a packet of salt. Borgesian vest, Oxford English Dictionary vest with a magnifying glass tucked inside one snapped-closed pocket, Wikipedia vest, Rosetta vest, Enigma vest of decoding, how is it one person can carry your weight for a lifetime, one person slip into your open arms for a lifetime? Who was given the world, and hunted for tissues, for chapstick. The Supple Deer By Jane Hirshfield The quiet opening between fence strands perhaps eighteen inches. Antlers to hind hooves, four feet off the ground, the deer poured through. No tuft of the coarse white belly hair left behind. I don\'t know how a stag turns into a stream, an arc of water. I have never felt such accurate envy. Not of the deer: To be that porous, to have such largeness pass through me. Time to Come BY WALT WHITMAN O, Death! a black and pierceless pall Hangs round thee, and the future state; No eye may see, no mind may grasp That mystery of fate. This brain, which now alternate throbs With swelling hope and gloomy fear; This heart, with all the changing hues, That mortal passions bear— This curious frame of human mould, Where unrequited cravings play, This brain, and heart, and wondrous form Must all alike decay. The leaping blood will stop its flow; The hoarse death-struggle pass; the cheek Lay bloomless, and the liquid tongue Will then forget to speak. The grave will take me; earth will close O’er cold dull limbs and ashy face; But where, O, Nature, where shall be The soul’s abiding place? Will it e’en live? For though its light Must shine till from the body torn; Then, when the oil of life is spent, Still shall the taper burn? O, powerless is this struggling brain To rend the mighty mystery; In dark, uncertain awe it waits The common doom, to die. Names of Horses Donald Hall B. 1928 All winter your brute shoulders strained against collars, padding and steerhide over the ash hames, to haul sledges of cordwood for drying through spring and summer, for the Glenwood stove next winter, and for the simmering range. In April you pulled cartloads of manure to spread on the fields, dark manure of Holsteins, and knobs of your own clustered with oats. All summer you mowed the grass in meadow and hayfield, the mowing machine clacketing beside you, while the sun walked high in the morning; and after noon\'s heat, you pulled a clawed rake through the same acres, gathering stacks, and dragged the wagon from stack to stack, and the built hayrack back, uphill to the chaffy barn, three loads of hay a day from standing grass in the morning. Sundays you trotted the two miles to church with the light load a leather quartertop buggy, and grazed in the sound of hymns. Generation on generation, your neck rubbed the windowsill of the stall, smoothing the wood as the sea smooths glass. When you were old and lame, when your shoulders hurt bending to graze, one October the man, who fed you and kept you, and harnessed you every morning, led you through corn stubble to sandy ground above Eagle Pond, and dug a hole beside you where you stood shuddering in your skin, and lay the shotgun\'s muzzle in the boneless hollow behind your ear, and fired the slug into your brain, and felled you into your grave, shoveling sand to cover you, setting goldenrod upright above you, where by next summer a dent in the ground made your monument. For a hundred and fifty years, in the Pasture of dead horses, roots of pine trees pushed through the pale curves of your ribs, yellow blossoms flourished above you in autumn, and in winter frost heaved your bones in the ground - old toilers, soil makers: O Roger, Mackerel, Riley, Ned, Nellie, Chester, Lady Ghost. Nurse By Dorianne Laux My mother went to work each day in a starched white dress, shoes clamped to her feet like pale mushrooms, two blue hearts pressed into the sponge rubber soles. When she came back home, her nylons streaked with runs, a spatter of blood across her bodice, she sat at one end of the dinner table and let us kids serve the spaghetti, sprinkle the parmesan, cut the buttered loaf. We poured black wine into the bell of her glass as she unfastened her burgundy hair, shook her head, and began. And over the years we mastered it, how to listen to stories of blocked intestines while we twirled the pasta, of saws teething cranium, drills boring holes in bone as we crunched the crust of our sourdough, carved the stems off our cauliflower. We learned the importance of balance, how an operation depends on cooperation and a blend of skills, the art of passing the salt before it is asked for. She taught us well, so that when Mary Ellen ran the iron over her arm, no one wasted a moment: My brother headed straight for the ice. Our little sister uncapped the salve. And I dialed the number under Ambulance, my stomach turning to the smell of singed skin, already planning the evening meal, the raw fish thawing in its wrapper, a perfect wedge of flesh.

He who binds to himself a joy Does the winged life destroy He who kisses the joy as it flies Lives in eternity\'s sunrise A single drop of rain can weigh fifty times as much as a mosquito and yet the insect flies through a downpour without injury. I doubt not God is good, well-meaning, kind, And did He stoop to quibble could tell why The little buried mole continues blind, Why flesh that mirrors Him must some day die, Make plain the reason tortured Tantalus Is baited by the fickle fruit, declare If merely brute caprice dooms Sisyphus To struggle up a never-ending stair. Mark but this flea, and mark in this, How little that which thou deniest me is; It sucked me first, and now sucks thee, And in this flea our two bloods mingled be; Thou know’st that this cannot be said A sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead, Yet this enjoys before it woo, And pampered swells with one blood made of two, And this, alas, is more than we would do. You weren\'t well or really ill yet either; just a little tired, your handsomeness tinged by grief or anticipation, which brought to your face a thoughtful, deepening grace. In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes, I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods, Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook, To please the desert and the sluggish brook. The purple petals fallen in the pool Made the black water with their beauty gay; Here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool, And court the flower that cheapens his array. Today as the news from Selma and Saigon poisons the air like fallout, I come again to see the serene, great picture that I love. I leant upon a coppice gate When Frost was spectre-grey, And Winter\'s dregs made desolate The weakening eye of day. The tangled bine-stems scored the sky Like strings of broken lyres, And all mankind that haunted nigh Had sought their household fires. All the new thinking is about loss. In this it resembles all the old thinking. The idea, for example, that each particular erases the luminous clarity of a general idea. That the clown- faced woodpecker probing the dead sculpted trunk of that black birch is, by his presence, some tragic falling off from a first world of undivided light. Or the other notion that, because there is in this world no one thing to which the bramble of blackberry corresponds, a word is elegy to what it signifies. that I smile too widely, grinning really, and laugh too loud and often; that I walk with spring and sensual sway; that I stretch myself and twist like a cat baking in the backyard brightness; that my brain is sun-bleached, all rule and thought boiled away, leaving only sensory steam; that my feverish eyes see strange dancing flames in afternoon shadows along the sides of streets and Bedouin oases, fragrant with dates and goats and acrid desert waters, in every suburban garden we pass while you argue and drive and I stare, heavy-brained with heat and too aware of my own body and every other; that I take a lover, brazenly, crazily, too sun-stupid to be careful, in my dreams. More than the fuchsia funnels breaking out of the crabapple tree, more than the neighbor’s almost obscene display of cherry limbs shoving their cotton candy-colored blossoms to the slate sky of Spring rains, it’s the greening of the trees that really gets to me. When all the shock of white and taffy, the world’s baubles and trinkets, leave the pavement strewn with the confetti of aftermath, the leaves come. Patient, plodding, a green skin growing over whatever winter did to us, a return to the strange idea of continuous living despite the mess of us, the hurt, the empty. Fine then, I’ll take it, the tree seems to say, a new slick leaf unfurling like a fist to an open palm, I’ll take it all. To Christ our Lord I caught this morning morning\'s minion, king- dom of daylight\'s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing, As a skate\'s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding Stirred for a bird, – the achieve of, the mastery of the thing! O Solitude! if I must with thee dwell, Let it not be among the jumbled heap Of murky buildings; climb with me the steep,— Nature’s observatory—whence the dell, Its flowery slopes, its river’s crystal swell, May seem a span; let me thy vigils keep ’Mongst boughs pavillion’d, where the deer’s swift leap Startles the wild bee from the fox-glove bell. One must have a mind of winter To regard the frost and the boughs Of the pine-trees crusted with snow; And have been cold a long time To behold the junipers shagged with ice, The spruces rough in the distant glitter This poem is concerned with language on a very plain level. Look at it talking to you. You look out a window Or pretend to fidget. You have it but you don’t have it. You miss it, it misses you. You miss each other. It little profits that an idle king, By this still hearth, among these barren crags, Match\'d with an aged wife, I mete and dole Unequal laws unto a savage race, That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me. I cannot rest from travel: I will drink Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy\'d Greatly, have suffer\'d greatly, both with those That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when Thro\' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades Vext the dim sea: I am become a name; For always roaming with a hungry heart Much have I seen and known; cities of men And manners, climates, councils, governments, The geometer wishes he were David cut from stone by lightning, his mind gyring wide into figures of space out of time, ever gauging the shock of the word for the pathos, ever slinging the rock of his wound at the sugared glass of me. I\'d rather be the artist himself, arms overhead atop a scaffold I built to the heavens and still immortal, than perfect frozen in stone, however larger than life in the image of God, the shepherd who slew the enemy of art with the dead aim of righteousness, the rightful king by love who would anoint a covenant he too could not keep and too late beg forgiveness. But I always felt beautiful by comparison. Need feels that way at first. Finally the harp grows weary of other viscera wound to snap across its polished body, the ceaseless plucking of its chords as if in play, turtle shell weeping hollow with the psalmist\'s ancient grief four thousand years of liturgy could not unspool. Finally the harp would string its own guts, would sing itself to sleep, like the artist\'s breastbone pressed flush against the ceiling, plaster still wet for the color. I put on again the vest of many pockets. It is easy to forget which holds the reading glasses, which the small pen, which the house keys, the compass and whistle, the passport. To forget at last for weeks even the pocket holding the day of digging a place for my sister’s ashes, the one holding the day where someone will soon enough put my own. To misplace the pocket of touching the walls at Auschwitz would seem impossible. It is not. To misplace, for a decade, the pocket of tears. I rummage and rummage— transfers for Munich, for Melbourne, to Oslo. A receipt for a Singapore kopi. A device holding music: Bach, Garcia, Richter, Porter, Pärt. A woman long dead now gave me, when I told her I could not sing, a kazoo. Now in a pocket. Somewhere, a pocket holding a Steinway. Somewhere, a pocket holding a packet of salt. The quiet opening between fence strands perhaps eighteen inches. Antlers to hind hooves, four feet off the ground, the deer poured through. No tuft of the coarse white belly hair left behind. I don\'t know how a stag turns into a stream, an arc of water. I have never felt such accurate envy. Not of the deer: To be that porous, to have such largeness pass through me. O, Death! a black and pierceless pall Hangs round thee, and the future state; No eye may see, no mind may grasp That mystery of fate. All winter your brute shoulders strained against collars, padding and steerhide over the ash hames, to haul sledges of cordwood for drying through spring and summer, for the Glenwood stove next winter, and for the simmering range. In April you pulled cartloads of manure to spread on the fields, dark manure of Holsteins, and knobs of your own clustered with oats. All summer you mowed the grass in meadow and hayfield, the mowing machine clacketing beside you, while the sun walked high in the morning; and after noon\'s heat, you pulled a clawed rake through the same acres, gathering stacks, and dragged the wagon from stack to stack, and the built hayrack back, uphill to the chaffy barn, three loads of hay a day from standing grass in the morning. Sundays you trotted the two miles to church with the light load a leather quartertop buggy, and grazed in the sound of hymns. Generation on generation, your neck rubbed the windowsill of the stall, smoothing the wood as the sea smooths glass. My mother went to work each day in a starched white dress, shoes clamped to her feet like pale mushrooms, two blue hearts pressed into the sponge rubber soles. When she came back home, her nylons streaked with runs, a spatter of blood across her bodice, she sat at one end of the dinner table and let us kids serve the spaghetti, sprinkle the parmesan, cut the buttered loaf. We poured black wine into the bell of her glass as she unfastened her burgundy hair, shook her head, and began. And over the years we mastered it, how to listen to stories of blocked intestines while we twirled the pasta, of saws teething cranium, drills boring holes in bone as we crunched the crust of our sourdough, carved the stems off our cauliflower. We learned the importance of balance, how an operation depends on cooperation and a blend of skills, the art of passing the salt before it is asked for. She taught us well, so that when Mary Ellen ran the iron over her arm, no one wasted a moment: My brother headed straight for the ice. Our little sister uncapped the salve. And I dialed the number under Ambulance, my stomach turning to the smell of singed skin, already planning the evening meal, the raw fish thawing in its wrapper, a perfect wedge of flesh. More than the fuchsia funnels breaking out of the crabapple tree, more than the neighbor’s almost obscene display of cherry limbs shoving their cotton candy-colored blossoms to the slate sky of Spring rains, it’s the greening of the trees that really gets to me. When all the shock of white and taffy, the world’s baubles and trinkets, leave the pavement strewn with the confetti of aftermath, the leaves come. Patient, plodding, a green skin growing over whatever winter did to us, a return to the strange idea of continuous living despite the mess of us, the hurt, the empty.

[Ainess] by the IBAF\'s scouts monitoring the dimensional pathways to other dimensions from Atlantis, although they [the scouts] couldn\'t pinpoint Ainess\' location, thus causing the Batlantis parliament and the lords and nobles to blame Lemuria despite the Lemurians being innocent, and also to hide the fact that Batlantis, along with the rest of Atlantis, is slowly turning into a barren desert due to the deterioration of the terraforming device with matter-energy replicators capable of creating food and basic items needed for building new environments, atmospheric chemical stabilizers and water purifiers known as the Genesis [Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto] on Atlantis.

The corridors of the Batlantis Royal Palace echoed with whispers and hurried footsteps as news of the disappearance spread like wildfire. Commander Elara, leader of the Imperial Batlanis Armed Forces (IBAF), convened with the Batlantis parliament in a chamber where the air was thick with tension and magic. “We’ve scoured the dimensional pathways; she’s not in Atlantis,” Commander Elara stated, her voice as calm as the still surface of a lake, yet beneath, churning with concern. A murmur of disbelief spread among the lords and nobles, their expressions a mix of worry and suspicion. “And you blame Lemuria for this?” challenged a noble, his eyes narrowed. “It is the most plausible explanation. They covet our magic-tech and our resources. They might have abducted Ainess to force our hand,” Elara replied, her posture unyielding. “But we have no proof!” argued another. Commander Elara sighed, “We might not have proof, but we cannot ignore the possibility. Plus, our world is dying. The Genesis device is failing. Lemuria, with its advanced technology, could be our salvation or our undoing.” The room fell silent, each person contemplating the gravity of their situation. **Chapter 2: The Alliance of Shadows** Across the dimensional breach, in Lemuria, an alert went out to the most covert forces in the world. The Ghosts received their orders in the bowels of a nondescript building, the air thick with anticipation. “Gentlemen, the IBAF has commandeered former US bases. We’re going in to take them out,” announced their commander, his eyes scanning the room. “We’ve got support from Third Echelon and intel that Artemis Global Security has gone rogue.” “What about Cordis Die and DedSec?” asked a Ghost, his hand steady on his weapon. “They’re attempting to expose the Batlantis invasion. But they’re fighting a shadow war. We need to act fast,” the commander replied. As teams moved out, whispers of collusion with otherworldly forces and tales of magic-tech armor filled the air. The line between friend and foe blurred in the shadows. **Chapter 3: The Siege of Lemuria** The skies above Lemuria darkened as fleets powered by both magic and technology descended upon the world. The IBAF, with its Heart Hybrid Gear-clad warriors, clashed against the advanced technology of Lemuria. It was a spectacle of light and shadow, as spells interwove with ballistic trajectories. In the heart of the conflict, Commander Elara sought out the stronghold of the Lemurian resistance. Her Heart Hybrid Gear shimmered with power as she cut through the ranks of drones and exoskeleton-powered soldiers. Amidst the chaos, the Enclave observed from their hidden bunkers, their fingers on the button of the apocalypse. \\"If Lemuria falls, we activate the Megafloats and retreat,\\" whispered one to another, their faces masked in shadows. As the battle raged, the Lemurian superpowers, in a desperate move, launched their combined WMD arsenals. The sky lit up with a destructive beauty, a pyrrhic victory covered up as a war between Earth\'s superpowers. **Chapter 4: Exodus to the Megafloats** The aftermath was desolation. The world of Lemuria was in ruins, its cities crumbling under the weight of the apocalypse. The Ghosts, along with survivors, made their way to the Megafloats - humanity\'s last refuge on the waterworld that Earth had become. \\"We\'ve lost much,\\" whispered a Ghost, looking back at the destruction. \\"But we still live. And as long as we do, we fight,\\" replied another, his gaze set on the horizon. In the command center of a Megafloat, leaders of Lemuria gathered, amongst them, shadowy figures from the Enclave. \\"Our world is gone. But on these Megafloats, we rebuild. We have technology, resources, and a will to survive. Batlantis may have won a battle, but not the war,\\" declared a leader, determination set in his features. As the Megafloats sailed across the vast, open sea, a beacon of hope amidst a sea of despair, they prepared. The war was far from over. Lemuria may be lost, but humanity would rise again, from the ashes of the old world, to face Batlantis in a battle for the future. **Epilogue: Echoes Across Worlds** In the hallowed halls of Batlantis, news of the Lemurian resistance reached even the highest echelons. Princess Ainess Synclavia, now returned under mysterious circumstances, watched from her balcony as her world grappled with a future fraught with uncertainty. \\"I disappeared to learn about our enemy, to understand their strength,\\" Ainess whispered to herself. \\"But what I found was their heart. Despite everything, they fight on. Perhaps... Perhaps there is another way.\\" As the sun set on Batlantis, and the lights of the Megafloats twinkled like stars on the horizon, a flicker of understanding bridged two worlds. For in the heart of conflict, lies the potential for reconciliation, and from the depths of despair, the hope for a new dawn. And so, the echoes of Lemuria whispered across dimensions, carrying tales of loss, of resilience, and of the undying spirit of humanity."},{"prompt":"Hard science reality, but insane difficulty","completion":"Creating a scientifically grounded concept that also presents an insane level of difficulty to achieve with our current understanding and technologies is quite a stimulating challenge. One such idea that fits these criteria involves the construction of a stable, traversable wormhole for space travel, as theorized in the field of astrophysics and general relativity. # Background A wormhole is a hypothetical structure linking disparate points in spacetime, potentially allowing for instantaneous travel across astronomical distances or even time travel. The concept is deeply rooted in Einstein\'s theory of General Relativity, which describes how gravity affects the shape of space and the flow of time. # Hard Science Basis The Einstein-Rosen bridge, or what is popularly known as a wormhole, emerges from solutions to the Einstein field equations that dictate how mass-energy curves space-time. For a wormhole to be traversable and stable, it would require a form of negative energy density (or exotic matter) to hold it open. This exotic matter would need properties violating the known energy conditions, such as being repulsive rather than attractive like normal matter. # Insane Difficulty 1. **Production of Negative Energy in Sufficient Quantities**: While effects such as the Casimir effect hint at the existence of negative energy, producing and maintaining it in sufficient quantities to stabilize a wormhole represents an enormous, currently insurmountable challenge. 2. **Stabilization and Safety**: Even if a wormhole could be opened, ensuring it is stable and safe for travel involves overcoming immense technical obstacles. Manipulating spacetime on such a grand scale without causing catastrophic side effects is beyond our current grasp. 3. **Navigation and Control**: Assuming a wormhole could be stabilized, the ability to navigate and control endpoints poses another set of profound difficulties. This would require a level of technology and energy manipulation that is far removed from our contemporary capabilities. 4. **Understanding of Spacetime**: Our current understanding of spacetime and the universe is incomplete. Theoretical breakthroughs in physics, perhaps through a working theory of quantum gravity, would be necessary to begin to approach the practical challenges of wormhole creation. 5. **Unimaginable Energy Requirements**: The energy required to manipulate spacetime in such a manner is estimated to be on the order of entire stars or even galaxies, depending on the specifics of the wormhole. Generating, harnessing, and directing such energy levels are well beyond the reach of current and near-future technologies. # Conclusion The creation and use of a stable, traversable wormhole represents a confluence of extreme scientific and engineering challenges that touches on the very limits of our understanding of the universe. While it is a concept deeply rooted in established physics, translating it from theory to reality would require breakthroughs in several fields of physics, enormous technological advancements, and a revolution in our understanding of the fundamental forces of nature."},{"prompt":"Ejercicio 7.

Voy a mostrarte cómo puedes introducir este código para detectar cuando hagas clic en el objeto \\"tierra\\" y aumentar su velocidad de giro. Supondremos que quieres incrementar la velocidad de rotación alrededor de su propio eje, por ejemplo, en el eje y. Primero, vamos a definir algunos ajustes iniciales necesarios como la creación del `Raycaster` y el vector `mouse` que usaremos para registrar la posición del ratón: ```javascript // Después de definir tus variables globales, añade estas nuevas var raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster(); var mouse = new THREE.Vector2(); var rotationSpeed = 0.01; // Velocidad inicial de rotación ``` Ahora, se necesita una función que actualice la posición del ratón y realice la detección de clic en el objeto. Esta función será llamada cuando se detecte un evento de clic: ```javascript function onMouseClick( event ) { // Calcula la posición del ratón en coordenadas normalizadas (-1 a +1) para ambos ejes mouse.x = ( event.clientX / window.innerWidth ) * 2 - 1; mouse.y = - ( event.clientY / window.innerHeight ) * 2 + 1; // Actualiza el raycaster con la posición del ratón raycaster.setFromCamera( mouse, camera ); // Calcula los objetos que intersectan con el rayo del raycaster var intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects( scene.children ); for ( var i = 0; i < intersects.length; i++ ) { // Comprueba si el objeto \'tierra\' es el intersectado if(intersects[i].object.name === \'tierra\') { // Aumenta la velocidad de rotación rotationSpeed += 0.01; } } } // Añade el event listener al document document.addEventListener( \'click\', onMouseClick, false ); ``` Por último, debes actualizar la función `animate` para incluir la rotación del objeto tierra usando la `rotationSpeed` que se incrementa al hacer clic en el objeto: ```javascript function animate() { requestAnimationFrame( animate ); var tierra = scene.getObjectByName(\'tierra\'); if(tierra){ // Actualiza la rotación de la tierra en el eje y tierra.rotation.y += rotationSpeed; } render(); update(); } ``` Con estos pasos, cada vez que haces clic en el objeto \\"tierra\\", la velocidad de su rotación debería incrementarse. Asegúrate de revisar y adaptar las variables y funciones a tu código específico donde sea necesario."},{"prompt":"Ya sabemos recoger eventos, ahora queremos utilizar un evento de ratón para seleccionar objetos 3D en la escena.

Lo haremos siguiendo estos pasos: 1. **Iniciar el `Raycaster` y escuchar eventos de clic del ratón**: Primero, necesitamos inicializar un `Raycaster` y luego usar un detector de eventos para escuchar clics del ratón en la ventana. 2. **Calcular la posición del ratón en coordenadas normalizadas**: Cuando se produce un evento de clic, calculamos la posición del ratón en coordenadas normalizadas entre -1 y 1, lo cual es necesario para que el `Raycaster` pueda interpretar correctamente la posición. 3. **Detectar la intersección con objetos en la escena mediante el `Raycaster`**: Usamos el rayo para verificar qué objetos en la escena intersecta el clic del ratón. Si se detecta que el objeto \\"tierra\\" fue clickeado, incrementaremos su velocidad de rotación. 4. **Modificar la velocidad de rotación del objeto \\"tierra\\"**: Una vez identificado el clic en el objeto \\"tierra\\", aumentaremos su velocidad de rotación. Aquí te dejo un ejemplo de cómo podrías integrar esto en tu proyecto: ```javascript // 1. Inicializando Raycaster y añadiendo detector de eventos para hacer clic en la ventana var raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster(); var mouse = new THREE.Vector2(); function onMouseClick(event) { // 2. Calculando la posición del ratón en coordenadas normalizadas mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1; mouse.y = - (event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1; // Actualizar el raycaster basado en la posición del ratón raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera); // 3. Detectando intersecciones var intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true); for (var i = 0; i < intersects.length; i++) { // Verificamos si el objeto \\"tierra\\" es el que se intersectó y aumentamos su velocidad de rotación if (intersects[i].object.name === \\"tierra\\") { // 4. Modificar la velocidad de rotación de \\"tierra\\" rotationSpeed += 0.01; // Suponiendo que existe una variable `rotationSpeed` para controlar esto } } } document.addEventListener(\'click\', onMouseClick, false); ``` Ahora asegúrate de tener una variable `rotationSpeed` que influya en la rotación de la tierra en tu función `animate` o donde manejes la actualización de la escena. Por ejemplo, si la rotación actual se aplica en el eje Y, tu código en la función de animación podría verse así: ```javascript function animate() { requestAnimationFrame(animate); // Asumiendo que \'tierra\' es tu objeto de esfera que representa la Tierra y que ha sido previamente definido var tierra = scene.getObjectByName(\\"tierra\\"); if (tierra) { tierra.rotation.y += rotationSpeed; } render(); update(); } ``` Este ejemplo incrementará la velocidad de rotación del objeto con nombre \\"tierra\\" cada vez que se haga clic sobre él, usando un `Raycaster` para detectar la interacción del ratón con el objeto 3D en la escena. Solo asegúrate de definir y adaptar variables como `rotationSpeed` según la estructura actual de tu código."},{"prompt":"why do people not trust me","completion":"Trust is a complex and multifaceted aspect of human relationships, influenced by numerous factors. If you feel like people generally do not trust you, it might be worth considering some of the following factors to understand why that might be the case: 1. **Consistency**: People often trust those who are consistent in their actions and words. If you\'ve been inconsistent or unpredictable, it might lead others to doubt your reliability. 2. **Honesty**: Have you been caught lying or stretching the truth? Even small lies can significantly damage trust, as they lead people to question whether they can believe what you say. 3. **Confidentiality**: If you\'ve shared secrets or private information that was entrusted to you, individuals may no longer see you as a confidant. 4. **Reliability**: Failing to keep promises or meet commitments can lead to a perception of unreliability, making others hesitant to trust you in the future. 5. **Empathy and Understanding**: People often trust those who show understanding and empathy towards them. If you\'ve been perceived as self-centered or indifferent to others\' feelings, this might impact their willingness to trust you. 6. **Body Language and Non-verbal Cues**: Sometimes, it\'s not about what you say but how you say it. Non-verbal cues like eye contact, facial expressions, and the tone of voice can affect how trustworthy people find you. 7. **Past Behaviors**: Previous actions can heavily impact people\'s willingness to trust. If there have been instances in the past where your actions have hurt someone, those memories can linger and affect their ability to trust you now. Building or rebuilding trust takes time and effort. It requires consistent, honest, and empathetic behavior, as well as a willingness to admit mistakes and apologize when necessary. Reestablishing trust is not always easy, but with patience, openness, and genuine effort, it is often possible to change how others perceive you. Reflecting on your actions and considering the perspective of others can be a good starting point for understanding why trust might be an issue and what steps you can take to address it."},{"prompt":"Proyecto: hacer llaveros con resina , sacar costo de venta con materiales, mano de obra, costó por unidad, tiempo de elaboración, valor de la unidad, ganancia día horas y minutos que me gaste haciendo un solo llavero con resina","completion":"Para calcular el costo de venta de un llavero de resina y estimar las ganancias, hay que tener en cuenta varios factores, incluyendo los costos de materiales, mano de obra, tiempo de elaboración, y otros posibles gastos indirectos (como electricidad, desgaste de herramientas, etc.). Aquí te comparto un ejemplo generalizado de cómo podrías calcular todo esto. Ten en cuenta que los precios y tiempos son hipotéticos y pueden variar según tu ubicación, la calidad de los materiales, y tu eficiencia. # 1. Lista de Materiales Necesarios: - Resina: 10 (suficiente para 10 llaveros). - Moldes: 5 (reutilizables, supongamos que se pueden usar para 100 llaveros antes de reemplazar). - Otros (colorantes, decoraciones, etc.): 5 (para 10 llaveros). # 2. Mano de Obra: - Tiempo estimado para hacer un llavero: 1 hora (esto incluiría mezclar resina, vertirla en el molde, añadir decoraciones y dejar que se cure). - Costo de mano de obra por hora: supongamos que quieres ganar 15 por hora. # 3. Costos Fijos y Variables: - Costos fijos (moldes divididos entre el número de usos): 5 / 100 = 0.05 por llavero. - Costos variables (resina y otros materiales divididos entre el número de llaveros que puedes hacer con esos materiales): (10 + 5) / 10 = 1.50 por llavero. - Costo de mano de obra por llavero (1 hora a 15 por hora): 15. # 4. Suma de Costos: - Total de costos por unidad: 0.05 (fijo) + 1.50 (variable) + 15 (mano de obra) = **16.55** por llavero. # 5. Precio de Venta y Ganancia: Para establecer un precio de venta, debes considerar un margen de ganancia sobre tus costos. Supongamos que quieres tener un 50% de ganancia sobre el costo. - Ganancia necesaria por llavero: 16.55 * 50% = 8.275. - Precio de venta sugerido por llavero: 16.55 + 8.275 = **24.825**, que podrías redondear a 25. # 6. Análisis de Ganancias por Tiempo: - Ganancia por hora: Si consideramos que la ganancia por llavero es de aproximadamente 8.28 y te lleva 1 hora hacerlo, tu ganancia por hora es de 8.28. Es importante recordar que estos cálculos son muy básicos y no incluyen posibles costos adicionales como impuestos, transporte de materiales, marketing, etc. También debes tener en cuenta el mercado y la demanda para el precio final de tus productos; quizás puedas obtener un mejor margen de ganancia o necesites ajustar los precios para ser competitivo."},{"prompt":"На солнце 283 огурца высохнут за 835467194 минут за сколько минут высохнут 8 огурцов?","completion":"Чтобы решить данную задук, можно воспользоваться пропорциями, исходя из того, что время, необходимое на высыхание огурцов, делится на количество огурцов, которое прямо пропорционально времени высыхания.

Python\'s type comment is a feature that allows developers to annotate variables, function parameters, and return types with type information, enabling static type checking in a dynamically typed language. This is particularly seen with the use of type comments following the PEP 484 specification. Let\'s outline how you might start implementing a basic Python lexer in Rust that recognizes Python syntax, including type comments. This example won\'t cover the full details of implementing a lexer but will give you a good starting point focusing on recognizing type comments alongside other tokens. # Step 1: Setting Up a Rust Project First, if you haven\'t already, you need to install Rust and Cargo (Rust’s build system and package manager). 1. **Install Rust:** Follow the instructions on the official Rust site (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). 2. **Create a New Project:** Run `cargo new python_lexer` in your terminal. This command creates a new Rust project named `python_lexer`. 3. **Change Directory:** Move into your project directory with `cd python_lexer`. # Step 2: Defining Your Token Types In your Rust project, you\'ll first need to define the types of tokens your lexer will recognize. This includes standard Python tokens (identifiers, keywords, literals) and specifically tokens representing type comments. 1. **Open `src/lib.rs`** and define an enum to represent your token types: ```rust #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)] pub enum TokenType { // Basic tokens Identifier(String), Integer(i64), Keyword(String), // Type comment token TypeComment(String), // Add more token types as needed } ``` # Step 3: Building the Lexer Next, you would implement the lexer itself. The lexer will read through the source input (a Python code string), breaking it into tokens. 1. **Implement Lexing Logic**: - For simplicity, let\'s sketch how you could start parsing type comments. A comprehensive lexer would require more sophisticated logic, including handling all Python syntax. ```rust pub struct Lexer { input: String, position: usize, // current position in input (points to current char) read_position: usize, // current reading position in input (after current char) ch: char, // current char under examination } impl Lexer { pub fn new(input: String) -> Lexer { let mut lexer = Lexer { input, position: 0, read_position: 0, ch: \'0\' }; lexer.read_char(); lexer } fn read_char(&mut self) { // Read the next character and advance the position in the input string. if self.read_position >= self.input.len() { self.ch = \'0\'; // Indicates EOF } else { self.ch = self.input.chars().nth(self.read_position).unwrap_or(\'0\'); } self.position = self.read_position; self.read_position += 1; } pub fn next_token(&mut self) -> Option<TokenType> { self.skip_whitespace(); let token = match self.ch { \'#\' => { // Handling type comments // For simplicity, assuming any comment could be a type comment for this example let comment_content = self.read_comment(); Some(TokenType::TypeComment(comment_content)) }, _ => None, // Further implementation needed for other tokens }; self.read_char(); token } fn read_comment(&mut self) -> String { let position = self.position + 1; // Skipping the \'#\' character while self.ch != \'n\' && self.ch != \'0\' { self.read_char(); } self.input[position..self.position].to_string() } fn skip_whitespace(&mut self) { while self.ch.is_whitespace() { self.read_char(); } } } ``` 2. **Test Your Lexer**: You\'ll want to write tests to ensure your lexer correctly handles various inputs, including those with type comments. ```rust #[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*; #[test] fn test_type_comment() { let input = \\"# type: (int) -> None\\".to_string(); let mut lexer = Lexer::new(input); assert_eq!( lexer.next_token(), Some(TokenType::TypeComment(\\"(int) -> None\\".to_string())) ); } } ``` # Step 4: Expanding Functionality - To handle the full Python language, you’ll want to extend your `TokenTypes` and lexing logic significantly. - Implement state handling for different contexts (e.g., inside a string literal, handling numeric literals, keywords, identifiers). - Optimize performance by exploring more efficient string manipulation and parsing strategies in Rust. # Resources and Further Learning - **Rust Language Documentation:** https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ - **The Python Language Reference:** https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html covers Python’s syntax and lexical analysis. - **Parsing Techniques:** For more advanced parsing strategies, consider researching parser generators that could be used alongside or integrated into your Rust lexer. This example provides a foundational approach to building a lexer in Rust. Expanding this to fully support Python syntax, including sophisticated type comment parsing, would involve a more detailed implementation and understanding of both Rust and Python\'s grammars."},{"prompt":"distinguish between normal comment and type comment in code","completion":"Distinguishing between normal comments and type comments in Python, as per the PEP 484 specification, is crucial for a lexer that aims to support type annotations introduced for static type checking. Type comments are a specific kind of comment that includes type hints, allowing developers to annotate the types of variables, function parameters, and return values in a way that is recognizable by static type checkers like `mypy`. # Normal Comments Normal comments in Python start with a `#` character and extend to the end of the line. They are purely for the developer\'s readability and have no impact on the program\'s execution. ```python # This is a normal comment a = 5 # This is also a normal comment, inline with code ``` # Type Comments Type comments are special comments that follow a specific syntax and are used to provide type hints. According to PEP 484, type comments should be used when syntax for type annotations is not available (e.g., Python versions before 3.6) or when the type hint syntax cannot be used (e.g., with variable annotations in Python 3.5 and earlier). Type comments for variables: ```python a = some_function() # type: int ``` Type comments for functions: ```python def func(arg1, arg2): # type: (int, str) -> bool return arg1 > 0 and arg2.islower() ``` # Implementing the Distinction in the Lexer To distinguish between normal comments and type comments in your lexer implementation in Rust, you would specifically look for the `# type:` pattern that marks the beginning of a type comment. This distinction allows your lexer to categorize comments correctly and potentially enables a static type checker to utilize these annotations. Below is an adjusted version of the `read_comment` method that attempts to distinguish between normal and type comments: ```rust fn read_comment(&mut self) -> String { let position = self.position + 1; // Skipping the \'#\' character while self.ch != \'n\' && self.ch != \'0\' { self.read_char(); } let comment_text = self.input[position..self.position].to_string(); // Check if it\'s a type comment if comment_text.trim_start().starts_with(\\"type:\\") { // Here, you could either handle it directly or differentiate it in some manner } comment_text } ``` When distinguishing between normal and type comments, you might choose to further process or tag type comments differently, perhaps by returning a variant of the `TokenType` enum specifically for type comments, such as `TokenType::TypeComment(String)` versus `TokenType::Comment(String)` for normal comments. Additionally, this approach implies that your lexer (or a subsequent parser phase) will need to maintain statefulness or incorporate more sophisticated pattern matching to accurately interpret and categorize comments according to their intended purpose, ensuring that type information can be extracted and used effectively by tools that rely on these annotations. Remember, this distinction is valuable for static analysis tools and type checkers, enabling them to make use of type hints embedded in comments to enforce type safety in Python codebases that haven\'t fully adopted the newer syntax for inline type annotations introduced in Python 3.5 and later."},{"prompt":"is it valid python with type comment ```def func(arg1, arg2): # type: bool return arg1 > 0 and arg2.islower() ```","completion":"The example you\'ve provided seems to attempt to use a type comment to specify the return type of the function `func`. However, the syntax used in the example is incorrect according to PEP 484, which introduces type hints through comments. Here\'s a breakdown of the syntax mistake and how to correct it. # Your Original Example ```python def func(arg1, arg2): # type: bool return arg1 > 0 and arg2.islower() ``` In this example, the comment `# type: bool` is placed inside the function, apparently with the intention of indicating that the function returns a boolean value. However, this is not how type comments for specifying return types are used in Python. # Correct Syntax for Type Comments with Functions According to PEP 484, the correct way to annotate a function\'s return type with a type comment is as follows: 1. **For a function with parameters**, the type comment includes types for all parameters, followed by the return type, all enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. If there are no parameters, just the return type in parentheses. 2. **The type comment is placed on the same line as the function signature if it fits**. If it doesn\'t fit, the type comment is placed on the immediately following line, starting with `# type:`. # Corrected Example If `arg1` is of type `int` and `arg2` is of type `str`, and the function is intended to return a `bool`, here is how you could annotate it: ```python def func(arg1, arg2): # type: (int, str) -> bool return arg1 > 0 and arg2.islower() ``` Alternatively, if the function signature is too long, you can place the type comment on the following line, but this is less commonly used for single-line function signatures: ```python def func(arg1, arg2): # type: (int, str) -> bool return arg1 > 0 and arg2.islower() ``` It\'s important to note that Python 3.5 and later versions support static type hints directly in the function signatures, which is the recommended way to annotate functions if you are not maintaining compatibility with older Python versions: ```python def func(arg1: int, arg2: str) -> bool: return arg1 > 0 and arg2.islower() ``` This inline syntax is more modern and preferred for new codebases or when backward compatibility with versions of Python older than 3.5 is not required."},{"prompt":"def func(): # type: () -> bool return False","completion":"The snippet you provided is a correct use of a type comment for specifying the return type of a function in Python, following the conventions set out in PEP 484. This syntax is particularly useful for indicating the expected return type of a function in Python versions that don\'t support the newer syntax introduced in Python 3.5 for type hints. Here’s the provided example: ```python def func(): # type: () -> bool return False ``` In this case, the function `func` is correctly annotated to indicate that it takes no arguments (as denoted by `()` in the type comment) and returns a boolean value (`bool`). The actual function body simply returns the boolean value `False`. # Key Points: - **Purpose**: This type comment is used for static type checking to ensure that the function is used correctly elsewhere in the code. It effectively communicates to developers and static type analyzers (like `mypy`) that `func` is expected to return a boolean value. - **Syntax**: The syntax used here, `# type: () -> bool`, conforms to the guidelines established by PEP 484 for annotating the types of function parameters and return values in the absence of native syntax support (prior to Python 3.5) or for other specific circumstances where inline type hints cannot be used. - **Compatibility**: While Python 3.5 and newer versions support inline type hints (e.g., `def func() -> bool:`), using type comments is still valid and useful for compatibility with older codebases or in situations where inline hints might not be practical. - **Tool Support**: Tools like `mypy` can read these comments and use them for type checking. This can help catch type-related errors early in the development process, contributing to more robust and less error-prone code. # Example with Inline Type Hints for Comparison: For comparison, here’s how you could write the same function using Python 3.5+ inline type hints: ```python def func() -> bool: return False ``` This newer syntax is more direct and integrates seamlessly into the language, making the code more readable and concise. However, the choice between using type comments and inline type hints can depend on your project\'s requirements, including compatibility with older Python versions and consistency with existing code style."},{"prompt":"```def func(arg1, arg2): # type: bool return arg1 > 0 and arg2.islower()``` will return error","completion":"Yes, you are correct. The syntax you\'ve presented with the type comment is indeed incorrect and would not be interpreted as valid by type checkers like `mypy` because it does not adhere to the format expected for type comments on functions as specified by PEP 484. Here\'s a breakdown of the issue and the correct approach. # Incorrect Usage: ```python def func(arg1, arg2): # type: bool return arg1 > 0 and arg2.islower() ``` In this example, the type comment `# type: bool` incorrectly suggests that it\'s annotating a type for something immediately following, which is not how type comments are used for function signature annotations in Python. This line is likely to be disregarded or cause confusion for type checkers and human readers alike because it does not specify types for `arg1` and `arg2`, nor does it properly annotate the return type following the correct syntax. # Correct Syntax for Function Type Comments: The correct way to use a type comment in a Python function, to denote both the argument types and the return type, would look something like this, assuming `arg1` is an integer and `arg2` is a string: ```python def func(arg1, arg2): # type: (int, str) -> bool return arg1 > 0 and arg2.islower() ``` This correctly indicates that `func` takes two arguments (`arg1` of type `int` and `arg2` of type `str`) and returns a `bool` value. # Modern Python Syntax: For completeness, in modern Python versions (3.5+), you would ideally use native type hints (annotations) directly in the function signature: ```python def func(arg1: int, arg2: str) -> bool: return arg1 > 0 and arg2.islower() ``` This approach integrates cleanly with the language, providing a more readable and concise way to specify type information, which is directly supported by the Python runtime and static type checkers. # Conclusion: The initial example you provided would indeed not be recognized correctly by tools or treated as intended for specifying the function\'s argument and return types. Using the corrected formats as shown would avoid such issues, ensuring your code benefits from static type checking to catch type-related errors early and improve overall code reliability and maintainability."},{"prompt":"will python interpreter will raise error for incorrect type coment","completion":"No, the Python interpreter will not raise an error for an incorrectly formatted type comment. Type comments, like all comments in Python, are ignored by the Python interpreter during execution. Their primary purpose is for static type checking (using tools like `mypy`) and for documentation purposes. This means that you can have syntactically incorrect type comments in your Python code, and the interpreter will still run the code without complaining about those comments. # Why Python Ignores Comments Including Type Comments: - **Comments are for humans, not machines**: The primary design of comments is to allow developers to write notes, explanations, or annotations that are not intended to be executed or interpreted by the compiler/interpreter. This principle applies across many programming languages, not just Python. - **Type comments are a convention, not a syntax**: The PEP 484 type hinting via comments is a convention understood by humans and specific tools designed to look for and interpret these patterns. The Python interpreter itself does not look for type hints in comments. It runs the code as if the comments were not there. # Implications: - **Code will run regardless of type comment correctness**: Your Python code, including functions with incorrectly formatted type comments, will execute normally unless there is an actual syntax or runtime error unrelated to comments. - **Static type checkers rely on correct format**: Tools like `mypy` that are designed to use these comments for type checking will require them to be correctly formatted to understand and check the types as intended. If the format is incorrect, `mypy` and similar tools may ignore the type comment or report an error regarding the type hinting, but this does not affect the runtime behavior of the program. - **Maintenance and clarity**: While the interpreter may ignore incorrect type comments, they can lead to confusion for developers trying to understand or maintain the code. Incorrect or misleading comments can degrade the readability and maintainability of the codebase. # Example: ```python def func(arg1, arg2): # type: bol # Incorrect type comment, Python interpreter ignores this. return arg1 > 0 and arg2.islower() ``` In the example above, even though the type comment is incorrect (`bol` instead of `bool`), the Python interpreter will execute the `func` function without errors, assuming `arg1` and `arg2` support the `>` and `islower()` operations, respectively. To benefit from type checks, always ensure that type comments follow the correct syntax and semantics expected by static type checkers and that your code follows Python\'s syntax rules."},{"prompt":"write a website for blogging , make it more professional , add dark mode and light mode , make it fully responsive","completion":"Creating a professional blogging website with light and dark mode features, along with a fully responsive design, requires a blend of front-end and back-end technologies.

His face was a testament to the years spent in service, bearing scars both physical and hidden. \\"We\'ve decrypted the Lemurian microchips. Batlantis tech will leap generations forward,\\" he announced, his voice grim. Across the multi-dimensional rift, in a grand chamber adorned with ancient symbols and pulsating with magical energy, stood Princess Ainess Synclavia. \\"With Artemis\' betrayal, our victory is assured. Prepare the brigands. We will bring Lemuria to its knees,\\" she proclaimed, her gaze fierce with determination. --- **Act II: Lemuria\'s Last Stand** In the depths of the NSA\'s secretive Third Echelon facility, operative Sam Fisher reviewed files on the Batlantis forces. \\"They\'ve got magic and tech combined. Never seen anything like it,\\" he muttered, loading his weapon. Meanwhile, the Ghosts, led by Captain Mitchell, parachuted into the night, their target: a former US base now under IBAF control. \\"Remember, people, silence is our ally. Take out their comms first,\\" Mitchell whispered, his team vanishing into the darkness. In a parallel effort, Cordis Die and DedSec hackers worked feverishly. \\"We need to show the world the truth. Batlantis must be exposed,\\" one hacker exclaimed, fingers flying over the keyboard. --- **Act III: The Counterattack** As dawn crept into the sky, a series of coordinated strikes began. The Ghosts hit IBAF positions hard, their precision and stealth turning the tide. Third Echelon operatives dismantled Batlantis\' information operations, crippling their command and control. \\"Artemis thought they could control this war. Time to show them they\'re wrong,\\" murmured Hayes, as his Artemis fleet turned guns against the advancing Batlantis ships, betraying their former allies. Amidst this chaos, the superpowers of Lemuria unleashed their WMDs, targeting the Batlantis invasion force. The world believed it was witnessing the onset of World War III, when in fact, it was the final stand of Lemuria against a threat from another world. In the Enclave\'s secure bunker, President Richardson convened with his council. \\"We may have to retreat to the Megafloats, but Lemuria will not fall quietly,\\" he declared, his voice echoing with defiance. --- **Act IV: The Exodus and the Resistance** The aftermath was apocalyptic. Much of Lemuria lay in ruins, its people fleeing to the Megafloats. But from the ashes rose a new resolve. The combined forces of Lemuria, the Ghosts, Third Echelon, and the betrayers from Artemis Global Security, now fought not just for their homes but for the future of their world. Princess Ainess, watching from her command ship, felt a twinge of doubt for the first time. \\"This war... what have we truly unleashed?\\" she pondered, looking at the destruction below. --- **Epilogue: An Uncertain Future** Years passed. The Megafloats became new bastions of hope, thriving on the seas, as Lemuria and Batlantis reached an uneasy truce. Ainess, transformed by the war, sought to rebuild her empire, not with conquest, but through peace and understanding. And as for the Lemurians, led by the Ghosts, Third Echelon, and the remnants of Artemis, they kept vigilant, knowing that the threat could one day return. But for now, they worked towards reconstruction and peace, knowing the true cost of war. Conflict had brought two worlds to the brink, but in its aftermath, there was a chance for a new beginning, grounded in mutual respect and shared vigilance against the darkness that had once threatened to consume them all. --- *Shadow Frontiers: The Lemuria-Batlantis Conflict* closes on a note of cautious optimism, the characters and factions forever changed, yet united by a common goal: to ensure such a conflict never endangers their worlds again."},{"prompt":"Soft and hard science fiction","completion":"Soft and hard science fiction are two subgenres of science fiction (SF) that reflect different approaches to the science and speculative elements within their stories. Both forms offer unique narratives and worldviews, exploring various aspects of human experience, technology, and the universe. Here\'s a closer look at each: # Hard Science Fiction Hard science fiction emphasizes scientific accuracy, logic, and technical detail. It is founded on real scientific concepts, theories, and principles, or on careful extrapolation of such knowledge into the future. Hard SF writers often meticulously research their topics to ensure their storytelling aligns with current understanding of physics, chemistry, biology, and astronomy, among others. This genre appeals particularly to readers who appreciate a strong foundation in real science alongside their fiction. Classic examples of hard science fiction authors include Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, and more recently, authors like Kim Stanley Robinson and Alastair Reynolds. Key characteristics of hard science fiction include: - A focus on science and technology as central to the plot. - Plausible technological advancements and discoveries. - Detailed exploration of space, the laws of nature, and the universe. - Use of technical language to describe inventions and phenomena. # Soft Science Fiction Soft science fiction, on the other hand, focuses more on social sciences, such as psychology, sociology, politics, and anthropology. While it might still feature science and technology, the emphasis is on human behavior, social structures, and speculative societies. Soft SF is less concerned with the technical details and accuracy of the science involved, and more with exploring themes of human experience, social commentary, and speculative societal evolution. It often delves into philosophical, moral, and ethical questions raised by speculative scenarios. Famous soft SF writers include Ursula K. Le Guin, Margaret Atwood, and Philip K. Dick. Key characteristics of soft science fiction include: - Emphasis on human-centered stories and social themes. - Exploration of speculative societies and their implications. - Less focus on technical detail and more on narrative and character development. - Engagement with ethical, cultural, and moral considerations. # Blending the Two While the distinction between hard and soft science fiction is useful for categorization, many works blend elements of both, creating rich and nuanced narratives that explore both the scientific and the social. Some stories might have a hard science fiction setting but delve deeply into social and ethical issues, or they might present a soft science fiction society with rigorous attention to scientific plausibility in its background. This interplay allows SF writers to explore a wide range of questions, from the deeply technical to the profoundly human. # Conclusion Whether through the lens of hard science fiction with its rigorous attention to the laws of nature and scientific plausibility or through soft science fiction\'s focus on society, psychology, and human behavior, science fiction serves as a versatile medium for exploring complex ideas, potential futures, and the unending question of \\"What if?\\". Both subgenres offer valuable perspectives, highlighting not only where humanity might go but also what it means to be human."},{"prompt":"Instead of hard science fiction, focus on science reality with extreme demon difficulty","completion":"Focusing on \\"science reality\\" with an \\"extreme demon difficulty\\" suggests delving into real scientific challenges or phenomena that present significant difficulty or complexity, akin to the highest levels of challenge one might encounter in a game or theoretical problem. This concept can be explored across various disciplines of science, each presenting its own formidable challenges. Examples include physics (e.g., quantum mechanics, general relativity), biology (e.g., curing complex diseases), and environmental science (e.g., climate change solutions). Here\'s a look at some areas within science reality where the complexity and difficulty level can be considered extreme: # Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity The reconciliation of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains one of the most profound challenges in contemporary physics. Quantum mechanics governs the world of the very small, explaining the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels. General relativity, on the other hand, is a theory of gravitation that describes the universe on a much larger scale, including the dynamics of galaxies and the universe itself. Despite their individual successes, these two theories are fundamentally incompatible in certain contexts, such as within black holes or at the time of the Big Bang. The search for a \\"theory of everything\\" that can seamlessly integrate both frameworks is a monumental task facing physicists today. # Curing Complex Diseases In the realm of biology and medicine, curing complex diseases like Alzheimer\'s, cancer, and HIV/AIDS represents a significant challenge. These diseases have eluded definitive cures for various reasons, including their ability to mutate (in the case of HIV), the complexity of their interaction with human biology (as with cancer\'s many forms and its ability to resist treatment), and incomplete understanding of their mechanisms (such as the brain\'s functioning in Alzheimer\'s disease). Advancements in genetic engineering, immunotherapy, and personalized medicine offer hopeful approaches, but the path to cures is fraught with scientific and ethical complexities. # Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability Addressing climate change and achieving environmental sustainability are perhaps among the most significant and complex challenges humanity faces today. The intricate interplay between natural ecosystems, human activity, and global climate systems creates a scenario of \\"extreme demon difficulty\\" in which solutions must be multifaceted, involving changes in technology, policy, and human behavior on a global scale. Efforts range from reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources to developing technologies for carbon capture and storage, alongside conservation efforts to protect biodiversity and ecosystems. # Artificial Intelligence and Ethics The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies presents a complex set of challenges, not only in the technical and developmental aspects but also in ethical considerations. Developing AI that is both powerful and beneficial to humanity, while avoiding potential pitfalls like loss of privacy, job displacement, and the creation of autonomous weapons, requires careful navigation. The development of ethical AI that aligns with human values and can make decisions in complex, unpredictable situations adds another layer of extreme difficulty to the field. # Conclusion In each of these areas, the \\"extreme demon difficulty\\" arises from the complexity of the systems involved, the limits of current understanding or technology, and the profound implications for humanity and the planet. Overcoming these challenges necessitates not only advancements in scientific knowledge and technology but also comprehensive ethical considerations and global cooperation.

Here, the `main` function does the following: 1. **Initialization**: It initializes variables for storing results and loop counters, reads an array of double words (32-bit unsigned integers) `v8` from a function `sub_11C9`, which presumably does some initialization based on the program\'s arguments. The specifics of `sub_11C9`, `sub_1697`, and `sub_160A` are not provided. The use of `__readfsqword(0x28u)` suggests it\'s storing a canary for stack smashing protection. 2. **Input From User**: It asks the user to supply a \\"code to execute\\" via stdin, stored in `flag_val`. 3. **Validation**: It checks if the length of the input is a multiple of 8. If not, it prints \\"Invalid code.\\" and exits. This implies that the expected input should be divisible by 8, hinting that the input might represent opcodes or instructions in a hexadecimal format, each 8 characters (representing 4 bytes or 32 bits) long. 4. **Execution Simulation**: The input length is divided by 8 to get the number of opcodes (`v6`). It then iterates through each opcode, performing the following actions: - Extracts 8 characters (4 bytes) at a time from `flag_val`, converts these characters from hexadecimal to an integer `v7`, and uses a `switch-case` structure based on the loop counter `i` (acting as an opcode index), to perform checks on `v7`. These checks involve bitwise AND operations with specific masks and comparisons to hardcoded values. - Depending on the outcome of these checks for specific cases (0 to 4), it may call `sub_1697()` and exit. - If the opcode\'s value (`v7 & 0xFFF`) is greater than 256 (`0x100`), it prints a message; otherwise it calls `sub_160A(v8, v7)` with the current opcode, possibly to simulate or execute it. 5. **Final Check**: After all opcodes are processed, `sub_125C(v8)` is called (purpose unknown without further context). It then checks if certain conditions are met within the presumably modified `v8` array: - If `*v8 == 512`, `v8[1] == -1`, `v8[2] == -1`, `v8[3] == 0`, `v8[12] == 0x10000000`, and exactly 5 opcodes were provided (`v6 == 5`), it prints a congratulatory message along with the flag format `HTB{%s}`, where `%s` is replaced by `flag_val`. This program appears to simulate a simple virtual machine or interpreter that executes a series of predefined operations or \\"opcodes\\" provided by the user as a hexadecimal string. The goal for the user (or attacker) is to craft an input (a series of opcodes) that passes all the checks, thus printing out the \\"right answer\\" message, which includes the flag for the challenge formatted as `HTB{user_provided_input}`. The specific opcodes and their required formats/values are determined by the checks in the `switch-case` and the final validation step."},{"prompt":"i have a hint for this challenge but i\'m unable to recover correct instructions -> reg_a should be equal to 0x200 reg_b should be equal to -1 reg_c should be equal to -1 reg_d should be equal to 0 flags should be set to 0x10000000 just meet this conditions, you can grab the flag 0: opcode=02 always=1 dst_reg=0(a) irflag=0 imm_or_src_reg=100 add a, 256 1: opcode=02 always=1 dst_reg=0(a) irflag=0 imm_or_src_reg=100 add a, 256 2: opcode=03 always=1 dst_reg=1(b) irflag=0 imm_or_src_reg=001 sub b, 1 3: opcode=01 always=1 dst_reg=2(c) irflag=1 imm_or_src_reg=100 mov c, b 4: opcode=04 always=1 dst_reg=3(d) irflag=0 imm_or_src_reg=000 cmp d, 0 concatenate the encoded instructions into one line, that will be your flag.","completion":"Given the hint and the requirements for the registers and flags at the end of the execution, you need to construct your flag by encoding each instruction based on the provided format. Let\'s analyze and encode each instruction based on the opcode format you\'ve given: 1. Opcode = 02 (Add) - always = 1 - dst_reg = 0 (a) - irflag = 0 - imm_or_src_reg = 100 (256 in decimal) Encoded as hexadecimal: - opcode = 02 => 20 (high nibble indicates the opcode, followed by the flags) - dst_reg = 0 => 0 - irflag = 0 => 0 - imm_or_src_reg = 100 (hex) => 100 The first instruction encoded: `02000100` 2. The second instruction is identical to the first: - Encoded: `02000100` 3. Opcode = 03 (Sub) - always = 1 - dst_reg = 1 (b) - irflag = 0 - imm_or_src_reg = 001 (1 in decimal) Encoded as hexadecimal: - opcode = 03 => 30 - dst_reg = 1 => 1 - irflag = 0 => 0 - imm_or_src_reg = 001 The third instruction encoded: `03010001` 4. Opcode = 01 (Mov) - always = 1 - dst_reg = 2 (c) - irflag = 1 (move from register b to c) - imm_or_src_reg = 100 (actually, since irflag=1, this means it\'s taking the value from register, not immediate. So, this part is influenced by `irflag` and `dst_reg`) Given the description, the intended operation seems to misinterpret the hint. Based on the goal to set `reg_c` to -1 (via copying `reg_b`), the encoded instruction based on the information would aim to make that copy. Assuming an oversight in instruction conversion: Encoded as hexadecimal: - opcode = 01 => 10 - dst_reg = 2 => 2 - irflag = 1 => 1 (denoting operation with register) - Due to ambiguity in instruction: assuming copying from `b` Likely intended instruction encoded might aim for copying operation, e.g., `0102xxxx`. Yet, clarification is needed since `imm_or_src_reg` handling under `irflag=1` seems atypical for the `mov` operation. 5. Opcode = 04 (Cmp) - always = 1 - dst_reg = 3 (d) - irflag = 0 - imm_or_src_reg = 000 (0 in decimal) Encoded as hexadecimal: - opcode = 04 => 40 - dst_reg = 3 => 3 - irflag = 0 => 0 - imm_or_src_reg = 000 The fifth instruction encoded: `04030000` Combining the encoded instructions into one line (and resolving the confusion in step 4 with an assumed or clarified encoding), the flag would be generated from these. Assuming the example placeholders were resolved correctly, aligning with actual opcode functionalities: `02000100020001000301000104030000` However, notice the ambiguity and potential contradiction in interpreting the 4th instruction\'s requirements. If the task hinges closely on meeting preconditions (e.g., `reg_a` to `0x200`, handling flags), an exact encoding will reflect operational specifics not fully covered in the provided details. Therefore, double-check how an instruction\'s fields (`opcode`, `always`, `dst_reg`, `irflag`, `imm_or_src_reg`) should be encoded, particularly when `irflag=1`. The demonstration above applies typical interpretations which may require adjustments according to the challenge\'s exact encoding logic."},{"prompt":"opcodes seems to be executing fine. but at the end i have \\"Executing 4 opcodes. Invalid value.: Success\\" ??","completion":"If you\'re encountering a message like \\"Executing 4 opcodes. Invalid value.: Success\\" after seemingly correctly encoding and providing opcodes as per the challenge specification, several points could be at play. This type of message typically arises when there are discrepancies between expected input format or values and what has been actually provided. Given your situation, let\'s explore potential issues and their solutions: # 1. Incorrect Number of Opcodes The message indicates that the program is executing only four opcodes, whereas based on your earlier information, five opcodes are expected to meet the conditions for success. This discrepancy can happen if: - There\'s a formatting error in your input, leading the program to misinterpret the number of opcodes. - A null character (`0`), newline, or some other character inadvertently truncates your input. **Solution:** Ensure your input string is correctly formed, containing exactly five opcodes without any intervening or terminating characters that could be mistakenly interpreted as end-of-input. # 2. Opcode Formatting or Encoding Issue A mistake in the opcode encoding, like an incorrect hexadecimal representation, could lead to unexpected behavior. For instance, an error in the fourth opcode\'s details might either cause it not to be recognized as a valid instruction or to trigger an error in the program execution logic. **Solution:** Double-check the hexadecimal representation of each opcode to ensure they match the expected format accurately. Remember, each instruction\'s format needs to be consistent with how the program decodes these instructions. # 3. Buffer Overflow or Underflow If the program expects a specific input length and you\'re off, even by a single character, it could read incorrect data for the fifth opcode or disregard it altogether. **Solution:** Verify the lengths of your strings and arrays, ensuring they align exactly with what the program expects. This includes the overall length of the opcode string and the individual lengths of each opcode segment. # 4. Misinterpretation of Instructions There might be a need for a clearer understanding or reinterpretation of the provided instructions, especially regarding the final condition checks within the program. For instance, an incorrectly encoded opcode that does not change the expected register or flag values as intended could lead to failure in validation checks. **Solution:** Re-examine the logical conditions required for each registry and flag setting. Make sure each opcode logically leads to the desired state by the end of its execution. # Troubleshooting Steps Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue: - **Review Opcode Encoding:** Re-examine your opcode encoding process to ensure accuracy. - **Input Verification:** Ensure the entire opcode string is input correctly without unintended characters. - **Debug Prints:** If possible, add debug print statements in the code (or use debugging tools) to trace how each opcode is being interpreted and executed. This can help identify at what point things diverge from expectations. - **Consult Documentation:** If there\'s documentation or additional hints available for the challenge, review them. Sometimes, subtle requirements can be overlooked on the first pass. Without the exact specifications of the opcode format and the program logic for their processing, these suggestions aim to cover common pitfalls. Ensure your opcode string format and each opcode precisely meet the expected criteria laid out in the challenge description."},{"prompt":"Propper opcodes is actually 02100100 02100100 03110001 and so on","completion":"Given your correction to the opcodes and taking into account the provided hint that you are aiming to set specific register values to meet the challenge conditions, let\'s go over your opcode specifications again to ensure they align with the goal and correctly form the flag. # Understanding the Opcode and Its Structure Based on your correction: 1. **`02100100` (Opcode for `add a, 256`):** - Opcode `02` is for an `add` operation. - The next part, `1`, indicates it\'s always executed. - The destination register is indicated by `0` (for register `a`). - The immediate value to add is `0100`, which is `256` in decimal. 2. **Repeated `02100100` (Opcode for `add a, 256` again):** - You\'re performing the same operation twice to ensure `reg_a` equals `512` (`0x200`), satisfying one of the challenge requirements. 3. **`03110001` (Opcode for `sub b, 1`):** - Opcode `03` is for a `sub` (subtract) operation. - As with the `add` operation, `1` indicates the opcode is always executed. - The destination register for this operation is `1` (for register `b`). - The immediate value to subtract is `0001` (`1` in decimal), setting `reg_b` to `-1` assuming it starts from `0`. Your message cuts off after these, but to continue with the logic you\'ve established and to meet the initially stated requirements, let\'s deduce the necessary next opcodes: 4. **To move `-1` into `reg_c`,** given no direct move operation was indicated, we can assume using previously established opcodes or potentially introducing a new form of move operation would be necessary. Given the initial goal, one might expect a `mov` opcode. Since you haven\'t provided it, we\'ll work with what we have – assume a subtraction that results in `reg_c` being `-1` as well, similar to how `reg_b` was set. 5. **And to make `reg_d` equal to `0` and set flags to `0x10000000`,** we lack a specific opcode structure based on your message. Typically, ensuring `reg_d` remains or is set to `0` could involve a reset or compare operation that doesn\'t alter its value, while setting specific flags could involve operations that result in conditions changing the processor\'s flags accordingly. # Putting It All Together The given opcodes and your scenario hint towards a challenge where manipulating register values via arithmetic or logical operations is key. Without complete opcode information, especially for steps 4 and beyond, we would encourage focusing on: 1. **Ensuring the opcode structure is fully understood**, particularly how immediate values are encoded and which operations can affect flags directly. 2. **Verifying all requirements are met** at the challenge\'s end - here, that involves `reg_a` being `0x200`, `reg_b` and `reg_c` being `-1`, `reg_d` being `0`, and certain flags being set. Meeting these conditions likely involves a combination of add, subtract, perhaps compare, and potentially direct move operations if available within your challenge\'s instruction set. For crafting a complete and valid flag, you\'d typically concatenate the correctly encoded instructions that fulfill all the challenge\'s conditions. If \\"and so on\\" implies there are more instructions to follow in the pattern you\'ve started, it will be crucial to continue with the same logical approach: encoding operations that increment, decrement, or directly set register values as needed. Given the opcodes you\'ve provided and aiming to meet the challenge requirements, the opcodes should directly manipulate the registers and flags per the game\'s rules. If additional operations are needed but not specified (like directly setting `reg_c` or modifying flags), you\'ll need to infer or discover the appropriate opcode formats for those from the challenge instructions or by understanding the virtual machine, processor, or environment these opcodes are intended for."},{"prompt":"Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere Are they increasing or decreasing?

The script uses mathematical formulas to smooth price data and aims to highlight market trends more distinctly. Let\'s break down key aspects of the script and the mathematical principles involved: # 1. **Understanding the Gaussian Filter** A Gaussian Filter is essentially a way of smoothing data. In the context of financial market analysis, it\'s applied to price data to help identify the underlying trend by filtering out noise. The filter is based on the Gaussian (normal) distribution, and its application multiple times (as indicated in the script) is akin to applying an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) multiple times. # 2. **Key Inputs and Parameters** - **Source (`src`):** The price data to be filtered, typically a composite of the high, low, and close prices. - **Poles (`N`):** Determines the filter\'s smoothing strength. More poles result in smoother but laggier data. - **Sampling Period (`per`):** The period over which calculations are performed. - **True Range Multiplier (`mult`):** Scales the filtered true range to adjust the channel\'s width. - **Reduced Lag and Fast Response Modes:** Options to modify the calculation for reduced lag or a faster response by adjusting the input data. # 3. **Calculations** - **Beta and Alpha:** The script calculates these coefficients to determine the weighting factors in the filter\'s formula. Beta is derived using trigonometric operations and the specified period, while Alpha adjusts the weighting to control the smoothing effect. - **Lag Reduction:** By potentially adding the difference between the current data point and a lagged version of itself, this technique aims to make the indicator more responsive. - **Poles and Filtering:** The number of poles dictates how many times the filtering operation is applied. More poles mean more smoothing but also more lag. The script employs a recursive function to apply this filtering based on the alpha coefficient and the specified number of poles. # 4. **Generating the Channel** The filtered price data creates the central line of the channel. The script then calculates a \\"Filtered True Range\\" using the same filtering technique on the true range of the price data, which it scales with a multiplier. This filtered true range is added to and subtracted from the central line to form the upper and lower bounds of the channel. # 5. **Visual Representation** - **Indicator Plots:** The filtered data (as the middle line of the channel) and the upper and lower bounds are plotted on the chart. - **Coloring:** The script changes the color of the plots and bar charts based on the position of the price relative to the channel and its previous value, indicating bullish or bearish conditions. # 6. **Mathematical Intricacies** - The core mathematical concept here revolves around recursive filtering, wherein the output involves prior outputs (feedback) to adjust current and future values dynamically. - The calculation of beta and alpha is significant because it sets the foundation for how the subsequent filtering behaves, affecting responsiveness to price changes and overall smoothness. - The use of trigonometric functions and exponents is crucial for determining the weights in the filter formula, enabling the smooth transition of data points across the period. In essence, this script offers a sophisticated way of analyzing price trends through a dynamically adjustable Gaussian Filter, which traders can tune according to their preferences for smoothness, responsiveness, and lag."},{"prompt":"give me examples of this in action and show me also in the code - The use of trigonometric functions and exponents is crucial for determining the weights in the filter formula, enabling the smooth transition of data points across the period.","completion":"The pivotal role of trigonometric functions and exponents in this script lies in the calculation of the coefficients `beta` and `alpha`, which are subsequently used to determine the weights in the Gaussian Filter formula. These calculations directly influence how the price data is smoothed and how responsive the filter is to market changes. Let\'s dive into the specific lines of code where this occurs and discuss a hypothetical example to illustrate their impact. # Code Snippets The key lines from the script related to the trigonometric and exponential calculations are: ```pinescript // Beta and Alpha Components beta = (1 - cos(4asin(1)/per)) / (pow(1.414, 2/N) - 1) alpha = - beta + sqrt(pow(beta, 2) + 2beta) ``` Here: 1. **Trigonometric Functions:** `cos(4asin(1)/per)` is a way to calculate cosines based on the sampling period. The expression `4*asin(1)` is a creative method to compute (2pi) (since (sin(frac{pi}{2}) = 1) and (4 times frac{pi}{2} = 2pi), which gives the full circle in radians, a clever workaround using available Pine Script functions). 2. **Exponential Functions:** `pow(1.414, 2/N)` computes the exponentiation involved in the formula. The number 1.414 is the square root of 2, often used in signal processing for filter design, indicating how rapidly the filter\'s response decays. Adjusting `N`, the number of poles, modifies the filter\'s sharpness and lag characteristics by changing this exponential term. # Hypothetical Example Imagine we\'re applying this filter to a simple dataset representing closing prices over a 10-day period, and we\'re looking to smooth this data to identify underlying trends. We\'ll consider a sampling period (`per`) of 10 days and use 4 poles (`N = 4`). The choices of `beta` and `alpha` will directly influence the smoothness and responsiveness of the resulting filter. 1. With `per = 10` and `N = 4`, the formula for `beta` incorporates both a trigonometric calculation (`cos(4asin(1)/10)`) to introduce a cyclic component based on the period and an exponential component (`pow(1.414, 2/4)`) to control decay rate or responsiveness. 2. For `alpha`, combining `beta` with a square root operation and additional arithmetic alters the balance between responsiveness and smoothing. A higher `beta` results in a lower `alpha`, which means more smoothing but less responsiveness to recent changes. This nuanced balance helps tailor the Gaussian Filter to the specific characteristics of financial data, where recognizing both long-term trends and not ignoring short-term fluctuations can be crucial for successful trading strategies. By adjusting `per` and `N`, traders can see real-time changes in how the filter processes price data on a graph. For instance, reducing `N` to 2 would make the filter respond more quickly to price changes but at the expense of introducing more noise. Conversely, increasing `N` to, say, 6 would enhance smoothing, potentially creating a cleaner signal of the underlying trend but with added latency, which could delay the recognition of trend reversals. This interplay, facilitated by the trigonometric and exponential calculations, essentially allows traders to fine-tune the indicator to match their specific trading horizons and risk appetites, showcasing the flexibility and depth of analysis possible with relatively concise scripting in Pine Script."},{"prompt":"Write a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled military thriller, tactical military

Around the polished oak table sat a mismatched group - military brass from the United States, covert operatives from Third Echelon, and representatives from both Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six units. The air was tense, each person fully aware of the magnitude of the situation. \\"We\'re facing an unprecedented threat,\\" started General Baker, his face etched with lines of worry. \\"The Batlantis Empire has not only breached our defenses but has also managed to gain ground on key locations within our territory.\\" Across the table, Sam Fisher of Third Echelon shifted, his gaze hard. \\"Our SIGINT capabilities have been hampered by their magic-tech. They\'re utilizing something far beyond our understanding of cyber warfare.\\" Meanwhile, in the shadowy underbelly of a commandeered US base, a clandestine meeting between the Batlantis imperials and their unexpected allies was unfolding. Ainess Synclavia, despite her usual regal posture, leaned forward, her eyes shimmering with a fierce determination. \\"We appreciate your... cooperation,\\" she said, addressing an assembly that included the Ultranationalists and remnants of Cordis Die. Her voice was laced with both contempt and necessity. \\"Our goals align for now, princess,\\" sneered a rugged figure adorned with the insignia of the Ultranationalists. \\"But remember, we expect Batlantis to uphold its end of the bargain.\\" Back on the Megafloats, Delta Company prepared for an op that could turn the tide of this covert war. Captain Mitchell, known amongst his peers as one of the Ghosts, was briefing his squad. Each member was suited in newly developed combat exoskeletons, their faces grim yet determined. \\"Our mission is to infiltrate the IBAF’s primary command center and extract any intel on their next move,\\" Mitchell explained. \\"This operation is off the books, and failure is not an option.\\" The scene shifted rapidly to Artemis Global Security\'s head office, where CEO Adrian DeWinter was seen discussing a particularly troubling aspect of their deal with Batlantis. \\"We\'ve helped them decipher Lemuria\'s tech, yet they demand more. Be prepared; we may soon find ourselves expendable in their eyes.\\" As the narrative unfolded across continents, DedSec was racing against time, their fingers flying across keyboards in a desperate attempt to pierce through Batlantis\' magically enhanced cybersecurity. Their goal was clear: expose the truth to the world before it was too late. In an unexpected turn of events, elements from various factions found themselves in a temporary alliance, driven by the overarching goal of thwarting Batlantis\' expansionism. Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, and even rogue members from Artemis and DedSec converged on a Batlantis stronghold, leading to a heart-stopping showdown. The battles were fierce, marked by the clashing of futuristic weaponry against the arcane might of Batlantis. Through sheer grit and an unshakable will to protect their homes and loved ones, the coalition managed to secure a crucial victory, but at a great cost. In the aftermath, under the scorched skies of a battered Lemuria, representatives from the various factions gathered. The mood was somber yet hopeful as they began to discuss the formation of a new alliance, one that could safeguard their world against threats from any realm.
