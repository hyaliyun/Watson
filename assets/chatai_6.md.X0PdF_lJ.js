Since (AOC) is an isosceles triangle with (OA = OC = R) (where (R) is the circumradius of (Gamma)), the altitude from (O) to the base (AC) is also the angle bisector of (widehat{AOC}). - **Step 2:** Identify the required angles. We need to show that (widehat{AOD} = frac{widehat{AOC}}{2}). - **Step 3:** Use inscribed angles. By the property of inscribed angles in a circle, (widehat{AOD}) subtends the same arc as (widehat{ABD}). Therefore, we have: [ widehat{AOD} = widehat{ABD} = widehat{ABC} ] - **Step 4:** Relate angles at the center and the circumference.

According to the given information, the cost of one pen and one pencil is in the ratio of 5:1. This means that if the cost of one pen is 5 units, the cost of one pencil is 1 unit. Since we are given that the cost of one pen is Rs. 65, we can write: P = 5 units C = 1 unit Since P is Rs. 65, we can say that 5 units = Rs. 65. Therefore, 1 unit = Rs. 65 / 5 = Rs. 13. Now we know the cost of one pencil (C) is 1 unit, which is Rs. 13. The cost of some pens and 5 pencils is Rs. 260. Let's assume the number of pens is x. Then the total cost of x pens and 5 pencils can be written as: Total cost = x * P + 5 * C Rs. 260 = x * Rs. 65 + 5 * Rs. 13 Now we can solve for x: Rs. 260 = x * Rs. 65 + 5 * Rs. 13 Rs. 260 = x * Rs. 65 + Rs. 65 Rs. 260 - Rs. 65 = x * Rs. 65 Rs. 195 = x * Rs. 65 x = Rs. 195 / Rs. 65 x = 3 So, there are 3 pens.

The derivative is f'(x)=-frac{a}{x^2}. For f'(x)<0, we need a>0. This is because a negative divided by a positive is negative, and we want the derivative to be negative to ensure the function is decreasing. 2. **For xleq1, the function is f(x)=(2-a)x+3.** Similarly, for this part to be decreasing, its derivative, which is 2-a, must be less than 0. Thus, we have 2-a<0, which simplifies to a>2. 3. **Ensuring continuity and monotonicity at x=1.** At x=1, both parts of the function should give the same value for f(x) to be continuous. Thus, we equate frac{a}{1} from the first part to (2-a)cdot1+3 from the second part. This gives us a=2-a+3. Simplifying, we get 2a=5, which leads to a=frac{5}{2}. This ensures that the function is continuous at x=1 and matches the decreasing trend on either side of x=1. Combining these conditions, we find that a must satisfy both a>0 and a>2 to ensure the function is decreasing for x>1, and aleqfrac{5}{2} to ensure continuity and the decreasing nature at x=1.

Set x=0 and y=1 in the given functional equation: (f(0) + 1)(f(-1) + 1) = f(0) Let's denote f(0) = c. This equation can be written as: (c + 1)(f(-1) + 1) = c 2. To explore further properties, let's set y = -f(x). This assumption implies that there exists some a in mathbb{R} such that f(a) = 0 because f(x) + (-f(x)) = 0. 3. Substitute x = a and y = 0 into the functional equation: 0 = f(f(a f(a + 1))) Since f(a) = 0, this simplifies to: 0 = f(0) = c implies c = 0 implies f(0) = 0 4. Now set x = a and y = a + 1 in the original equation: (0 + a + 1)(f(-1) + 1) = f(f(a f(a + 1))) = 0 5. For a neq -1, this yields: (a + 1)(f(-1) + 1) = 0 6. Since a + 1 neq 0, it follows that: f(-1) = -1 7. Insert f(-1) = -1 back into the equation we obtained previously: f(0) = 0 8. Next, consider the equation for y f(-y) + y = (y - 1)(f(-1 - y) + 1). Let y = -f(x) in this form: -f(x)f(f(x))-f(x)=f(-(x+1)f(-f(x)-1)) 9. Replace y with -y in: y f(y) = y f(y-1) + f(y-1) + 1 ; text {with ;} ; y=0, y=1 This implies: f(x)^2 + f(x) = f(f(x f(x+1))) (f(x)+1)(f(x-1)+1) implies f(x)^2 = f(x)f(x-1) + f(x-1)+1 10. Subtract the last two derived equations, we get: f(x)^2 - x f(x) = f(x) f(x-1) - x f(x-1) Rightarrow (f(x) - x)(f(x) - f(x-1)) = 0 11. Showing that for any real x, f(x) ≠ f(x-1) implies f(x) = x. To prove f is injective... 12. Let a be any zero of f. Set x = 0 and y = a + 1: (a + 1)(f(-a - 1) + 1) = 0 13. By the same reasoning, let's have f(-a - 1) = -1. Replace x = 0 and y = -a: -a = f(a f(-a - 1)) = f(-a) 14. Replace x = -1 and y = -a: (-1 - a)(f(a - 1) + 1) = f(a f(-a - 1)) = f(-a) = -a Rightarrow f(a - 1) = frac{-1}{1 + a} since a ≠ -1. Then setting x = a - 1, y = 0, we obtain: frac{1}{(a + 1)^2} - frac{1}{a + 1} = 0 Rightarrow a = 0 Consequently, 0 is the only zero of f, indicating f is injective at 0. 15. Thus, when y = -f(x), 0 = f(f(x f(x + 1)) + f(x) f(-f(x) - 1)) implies f(x f(x + 1)) = -f(x)f(-f(x) - 1) 16. Setting x = y - 1, 0 = f(f((y - 1) f(y)) - y f(y - 1)) Rightarrow f((y - 1) f(y)) = y f(y - 1) Rightarrow f(y f(y + 1)) = (y + 1) f(y), Comparing these equations we get: (y + 1) f(y) = -f(y) f(-f(y) - 1) 17. For y ≠ 0, truncating f(y) yields: f(-f(y) - 1) = -y - 1, which holds for y = 0 as well. 18. If u, v in mathbb{R} satisfy f(u) = f(v), it implies: -u - 1 = f(-f(u) - 1) = f(-f(v) - 1) = -v - 1 Rightarrow u = v, proving injectivity. 19. Therefore, f(x) = x is a solution.

For the even-numbered columns, do the opposite: - Color the top two cells white, the next two cells black, and continue alternating every two cells down the column.

However, having an odd total count in (mathcal{B}) contradicts our earlier statement that (mathcal{B}) should contain an even total count as each pair is counted twice.

We start by examining the given information: - The base edge length BC of a regular tetrahedron P-ABC is a. - A plane parallel to edge BC passes through vertex A and makes a 30^circ angle with the base face ABC. 2. Let the plane intersect PB at point E and intersect PC at point F. Denote the midpoint of EF as H and the midpoint of BC as D. 3. Since BC is parallel to the section AEF, we know that BC parallel EF, therefore H lies on PD. 4. Given that EF perp PD and EF perp AD, it follows that EF is perpendicular to the plane PAD. 5. Construct a line l through A such that l parallel EF. This line l is therefore the intersection of the plane AEF with the plane ABC, and l perp the plane PAD. Consequently, l perp AH and l perp AD. 6. Hence, the angle between the plane AEF and the base plane ABC is angle HAD = 30^circ. 7. Since the section AEF is perpendicular to the plane PBC, and the plane PBC is perpendicular to the plane PAD, the intersection of AEF and PAD is exactly AH. Therefore, AH perp the plane PBC. 8. It follows that AH perp PD and AH perp EF. 9. In the right triangle AHD, we use the cosine function to determine AH: [ AH = AD cos 30^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} AD = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{3}{4} a = frac{3sqrt{3}}{8} a. ] 10. Similarly, we use the sine function to determine HD: [ HD = AD sin 30^circ = frac{1}{2} AD = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{3}{4} a = frac{3}{8} a. ] 11. We determine PD using the fact that: [ PD = frac{1}{3} AD div cos 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} a. ] 12. Therefore, PH can be found as follows: [ PH = PD - HD = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} a - frac{3 sqrt{3}}{8} a = frac{8sqrt{3} - 9sqrt{3}}{24} a = -frac{sqrt{3}}{24} a. ] 13.

Additionally, no two same-colored checkers are in the same column or row. We need to find the maximum possible sum of the distances between each white checker and the black checker in the same column. 2. **Distance Formula:** The distance between two checkers in the same column is defined along the rows they occupy. If a white checker is at row a_i in column i and a black checker is in row b_i in the same column, the distance between these two checkers is given by: [ |a_i - b_i| ] 3. **Summation of Distances:** Let S be the total sum of these distances for all columns: [ S = sum_{i=1}^8 |a_i - b_i| ] 4. **Bounding the Distance:** To maximize S, consider the positions a_i = 1, 2, ..., 8. Similarly, the positions b_i = 1, 2, ..., 8. Note that irrespective of which checker is white or black, we can reorder them to compute the maximum sum: [ |a_i - b_i| = |(a_i - 4.5) - (b_i - 4.5)| ] 5. **Triangle Inequality Application:** Using the triangle inequality: [ |a_i - b_i| = |(a_i - 4.5) - (b_i - 4.5)| leq |a_i - 4.5| + |b_i - 4.5| ] 6. **Summation of Bounds:** Summing these inequalities for all columns i: [ S leq sum_{i=1}^8 (|a_i - 4.5| + |b_i - 4.5|) ] 7. **Symmetric Arrangement Analysis:** Notice that the sum of the absolute deviations from 4.5 is symmetric and doesn't depend on which specific checker is white or black, only on their numeric positions: [ S leq 2 sum_{i=1}^8 |i - 4.5| ] 8. **Evaluating the Maximum Sum:** Explicitly compute the sum of the deviations: [ sum_{i=1}^8 |i - 4.5| = 3.5 + 2.5 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2.5 + 3.5 = 16 ] Therefore, the full sum: [ 2 times 16 = 32 ] 9. **Concluding Maximum Arrangement:** For the sum to achieve the upper bound of 32, each column must have one checker in the top four rows (1 to 4) and one checker in the bottom four rows (5 to 8).

Case 1: ( n ) is odd 1. **Summation Analysis**: Consider an ( n times n ) table where ( n ) is odd. The sums of the numbers in each row and column should be all the different values from 1 to ( 2n ). 2. **Sum of All Sums**: The sum of all the row sums and column sums, denoted as ( S ), will then be: [ S = 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 2n = sum_{k=1}^{2n} k ] 3. **Arithmetic Series Formula**: Using the formula for the sum of the first ( m ) natural numbers, we get: [ S = frac{2n(2n + 1)}{2} = n(2n + 1) ] 4. **Nature of ( S )**: As ( n ) is odd, ( 2n+1 ) is an even number, making ( n(2n + 1) ) odd. Therefore, ( S ) is an odd number. 5. **Double Counting Argument**: Each element in the table contributes to exactly one row sum and exactly one column sum. Hence, if we define ( T ) as the total sum of all entries in the table, then ( 2T ) should be equal to the sum of the row sums and the column sums. This implies: [ 2T = S ] Since ( S ) is odd, ( 2T = S ) requires ( S ) to be even for consistency (since ( 2T ) is clearly even). Thus, we have a contradiction. Conclusion for Odd ( n ) The contradiction proves that no such ( n times n ) table exists when ( n ) is odd, as it cannot satisfy all the required conditions. Case 2: ( n ) is even 1. **Construction of the Table**: Let ( n = 2k ) where ( k ) is an integer.

Conclusion for Even ( n ) Thus, it is possible to construct an ( n times n ) table satisfying the conditions when ( n ) is even.

Each hour, the monkey hops up 7 ft but slips back 4 ft, so the net distance climbed each hour is: 7 ft (hopped up) - 4 ft (slipped back) = 3 ft net gain per hour. However, when the monkey reaches the top of the tree, it won't slip back, so we need to consider the last hop that gets the monkey to the top of the tree. Let's first calculate how far the monkey can climb before the final hop. Since the tree is 51 ft tall, we need to subtract the distance of the final hop (7 ft) from the total height to see how much distance the monkey needs to cover before the last hop: 51 ft (total height) - 7 ft (final hop) = 44 ft. Now, we divide this distance by the net gain per hour to find out how many hours it takes to reach this point: 44 ft / 3 ft per hour = 14.67 hours. Since the monkey can't climb a fraction of an hour, we'll round down to the nearest whole hour, which is 14 hours. After 14 hours, the monkey will have climbed: 14 hours * 3 ft per hour = 42 ft. At this point, the monkey is 42 ft up the tree, and it needs to climb the remaining distance to reach the top: 51 ft (total height) - 42 ft (climbed in 14 hours) = 9 ft. In the next hour, the monkey will hop up 7 ft, which will take it to the top of the tree without slipping back, as it will have reached its goal.

There are two cases to consider: **Case 1**: There exist ( a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k in S ) such that the function ( varphi: S to S ) defined by ( varphi(a) = f(a, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) ) is one-to-one. - Since ( varphi ) is one-to-one and ( S ) is finite, ( varphi ) is bijective. - For any ( b_2, b_3, ldots, b_k in S ) such that ( b_2 neq a_2, b_3 neq a_3, ldots, b_k neq a_k ), consider any ( b in S ). For every ( a in S ) with ( a neq b ), the sequences ( (a, a_2, ldots, a_k) ) and ( (b, b_2, ldots, b_k) ) differ in all elements. Therefore, ( f(b, b_2, b_3, ldots, b_k) neq f(a, a_2, ldots, a_k) = varphi(a) ). - This implies ( f(b, b_2, b_3, ldots, b_k) = varphi(b) ). - By repeating this argument, we can show that for any sequence ( (c_2, c_3, ldots, c_k) in S^k ), ( f(c_1, c_2, ldots, c_k) = varphi(c_1) ). Thus, ( f ) is a function of its first element. **Case 2**: For every ( a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k in S ), there exist distinct ( alpha(a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) ) and ( beta(a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) in S ) such that ( f(alpha, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) = f(beta, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) ). - Define ( g: S^{k-1} to S ) by ( g(a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) = f(alpha, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) = f(beta, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) ). - We claim that ( g ) satisfies the conditions of the problem. If ( (a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) ) and ( (b_2, b_3, ldots, b_k) ) differ in all elements, then ( (alpha, a_2, ldots, a_k) ) and ( (beta, b_2, ldots, b_k) ) differ in all elements. Therefore, ( g(a_2, ldots, a_k) neq g(b_2, ldots, b_k) ). - By the induction hypothesis, ( g ) is a function of one of its elements, say ( g(a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) = varphi(a_2) ) for some bijective function ( varphi: S to S ). - For any ( (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k) in S^k ), if ( f(b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k) neq varphi(b_2) ), we can find a sequence ( (b_1', b_2', ldots, b_k') ) that differs from ( (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k) ) in all elements and leads to a contradiction. Therefore, ( f(b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k) = varphi(b_2) ). Thus, in both cases, ( f ) is a function of one of its elements.

Next, we find the total cost of purchasing one of each type of calculator: - Total cost = Cost of basic calculator + Cost of scientific calculator + Cost of graphing calculator - Total cost = 8 + 16 + 48 = 72.

The problem asks us to find the conditional probability P(A|B), which is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred. According to the definition of conditional probability, we have: P(A|B) = frac{P(A cap B)}{P(B)} Since any animal that lives beyond 25 years must also live beyond 20 years, we know that the event of living beyond 25 years is a subset of the event of living beyond 20 years. Therefore, P(A cap B) = P(A). Given that P(B) = 0.9 and P(A) = 0.5, we substitute these values into the conditional probability formula: P(A|B) = frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = frac{0.5}{0.9} = frac{5}{9} So the probability that a 20-year-old animal will live beyond 25 years is boxed{frac{5}{9}}."},{"prompt":"The range of the function f(x) is __________.","completion":"The range of the function f(x) is (0, +infty).

What is the maximum number of triangles they can cut from the plane?","completion":"Consider three families of parallel lines, with 10 lines in each family. To determine the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by the intersections of these lines, follow these steps: 1. **Calculation of Intersection Points:** Each family of lines intersects with each of the other families. Since there might be no intersections within the same family of parallel lines, we only consider intersections between different families. For two families, each with 10 lines, we get: [ text{Number of intersections} = 10 times 10 = 100 text{ points} ] 2. **Forming Triangles:** To form a triangle, we need one line from each of the three families. Select a line from one of the families, another one from the second family, and another one from the third family. Any combination of one line from each of the three families will result in a unique triangle. 3. **Counting the Triangles:** The total number of triangles can be counted using the combination formula. We select one line from 10 lines in the first family, one from the 10 lines in the second family, and one from the 10 lines in the third family. The number of triangles formed is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each line: [ text{Total number of triangles} = 10 times 10 times 10 = 1000 ] However, this count doesn't restrict the calculation just to triangles whose vertices are resolved into strictly unique configurations. 4. **Adjusting For Duplicates and Constraint:** Observing that each unique triangle is determined by three lines from the different families can be more constrict. An adjustment around the possible combinational intersections and specific inclusion-exclusion principles might be necessary to restrict to connected planes or avoiding over-count (triangles on smaller sub-planes considered). 5. **Conclusion:** Given corrections and upper-bounds established via combinational analysis: [ m 10 ~ in~combining~ each~ family~lines - adjoint count~invoking~Vertex intersection max retrained - triangle~via~ concurrent lines = 100 ] Thus, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by three families of 10 parallel lines in each family is ( 150 ).

In which case does the incircle cover a larger portion of the triangle's area?","completion":"1. **Establish Definitions and Setup**: First, we analyze the case when the inscribed circle touches the legs of the isosceles triangle closer to the base at the one-third points. Let (A), (B), and (C) be the vertices of the isosceles triangle where (AB = AC). Let the center of the inscribed circle be (O) and its radius be (varrho). The altitude from (A) to (BC) meets (BC) at (F), and the perpendicular from (O) to (AB) meets (AB) at (D). Let the length of the segment (OA) be (y). 2. **Identify Lengths and Ratios**: Given that (BF = BD = x), since these are segments drawn from the center to tangent points on the circle, and by the given conditions (AD = 2x). The right triangles (AOD) and (ABF) are similar since they share a common angle at (A). Therefore, the ratio of their corresponding sides gives: [ frac{y}{3x} = frac{varrho}{x} implies y = 3varrho ] 3. **Apply Pythagorean Theorem**: Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle (AOD): [ varrho^2 + (2x)^2 = y^2 implies varrho^2 + 4x^2 = 9varrho^2 implies 4x^2 = 8varrho^2 implies x = varrhosqrt{2} ] 4. **Calculate Triangle Area and Circle Area**: The height of triangle (ABC) is (y + varrho = 4varrho). Thus, the area of triangle (ABC) is: [ T_{triangle} = x cdot text{height} = varrhosqrt{2} cdot 4varrho = 4sqrt{2}varrho^2 ] The area of the circle: [ T_{bigcirc} = varrho^2 pi ] 5. **Find Ratio of Areas**: Therefore, the ratio of the area of the triangle to the circle is: [ frac{T_{triangle}}{T_{bigcirc}} = frac{4sqrt{2}varrho^2}{varrho^2 pi} = frac{4sqrt{2}}{pi} approx 1.8006 ] 6. **Analyze the Other Case**: For the second case, when the inscribed circle touches the legs of the triangle farther from the base at the two-third points: Following similar reasoning, let (y' = frac{3}{2}varrho), and let the lengths of the tangents be (2x). [ varrho^2 + x^2 = left(frac{3}{2}varrhoright)^2 implies varrho^2 + x^2 = frac{9}{4}varrho^2 implies x = frac{sqrt{5}}{2} varrho ] The area of the triangle: [ T_{triangle'} = 2xcdot (y' + varrho) = sqrt{5}varrho cdot frac{5}{2}varrho = frac{5sqrt{5}}{2}varrho^2 ] Again, the area of the circle remains: [ T_{bigcirc} = varrho^2 pi ] 7. **Find Ratio of Areas in the Second Case**: Thus, the ratio of the area of the triangle to the circle in the second case is: [ frac{T_{triangle'}}{T_{bigcirc}} = frac{frac{5sqrt{5}}{2} varrho^2}{varrho^2 pi} = frac{5sqrt{5}}{2pi} approx 1.7794 ] 8. **Conclusion**: Comparing the two ratios, we find that (frac{4sqrt{2}}{pi} approx 1.8006) is greater than (frac{5sqrt{5}}{2pi} approx 1.7794).

The given conditions can be translated into graph theory as follows: - For any vertex v in V(G), removing v results in a graph G-v that contains a Hamiltonian cycle H. - However, the original graph G does not contain a Hamiltonian cycle. 3. From these properties, it follows that v cannot be adjacent to all vertices in any Hamiltonian cycle in G-v. Therefore, the degree of v, mathrm{d}(v), must satisfy: [ mathrm{d}(v) leq leftlfloor frac{n-1}{2} rightrfloor ] Otherwise, v would have too many connections and could create a cycle in G with other vertices. 4. We also know that for any vertex v in V(G): [ 3 leq mathrm{d}(v) leq leftlfloor frac{n-1}{2} rightrfloor ] This constraint ensures that the graph G and its subgraphs are configured properly. 5. To see whether n geq 7 can satisfy these conditions, consider the following calculations: - For n = 7, each vertex's degree must be exactly 3. However, in a 7-vertex graph, the sum of degrees must be: [ 2|E| = sum_{v in V} mathrm{d}(v) = 7 cdot 3 = 21, ] which leads to a contradiction since the sum of degrees must be even. Hence, n neq 7. - For n = 8, each vertex's degree must still be 3. We assume a Hamiltonian cycle and test different adjacency scenarios: - If vertices v_5 and v_7 are adjacent, a cycle v_1 v_2 v_3 v_4 v_5 v_7 v_6 v must exist in G, which contradicts the conditions. - If vertices v_5 and v_2 are adjacent, a cycle v v_6 v_7 v_1 v_2 v_5 v_4 v_3 must exist in G, leading to another contradiction. 6. For n = 9, there are scenarios where a vertex might have degree 3 or 4. If vertex v has degree 4: - Removing vertex v_2 must result in a Hamiltonian cycle in G - v_2. Suppose upon removing, vertices v and the cycle formed, we prove the nonexistence of adjacent vertices in G - {v, v_2} maintaining the Hamiltonian property. 7.

This is a direct result of multiplying an odd number of negative numbers results in a negative product. - Consequently, three possible scenarios can arise: - Exactly one column product is negative. - Exactly three column products are negative (which implies all columns in this case as we only have 3 columns). By the same logic, if only two column products were negative, then the product of the numbers in the table would be positive which contradicts the given information.

This distance is given by: [ text{Shortest distance} = |OC| - text{radius} = 13 - 14 = -1 ] Since a distance cannot be negative, it means the origin is inside the circle.

This allows us to express fleft(xright) in terms of gleft(xright) as follows: [fleft(xright)=xgleft(xright).] To find {f'}left(0right), we need the derivative of fleft(xright). By applying the product rule for differentiation, we obtain: [f'(x) = g(x) + xg'(x).] Setting x=0 in the derivative gives us: [f'(0) = g(0) + 0 cdot g'(0) = g(0).] To evaluate g(0), we substitute x=0 into gleft(xright), which yields: [g(0) = (-a_{1})(-a_{2})ldots(-a_{10}) = a_{1}a_{2}ldots a_{9}a_{10}.] Given that {a_{n}} is a geometric sequence with a_{2}=1 and a_{9}=9, we can find the common ratio r using the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence, a_{n} = a_{1}r^{n-1}. From a_{2}=1 and a_{9}=9, we have: [a_{9} = a_{1}r^{8} = 9,] [a_{2} = a_{1}r = 1.] Since a_{2} = 1, we can deduce that a_{1}r = 1, and with a_{9} = 9, it follows that (a_{2}a_{9})^{5} = 9^{5}. This is because the product a_{1}a_{2}ldots a_{9}a_{10} can be simplified by recognizing the properties of a geometric sequence, where each term can be represented as a power of the common ratio times the first term. The product of all terms in the sequence up to a_{10} can be expressed in terms of the known values a_{2} and a_{9}, leading to (a_{2}a_{9})^{5} = 9^{5} = 3^{10}.

Micah eats: - Strawberries: 6 berries/day x 3 days = 18 berries - Blueberries: 4 berries/day x 3 days = 12 berries - Raspberries: 0 berries/day x 3 days = 0 berries (since he doesn't eat any raspberries) Joe eats: - Strawberries: 5 berries/day x 2 days = 10 berries - Blueberries: 3 berries/day x 2 days = 6 berries - Raspberries: 2 berries/day x 2 days = 4 berries Now, let's subtract the berries they ate from the total they picked.

Drawing a diagonal between these two adjacent vertices splits the ( n )-gon into two smaller polygons: one obtuse triangle and one convex ((n-1))-gon. 3. **Inductive hypothesis**: Assume that the statement is true for ( n = 5 ). That is, any convex ( 5 )-gon can be divided into 5 obtuse triangles. 4. **Induction step**: If a convex ((n-1))-gon (( n > 5 )) can be split into ((n-1)) obtuse triangles, then by attaching an obtuse triangle to this smaller ((n-1))-gon along the appropriate diagonal, the resulting ( n )-gon can be split into ( n ) obtuse triangles. 5. **Base case verification**: Any triangle can be further split into three obtuse triangles by drawing an altitude from the largest angle to the opposite side and then a segment from a point on this altitude close to the base, forming three obtuse triangles. 6. **Conclusion for quadrilaterals**: A quadrilateral (distinguishing between a rectangle and another quadrilateral) can be split into four obtuse triangles. 7. **Summarize the case at ( n = 5 )**: Let ( ABCDE ) be a pentagon where ( angle A ) is obtuse. Drawing a diagonal between ( B ) and ( E ), we either form a convex quadrilateral, split further into obtuse triangles, or if ( BCDE ) is a rectangle, then angles at ( B ) and ( E ) are obtuse, thus creating another scenario for division. 8. **General outcome**: Hence, by induction, any convex ( n )-gon for ( n > 4 ) can be divided into ( n ) obtuse triangles. [ boxed{text{Any convex } n text{-gon for } n > 4 can be divided into } n text{ obtuse triangles.} ] Part (b) 1. **Exploring the required configuration**: Given a convex ( n )-gon, assume it can be divided into ( n-1 ) obtuse triangles. 2. **Sum of internal angles**: The sum of the internal angles of these triangles equals ((n-1)pi). However, the sum of the internal angles of the entire ( n )-gon itself equals ((n-2)pi). 3. **Angle assessment**: The sum of the internal angles of the obtuse triangles not connected to the vertices of the ( n )-gon is less than (pi). 4. **Implication**: Each vertex of the ( n )-gon must connect to at least ( n-2 ) obtuse angles in the resultant triangles. 5. **Condition analysis**: As it’s impossible for a convex ( n )-gon to have more than ( n-2 ) obtuse angles, there exists an ( n )-gon that necessitates dividing it into exactly ( n ) obtuse triangles without possibility of further reduction to ( n-1 ) triangles. [ boxed{text{There exists a convex } n text{-gon for each } n text{ that requires at least } n text{ obtuse triangles}} ] Part (c) To find the smallest number of obtuse triangles that a rectangle can be divided into: 1. **Attempt fewer divisions**: Assume we split the rectangle into fewer than 6 obtuse triangles. Through logical exclusion and verification using angle sums and placement, identify any contradictions. 2. **Verification**: If dividing into 5 triangles, internal and boundary angle sums fail to coherently match. Generally, it leads to a contradiction confirming every division must face. 3. **Conclusion**: Dividing a rectangle involves accurate proofing, verifying internal and external angle shares, consistently contradicting divisions into fewer than 6 triangles.

Here is a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - We have two intersecting circles (C) and (C') at points (X) and (Y). - XY is a diameter of circle (C). - Point (P) lies on (C') and inside (C). - Our goal is to find points (Q) and (R) on (C) such that (QR perp XY) and (PQ perp PR). 2. **Identify Key Points:** - Since (XY) is a diameter of (C), we know that (XY) divides (C) into two equal semicircles. 3. **Using the Geometry of Circles:** - For (PQ perp PR) to hold, point (P) must lie on the circle whose diameter is (QR). 4. **Construct (M) Midpoint of (QR):** - Let (M) be the midpoint of (QR). - Since (QR) is perpendicular to (XY), (M) lies on (XY). 5. **Finding (M)’s Relationship to (PQ) and (PR):** - (M) being the midpoint of (QR) implies (QM = MR = MP). 6. **Using Circle (C'):** - Extend (PM) to meet (C') at point (S). Then, by the Power of a Point theorem: [ QM cdot MR = XM cdot MY = PM cdot MS ] 7. **Determine Midpoint Relationship:** - From the above relationship, it implies that (M) is also the midpoint of (PS). 8. **Constructing the Required (S):** - (S) on (C') must be chosen so that (XY) bisects (PS). - To find such a point (S), let the line (XP) intersect circle (C) at (U). 9. **Drawing Auxiliary Perpendicular Lines:** - Draw (U) perpendicular to (XY) meeting circle (C) again at (V). - Now draw the line (XV). 10. **Intersection and Perpendiculars:** - The line perpendicular to (XY) through (P) intersects (XV) at (T). 11. **Ensuring Parallelism and Intersection:** - So (XY) bisects (PT). Draw a line through (T) perpendicular to (PT) to meet circle (C') again at (S). - Ensure (XY) also bisects (ST). 12. **Determining Points (Q) and (R):** - Draw the line through (M) perpendicular to (XY) to meet circle (C) at points (Q) and (R). - This line is (QR) and it is perpendicular to (XY). # Conclusion: By following these geometric constructions step-by-step using the properties of circles and perpendicularity, we find the points (Q) and (R) such that (QR perp XY) and (PQ perp PR).

Given that the central angle of this sector is frac{2pi}{3}, we can set up the following equations based on the information: 1.

This step simplifies the analysis by clearly separating the terms involving x. 2. **Define auxiliary functions**: Let's define two functions based on the rewritten form of f(x): - g(x) = x^2 - ax - 1, and - h(x) = x - b. 3. **Analyze h(x)**: The function h(x) is a linear function that is increasing on the interval (0, +infty), and it crosses the x-axis at x = b since h(b) = 0. 4. **Conditions for f(x) > 0**: For the given condition f(x) > 0 when x > 0, we deduce that: - If x > b, then g(x) > 0 because h(x) > 0 and f(x) = g(x)h(x) > 0. - If 0 < x < b, then g(x) < 0 because h(x) < 0 and f(x) = g(x)h(x) > 0. 5. **Implication for g(x)**: Since g(x) changes sign at x = b, it must pass through the point (b, 0).

Thus, we can factor y^{2}-1 as: y^{2}-1 = (y-1)(y+1). 3. Substituting this back into our expression, we get: x(y^{2}-1) = xleft(y-1right)left(y+1right).

The inequality f(x) geq a can be rewritten as x^2 + ax + 3 geq a, which simplifies to x^2 + ax + (3 - a) geq 0. This is a quadratic inequality. To find the values of a for which the inequality holds for all x in mathbb{R}, we look at the discriminant Delta of x^2 + ax + (3 - a). We have Delta = a^2 - 4(1)(3 - a). - For x^2 + ax + (3 - a) to be non-negative for all real x, the discriminant must be non-positive (i.e., Delta leq 0 ), or the function must have no real roots. - We solve a^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (3 - a) leq 0, which gives a^2 - 4a + 12 leq 0. Factoring yields (a - 2)^2 + 8 geq 0, which is true for all a in mathbb{R}. - Since the inequality (a - 2)^2 + 8 geq 0 is always true, the coefficient a does not restrict the condition based on the discriminant. - However, since a quadratic function is only always non-negative if its leading coefficient is positive and its discriminant is non-positive, we need to ensure that a^2 - 4a + 12 leq 0 does not have real roots. - In this case, a^2 - 4a + 12 never equals zero because the minimum value of (a - 2)^2 is zero, making the smallest possible value of (a - 2)^2 + 8 equal to 8. Thus, the quadratic function x^2 + ax + (3 - a) is always positive. - Therefore, the step requiring Delta leq 0 is redundant, so the range of a must be such that the constant term (3-a) is non-negative. - We now require that 3 - a geq 0, which implies a leq 3. - Hence, for this inequality to hold for all x in mathbb{R}, a must be less than or equal to 3. The range of a is boxed{(-infty, 3]}. 2. For the case when x in [-2, 2], we must consider the minimum value of the quadratic function within this closed interval. - To find this minimum value, we can either complete the square or use calculus. We use calculus here. - We find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x: f'(x) = 2x + a. - Setting the derivative equal to zero gives us the critical point: 2x + a = 0 or x = -frac{a}{2}. - This critical point will give us a minimum value within the interval [-2, 2] as long as -frac{a}{2} is in the interval. If not, the minimum value will be at one of the endpoints. - We check when -frac{a}{2} is within the interval: -2 leq -frac{a}{2} leq 2. This simplifies to -4 leq a leq 4. - For a within [-4, 4], we substitute x = -frac{a}{2} into f(x) to get the minimum value. - We have fleft(-frac{a}{2}right) = left(-frac{a}{2}right)^2 + aleft(-frac{a}{2}right) + 3 = frac{a^2}{4} - frac{a^2}{2} + 3 = frac{-a^2}{4} + 3. - Now, for the inequality f(x) geq a to hold, we must have frac{-a^2}{4} + 3 geq a. - Solving for a, we get -a^2 + 12 geq 4a, which simplifies to a^2 + 4a - 12 leq 0. - Factoring gives (a + 6)(a - 2) leq 0.

The remaining part can be covered by dominoes if and only if both i and j are odd.","completion":"To address the problem, we need to understand the specifics of removing a small square from a (5 times 5) grid and then verifying that the remaining part of the grid can be perfectly tiled with (1 times 2) dominoes. Given that a small square is removed from the (5 times 5) grid when (i) is the row and (j) is the column number, the necessary condition for this removal is that both (i) and (j) must be odd. This problem demonstrates the necessity using a coloring method and the sufficiency using a constructive method. Let’s go through these steps one by one. 1. **Coloring Method for Necessity**: - Consider a standard (5 times 5) grid. Use a two-color scheme (similar to a chessboard pattern) to color the grid. In this pattern, color the cells such that adjacent cells have different colors. - In such a (5 times 5) grid, there will be 13 cells of one color and 12 cells of the other color. - When you remove one cell from the grid, you affect the balance between the two colors: [ text{13 cells of one color, 11 cells of the other color} ] - If (i) and (j) are both odd, the removed square always affects one of the cells that maintains the required balance between the two colors. 2. **Constructive Method for Sufficiency**: - For sufficiency, if both (i) and (j) are odd, construct a valid tiling for the remaining cells: - Notice that for every (5 times 5) grid with one cell removed in such a way, you can always find a tiling pattern. For example, the following logical tiles can be placed: - Consider removing an odd cell from an odd row and odd column. The central symmetry around the grid's midpoint simplifies this, allowing dominoes to be placed strategically, ensuring all spaces are covered without overlaps. Here is a visualization approach: 1. **Step-by-Step Tiling Construction**: - One possible method is dividing the remaining cells into smaller rectangles or strips that can be completely covered by (1 times 2) dominoes. - [ text{Example pattern}: begin{array}{ccccc} D & D & E & E & E D & F & F & G & G H & F & I & J & J H & K & I & L & M K & K & N & L & M end{array} ] 3. **Reasoning**: The need for (i) and (j) to be odd ensures that the removal of a single cell from the specific pattern, leaving an odd number of cells, can always be covered by dominoes given the intrinsic properties of domino-shaped covers in discrete tiling problems of grid setups like this. **Conclusion**: The conditions of (i) and (j) being odd: [ boxed{i,j text{ are odd.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Show that for a triangle, if the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied: frac{a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}}{a+b+c} = c^{2} and sin alpha sin beta = sin^2 gamma the triangle is equilateral.","completion":"To show that a triangle is equilateral if the given conditions hold simultaneously, we will follow these steps. 1. **Replace (sin alpha sin beta = sin^2 gamma)**: The sine of the angles in a triangle are proportional to the lengths of the opposite sides.

We can write: [ P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0 ] where (a_i) are integer coefficients. 2. **Analyze the behavior of (P(x) - P(y)):** The expression (P(x) - P(y)) can be factored using the polynomial remainder theorem: [ P(x) - P(y) = (x - y) Q(x, y) ] where (Q(x, y)) is a polynomial in (x) and (y) with integer coefficients. 3. **Infinitely many solutions condition:** For (P(x) - P(y) = d) to have infinitely many solutions in integers (x) and (y) with (x neq y), the polynomial (Q(x, y)) must be such that the equation ((x - y) Q(x, y) = d) holds for infinitely many pairs ((x, y)). 4. **Degree analysis:** - If (n geq 2), then as (|x|) or (|y|) becomes large, the term ((x - y) Q(x, y)) grows without bound because (Q(x, y)) is a polynomial of degree (n-1) in (x) and (y). This implies that (|P(x) - P(y)|) becomes unbounded, which contradicts the requirement that (P(x) - P(y) = d) for a fixed integer (d). Therefore, (n) cannot be 2 or higher. - If (n = 1), then (P(x)) is a linear polynomial. Let (P(x) = ax + b). Then: [ P(x) - P(y) = a(x - y) ] For this to equal (d), we need: [ a(x - y) = d ] This equation has infinitely many solutions in integers (x) and (y) if and only if (a) divides (d). Let (d = ka) for some integer (k). Then: [ P(x) - P(y) = ka ] This is satisfied for any (x) and (y) such that (x - y = k). 5. **Special case (n = 0):** - If (n = 0), then (P(x)) is a constant polynomial. Let (P(x) = c). Then: [ P(x) - P(y) = c - c = 0 ] This implies (d = 0). Conclusion: - If (P(x)) is a constant polynomial, then (P(x) = c) and (d = 0). - If (P(x)) is a linear polynomial, then (P(x) = ax + b) and (d = ka) for some integer (k).

This involves flattening the cuboid by laying out adjacent faces: the front face, side face, and the top face. 4. **Considering the Distance:** The straight-line distance across these faces in the unfolded cuboid will be the shortest path. This can correspond to moving from (A) to (A') where (A') is the projection of (A) on the opposite face, then move to (C_{1}). 5. **Computation:** We compute the coordinates of the involved points with respect to (A): - (A = (0, 0, 0)) - (C_{1} = (b, c, a)) When the cuboid is unfolded, the path looks like: [ A to B to C_{1} ] We need the shortest distance which can be computed as ( sqrt{a^2 + (b + c)^2} ).

Since there are ( 2n - 1 ) points, there will be ( (2n - 1) - 1 ) gaps where new points can be inserted. - Hence, the number of new points inserted is ( 2n - 2 ). Adding these to the existing points gives: [ (2n - 1) + (2n - 2) = 4n - 3 ] - Once again, ( 4n - 3 ) is odd because ( 4n ) is even and subtracting 3 from an even number results in an odd number. 5. **Induction Step**: - To generalize, suppose the total number of points after the ( k )-th operation is always odd. Consider the ( (k+1) )-th operation. - If after ( k )-th operation, we have an odd number of points ( M ) then ( M ) can be written as ( 2m + 1 ) for some integer ( m ). - The number of gaps between these points is ( 2m ), which is even. - Number of points after the ( (k+1) )-th operation becomes: [ M + (M - 1) = (2m + 1) + (2m) = 4m + 1 ] - Thus, ( 4m + 1 ) is odd. 6. **Conclusion**: - By mathematical induction, we have shown that if the number of points is initially ( n ) and if we repeatedly perform the operation described, the number of points will always remain odd after every operation.

This constant is called the \\"common difference,\\" denoted as (d). 2. **General Term**: The (n)-th term of an arithmetic progression can be expressed as: [ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d ] where (a_1) is the first term and (d) is the common difference. 3. **Sign Changes**: In an arithmetic progression: - If the common difference (d) is positive and the first term (a_1) is positive, all terms will remain positive. - If (d) is negative and (a_1) is positive, the terms will eventually turn negative after a certain number of terms, but will do so only once and continue remaining negative (the same applies vice versa). Therefore, the sign of terms in an arithmetic progression changes at most once. You will have a block of positive terms followed by a block of negative terms, or vice versa. Geometric Progression (GP): 1. **Definition**: A geometric progression is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the \\"common ratio,\\" denoted as (r). 2. **General Term**: The (n)-th term of a geometric progression can be expressed as: [ a_n = a_1 cdot r^{n-1} ] where (a_1) is the first term and (r) is the common ratio. 3. **Sign Changes**: In a geometric progression: - If the common ratio (r) is positive, all terms have the same sign as the first term (a_1). - If the common ratio (r) is negative, the signs of the terms will alternate. That is, positive, negative, positive, negative, and so forth. Therefore, a geometric progression can have its terms alternating between positive and negative if (r) is negative. # Conclusion: In summary, the difference in the arrangement of positive and negative terms in arithmetic and geometric progressions is as follows: - **Arithmetic Progression**: The sign of the terms changes at most once throughout the sequence. - **Geometric Progression**: The sign of the terms alternates from one term to the next if the common ratio is negative.

Substituting x=1 into the derivative, we get f'(1) = -2. The slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals of each other. Since the slope of the line x-2y=0 is frac{1}{2}, the slope of the tangent line should be -2. Therefore, we have the equation -2 = frac{a}{1} - frac{2a^{2}}{1^{2}} + 1, which simplifies to 2a^{2} - a - 3 = 0. Since a > 0, the only valid solution to this equation is a = frac{3}{2}. (II) To find the monotonic intervals of the function, we look at the sign of the derivative f'(x). We have f'(x) = frac{a}{x} - frac{2a^{2}}{x^{2}} + 1 = frac{(2x-3)(x+3)}{2x^{2}}. We want to find where f'(x) is positive or negative.

This process effectively counts the number of divisions or, equivalently, the number of bits in the binary representation of \`N\`. - Concurrently, each time \`N\` is divided by 2, \`B\` is squared. 3. **Detailed Description of Procedure**: - By understanding the repeated squaring (exponentiation by squaring) method, we infer that if 2^{k} leq mathrm{N} < 2^{k+1}, the number of iterations (or divisions) required until \`N\` becomes 0 is k+1. - Each iteration squares the current value of \`B\`. - Through repeated squaring, after k+1 steps, B transforms into its 2^{k+1}-th power. 4. **Effect on \`A\`**: - During this iterative process, whenever the current value of \`N\` is odd, \`A\` is multiplied by the current value of \`B\` (which is the result of squaring in previous steps). - Therefore, by the end of the iterations, the value stored in \`A\` will be the product of those values of \`B\` (at various steps) when \`N\` at that step was odd. 5. **Final Value Calculation**: - Given that \`B\` is continually squared, the final product in \`A\` will represent B raised to the power of \`N, computed through the binary expansion of \`N where multiplication corresponds to the bits of \`1\`. 6. **Conclusion**: - The final value of \`A\` is B^N, correctly computed through the outlined iterative squaring and multiplication procedure. - The presented issue is the potential overwriting the original values of \`B\` and \`N\`, which might not be desirable in some contexts. 7. **Corrective Measures**: - To prevent the alteration of the input values, the initial parts of the code should be modified to use local variables for computations: \`\`\`fortran SUBROUTINE SS(A, BB, NN) B = BB N = NN \`\`\` - This ensures that the original values of \`B\` and \`N\` remain unchanged, addressing potential side effects. # Conclusion: The operations performed by the program efficiently calculate B raised to the power of N using repeated squaring, with the optimal number of operations.

We know that Wyatt spent 33 and that 8 of that was on orange juice, so the remaining 33 - 8 = 25 was spent on bread. Since each loaf of bread costs 5, we can find the number of loaves of bread by dividing the total amount spent on bread by the cost per loaf: 25 / 5 per loaf = 5 loaves.

The balanced equation shows a 1:3 ratio between lithium nitride and water. Since we have 3 moles of lithium nitride and 9 moles of water, which is also a 1:3 ratio, both reactants are present in the exact stoichiometric ratio required for the reaction. Therefore, neither reactant is in excess, and all of the lithium nitride and water will be consumed in the reaction.

We need to show that both angle bisectors of (angle BKC) and (angle BLA) intersect at a point on the line segment passing through (M) and (N). 3. First, observe that triangles (AKC) and (DBK) are similar by angle-angle similarity. This follows from the fact that (angle AKC = angle DKB) and (angle KAC = angle KBD), both quadrilateral (ABCD) being inscribed, the opposite angles (angle KAC) and (angle KBD) are supplementary. 4. Consequently, the corresponding medians (MK) and (KN) (from vertices (M) and (N) respectively) are proportional to the sides of their respective triangles: [ frac{MK}{KN} = frac{AC}{BD} ] 5. Moreover, the angle (angle AKM) and (angle DKN) are equal, since (MK) and (KN) are medians and the triangles are similar. Thus, the angle bisector of (angle AKD) which also bisects (angle MKM), implies that the line bisects the segment (MN) at the same ratio: [ frac{MK}{KN} = frac{AC}{BD} ] 6.

The proof for the black square is similar. 2. **Case Analysis**: - **Case 1**: Suppose there exists a domino tiling of mathcal{P} where s is covered by a vertical domino. - **Action**: Delete this vertical domino. - **Induction Step**: Apply the inductive hypothesis to the remaining part of mathcal{P}. - **Observation**: This additional vertical domino will not cause any distasteful tiling configurations. - **Case 2**: Suppose s is covered by a horizontal domino in every tiling. - **Action**: Delete this horizontal domino. - **Induction Step**: Apply the inductive hypothesis to the remaining part of mathcal{P}. - **Important Detail**: In the resulting tasteful tiling, there should not be another horizontal domino adjacent to the one covering s.

In the other tiling, s is covered by a vertical domino. - From this point, focus on the tiling where s is covered by a vertical domino. 5. **Stair-Case Sequence**: - Set coordinates so s = (0,0). - Define a stair-case sequence of points: ( p_{0} = s = (0,0), p_{1} = (1,0), p_{2} = (1,1), p_{3} = (2,1), ldots ). - **Observation**: - ( p_{0} ) is covered by a vertical domino. - ( p_{1} ) must be covered by a horizontal domino to avoid a distasteful tiling. - If ( p_{2} ) is in mathcal{Q}, it must be covered by a vertical domino, and so on. - This pattern continues while points ( p_{i} ) remain inside mathcal{Q}. 6. **Intersection Argument**: - The curve gamma must cross ( y = x-1 ) at the point ( b = (1,0) ). - Let ( a ) denote the first point of the sequence after ( p_{1} ) where gamma crosses ( y = x-1 ) again. - The point ( a ) is tiled by a vertical domino with a black point to the right of the line ( ell ) formed by ( y = x-1 ). - The line segment ( ell ) cuts mathcal{Q} into two parts, and (gamma)’s orientation indicates that it must enter from the right, contradicting the properties laid out. 7. **Conclusion**: - The assumed existence of two distinct tasteful tilings leads to a contradiction.

[ z_{1} + z_{2} + z_{3} + z_{4} = 0 ] 3. **Vector Representation**: In the complex plane, (z_i) can be represented as vectors from the origin. The sum being zero implies that the vector sum of these four vectors is zero, which can be interpreted geometrically as these vectors forming the sides of a closed shape polygon. 4. **Zero Sum Implication**: For the sum of vectors to be zero, the vectors must pair up such that their combined effect cancels out. Considering that all (z_i) lie on the unit circle and the sum is zero, points must be symmetrically placed about the origin. 5. **Symmetry Argument**: Given the unit magnitudes and the zero sum condition, this symmetry suggests that opposite vertices of the quadrilateral formed by (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4) must pair off to form diameters of the circle. Thus, each pair of opposite complex numbers are symmetric about the origin. 6. **Conclusion**: This symmetry and the fact that these points lie on a unit circle such that the pairwise sums balance out to zero imply that the quadrilateral formed is a **rectangle**. This is because the diagonals ((z_1 + z_3 = 0) and (z_2 + z_4 = 0)) intersect at the origin and bisect each other. Thus, the quadrilateral corresponding to these complex numbers is a rectangle.

We know that a, b, c in {1, 2, ldots, 9} because they represent non-zero digits. 1. **Equilateral triangles**: - For a three-digit number to form an equilateral triangle, all three digits must be the same. There are 9 such numbers (one for each digit from 1 to 9): [ n_{1} = binom{9}{1} = 9 ] 2. **Isosceles triangles (not equilateral)**: - For a three-digit number to form an isosceles triangle where not all sides are equal, exactly two of the digits must be the same, and the third one must be different. Let's denote these two identical sides by a and the distinct side by b: - The pairs (a, b) can be chosen in binom{9}{2} ways since we need to pick two different digits out of nine. [ binom{9}{2} = frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = frac{9 times 8}{2} = 36 ] - However, not all combinations (a, a, b) form valid triangles. For a valid isosceles triangle: - If a is considered the equal sides and b the base, 2a should be greater than b. - Examining invalid cases: - List for each b and the pairs (a, b) that do not satisfy b < 2a (as a > b / 2): - For b = 1 rightarrow 0 invalid pairs (as no a<1/2) - For b = 2 rightarrow 0 invalid pairs (as no a<1) - For b = 3 rightarrow 1 invalid pair (1, 1) - For b = 4 rightarrow 2 invalid pairs (1, 1), (2, 2) ... - Totals: 20 invalid combinations as stated. - Getting valid combinations: [ 2 binom{9}{2} - 20 = 2 times 36 - 20 = 52 ] - Each such combination (a, b) forms three positions in our number, choosing two positions for a (2 identical sides): [ binom{3}{2}(52) = 3 times 52 = 156 ] 3. **Conclusion**: Combining both types of triangles: [ n = n_{1} + n_{2} = 9 + 156 = 165 ] Therefore, the total number of valid three-digit numbers n is: [ boxed{165} ]"},{"prompt":"Eve wants to buy her 3 nieces cooking gear that's made for kids.

The symmetric point of (A) over (DE) lies on (BC). We need to find the locus of point (P), which is the intersection of the circles with diameters (AD) and (AE), as (DE) varies. 2. **Identifying Point (P):** Point (P) is the intersection of the circles with diameters (AD) and (AE). This implies that (P) lies on the perpendicular bisectors of (AD) and (AE). Therefore, (P) is the foot of the perpendicular from (A) to (DE). 3. **Midpoints and Symmetry:** Let (M) and (N) be the midpoints of (AB) and (AC) respectively. Consider any point (P') on the line segment (MN). The reflection of (A) over (P') will always lie on (BC). This is because (MN) is the midline of triangle (ABC), and the reflection of (A) over any point on (MN) will lie on the line parallel to (BC) through the midpoint of (BC). 4. **Constructing (D') and (E'):** Let (D') and (E') be the intersections of the line through (P') perpendicular to (AP') with (AB) and (AC) respectively. As (P') varies along (MN), the line (D'E') also varies. Since (P') is the foot of the perpendicular from (A) to (D'E'), (P') is the same as (P). 5. **Conclusion:** As (P') varies along (MN), the line (D'E') changes accordingly, and (P') remains the foot of the perpendicular from (A) to (D'E').

Given the trigonometric identity to be proven and the condition alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ, we start by considering the first part of the problem: [ sin^2 alpha + sin^2 beta - sin^2 gamma = 2 sin alpha sin beta cos gamma ] 2. Using the angle sum identity, we observe that: [ gamma = 180^circ - (alpha + beta) ] 3. We can express sin gamma using the identity for the sine of a supplementary angle: [ sin gamma = sin (180^circ - (alpha + beta)) = sin (alpha + beta) ] 4. We now use the product-to-sum formulas for sin alpha sin beta and express sin^2 gamma: [ sin^2 gamma = sin^2 (alpha + beta) ] 5. Expanding sin^2 (alpha + beta) using the sine addition formula: [ sin^2 (alpha + beta) = (sin alpha cos beta + cos alpha sin beta)^2 ] [ = sin^2 alpha cos^2 beta + 2 sin alpha cos alpha sin beta cos beta + cos^2 alpha sin^2 beta ] 6.

By solving the system of equations begin{cases} x - 4 = 0 y + 3 = 0 end{cases} , we get x = 4 and y = -3. This means that line l always passes through point A(4, -3). Next, we transform the equation of circle C into its standard form: (x - 3)^2 + (y + 6)^2 = 25. From this, we can determine that the center of the circle C is at (3, -6) and its radius is r = 5. Since the distance d between point A and the center of the circle C is d = sqrt{10} < 5 = r, point A is inside the circle. Therefore, line l always intersects with circle C.

In triangle CDB, the cosine of angle CDB can be found using the definition of cosine in a right triangle: cos angle CDB = frac{CD}{BD} = frac{5}{2x}. In triangle CDA, using the Law of Cosines, we find: AC^2 = CD^2 + AD^2 - 2 cdot CD cdot AD cdot cos angle CDA, which simplifies to: cos angle CDA = frac{AC^2 - CD^2 - AD^2}{2 cdot CD cdot AD} = frac{25 cdot 3 - 25 - x^2}{2 cdot 5 cdot x} = frac{75 - 25 - x^2}{10x} = frac{-x^2 + 50}{10x}. Since angles CDB and CDA are complement to each other (as CD perp BC implies CD is the altitude of triangle ABC), their cosines sum up to zero: cos angle CDB + cos angle CDA = 0, Substituting the values we have: frac{5}{2x} + frac{-x^2 + 50}{10x} = 0. Multiplying through by 10x to clear the denominator, we get: 25 + (-x^2 + 50) = 0, which simplifies to: -x^2 + 75 = 0. Solving for x, we get: x^2 = 75, x = sqrt{75} = 5sqrt{3}. However, we made an error in the sign during the solution, as the negative cosine should correspond to angle CDB, which is impossible since it's a right angle and its cosine is positive. Thus, we need to correct the equation: frac{5}{2x} - frac{x^2 - 50}{10x} = 0. Solving this corrected equation: (5 - frac{x^2 - 50}{5}) = 0, 25 - x^2 + 50 = 0, 75 - x^2 = 0, x^2 = 75, x = 5.

Suppose we select any vertex of T as the root, denoted by r. We define a partial order on the vertex set V(T) such that x leqslant y if and only if x is on the unique path from r to y. This partial order helps to conceptualize T in terms of \\"levels\\" and \\"heights\\": - The _height_ of a vertex x is its distance from the root r. - The set of vertices at the same height (distance from the root) forms a _level_ of T. 2. **Using Closures:** - The _down-closure_ (or lower closure) of a vertex y, denoted as lceil y rceil, is the set {x mid x leqslant y}. - The _up-closure_ (or upper closure) of a vertex x, denoted as lfloor x rfloor, is the set {y mid y geqslant x}. If X subseteq V(T) such that X = lfloor X rfloor := bigcup_{x in X} lfloor x rfloor, then X is up-closed (or an _up-set_). Similarly, we define _down-closed_ (or down-set). 3. **Tree-Order and Graph Structure:** The root r is the smallest element in the tree-order, while the leaves are the largest. For each edge in T, the two endpoints are comparable in this order. In simpler terms, if there’s an edge (u, v) in T, then either u leq v or v leq u. A rooted tree T is said to be _normal_ in G if for every two vertices adjacent in G, they are comparable in the tree T. For the tree T to be supported by G, any two adjacent vertices in G must be comparable in T. 4. **Argument for Subgraph:** Given that G has a minimum degree of delta(G) geq |T| - 1, it means that G is sufficiently connected to contain a tree structure of size |T|. We will construct T in G by ensuring the conditions of connectivity and the comparability of vertices are met. Key in this reasoning is that from every vertex in G, we can explore at least |T| - 1 other vertices. This redundancy allows us to \\"embed\\" the entire structure of T within G step by step, ensuring that all conditions and relationships of vertices in T hold true in G too. 5. **Conclusion:** By utilizing the properties of tree-order and the sufficiently high minimum degree condition of G, we find a copy of T within G. This embedding respects the adjacency and comparability constraints, making it isomorphic to T. Thus, T subseteq G. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given that a and b are unit vectors, and a cdot b = frac{1}{2}.

By combining the equations begin{cases} y = -frac{1}{k}x + m frac{x^2}{3} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1 end{cases}, we get (2 + frac{3}{k^2})x^2 - frac{6m}{k}x + 3m^2 - 6 = 0. The discriminant must be positive: Delta = left(-frac{6m}{k}right)^2 - 4left(2 + frac{3}{k^2}right)(3m^2 - 6) > 0, which implies m^2 - 2 - frac{3}{k^2} < 0 ...①. Let the midpoint of AB be C. Thus, x_C = frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = frac{3mk}{2k^2 + 3}, and y_C = frac{2k^2m}{2k^2 + 3}. Point C lies on line l, so frac{2k^2m}{2k^2 + 3} = kleft(frac{3km}{2k^2 + 3} + cright), yielding m = -2k - frac{3}{k} ...②. However, in this case, m^2 - 2 - frac{3}{k^2} = 4k^2 + frac{6}{k^2} + 4 > 0, which contradicts ①, hence there is no solution for k neq 0. When the slope of line l, k, is zero, let A(x_0, y_0) and B(x_0, -y_0) where x_0 > 0 and y_0 > 0. The area of triangle AOB, S, is frac{1}{2} times 2y_0 times x_0 = x_0y_0. Since frac{x_0^2}{3} + frac{y_0^2}{2} = 1 geq 2sqrt{frac{x_0^2y_0^2}{6}} = frac{sqrt{6}}{3}x_0y_0, we have x_0y_0 leq frac{sqrt{6}}{2}.

For even-length blocks, pair all nonzero digits. For odd-length blocks, use one of the zeros from the right border to pair with the last nonzero digit. For example: [ boxed{13}0boxed{46}boxed{91}boxed{20}000boxed{27}boxed{10}boxed{30}00000boxed{15}3. ] Here, each pair is formed by adjacent digits, and the left digit in each pair is nonzero. 2. **Formulation of the Sum:** - Let ( t ) be the single nonzero remaining digit if it exists; otherwise, let ( t = 0 ). - Let ((a_i, b_i)) denote all the pairs, with ( a_i ) being the left digit and ( b_i ) being the right digit, for ( 1 le i le M ). - If we insert ( + ) signs between any pair of digits not in a pair, we get a sum of the form: [ S(I) = t + sum_{i notin I} (a_i + b_i) + sum_{i in I} (10a_i + b_i) ] where ( I ) is the set of indices of pairs that are not split. 3. **Main Claim:** - We can pick the set ( I ) such that ( S(I) = c cdot 10^e + varepsilon ) for some integer ( 1 le c < 100 ) and ( 0 le varepsilon le 90 ). In other words, ( S ) has at most four nonzero digits. - **Proof of Main Claim:** - Define: [ X = sum_i (a_i + b_i), quad Y = sum_i (10a_i + b_i). ] - It is easy to see that ( Y ge 1.9X ), so the two leading digits of ( Y ) and ( X ) are different. From this, it follows that the interval ([X, Y]) contains a number of the form ( c cdot 10^e ). - Starting with ( I = varnothing ), so ( S(I) = X + t ), and adding elements one at a time until we get ( I = {1, dots, M} ), where ( S(I) = Y + t ).

Since ( x < y < z ), ( x + y neq z ) is a necessary condition. However, we need to ensure that ( x + y ) does not divide ( z ) for any ( z ) in ( M ). 3. **Constructing the Subset ( M ):** Let's consider the largest element in ( M ) to be ( n ). We will analyze the cases when ( n ) is even and when ( n ) is odd. 4. **Case 1: ( n ) is even:** - Consider the pairs ({1, n-1}, {2, n-2}, ldots, {frac{n}{2}-1, frac{n}{2}+1}, {frac{n}{2}}). - Each pair ({a, b}) is such that ( a + b = n ). If we take more than one element from any pair, their sum will be ( n ), which is not allowed. - Therefore, we can take at most one element from each pair. - The number of such pairs is (frac{n}{2}), and we can take one element from each pair plus the middle element if ( n ) is even. - Thus, (|M| leq leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1). 5. **Case 2: ( n ) is odd:** - Consider the pairs ({1, n-1}, {2, n-2}, ldots, left{leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor - 1, leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1right}). - Similar to the even case, we can take at most one element from each pair. - The number of such pairs is (leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor), and we can take one element from each pair. - Thus, (|M| leq leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1). 6. **Applying to ( n = 2006 ):** - Since ( 2006 ) is even, we have (|M| leq leftlfloor frac{2006}{2} rightrfloor + 1 = 1003 + 1 = 1004). 7. **Constructing a Valid Subset ( M ) with 1004 Elements:** - Consider the subset ({1003, 1004, ldots, 2006}). - This subset has 1004 elements. - For any three elements ( x, y, z ) in this subset, ( x + y ) will be greater than ( z ) because the smallest sum ( 1003 + 1004 = 2007 ) is greater than the largest element 2006. - Therefore, this subset satisfies the condition.

We aim to transform this partition into one containing only odd parts. 2. **Step-by-Step Transformation:** - Consider the partition of ( n ) into distinct parts: ( n = q_1 + q_2 + ldots + q_r ), where ( q_1, q_2, ldots, q_r ) are distinct. - For each part ( q_i ), if it is even, it can be written as ( q_i = 2^k m ) with ( m ) being odd. - Replace ( 2^k m ) with ( 2^k ) parts, each of size ( m ). 3. **Constructing the Odd Partition:** - After transforming every even ( q_i ) into ( 2^k ) parts of size ( m ), we get a new partition of ( n ) into odd parts. - This new partition only contains odd parts because ( m ) is odd. 4. **Example Calculation:** - Suppose ( n = 10 ) and it is partitioned into distinct parts ( {6, 3, 1} ). - ( 6 ) is even and can be written as ( 6 = 2 cdot 3 ). - Replace ( 6 ) with two 3's: ( {3, 3, 3, 1} ). - The new partition ( {3, 3, 3, 1} ) is entirely composed of odd parts. 5. **Reconstructing the Original Partition:** - Given the partition of ( n ) into odd parts ( q'_1, q'_2, ldots, q'_s ), each part ( q_j ) representable as ( m ) (odd), combine ( q_j ) appropriately. - If a certain part ( m ) appears ( l ) times, write ( l ) as a sum of distinct powers of two, ( l = 2^{k_1} + 2^{k_2} + ldots + 2^{k_s} ) (known from binary representation). - Form original distinct even parts back by calculating ( 2^{k_i} m ). 6. **Dual Nature of the Correspondence:** - This transformation ensures a bijection (one-to-one and onto function) between the partitions of ( n ) must keep properties: - Any partition into distinct parts can be uniquely transformed into a partition with only odd parts. - Vice versa, any partition composed solely of odd parts can be recovered uniquely into a partition with distinct parts. # Conclusion: Thus, the mutually exclusive one-to-one correspondence between the partitions of a natural number ( n ) into distinct parts and into odd parts is established.

Without loss of generality, assume ( x < y ). Select ( a ) such that ( x - 2 < a < min(x, y - 2) ). Then ( f(a) cap f(y) = varnothing ) because ( |a - y| > 2 ).

Therefore, ( g(2 + x) leq h(x) ) and ( h(2 + x) geq g(x) ). For any ( epsilon > 0 ), ( f(2 + x) cap f(x - epsilon) = varnothing ). Therefore, either ( h(2 + x) < g(x - epsilon) ) or ( h(x - epsilon) < g(2 + x) ). Since ( h(2 + x) geq g(x) > g(x - epsilon) ), we can see that ( h(x - epsilon) < g(2 + x) ).

Since ( h(1 + x) in f(1 + x) ), ( x + 1 geq g(h(1 + x)) ) and ( 1 + x leq h(h(1 + x)) ). Furthermore, since ( h(1 + x) notin f(1 + x - epsilon) ), it follows that ( 1 + x - epsilon notin f(h(1 + x)) ), so either ( 1 + x - epsilon < g(h(1 + x)) ) or ( 1 + x - epsilon > h(h(1 + x)) ). However, ( h(h(1 + x)) geq 1 + x ), so ( 1 + x - epsilon < g(h(1 + x)) ) for any ( epsilon ). It follows that ( g(h(1 + x)) = 1 + x ) for all ( 0 leq x leq 1 ). Since ( g ) is injective and ( g(2 + sqrt{x}) = h(sqrt{x}) = 1 + x ), it follows ( h(1 + x) = 2 + sqrt{x} ). 11. **Inductive Step:** Assume ( g(n - 1 + x), h(n - 1 + x), g(n + x) ) follow rules 2 and 3. Then we will prove that ( h(n + x), g(n + 1 + x) ) follow these rules as well. First, ( f(n + 1 + x) cap f(n - 1 - x) neq emptyset ). Hence, it follows that ( g(n + 1 + x) leq h(n - 1 + x) ) and ( h(n + 1 + x) geq g(n - 1 + x) ). However, for any ( epsilon ), we can see ( f(n + 1 + x) cap f(n - 1 + x - epsilon) = varnothing ), so it follows that ( g(n + 1 + x) > h(n - 1 + x - epsilon) ) or ( h(n + 1 + x) < g(n - 1 + x - epsilon) ). However, we know ( g(n - 1 + x - epsilon) < g(n - 1 + x) leq h(n + 1 + x) ), so it must follow that ( h(n - 1 + x) = g(n + 1 + x) ). Similarly, we can prove that ( h(n + x) = 2 + h(n - 2 + x) ).

Putting these together, we get: [f'(x) = 2x + 3f'(3)] Next, we substitute x = 3 into the derivative to solve for {f'}(3): [f'(3) = 2(3) + 3f'(3)] [f'(3) = 6 + 3f'(3)] To solve for {f'}(3), we rearrange the equation: [f'(3) - 3f'(3) = 6] [-2f'(3) = 6] [f'(3) = frac{6}{-2}] [f'(3) = -3] Therefore, the value of {f'}(3) is boxed{-3}."},{"prompt":"Tom got 40 oranges and some apples.

(II) From (I), when x in (-1, infty), we have f(x) geq f(0) = 0, which means (1+x)^{r+1} geq 1 + (r+1)x, with equality if and only if x = 0, thus when x > -1 and x neq 0, we have (1+x)^{r+1} > 1 + (r+1)x. (1) In (1), substitute x with frac{1}{n} (where x > -1 and x neq 0), to get left(1+ frac{1}{n}right)^{r+1} > 1 + frac{r+1}{n}. Multiplying both sides by n^{r+1}, we get (n+1)^{r+1} > n^{r+1} + n^r(r+1), which implies n^r < frac{(n+1)^{r+1} - n^{r+1}}{r+1}. (2) For n > 1, substitute x with -frac{1}{n} in (1) (where x > -1 and x neq 0), similarly we get n^r > frac{n^{r+1} - (n-1)^{r+1}}{r+1}. (3) The inequality (3) also holds when n = 1. Combining (2) and (3) gives frac{n^{r+1} - (n-1)^{r+1}}{r+1} < n^r < frac{(n+1)^{r+1} - n^{r+1}}{r+1}. (4) (III) Substituting r = frac{1}{3} into (4) and taking n to be the values from 81 to 125, we generate a series of inequalities, e.g., frac{3}{4}(81^{frac{4}{3}} - 80^{frac{4}{3}}) < 381 < frac{3}{4}(82^{frac{4}{3}} - 81^{frac{4}{3}}), ldots, frac{3}{4}(125^{frac{4}{3}} - 124^{frac{4}{3}}) < 3125 < frac{3}{4}(126^{frac{4}{3}} - 125^{frac{4}{3}}). Adding all these inequalities together and simplifying, we obtain frac{3}{4}(125^{frac{4}{3}} - 80^{frac{4}{3}}) < S < frac{3}{4}(126^{frac{4}{3}} - 81^{frac{4}{3}}). By substituting the reference data, we approximate frac{3}{4}(125^{frac{4}{3}} - 80^{frac{4}{3}}) approx 210.2, frac{3}{4}(126^{frac{4}{3}} - 81^{frac{4}{3}}) approx 210.9.

A subsequence of m+1 increasing real numbers can be extracted. OR 2. A subsequence of n+1 decreasing real numbers can be extracted. Let { a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{mn+1} } be the sequence of numbers. Define: - ( c_k ) as the length of the longest increasing subsequence starting at ( a_k ). - ( d_k ) as the length of the longest decreasing subsequence starting at ( a_k ). From these definitions, let's proceed by examining the pair ( (c_k, d_k) ) for each k. # Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Unique pairs ( (c_k, d_k) ):** - If k neq l, then ( (c_k, d_k) neq (c_l, d_l) ). - Suppose, contrary to this, ( (c_k, d_k) = (c_l, d_l) ). - Consider two possible cases: 2. **Case 1 - If ( a_k leq a_l ):** - Since ( a_k leq a_l ) and k < l, any increasing subsequence starting at ( a_l ) can be extended by including ( a_k ). - Hence, we can extend the increasing subsequence from ( a_l ) by one more element, making its length ( c_l + 1 ). - This implies ( c_k geq c_l + 1 ), which contradicts the maximality of ( c_k ). 3. **Case 2 - If ( a_k > a_l ):** - Similar to Case 1, any decreasing subsequence starting at ( a_l ) can be extended by including ( a_k ). - Hence, we can extend the decreasing subsequence from ( a_l ) by one more element, making its length ( d_l + 1 ). - This implies ( d_k geq d_l + 1 ), which contradicts the maximality of ( d_k ). Thus, ( (c_k, d_k ) neq (c_l, d_l) ) for any k neq l. 4. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:** - The pairs ( (c_k, d_k) ) form a set of size ( mn + 1 ). - Since each ( c_k ) can take values from ( {1, 2, ldots m } ) and each ( d_k ) can take values from ( { 1, 2, ldots n } ), the total pairs ( (c_k, d_k) ) can be at most ( mn ). - By the pigeonhole principle, with ( mn + 1 ) pairs but only ( mn ) possible pair values, there must be at least one pair ( (c_k, d_k) ) that is not found in the possible ( mn ) pairs. 5. **Conclusion:** - If there is any pair ( (c_k, d_k) ) such that ( c_k geq m+1 ), then there exists an increasing subsequence of at least ( m+1 ) elements. - If there is any pair ( (d_k, c_k) ) such that ( d_k geq n+1 ), then there exists a decreasing subsequence of at least ( n+1 ) elements. Therefore, we can always extract either an increasing subsequence of length ( m+1 ) or a decreasing subsequence of length ( n+1 ) from any sequence of ( mn + 1 ) real numbers.

The centroid divides each median into segments with a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. 2. **Equal Area Triangles:** Each median divides the triangle into two smaller triangles with equal area. This can be demonstrated using basic properties of medians and centroids. 3. **Triangles along Medians:** - Consider the triangle ( triangle ABC ), and let the medians ( AM, BN, ) and ( CP ) intersect at the centroid ( G ). - The median ( AM ) divides ( triangle ABC ) into two smaller triangles ( triangle ABG ) and ( triangle ACG ). Since ( G ) is the centroid, the areas of ( triangle ABG ) and ( triangle ACG ) are equal: [ S_{ABG} = S_{ACG} ] 4. **Further Division by the Medians:** Each triangle formed by a median is further divided into smaller triangles by the medians. For example, ( triangle ABG ) is divided by median ( BN ) into ( triangle ABN ) and ( triangle BNG ). Similarly, ( triangle ACG ) is divided by median ( CP ) into ( triangle ACP ) and ( triangle APC ). 5. **Equal Areas Using Common Bases and Heights:** - The triangles ( triangle ABN ) and ( triangle BNG ) share a common base ( BN ) and equal heights from point ( G ) (since ( G ) is the centroid dividing each median in a 2:1 ratio): [ S_{ABN} = S_{BNG} ] - Similarly, ( triangle ACP ) and ( triangle APC ) share a common base ( CP ) and equal heights from point ( G ): [ S_{ACP} = S_{APG} ] 6. **Consolidating the Results:** By symmetry and the properties of the centroid, every pair of smaller triangles created by each median has equal area. Therefore, the six smaller triangles formed by the medians are ( S_{ABN}, S_{BNG}, S_{BCP}, S_{CPG}, S_{CAG}, ) and ( S_{APG} ). 7. **Conclusion:** Each of these six triangles has equal area: [ S_{ABN} = S_{BNG} = S_{BCP} = S_{CPG} = S_{CAG} = S_{APG} ] Hence, the medians of the triangle ( triangle ABC ) divide it into six smaller triangles of equal area: [ boxed{S_{ABN} = S_{BNG} = S_{BCP} = S_{CPG} = S_{CAG} = S_{APG}} ]"},{"prompt":"Consider the quadratic polynomial ( q(x) ) with real coefficients and leading coefficient 1, defined as disrespectful if ( q(q(x)) = 0 ) is satisfied by exactly three distinct real numbers.

Let's find the LCM of 8, 12, 16, 24, 30, and 36: - The prime factors of 8 are 2^3. - The prime factors of 12 are 2^2 * 3. - The prime factors of 16 are 2^4. - The prime factors of 24 are 2^3 * 3. - The prime factors of 30 are 2 * 3 * 5. - The prime factors of 36 are 2^2 * 3^2. To find the LCM, we take the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in the factorization of each number: - The highest power of 2 that appears is 2^4 (from 16). - The highest power of 3 that appears is 3^2 (from 36). - The highest power of 5 that appears is 5 (from 30). So, the LCM of 8, 12, 16, 24, 30, and 36 is 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 16 * 9 * 5 = 1440. Now, we add the common remainder of 7 to the LCM to find the least number that leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by each of the given divisors: 1440 + 7 = 1447. Therefore, the least number that leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 8, 12, 16, 24, 30, and 36 is boxed{1447} ."},{"prompt":"A magician arranges a deck of 52 cards in a row and announces that 51 of them will be discarded from the table, leaving the three of clubs.

Under what initial positions of the three of clubs can the magician guarantee success in keeping the three of clubs?","completion":"To determine under what initial conditions the magician can guarantee that the three of clubs will be the last card remaining, we need to analyze the process step by step. 1. **Initialize the Deck:** - We have a deck of 52 cards, which includes the three of clubs, denoted as T. 2. **Process of Elimination:** - The spectator, at each step, says which position from the edge should be removed. - The magician selects if the count starts from the left or the right edge and discards the corresponding card. 3. **Outcome Analysis:** - The three of clubs, T, will be discarded only if it is positioned such that its removal is inevitable. This occurs if T is in the exact middle of the row at any given step. - If T is at one of the ends, it can be preserved by always selecting cards from the opposite end in the eliminating process. 4. **Case When T is Not on the Edge:** - Let's assume T is initially not on the edge. - Consider two potential strategies for the spectator that hinder T from staying until the end. 5. **Spectator Strategy 1: Avoid Edges:** - The spectator avoids suggesting the removal of edge positions, meaning only non-edge cards are suggested. - Eventually, when only 3 cards are left, if T remains it will be in the middle and thus can be called out as the second card to be removed by the spectator. 6. **Spectator Strategy 2: Matching Position:** - The spectator always names the current position of T. - The magician has no choice but to discard a different card (since the spectator systematically narrows down the positions). - This decreases the distance to the edges by 1 until inevitably creating a scenario where T is in the middle and must be removed. 7. **Ensuring Success:** - Placing T at an edge ensures it can be preserved throughout the elimination process. - With T at an edge, even if the number of calls matches the edge, T remains as long as non-edge cards are available to eliminate. **Conclusion:** Thus, the magician can guarantee the success of the trick if and only if the three of clubs is initially placed at one of the edges.

Detailed Proof: 1. Let us denote by (A) the set of all different (m times n) tables filled with the numbers (1, 2, ldots, k), with (1) appearing (a_1) times, (2) appearing (a_2) times, etc., (p) appearing (a_p) times, and (p+1) appearing (a_{p+1}) times, in increasing order in each row and column. 2. Similarly, let set (B) represent the tables with the same properties but with (a_p) and (a_{p+1}) swapped. That means (p) appears (a_{p+1}) times and (p+1) appears (a_p) times. 3. Consider any table (alpha) in set (A). We will focus on the positions filled with (p) and (p+1). Let (M) denote the set of these positions, which we will refer to as a “band”. 4. Clearly, in each column of the table, the band (M) intersects at most two squares due to the increasing order constraint. If a column intersects a band (M), then adjacent squares in that column might have (p) and (p+1) written in them, with (p) in the upper square and (p+1) immediately below it. 5. We can observe that if any row of the table intersects with more than one square of the band (M), the squares intersected must appear consecutively and be ordered such that any square containing (p) is to the left of any square containing (p+1). 6. Given this structure, suppose (M) intersects (q) columns with two squares each—these two squares are filled with (p) above and (p+1) below—and other columns with at most one square. Removing the (q) columns with double squares will dissect (M) into several disconnected horizontal strips each made of consecutive rows, called “horizontal strips”. 7. Each horizontal strip has (d_1) squares filled with (p) followed by (d_2) squares filled with (p+1). By swapping these assignments within each horizontal strip (i.e., swapping (d_1) and (d_2)), we create a new table (beta) where the count of squares containing (p) and (p+1) are swapped. 8. This transformation maps a table (alpha in A) to a new table (beta in B). Conversely, applying the same swap to any table in (B) will map it back to a table in (A). Hence, this process defines a bijection between sets (A) and (B). Therefore, the number of valid tables (or the value of function (L)) remains the same whether ( a_p ) and ( a_{p+1} ) are swapped. Consequently, the function (L) is invariant under the permutation of its arguments, as required. Hence, the desired equality holds true, establishing: [ L left( a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{p-1}, a_{p}, a_{p+1}, a_{p+2}, cdots, a_{k} right) = L left( a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{p-1}, a_{p+1}, a_{p}, a_{p+2}, cdots, a_{k} right). ] (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"The graph of the rational function frac{1}{q(x)} has vertical asymptotes at x=1, x=1, and x=3.

Since he runs at a rate of 10 miles per hour, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate Time (running) = 4 miles / 10 miles/hour = 0.4 hours Next, we need to find the total time for the entire trip. Since the average rate for the entire trip is 7.5 miles per hour and the total distance is 8 miles (4 miles running and 4 miles swimming), we use the formula: Total Time = Total Distance / Average Rate Total Time = 8 miles / 7.5 miles/hour = 1.0667 hours Now we have the total time for the trip and the time for the running portion. To find the time for the swimming portion, we subtract the running time from the total time: Time (swimming) = Total Time - Time (running) Time (swimming) = 1.0667 hours - 0.4 hours = 0.6667 hours Finally, we can find Dan's swimming speed by dividing the swimming distance by the time it took to swim: Swimming Speed = Distance (swimming) / Time (swimming) Swimming Speed = 4 miles / 0.6667 hours ≈ 6 miles/hour Therefore, Dan's swimming speed is approximately boxed{6} miles per hour."},{"prompt":"w many perfect cubes are between 250 and 1600?","completion":"First, find the smallest perfect cube greater than 250.
