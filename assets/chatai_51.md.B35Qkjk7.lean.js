This implies that if a root has an irrational part, its radical conjugate must also be a root to ensure the coefficients remain rational. Therefore, since 5-sqrt{2} is a root, its radical conjugate, 5+sqrt{2}, must also be a root.

Since monogramming each backpack costs 12.00 and Grandma wants to order 5 backpacks, the total cost for monogramming is: 5 backpacks * 12.00/backpack = 60.00 Now, we know that the total cost including the monogramming is 140.00. To find the cost of the backpacks before the monogramming, we subtract the monogramming cost from the total cost: 140.00 (total cost) - 60.00 (monogramming cost) = 80.00 (cost of backpacks without monogramming) If the backpacks cost 80.00 after the discount, and the original monogramming cost of 60.00 is added back in, the original price before the discount would have been: 80.00 (discounted backpacks) + 60.00 (monogramming) = 140.00 (original price before discount) Since the original price before the discount is the same as the total cost after the discount, it appears there is no discount applied to the backpacks.

According to the given information: - B invests double the amount of A after 6 months, which means B invests 2x after 6 months. - C invests thrice the amount of A after 8 months, which means C invests 3x after 8 months. Since profits in a partnership are divided in proportion to the product of the capital invested and the time for which it is invested, we can calculate the share of profits for A, B, and C as follows: A's share = x * 12 (since A invested for the entire year) B's share = 2x * 6 (since B invested for 6 months) C's share = 3x * 4 (since C invested for 4 months) The ratio of their profits will be: A : B : C = x * 12 : 2x * 6 : 3x * 4 A : B : C = 12x : 12x : 12x Since the ratio of their profits is equal, it means they all get an equal share of the profit. Given that A's share is Rs. 4,000, this means that the total profit is 3 times A's share (since there are three partners and they all get an equal share).

Since 512 > 255, we use 8^2 = 64. 1. **Determine the coefficient for 8^2**: - The largest multiple of 64 that is less than or equal to 255 is 3 times 64 = 192 (since 4 times 64 = 256, which is greater than 255). - This establishes the digit in the 8^2 place as 3. 2. **Subtract to find the remainder**: - Subtract 192 from 255 to find the remainder that needs to be expressed by lower powers of 8: 255 - 192 = 63. 3. **Proceed with lower powers (for 8^1 and 8^0)**: - The highest multiple of 8 less than or equal to 63 is 7 times 8 = 56. - This sets the digit in the 8^1 place as 7. - Subtract 56 from 63 to get 7, which is 7 times 8^0. - The digit in the 8^0 place is 7.

Each valid multiple of 11, depending on its digit structure (repeated digits or all different), can create 4! = 24 permutations if all digits are different. However, if any digit is zero or digits are repeated, the number of valid permutations will be less because permutations with a leading zero are not four-digit numbers, and repeated digits reduce the permutation count. Since it's computationally intensive to manually check each multiple of 11 for valid permutations and avoid leading zeros, let's perform a rough estimation: - Assume about half of the multiples of 11 can be fully permutable without repeats or leading zeros. This estimate adjusts for digits repeated and zeros present. Hence, around half of 900 approx 450 four-digit numbers are fully permutable. - For those with repeated digits or zero, consider roughly the other half, reducing the permutation count on average by a factor due to leading zeros or repeated digits (let's roughly estimate 12 valid permutations each). Thus, the estimated count would be (450 times 24 + 450 times 12 = 10800 + 5400 = 16200) permutations. We should then check for overcounting, such as permutations leading to numbers outside 1000 to 9999 or non-multiples of 11. Since we accounted roughly, our overestimation could balance the underestimations.

They appear in the expansion of the generating function: [ frac{x}{e^{x} - 1} = sum_{n=0}^{infty} B_n frac{x^n}{n!} ] By multiplying both sides of the equation by (e^x), we can derive related expressions and identities involving Bernoulli numbers. 2. **Expression for the Exponential and Sum**: Using the series expansion for the exponential function, we have: [ e^x = 1 + x + frac{x^2}{2!} + frac{x^3}{3!} + cdots ] Now consider the product of (e^x) and the generating function: [ e^x cdot frac{x}{e^x - 1} = left(1 + x + frac{x^2}{2!} + frac{x^3}{3!} + cdots right) sum_{n=0}^{infty} B_n frac{x^n}{n!} ] 3. **Sum Equals 1**: Note that multiplying these two series together must yield 1: [ left(1 + frac{x}{1!} + frac{x^2}{2!} + frac{x^3}{3!} + ldotsright) left(sum_{n=0}^{infty} B_n frac{x^n}{n!}right) = 1 ] 4. **Coefficient of (x^{k-1})**: We are specifically interested in the coefficient of (x^{k-1}) in the expansion.

A permutation (sigma: {1,2,ldots,n} to {1,2,ldots,n}) is called *straight* if for each integer ( k ), ( 1 leq k leq n-1 ), the inequality ( |sigma(k) - sigma(k+1)| leq 2 ) holds. 2. **Introduce the sequences:** Let ( x_n ) be the number of all straight permutations of length ( n ). Let ( a_n ) be the number of straight permutations having ( n ) on the first or last position. Let ( b_n ) be the difference ( x_n - a_n ). Let ( a_n' ) be the number of permutations having ( n ) on the first position. Let ( a_n'' ) be the number of permutations having ( n ) on the last position. 3. **Symmetry argument:** By symmetry, we have ( a_n' = a_n'' ) and thus ( a_n = 2a_n' ). 4. **Base cases:** Compute the initial values: [ a_2' = 1, quad a_3' = 2, quad a_4' = 4 ] 5. **Recurrence relation for ( a_n' ):** For ( n geq 5 ), consider the second position in the permutation: - If ( sigma(2) = n-1 ), the remaining positions can be filled in ( a_{n-1}' ) ways. - If ( sigma(2) = n-2 ), then: - If ( sigma(3) = n-1 ), the remaining positions can be filled in ( a_{n-3}' ) ways. - If ( sigma(n) = n-1 ), there is only one such permutation.

To find the range of x that satisfies this condition, we solve the inequality e^{x} > 1. Recall that the exponential function e^{x} is always positive and increases as x increases. The function equals 1 when x=0. Therefore, for e^{x} > 1, x must be greater than 0.

To find the range of x that satisfies this condition, we solve the quadratic inequality x^{2}-x-2 < 0.

Prove that n is divisible by 3.","completion":"1. **Initial Observation**: To solve the problem, we proceed by reducing it to a simpler case. Specifically, we assume that the camel's path does not intersect itself. This simplification is justified because loops and repeated crossings can be systematically removed as discussed in problem 25, without affecting the fundamental nature of the camel's path. 2. **Reduction to Simple Path**: Let us assume that the camel visits each node exactly once and returns to the starting node. We then focus on the map bounded by the camel's path as shown in the diagram (refer to Fig. 111 in the problem statement). 3. **Two-Color Map Coloring**: The bounded map can be properly colored using two colors. In this context: - Triangles adjacent to the camel's path on the right are colored black. - Triangles adjacent to the camel's path on the left are colored white. Therefore, all triangles adjacent to the external boundary will have the same color. This is because if we color the outside of the path (the external region) with the opposite two-color scheme, coloring the external region in the complementary color will yield a consistent two-coloring. 4. **Application of Problem 4**: By leveraging the results from problem 4, we know that: - For a map consisting predominantly of triangular regions, the number of borders (sides) in the external region that coincide with the camel’s path must be divisible by 3. In our case, the camel travels along the boundaries of triangles such that its entire path forms the external boundary of our map. 5. **Conclusion**: Since the camel returns to the starting point by definition, the number of steps made by the camel (which is twice the number of triangle sides on its path) must be divisible by 3. This directly implies that the total number of steps ( n ) must be divisible by 3. Therefore, we have proved that the number of steps ( n ) is divisible by 3.

Now evaluating the sum for ( n ) being a natural number, we also have: [ leftlfloor frac{n}{2^k} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{n}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor. ] This can be shown by substituting ( x ) in the basic identity above and making the following calculation.

If ( n = 2k ): [ leftlfloor frac{2k}{2^k} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{2k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor = k - leftlfloor frac{k}{2} rightrfloor, ] which is indeed the expression ( leftlfloor frac{2k + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor ).

If this is not possible, the year is classified as ominous. Which years are ominous?","completion":"We need to determine which years are unlucky according to the tradition of the Tribe of Mental Calculators. Unlucky years are those for which the first ( n ) positive integers cannot be subdivided into at least two groups such that the sum and the count of the numbers in any two groups are the same. 1. **Identify the Unlucky Years:** First, we need to prove the statement: The unlucky years are exactly 1 and the prime numbers. Composite numbers are lucky. 2. **Unlucky Year 1:** Considering ( n = 1 ): - Clearly, there is only one number: 1. - It cannot be subdivided into two groups. - Therefore, 1 is indeed an unlucky year. 3. **Unlucky Prime Numbers:** Considering ( n ) is a prime number: - Since ( n ) is prime, it cannot be divided into ( d geq 2 ) groups of equal size. - For ( d ) to divide the sum and count of any two groups, ( d mid n ) must be true. - Because ( n ) is prime, the only divisor ( d ) can be ( d = n ), meaning each number would be in its own separate group. - Thus, the sums of the groups will not be equal. - So, if ( n ) is prime, then it is an unlucky year. 4. **Lucky Composite Numbers:** Consider ( n ) is a composite number. - **Case 1: ( n ) is even (( n > 2 ))** - We construct pairs where the sum is ( n + 1 ): [ (1, n), (2, n-1), (3, n-2), ldots, left(frac{n}{2}, frac{n}{2} + 1right) ] - Each of these pairs sums to ( n + 1 ) and there are ( frac{n}{2} ) such pairs. - Therefore, even composite numbers (larger than 2) are lucky. - **Case 2: ( n ) is an odd composite number** - Let ( p ) be the smallest prime divisor of ( n ). - Since ( n ) is composite, (frac{n}{p}) is a positive integer and greater than 1. - Further assume ( n = p(p + 2k) ), where ( k ) is a non-negative integer. - We will show that the first ( n ) positive integers can be divided into ( p ) groups with equal sums. 5. **Creating the Grouping for Odd Composite Numbers:** - **Subdividing 1 to ( p^2 ):** 1. Arrange ( 1, 2, ldots, p^2 ) in a ( p times p ) table where ( (i-1)p + j ) represents the element in ( i )-th row and ( j )-th column. 2. Select groups such that each group contains one element from each row and each column. We can create ( p ) groups with: [ S = sum_{(i-1)p + j in S} [(i-1)p + j] ] Each group sum looks like: [ (0 + 1 + 2 + ldots + (p-1))p + (1 + 2 + ldots + p) ] 6. **Summing Partitions to Extend Groupings:** - Consider numbers ( p^2 + 1 ) to ( p^2 + 2kp ): - Form ( kp ) pairs: [ (p^2 + 1, p^2 + 2kp), (p^2 + 2, p^2 + 2kp - 1), ldots, (p^2 + kp, p^2 + kp + 1) ] - Each pair sums to the same value. - Complete the groups by adding ( k ) pairs to ( p ) groups formed in the table. Conclusion: Thus, every composite number ( n ) can be partitioned into equal-sized groups with equal sums, confirming that all composite numbers are lucky years. Therefore, the unlucky years are the first year and the years corresponding to prime numbers. [ boxed{1 text{ and prime number years}} ]"},{"prompt":"A bin contains 10 black balls and 9 white balls.

To build any 100-digit number overline{d_1 d_2 dots d_{100}} from a 99-digit number overline{d_1 d_2 dots d_{99}}, we append one more digit (1, 2, or 3). 4. Given a 99-digit number, let's analyze when the resulting 100-digit number will be divisible by 3. Let's denote the sum of the digits of the 99-digit number by S. - If S equiv 0 pmod{3} and we add 3 (since 3 equiv 0 pmod{3}), the sum remains divisible by 3. - If S equiv 1 pmod{3}, adding 2 (since 2 equiv -1 pmod{3}), the sum S+2 equiv 0 pmod{3}. - If S equiv 2 pmod{3}, adding 1 (since 1 equiv -2 pmod{3}), the sum S+1 equiv 0 pmod{3}. 5.

Let's assume Hari's contribution to the capital is Rs. H. The profit is divided in the ratio of 2:3 between Praveen and Hari, respectively. This means that for every 2 parts of profit that Praveen gets, Hari gets 3 parts. The time-adjusted capital for Praveen is: Praveen's capital * Number of months = Rs. 3780 * 12 The time-adjusted capital for Hari is: Hari's capital * Number of months = Rs. H * 7 The ratio of their time-adjusted capitals should be equal to the ratio of their profits, which is 2:3. So we have: (Praveen's time-adjusted capital) / (Hari's time-adjusted capital) = 2 / 3 Substituting the values we have: (3780 * 12) / (H * 7) = 2 / 3 Now we can solve for H: (3780 * 12) / (2) = (H * 7) / (3) Cross-multiplying to solve for H: 3 * (3780 * 12) = 2 * (H * 7) H = (3 * 3780 * 12) / (2 * 7) Calculating the value of H: H = (3 * 3780 * 12) / 14 H = (11340 * 12) / 14 H = 136080 / 14 H = 9720 Therefore, Hari's contribution to the capital is Rs. boxed{9720} ."},{"prompt":"A certain middle school has 3500 high school students and 1500 junior high school students.

We need to place these cards in 2 pairs. We can select 2 cards to be together in binom{4}{2} ways, without considering the order of the envelopes. Since the envelopes are distinguishable, the two pairs can be placed in 2 different envelopes in 2! ways.

We need to find all pairs of positive integers ((x, p)) such that (p) is a prime, (x leq 2p), and (x^{p-1}) is a divisor of ((p-1)^x + 1).

First, consider the case when (p = 2): [ x^{2-1} = x mid (2-1)^x + 1 = 1^x + 1 = 2 ] Therefore, (x) must be a divisor of 2, which gives (x = 1) or (x = 2). Hence, the pairs ((x, p)) are ((1, 2)) and ((2, 2)). 3. Next, observe that for any prime (p), the pair ((1, p)) works because: [ 1^{p-1} = 1 mid (p-1)^1 + 1 = p ] So, ((1, p)) is always a solution. 4. Now, assume (x > 1) and (p geq 3). Since ((p-1)^x + 1) is odd, (x) must also be odd. Consider the case when (x = p): [ v_p(x^{p-1}) = v_p(p^{p-1}) = p-1 ] We need: [ v_p((p-1)^p + 1) geq p-1 ] Using (p = 3): [ v_3(2^3 + 1) = v_3(9) = 2 ] This implies (p = 3).

If (r = 1), then (p-1 equiv 1 pmod{q}), which contradicts ((p-1)^x equiv -1 pmod{q}).

Using the triangle inequality for the triangle ( OCX ), we have: [ OC + CM = OM = OX < OC + CX ] This implies: [ CM < CX ] Hence, the distance ( CM ) is indeed the shortest distance from ( C ) to any point on the circle. 4. **Prove Using Power of a Point Theorem**: Extend the segment ( CO ) beyond ( O ) to intersect the circle at a second point ( N ). According to the power of a point theorem, for the chords intersecting at ( C ): [ CM cdot CN = AC cdot CB ] Substituting the given lengths: [ CM cdot (12 - CM) = 4 cdot 5 ] Simplifying, we get: [ CM cdot (12 - CM) = 20 ] This quadratic equation can be solved as follows: [ CM^2 - 12CM + 20 = 0 ] Solving this using the quadratic formula ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ) where ( a = 1 ), ( b = -12 ), and ( c = 20 ): [ CM = frac{12 pm sqrt{144 - 80}}{2} ] [ CM = frac{12 pm sqrt{64}}{2} ] [ CM = frac{12 pm 8}{2} ] [ CM = 10 text{ or } CM = 2 ] Given ( CM < OM = 6 ), we discard ( CM = 10 ) and accept ( CM = 2 ).

The price of green tea dropped by 90%, so the new price per pound of green tea is ( C - 90% times C = C - 0.9C = 0.1C ) dollars. In July, a mixture containing equal quantities of green tea and coffee costs 3.15 for 3 lbs. Since the mixture contains equal quantities of green tea and coffee, we can assume that it contains 1.5 lbs of green tea and 1.5 lbs of coffee. The cost of 1.5 lbs of green tea in July is ( 1.5 times 0.1C ) dollars, and the cost of 1.5 lbs of coffee in July is ( 1.5 times 2C ) dollars. The total cost of the mixture is the sum of the cost of green tea and coffee, which is ( 1.5 times 0.1C + 1.5 times 2C ).

Similarly, it cannot have 1 as a side length, since the adjacent rectangle will have side length ( 12 - 1 = 11 > 10 ). Hence, ( 1 times 6 ) must be the dimensions of the \\"core\\" square.

Connect these points with 4 line segments, with each point being an endpoint of at least one segment. How many different ways can these connections be made? To find all the different ways to connect the 5 points using 4 line segments under the given conditions, we will consider various configurations as follows: (1) Star Configuration: One point is the central point connected to all other four points. There are (5) ways to choose the central point and connect it to the other four points: 1. (A) is the center point connected to (B, C, D, E) 2. (B) is the center point connected to (A, C, D, E) 3. (C) is the center point connected to (A, B, D, E) 4. (D) is the center point connected to (A, B, C, E) 5. (E) is the center point connected to (A, B, C, D) Thus, there are (5) valid configurations in the star pattern. (2) Line Configuration: Treat the 5 points as a linear arrangement where each point is connected to its adjacent points. Since any linear permutation of 5 points can be converted into another by reversing the order, we calculate the number of unique permutations modulo reversals: [ frac{5!}{2} = frac{120}{2} = 60 ] Thus, there are 60 unique configurations for linear arrangements. (3) Branch Configuration: Choose one distinguished point, then select two branches, one with two points and one with one point. We can break this into three steps: - Choose the distinguished point: (5) ways - Choose 2 points out of the remaining 4 to form a branch: (binom{4}{2} = 6) ways - Choose the order of the last 2 points in the branch: (2!) ways Combining all these gives us: [ 5 times 6 times 2 = 60 ] Thus, there are 60 configurations of this type. (4) Quadrilateral Plus One Point: Choose 4 points to form a quadrilateral, with the fifth point connected to one of them. There are (binom{5}{4} = 5) ways to choose the four points for the quadrilateral. Once chosen, there are (frac{4!}{2} = 12) ways to arrange these points into a specific linked order forming a quadrilateral (accounting for symmetry).

When they work together, their combined rate is B + A. Given that Anne can clean the house on her own in 12 hours, her rate A is 1/12 houses per hour. When Bruce and Anne work together, they can clean the house in 4 hours, so their combined rate is 1/4 houses per hour. Therefore, we have: B + A = 1/4 We know that A = 1/12, so we can substitute this into the equation: B + 1/12 = 1/4 To find B, we subtract 1/12 from both sides: B = 1/4 - 1/12 To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12: B = (3/12) - (1/12) B = 2/12 B = 1/6 So, Bruce's rate of cleaning is 1/6 houses per hour. Now, if Anne's speed were doubled, her new rate would be 2A, which is 2 * 1/12 = 1/6 houses per hour. If they work together with Anne's doubled speed, their new combined rate would be: B + 2A = 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3 houses per hour.

An employee performs a series of operations named T_{1}, T_{2}, ldots, T_{n} on these lockers. Specifically, T_{k} (for 1 leq k leq n) entails toggling the lockers labeled with all multiples of k—locking them if they were unlocked and unlocking them if they were locked. After completing these n operations, it is observed that only lockers labeled with perfect squares remain unlocked. Provide a mathematical proof for this observation. (2) Investigate several meaningful sequences of operations in mathematics such that the lockers labeled with specific numbers, such as exactly the perfect squares or numbers of the form 2m^{2}, or the form m^{2}+1, or any other similar non-square forms remain unlocked. 1. To prove that after completing the n operations, only lockers labeled with perfect squares are unlocked, let's carefully analyze the operations on a locker labeled m (1 leq m leq n): - Represent m using its prime factorization: m = p_{1}^{alpha_{1}} p_{2}^{alpha_{2}} cdots p_{k}^{alpha_{k}} - The number of divisors of m, denoted by d(m), is given by: d(m) = (alpha_{1} + 1) (alpha_{2} + 1) cdots (alpha_{k} + 1) - Each divisor of m corresponds to an operation T_{k} that is applied to locker m. Therefore, the number of times locker m is toggled is equal to the number of divisors of m. - A locker is unlocked if it is toggled an odd number of times. This requires d(m) to be odd. If d(m) is odd, then each exponent alpha_{i} in the prime factorization of m must be even (since adding 1 to each exponent results in an odd number). Therefore, m must be a perfect square. - Hence, after all operations T_{1}, T_{2}, ldots, T_{n}, only lockers labeled with perfect squares will be unlocked, as those are the only ones toggled an odd number of times. Conclusion for part (1): boxed{Only lockers labeled with perfect squares remain unlocked.} 2. Now, consider different operation sequences that result in specific patterns for the unlocked lockers: - Let's take an operation T_{k} that toggles lockers labeled with multiples of 2k. This will create a set of lockers such that: m = 2qk Rightarrow m = 2m^2 - If we define another operation T_{k} to toggle lockers labeled as: m = k + 1 - Perform operation T_{i} for i which are of form: m^2 + 1 Conclusion for part (2): [ As we design these specific operations, different sets of lockers such as {2m^{2}, m^{2}+1} will remain unlocked. ] Thus, with these mathematical analyses and operation sequences, we can conclude that specific lockers will be unlocked based on designed operations. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Find the minimum value of 16^x 4^x + 1 over all real numbers x.","completion":"Let y = 4^x.

So we can write the following equation: p - 12 = 1/2 * (q - 12) [Equation 1] We are also given that the total of their present ages is 42: p + q = 42 [Equation 2] Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of p and q. First, let's rearrange Equation 1 to express p in terms of q: p = 1/2 * (q - 12) + 12 p = 1/2 * q - 6 + 12 p = 1/2 * q + 6 Now, we can substitute this expression for p into Equation 2: (1/2 * q + 6) + q = 42 Now, let's solve for q: 1/2 * q + q = 42 - 6 1.5 * q = 36 q = 36 / 1.5 q = 24 Now that we have q, we can find p using Equation 2: p + 24 = 42 p = 42 - 24 p = 18 So, the present age of p is 18 and the present age of q is 24.

This is crucial because it tells us that the vertex of the parabola is located at x=-2. 2. **Determine the Distance Between Intersection Points**: The distance between the two intersection points of the parabola and the x-axis is given as 6. Since these points are symmetrically located around the axis of symmetry, and the total distance between them is 6, each point is 3 units away from the axis of symmetry. 3. **Calculate the Coordinates of Intersection Points**: Given the axis of symmetry x=-2 and knowing each intersection point is 3 units away from it, we can find the x-coordinates of these points. Moving 3 units to the left of -2 gives us -2 - 3 = -5. Moving 3 units to the right of -2 gives us -2 + 3 = 1. Therefore, the x-coordinates of the intersection points are -5 and 1, respectively. Since these points lie on the x-axis, their y-coordinates are 0.

Therefore, based on the coordinates of the intersection points, the solutions to the equation in terms of x are x_1 = -5 and x_2 = 1.

Let the slope of PA be k(k neq 0), then the slope of PB is - dfrac{1}{k}. The equation of line PA is y=k(x+2).

Each ( a_i in S_1 ) eliminates ( 2^{r-1} ) residues mod ( 2^r ), each ( a_i in S_2 ) eliminates ( 2^{r-2} ) residues mod ( 2^r ), and in general each ( a_i in S_k ) eliminates ( 2^{r-k} ) residues mod ( 2^r ). Here ( k leq r ) since we have yet to choose any ( x_i ) in ( S_k ) with ( k > r ). So the number of residues eliminated is at most: [ sum_{k=1}^{r} 2^{r-k} |S_k| = 2^r sum_{k=1}^r frac{|S_k|}{2^k} < 2^r, ] where we applied our inequality above. This means at least one residue mod ( 2^r ) is available to choose for ( a_i ). 5. **Construct the sequence of optimistic reports:** Start all indicators at 1. By default, increase each indicator by 1 the next year, and reset indicator ( i ) to 1 when the year number is ( x_i ) mod ( 2^r ) (where ( r ) is such that ( a_i in S_r )). Because the chosen residues do not overlap, this will never reset two indicators at once. Furthermore, indicator ( i ) is reset every ( 2^r ) years where ( 2^r leq a_i ), so no indicator will exceed its maximum value.

Let the number of coins reported by the i-th individual be (C_i), where (1 leq C_i leq 10). 4. According to the problem, the total sum of the reported coins is (36), so: [ sum_{i=1}^{10} C_i = 36 ] 5.

The actual sum (36) is smaller than the maximum sum (55) by: [ 55 - 36 = 19 ] 7. This difference is caused by the wizards reporting false numbers. Let’s assume each individual either over-reported or under-reported by some amount. 8. Now, suppose each wizard lied on average by (x) coins when reporting (either over-reporting or under-reporting). The total error caused by all (W) wizards combined would sum to 19 coins: [ W cdot x = 19 ] 9. The minimum possible integer value for (x) (magnitude of discrepancy) is (1). Therefore, with (x = 1): [ W = 19 ] 10. However, (W) being equal to 19 is impossible because we only have 10 individuals in total.

The order in which we choose the 2 people for the committee does not matter, so we are dealing with combinations here, not permutations. - First, we choose one person out of the remaining 7, which can be done in 7 ways. - Then, we choose the second person out of the remaining 6, which can be done in 6 ways. - Therefore, without considering the order, the total number of ways to choose 2 people out of 7 is 7 times 6. 3. **Correct for Overcounting**: Since the order of selection does not matter for the committee, every pair is counted twice in our calculation (once for each order they could be picked in). To correct for this, we divide by the number of ways to arrange 2 people, which is 2 (since 2 people can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways). 4. **Combine the Steps**: Combining the steps, we have the total number of ways to choose a president and then a 2-person committee as follows: [ 8 times frac{7 times 6}{2} = 8 times 21 = 168 ] Therefore, the total number of ways to choose a president and a 2-person committee from 8 people is boxed{168}."},{"prompt":"The average weight of some boys in a class is 48 kgs.

(1) If a tourist group with x people (x > 10) visits the scenic area: ① On a nonholiday, the amount to be paid is ______ yuan; ② On a holiday, the amount to be paid is ______ yuan. (2) Sunshine Travel Agency organized Group A on May 1st (a holiday) and Group B on May 10th (a nonholiday) to visit the scenic area. The total ticket cost for both trips was 1840 yuan. It is known that Groups A and B together consist of 50 people. How many people are in Groups A and B respectively?","completion":"# Solution: Part 1: **(1)** For a tourist group with x people visiting on a non-holiday: The original price per person is 50 yuan. With a 40% discount, the price becomes 50 times frac{6}{10} = 30 yuan per person. Therefore, for x people, the total cost is: 50 times frac{6}{10}x = 30x Hence, the amount to be paid on a non-holiday is boxed{30x} yuan. **(2)** For a tourist group with x people visiting on a holiday: For the first 10 people, the price remains the original, which is 50 yuan per person, totaling 50 times 10 = 500 yuan. For the remaining (x-10) people, a 20% discount is applied, making the price per person 50 times frac{8}{10} = 40 yuan. Thus, the total cost for the remaining people is 40 times (x-10). The total amount to be paid is: 50 times 10 + 40 times (x-10) = 500 + 40(x-10) = 40x + 100 Therefore, the amount to be paid on a holiday is boxed{40x + 100} yuan.

Therefore, we discard this solution. - **Case 2:** When m > 10, the equation is: 40(m-10) + 500 + 30(50-m) = 1840 Solving this equation: 40m - 400 + 500 + 1500 - 30m = 1840 10m + 1600 = 1840 10m = 240 m = 24 Therefore, the number of tourists in Group A is 24.

If circle C_1 is externally tangent to circle C_2, then the value of the real number m is ____.","completion":"To solve for m, we first convert the equations of circles C_1 and C_2 to their Cartesian forms and then use the condition that they are externally tangent to each other. Let's start with C_1. The polar equation of C_1 can be rewritten as: rho = -2sqrt{2}left(costhetacosfrac{pi}{4} + sinthetasinfrac{pi}{4}right) = -2costheta - 2sintheta. Converting this to Cartesian coordinates by using rho^2 = x^2 + y^2, rhocostheta = x, and rhosintheta = y, we get: x^2 + y^2 = -2x - 2y. Rearranging terms, the standard form equation of C_1 is: x^2 + y^2 + 2x + 2y = 0. The center C_1 of the circle is at (-1, -1) since by completing the square we would add 1 to both x and y terms. The radius r_1 of C_1 is sqrt{2} since (x+1)^2+(y+1)^2=2. Now let's find the standard form equation for C_2. From the parametric equations, we have: (x - 2)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = m^2. Thus, the center C_2 of this circle is at (2, 2), and its radius r_2 is |m|. Since the circles are externally tangent, their radii added together is equal to the distance between their centers: |r_1| + |r_2| = |C_1C_2|. Calculating the distance between centers C_1 (-1, -1) and C_2 (2, 2) using the distance formula, we get: |C_1C_2| = sqrt{(2 - (-1))^2 + (2 - (-1))^2} = 3sqrt{2}. Therefore, the equation becomes: sqrt{2} + |m| = 3sqrt{2}, which implies that |m| = 2sqrt{2}. Since m can be either positive or negative, we have m = pm 2sqrt{2}.

Let ( ell ) be the number of white balls. Hence, [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} f(k) = ell(ell-1) + (n-ell)(n-ell-1) ] This is because each white ball pairs with (ell-1) other white balls, and each black ball pairs with (n-ell-1) other black balls. 3. **Minimizing the RHS:** The right-hand side (RHS) attains its minimum when (ell = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor).

This ensures that no matter how you shift the balls, at most (frac{n-1}{2}) balls will remain the same color. 3. **Verify the condition:** For any ( k ), the number of balls that remain the same color after shifting ( k ) positions is at most (frac{n-1}{2}).

Then ( n+1 = 4 ), which is not square-free (since ( 4 = 2^2 )). - The matrix ( M(3) ) is: [ M(3) = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 1 & 1 & 0 1 & 0 & 1 end{pmatrix} ] - The determinant of ( M(3) ) is ( det(M(3)) = 1 cdot (1 cdot 1 - 0 cdot 0) - 0 cdot (1 cdot 1 - 0 cdot 1) + 0 cdot (1 cdot 0 - 1 cdot 1) = 1 ), which is non-zero.

Consider a cube of side length (6). This cube can be divided into (6 times 6 times 6 = 216) unit cubes. 2.

Each unit cube has a center that lies within the larger cube. 4. Since each unit cube must be completely contained within the larger cube, all points in (S) must be contained in a (5 times 5 times 5) unit cube with the same center as the large cube. This is because the unit cubes must fit entirely within the larger cube, and the centers of the unit cubes must be at least (0.5) units away from the boundary of the larger cube. 5. Partition the (5 times 5 times 5) cube into (1000) separate (frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2}) cubes.

If two centers are in the same (frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2}) cube, they are within (frac{1}{2}) unit of each other in each direction.

During his journey, he traveled west for at most 19000 text{ km}. Prove that there was a moment when the difference between the distances traveled east and west was at least half the length of the equator.","completion":"1. **Introduction of the Problem:** We need to prove that there was a time when the difference between the distances Aladdin traveled eastward and westward was at least half the circumference of the equator. 2. **Notation and Setting Up the Problem:** - Let (A) represent Aladdin's position. - Let (A') be the antipodal point of (A) on the equator. Note that if Aladdin moves to the antipodal point, (A) and (A') simply swap places. - Initially, let (A) start at a point (A_0) and (A') start at the corresponding antipodal point (A_0'). 3. **Path Description:** - Throughout Aladdin's journey on the equator, denote the farthest point westward that (A) reaches as (P). - Assume that Aladdin never reaches a point where the difference between his traveled distances eastward and westward is less than half the equator's length. 4. **Contradiction Assumption:** - Suppose the difference between the traveled distances eastward and westward by (A) is always less than half the equator’s length. - The length of the equator is approximately (40,000 , text{km}), so half of it is (20,000 , text{km}). - Under this assumption, (A) cannot travel into the arc (P A_0') because the length from (A_0) to (P) is at most (19,000 , text{km}). 5. **Path of (A'):** - Symmetrically, (A') cannot travel into the arc (P' A_0) because (A_0') to (P') also covers no more than (19,000 , text{km}). 6. **Number of Times Traveling Through Points:** - Together, (A) and (A') must pass through every point on the equator at least twice. This follows because both points together cover the entire equator. 7. **Contradiction Development:** - If (A) cannot cover the arc (P' A_0) even once due to the smaller westward traveling limit, Aladdin must have repeatedly covered the eastward direction or westward into unreachable arcs according to the assumption. - However, since (A') should have been confined within its limited arc adjacent to (A)’s arcs, this is not possible without (A') also breaking the (19,000 , text{km}) limit, hence violating the assumption. 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, by contradiction, the assumption that A always maintained a difference in distance traveled eastward and westward of less than the half equatorial circumference cannot hold. There must have been an instance where the difference was at least half the circumference of the equator.

Prove that for any natural number ( n ), all the fixed points of ( p_{n}(x) ) are distinct real numbers.","completion":"**Step 1:** Let p_1(x) = x^2 - 2. For each integer j geq 2, define p_j(x) = p_1(p_{j-1}(x)). We need to show that for any given natural number n, all the fixed points of p_n(x) are real numbers and are distinct. **Step 2:** Consider ( p_1(x) = x^2 - 2 ). Notice that p_1(x) is strictly increasing for x > 0. Let's use mathematical induction to prove that for any natural number n, if |x| > 2, then p_n(x) > |x|. - **Base Case:** When n = 1, we have p_1(x) = x^2 - 2. For |x| > 2: [ x^2 - 2 > |x| ] Since |x| > 2: [ x^2 > 4 quad Rightarrow quad x^2 - 2 > 2 quad Rightarrow quad x^2 - 2 > |x| ] This proves the base case. - **Inductive Step:** Suppose the statement holds for some k geq 1, i.e., p_k(x) > |x| for |x| > 2. We need to show it holds for k + 1. Since p_k(x) > |x|, and p_1(x) is increasing for x > 0, it follows that [ p_{k+1}(x) = p_1(p_k(x)) > p_1(|x|) = |x|^2 - 2 ] Since |x| > 2, [ |x|^2 - 2 > |x| ] Hence, p_{k+1}(x) > |x|. This completes the induction. **Step 3:** Therefore, p_n(x) > |x| for |x| > 2. This implies that the equation p_n(x) = x has no real roots for |x| > 2. So all real roots of the equation p_n(x) = x must lie within |x| leq 2. **Step 4:** To further dig into this, let x = 2 cos t. Then, [ p_1(x) = x^2 - 2 = 4 cos^2 t - 2 = 2 cos 2t ] Let's use induction again for p_n: - **Base Case:** For n = 1, p_1(x) = 2 cos 2t. - **Inductive Step:** Suppose p_{n-1}(x) = 2 cos 2^{n-1} t. Then, [ p_n(x) = p_1(p_{n-1}(x)) = 4 cos^2 2^{n-1} t - 2 = 2 cos 2^n t ] Hence, p_n(x) = 2 cos 2^n t. Thus, the original equation is transformed into: [ 2 cos 2^n t = 2 cos t ] This is satisfied iff: [ sin frac{(2^n - 1) t}{2} sin frac{(2^n + 1) t}{2} = 0 ] **Step 5:** Solving the above, we get: [ frac{(2^n - 1) t}{2} = k pi quad text{and} quad frac{(2^n + 1) t}{2} = l pi ] for integers k and l. Therefore, [ t = frac{2kpi}{2^n - 1} quad text{and} quad t = frac{2lpi}{2^n + 1} ] Transforming back to the x notation, the roots are: [ x = 2 cos frac{2kpi}{2^n - 1}, quad k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 2^{n-1} - 1 ] and [ x = 2 cos frac{2lpi}{2^{n} + 1}, quad l = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 2^{n-1} ] **Step 6:** There are 2^{n-1} fixed points from the first set and 2^{n-1} + 1 from the second set. We now show there are no duplicated fixed points between the two sets other than l = k = 0. Suppose [ frac{2kpi}{2^n - 1} = frac{2lpi}{2^n + 1} quad Rightarrow quad k(2^n + 1) = l(2^n - 1) ] Since 2^n + 1 and 2^n - 1 are co-prime, k must be a multiple of (2^n - 1), which is impossible since k < 2^n - 1. Thus, other than k = l = 0, there are no other common points. **Conclusion:** This ensures that there are 2^n distinct fixed points for p_n(x), confirming that all fixed points of p_n(x) are real and distinct.

Substituting b = ma into the original equation, we get: [ 100a + ma = k cdot a cdot ma implies a(100 + m) = k cdot a cdot ma implies 100 + m = k cdot m cdot a ] This gives us: [ 100 + m = k cdot ma ] 5.

Denote the common interior point by (P), and connect (P) to the centers of the six circles, which we'll denote as (A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6). 2. The six rays (PA_1, PA_2, PA_3, PA_4, PA_5, PA_6) determine six angles around the point (P). These angles must sum to (360^circ). 3. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of these angles must be ( leq 60^circ ). Assume this angle is (angle A_i P A_j leq 60^circ) for some (i, j). 4. This means that the triangle (A_i PA_j) has (angle A_j PA_i leq 60^circ). 5. In triangle (A_i PA_j), at least one of the other angles, (angle PA_iA_j) or (angle PA_jA_i), must be (geq 60^circ). Let's say, without loss of generality, that (angle PA_j A_i geq 60^circ). 6. Since (P) is an interior point of all six circles, we have (PA_i < r_{A_i}) and (PA_j < r_{A_j}), where (r_{A_i}) and (r_{A_j}) are the radii of the circles centered at (A_i) and (A_j) respectively. 7. Given that (angle PA_j A_i geq 60^circ), by the Law of Sines in (triangle PA_i A_j), [ frac{A_iA_j}{sin angle PA_jA_i} = PA_j cdot frac{1}{sin angle PA_iA_j} ] 8. Since (sin angle PA_jA_i leq sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}), we get that (A_iA_j geq PA_j). 9. Hence, (A_iA_j < r_{A_j}). 10. This implies that the circle centered at (A_j) with radius (r_{A_j}) contains the point (A_i). # Conclusion: Thus, there exists at least one circle among the six whose center is an interior point of another circle.

When air is blown through a wide end and out the narrow end of a cone, the airflow is concentrated. - If the narrow end is not aligned correctly, then the airflow spreads out and does not exert enough force on the flame to extinguish it. 5. **Correct Method**: - Lower the cone until the dotted line ( CA ), as shown in the illustration, crosses the flame. - In this alignment, the ideal angle and position allow the focused airflow to hit the flame directly, increasing the chances of extinguishing it. 6. **Understanding the Alignment**: - Position the flame within the path of the direct airflow coming out of the narrow end of the cone. 7. **Conclusion**: - Any attempt to blow out the candle by placing it at the center of the wider end of the cone and blowing without considering the airflow alignment is doomed to fail.

Now we can set up an equation for the total gallons used: 3 gallons (first car) + 150/x gallons (second car) + 10 gallons (third car) = 28 gallons 3 + 150/x + 10 = 28 Combine the constants: 13 + 150/x = 28 Subtract 13 from both sides: 150/x = 28 - 13 150/x = 15 Now, solve for x by multiplying both sides by x and then dividing by 15: 150 = 15x x = 150 / 15 x = 10 So, the average mileage per gallon of gas for the second car is boxed{10} miles per gallon."},{"prompt":"Find the ordered pair (x, y) that satisfies the equations 3x 18y = 5 and 4y x = 6.","completion":"The given equations are 1. 3x - 18y = 5 2. 4y - x = 6.

According to the information given: - 22% of the customers are caught sampling the candy. This means 22 customers are caught and fined. - 5% of the customers who sample the candy are not caught. To find out how many customers this represents, we need to know the total percentage of customers who sample the candy. Let's call the total percent of customers who sample candy \\"x\\". This means that x% of the 100 customers sample the candy. Out of these x customers, 5% are not caught. So, 0.05x customers are not caught. Now, we know that 22% are caught, and this represents (100% - 5%) of the customers who sample the candy because 5% are not caught. So, the caught customers represent 95% of all customers who sample candy.

Show that the midpoints of the other three sides form an equilateral triangle.","completion":"1. **Initial Setup**: Consider a hexagon inscribed in a circle with radius 1. The hexagon has alternate sides of length 1. Thus, the hexagon can be seen as having vertices that are equidistantly placed on the circle. Let the vertices of the hexagon be ( A, B, C, D, E, F ) in order. 2. **Properties of Inscribed Hexagon**: Because the hexagon is symmetrical and it is inscribed in the circle, the center ( O ) of the circle is also the center of symmetry of the hexagon. Therefore, the angles at the center subtended by each of the sides are equal. 3. **Angles Subtended by Sides**: Let the angles subtended by the sides ( AB, CD, ) and ( EF ) (each of length 1) at the center ( O ) be ( 2A, 2B, ) and ( 2C ) respectively. Hence, ( A + B + C = 90^circ ) because the sum of angles subtended by the sides of a hexagon at the center is ( 360^circ ) and there are three pairs of alternate sides. 4. **Distance from Center to Midpoints**: The midpoints of the sides ( BC ), ( DE ), and ( FA ) (denoted ( M, N, ) and ( P ) respectively) form a triangle. Since ( O ) is the center, the distances from ( O ) to each of these midpoints are ( cos(A), cos(B), ) and ( cos(C) ). 5. **Angle between Lines**: The line segments ( OM ) and ( ON ) subtend an angle of ( A + B + 60^circ ) at the center, since ( angle BOM = A ) and ( angle DON = B ) plus the equilateral triangle contributes ( 60^circ ). 6. **Distance Formula Application**: Using the distance formula for points on a circle, the square of the distance ( d ) between ( M ) and ( N ) can be calculated using that angle: [ d^2 = cos^2(A) + cos^2(B) - 2 cos(A) cos(B) cos(A + B + 60^circ) ] 7. **Trigonometric Simplifications**: Using the identity (cos(A+B+60^circ) = cos(150^circ - C) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos C + frac{1}{2} sin C ), we get [ cos(A+B+60^circ) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos C + frac{1}{2} sin C. ] 8. **Expanding and Simplifying**: Substituting, we get: [ d^2 = cos^2(A) + cos^2(B) + cos^2(C) + sqrt{3} cos(A) cos(B) cos(C) - (cos(A) cos(B) sin(C) + cos(A) sin(B) cos(C) + sin(A) cos(B) cos(C)). ] 9. **Symmetrical Form**: Given ( cos C = sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B ), the expression simplifies to a symmetrical form involving periodic repetition among ( A, B, ) and ( C ). 10. **Conclusion**: Hence, this substantiates that the triangle formed by the midpoints of the alternate sides is equilateral, as all sides of the triangle have equal length.

The allowed operation is to swap two numbers in a row if they differ by 1 and are not adjacent. We are to find the largest possible value of n such that no two rows can be made identical through the allowed operations. 1. **Representation of Permutations using Signs:** Consider a row ( [x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{100}] ), which is a permutation of ([1, 2, ldots, 100]). We can represent this permutation by a sequence of ( 99 ) signs, each of which is either ( < ) or ( > ), depending on whether consecutive elements increase or decrease. Specifically: [ text{sign}_k = begin{cases} < & text{if } x_k < x_{k+1}, > & text{if } x_k > x_{k+1}. end{cases} ] 2. **Invariance under Allowed Swaps:** The allowed operations do not change the sequence of these ( < ) and ( > ) signs. Consider a swap between ( x_k ) and ( x_m ) where ( |x_k - x_m| = 1 ) and ( m neq k+1 ). The nature of this swap means that such a swap cannot reverse the sign of any pair that becomes adjacent after the swap. 3. **Number of Distinct Patterns:** Since the sequence of signs (from any row) remains invariant under the allowed operations, it suffices to count the number of distinct sequences of ( 99 ) signs. Each sign can either be ( < ) or ( > ), leading to ( 2^{99} ) possible different sequences. 4. **Construction of Distinct Permutations:** Let's consider constructing a \\"canonical\\" permutation for each sequence of signs to ensure all rows are distinct. Given a sign pattern, we form a permutation by the following rule: - For ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 99 ): - If (text{sign}_k = >), place the largest remaining number in the ((k+1))-th position, otherwise place the smallest remaining number. - The last number, ( x_{100} ), is the remaining unused number. 5. **Examples to Clarify Construction:** - If all signs are ( < ): the sequence would be ( [1, 2, 3, ldots, 100] ). - If all signs are ( > ): the sequence would be ( [100, 99, ldots, 1] ). 6. **Proof by Contradiction:** Suppose there were more than ( 2^{99} ) rows, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least two rows would map to the same sequence of signs.

Finally, we will calculate the probability of journalist A being assigned to group A. **Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to assign the 4 journalists to the 3 groups.** Since each group must have at least one journalist, we can think of this problem as first choosing 2 journalists to form a pair (which can be assigned to any of the 3 groups), and then assigning the remaining 2 journalists to the other two groups. This can be calculated as follows: - Choose 2 journalists out of 4 to form the first pair: {C}_{4}^{2} ways. - Choose 1 journalist out of the remaining 2 to form the second group: {C}_{2}^{1} ways. - The last journalist automatically goes to the third group: {C}_{1}^{1} way. - Since the groups are distinct, we need to account for the permutations of the groups among the 3 chosen sets of journalists: {A}_{3}^{3} ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to assign the 4 journalists to the 3 groups is: [ frac{{C}_{4}^{2}{C}_{2}^{1}{C}_{1}^{1}}{{A}_{2}^{2}} times {A}_{3}^{3} = 36 ] **Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to assign journalist A to group A.** - Assign journalist A to group A directly: {A}_{3}^{3} ways for the remaining journalists to be assigned to groups B and C. - Or, choose 2 journalists from the remaining 3 (not including A) to form the other groups, and then permute these groups: {C}_{3}^{2}{A}_{2}^{2} ways. Therefore, the number of ways to assign journalist A to group A is: [ {A}_{3}^{3} + {C}_{3}^{2}{A}_{2}^{2} = 12 ] **Step 3: Calculate the probability of journalist A being assigned to group A.** The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: [ frac{12}{36} = frac{1}{3} ] Therefore, the probability that journalist A will be assigned to group A is boxed{frac{1}{3}}.

Since each lap is 1/6th of a mile and the boys ran 34 laps, we can calculate the distance the boys ran as follows: Boys' distance = 34 laps * (1/6 mile/lap) = 34/6 miles Now, let's simplify that fraction: Boys' distance = 5 4/6 miles (since 34 divided by 6 is 5 with a remainder of 4) Boys' distance = 5 2/3 miles (simplifying 4/6 to 2/3) Now we know the girls ran 9 miles. To find out how many more miles the girls ran than the boys, we subtract the boys' distance from the girls' distance: Girls' additional distance = 9 miles - 5 2/3 miles To subtract these, we need a common denominator, which is 3 in this case: Girls' additional distance = 27/3 miles - 17/3 miles (since 9 = 27/3 and 5 2/3 = 17/3) Girls' additional distance = 10/3 miles Now we need to find out how many laps this additional distance represents. Since each lap is 1/6th of a mile, we divide the additional distance by 1/6 to find the number of additional laps: Girls' additional laps = (10/3 miles) / (1/6 lap/mile) To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: Girls' additional laps = (10/3 miles) * (6 laps/mile) Now we multiply the numerators and the denominators: Girls' additional laps = (10 * 6) / (3 * 1) laps Girls' additional laps = 60/3 laps Girls' additional laps = 20 laps So, the girls ran boxed{20} more laps than the boys."},{"prompt":"Joey the postman runs a 5mile long route every day.

It concludes its strike period after adding precisely two more strikes, reaching its count for ( h ) th hour. 5. **Identification of Hour ( h )**: - The two-hour increment due to delayed completions is observed only at the beginning where the synchronization starts. Hence, one should calculate this doubling only at initial time ( h = 3 ). - If we relate the ( h ): When ( h = 5 ), it would synchronize with ( frac{2}{3}h + approx 2 = 5:2).

Therefore, we have two possibilities for the y-coordinate: - y = 13 + 5 = 18 - y = 13 - 5 = 8 2. **Distance from the point (7,13):** The distance formula states that the distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}.

Since there are 55 people in total and 30 of them are boys, we can calculate the number of girls as follows: - Total number of people at the track meet = 55 - Number of boys = 30 Therefore, the number of girls = Total number of people - Number of boys [= 55 - 30] [= 25] Next, we find out how many of these girls have long hair. We are told that three fifths of the girls have long hair.

Since cos 60^circ = frac{1}{2}, and in the second quadrant the cosine of an angle is the negative of its reference angle, we have cos 120^circ = -frac{1}{2}. 4.

Determine for which positive integers ( n ), there exists a double-neighbor set containing exactly ( n ) lattice points. 1. **Key Observation:** - If ( S ) is a double-neighbor set containing ( n ) lattice points, then ( n ) must be an even number. 2. **Proof:** - Connect each pair of neighboring lattice points ( (p, q) ) with a line segment if they are connected by their coordinates being 1 unit apart horizontally or vertically. - Every point in ( S ) must be connected to exactly 2 other points by line segments. Thus, the structure of ( S ) can be represented as a collection of finite, non-self-intersecting closed polygonal chains (closed walks). 3. **Properties of Closed Polygonal Chains:** - In each closed polygonal chain, alternating coordinates (horizontal and vertical) of neighboring points are such that every step alternates between changing and not changing a coordinate. - Hence, each step in the walk must cycle through even and odd values for coordinates, ensuring that the total number of points in the polygonal chain is even. 4. **Eliminating Small Even ( n ):** - Consider the smallest even numbers ( n = 2, 4, 6 ) to see if they can form a double-neighbor set. - ( n = 2 ): Clearly, 2 points cannot form a valid double-neighbor set. - ( n = 6 ): It's not possible for 6 points to form a valid closed polygonal chain that meets the double-neighbor set requirements as shown below, since they cannot form a valid connected structure according to the given conditions. 5. **Existence of Double-Neighbor Sets for Larger Even ( n ):** - ( n = 4 ): A simple 2x2 square ({ (p, q), (p+1, q), (p+1, q-1), (p, q-1) }) can form a valid double-neighbor set. 6. **General Construction:** - For ( n = 4k ) where ( k in mathbb{N}^{*} ), one can construct a double-neighbor set by taking ( k ) instances of such 4-point configurations ((2 times 2 textrm{ squares})), each suitably spaced such that no points connect more than their required neighbors. - For ( n = 4k + 2 ) where ( k geq 2 ), ( n ) can be decomposed as ( 4(k-2) + 10 ).

Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the mother's location is D miles. On the flight up, the speed was 110 mph, so the time taken for the flight up would be D/110 hours. On the way home, the speed was 72 mph, so the time taken for the flight home would be D/72 hours. The total distance for the round trip is 2D (D miles up and D miles back). The total time for the trip is the sum of the time taken for the flight up and the flight home: Total time = D/110 + D/72 To add these two fractions, we need a common denominator, which would be the least common multiple (LCM) of 110 and 72. The LCM of 110 and 72 is 7920 (since 110 = 2 * 5 * 11 and 72 = 2^3 * 3^2, the LCM is 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 11 = 7920).

Since (15 equiv 0 pmod{5}) and (-7 equiv -2 pmod{5}), the equation simplifies to: [ 0 cdot x^2 - 2y^2 equiv 9 pmod{5} ] or simply: [ -2y^2 equiv 9 pmod{5} ] 4.

We do this by considering two cases based on the value of x: - **Case 1:** n leq x < n + frac{1}{2}. - Here, leftlfloor x rightrfloor = n and leftlfloor x + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor = n. - Thus, leftlfloor 2x rightrfloor = leftlfloor 2n leq 2x < 2n + 1 rightrfloor = 2n. - Therefore, leftlfloor 2x rightrfloor = 2n = n + n = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + leftlfloor x + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor. - **Case 2:** n + frac{1}{2} leq x < n + 1. - Here, leftlfloor x rightrfloor = n and leftlfloor x + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor = n + 1. - Thus, leftlfloor 2x rightrfloor = leftlfloor 2n + 1 leq 2x < 2n + 2 rightrfloor = 2n + 1. - Therefore, leftlfloor 2x rightrfloor = 2n + 1 = n + (n + 1) = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + leftlfloor x + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor. Thus, we have verified: leftlfloor 2x rightrfloor = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + leftlfloor x + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor. 3. **Analyzing the Sum:** Rewriting the terms: leftlfloor frac{x + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{x}{2^{k+1}} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 2 cdot frac{x}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{x}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor. The series transforms to: leftlfloor frac{x + 1}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{x + 2}{4} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{x + 4}{8} rightrfloor + cdots. By the intermediate question: leftlfloor frac{x + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{x}{2^{k+1}} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 2 cdot frac{x}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{x}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor. Next, consider the sequence: left(leftlfloor x - leftlfloor frac{x}{2} rightrfloor right) + left(leftlfloor frac{x}{2} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{x}{4} rightrfloorright) + cdots right) Observe that this is a telescoping series: = leftlfloor x rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{x}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{x}{2} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{x}{4} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{x}{4} rightrfloor - cdots = leftlfloor x rightrfloor. Thus, the sum simplifies to: boxed{leftlfloor x rightrfloor}."},{"prompt":"Given point A(5,0), if the distance from a point P(m,n) on the parabola y^{2}=4x to the line x=1 is equal to the distance from point A, then m= _____ .","completion":"A line passing through a point P on the parabola y^{2}=4x is perpendicular to the line x=-1 and intersects at point B.

What is the magnitude of overrightarrow{{F_1}}? A: 5N B: 5sqrt{2}N C: 5sqrt{3}N D: 10N","completion":"Given the problem statement, we can approach the solution step by step as follows: 1. **Understanding the relationship between overrightarrow{{F_1}} and overrightarrow{{F_2}}:** Since the angle between overrightarrow{{F_1}} and overrightarrow{{F_2}} is frac{pi}{2} (90 degrees), they are perpendicular to each other. This implies that the dot product overrightarrow{{F_1}} cdot overrightarrow{{F_2}} = 0 because the dot product of two perpendicular vectors is zero. 2. **Analyzing the resultant force and its angle with overrightarrow{{F_1}}:** Given that the magnitude of the resultant force is 10N and the angle between the resultant force and overrightarrow{{F_1}} is frac{pi}{4}, we can use the cosine of the angle to express the relationship between the magnitudes of overrightarrow{{F_1}}, overrightarrow{{F_2}}, and their resultant. The cosine of the angle between the resultant force and overrightarrow{{F_1}} can be calculated as: cosleft(frac{pi}{4}right) = frac{overrightarrow{{F_1}} cdot (overrightarrow{{F_1}} + overrightarrow{{F_2}})}{|overrightarrow{{F_1}} + overrightarrow{{F_2}}| cdot |overrightarrow{{F_1}}|} Since overrightarrow{{F_1}} cdot overrightarrow{{F_2}} = 0, the dot product simplifies to overrightarrow{{F_1}} cdot overrightarrow{{F_1}} = |overrightarrow{{F_1}}|^2. Therefore, we have: frac{|overrightarrow{{F_1}}|^2}{10|overrightarrow{{F_1}}|} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} This simplifies to: frac{|overrightarrow{{F_1}}|}{10} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} Solving for |overrightarrow{{F_1}}|, we get: |overrightarrow{{F_1}}| = 10 cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = 5sqrt{2}N Therefore, the magnitude of overrightarrow{{F_1}} is 5sqrt{2}N.

However, since ( p ) and ( q ) are coprime, neither ( p ) divides ( q ), nor ( q ) divides ( p ). Hence, ( pq ) does not divide ( p^2 + q^2 ) unless ( p ) and ( q ) are equal, which contradicts the setup that ( q > p ). Thus, the sum ( frac{p}{q} + frac{q}{p} = frac{p^2 + q^2}{pq} ) is not an integer for ( n = 2 ). # Conclusion: The condition is satisfied for ( n > 2 ).

There is a tangent ( l ) to the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) at point ( A ). We need to prove that the line passing through ( D ) and parallel to ( l ) is tangent to the inscribed circle of ( triangle ABC ). 2. **Identify Key Elements:** - The circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) (denoted as ( Omega )) - Tangent ( l ) at point ( A ) - Angle bisector ( AD ) - Inscribed circle (denoted as the incircle) - The line through ( D ) parallel to ( l ) 3. **Apply Tangent Properties:** Since ( l ) is tangent to ( Omega ) at ( A ), it is perpendicular to the radius ( OA ) at ( A ) (where ( O ) is the center of ( Omega )). Let the line passing through ( D ) and parallel to ( l ) be denoted as ( m ). 4. **Use of Angle Bisector Theorem:** By the Angle Bisector Theorem, ( AD ) divides ( angle BAC ) such that: [ frac{BD}{DC} = frac{AB}{AC} ] 5. **Construct the Tangential Property:** Consider triangle ( ABC ) and its incircle touching sides ( BC, CA, ) and ( AB ) at points ( D, E, ) and ( F ), respectively (these ( D, E, F ) might be denoted differently but it doesn't change the concept). 6. **Proving Line ( m ) is Tangent to the Incircle:** Recognize that ( D ) is the point of tangency on ( BC ). Since ( m ) is parallel to ( l ) and tangents from a point to a circle are equal, if ( m ) were not tangent to the incircle, it would not preserve the tangency condition. 7. **Similar Angles and Parallel Lines:** Because ( m parallel l ), the angles formed between ( AD ) and these lines are equal: (angle (AD, l) = angle (AD, m) ). And since they maintain equal supplementary angles with the triangle's sides, ( m ) must be tangent per alternative segment theorem. 8. **Conclusion:** The line passing through ( D ) and parallel to ( l ) must indeed be tangent to the incircle of ( triangle ABC ).

GPT4的路径中，MOE被认为是模型架构侧的关键之关键。因此，观察社区在MOE的整体成熟度，能帮助了解往4走的节奏。例如，23.11开始有零星的MOE开源模型，24.2月开始增多明显，意味着成熟度到达一定阶段（考虑到开源本身有留一手）。 ○ 指标维度 —— 以 MMLU 指标作为观察当前开源大模型能力水位线的快速反应指标。例如，65左右（23.11）属于GPT3.5的水位，77-80左右（23.2）属于准GPT4水位。场景应用预研跟随指标榜趋势进行提前布局。 挑战三：针对“AI+全自动找挑一站式代理流程”（smart-shopping）的实现难点： 1. 大模型如何为用户的需求生成有价值的“购物指导”？ 2. 大模型如何根据“购物指南”找到相关商品？ 3. 大模型如何理解商品并做出最佳推荐？ 行动： ● 采用Qwen-14B根据用户需求描述 结合外搜（夸克搜索 + 自建小红书博文索引）生成“购物指导”，同时为了提升“购物指导”的可信度提升，设计了引用提示来激活大模型指明结论或观点的来源。 ● 采用Qwen-72B根据“购物指南”结合用户需求描述生成多个商品搜索词，通过引导工具调用（主搜）召回相关商品。 ○ 当召回商品过少时，会引导大模型做优化搜索词生成，进行二次召回（ReACT模式） ○ 为了提高这一环节的商品召回率和丰富度，基于 m3e + v-store 对一部分首猜商品搭建了向量化索引 ● 大模型对找到的商品进行分析，分为“粗读”和“细读”两个阶段： ○ 粗读阶段：利用商品标题描述，结合商品搜索词，采用Mistral 8x7B-moe，一次性针对200个左右的商品（7-10个搜索词召回）进行高效可靠的相关性分析，筛选出20个相关商品。 ○ 细读阶段：将商品的CPV信息 + 部分服务信息根据大模型易于理解的格式构造形成商品文档，采用Qwen-72B通过分析商品文档内容，结合用户需求和购物指南，生成3个商品推荐及理由。 成果/效果： 1. 源宝AI采购助手 1.0 / 1.5 / 2.0（目前日活用户 2w+，随放量逐步增加中 #TODO 表述？） 2. smart-shopping（体验原型：https://pre-air.1688.com/kapp/cbu-ai-pilot/ai-shopping-guide/home） 关键事件/结果3：买家询盘体验建设 一句话：聚焦询盘体验核心问题，创新算法+产技运联动构建买家询盘体验保障线。 场景/背景 在B类买家的采购流程中，询盘环节扮演了至关重要的角色。此阶段是买家进行深度评估和选择供应商的关键时期，涵盖对产品和服务细节的探讨。通过询盘，不仅能够精确掌握产品信息和供应商的生产能力，同时也可以评估供应商是否具备良好沟通和服务意识，这对建立合作至关重要。响应率（买家能否及时地获得必需信息）和服务态度（沟通时能否感受到供应商的专业与礼貌）是确保询盘结果正面的两大核心因素，直接影响着买家的交易决策。平台在建立规则制度要求商家提升响应和服务质量同时，也致力于打造智能化产品来保障和提升体验边界。 参与人 ● 晓破、旺旺产技相关、CCO、CRO 我的角色/作用 工作整体目标和任务： 1. 建设买家询盘场景识别能力，同时聚焦提升售前阶段买家咨询的响应体验 2. 建设1688全域询盘消息质量检测能力，支持CCO治理-引导-改善商家询盘服务质量 3. 沉淀从对话理解、知识问答、询盘知识库一整套询盘智能化能力栈，支持询盘体验长期建设 我所承担目标和任务： ● 算法owner ○ 牵头制定（cco、运营、外包）1688站内询盘场景意图树，意图服务及知识问答架构方案设计，协同产技落地智能化响应服务。 ○ 协同产技设计端智能全域询盘消息质量检测方案架构，承担端智能核心算法开发，包括对话情绪识别、对话恶意度识别等。 ○ 抽象标准化1688-询盘算法能力基建，涵盖对话理解、询盘知识库建设、智能问答、对话质量评估等。 事实描述/路径 挑战一：如何在有限的数据标注资源下构造可靠的买家询盘场景识别能力？以及，针对买家售前询盘阶段，如何设计构建一套商家参与的低成本、高时效、高覆盖“知识库方案”来支撑智能问答有效落地？ 行动： ● 协同产技设计实现从数据标注到模型训练迭代一整条SOP流程： ○ 一阶段，通过打通标注平台，结合主动学习和文本匹配技术，提高了数据标注效率和质量，快速完成第一版买家询盘问题语料的构建。 ○ 二阶段，借助预训练技术和数据强化标注，提高识别模型的泛化性。 ○ 三阶段，将识别模型&语料联合迭代，逐步提高。同时为了进一步提高模型准确性，研发了词&标签联合表征网络。 ● 通过走访商家和客服外包小二了解到，相当大一部分售前商品类咨询能从商品详情页的图片中获取信息。而商品详情图的维护对于商家来说，从入驻平台起就是“日常工作”，并不会带来额外的roi负担。然而，一体式的图片问答模型由于缺少有效训练数据落地困难，在对整个过程重新解构后，采取链路化方式处理。协同工程侧，搭建了从商品图下载解码 -> ocr解析 -> ocr内容片段聚合 -> 基于query的ocr文本问点抽取 -> 匹配挂载标准问题 -> 图片问答知识库的数据生产链路，从而将问题转化为标准的 KBQA 问题，成功落地。 挑战二：针对商家辱骂问题，如何在商家消息发出前就能进行检测并进行干预？同时，针对商家消息有多个发送端的实际状况，如何保证端侧的识别能力做到高覆盖和一致性？ 行动： ● 为了能在端上检测出商家回复询盘的情绪状况和恶意性，我和相关工程同学选择尝试了集团内首例端智能对话理解方案。为了尽可能减少APP模型加载的成本，优化实现了LSTM+稀疏自注意力的超轻量对话情绪识别网络，以及textCNN+贝叶斯结合的超轻量对话恶意性检测网络，通过样本测试，两项的检测准确性均达到95%以上。在整个设计-研发-踩坑-上线过程中，作为PM协同相关工程同学和MNN团队做了大量交流和联动，确保了整个检测能力的落地。 ● 通过离线训练小样本分类模型，通过拉取日志大规模打标后进行数据分析发现，商家辱骂消息的来源设备分布主要集中（95+%）在商家版PC、主客IOS和Android。在数据结论的的指导下，协同工程侧构造从模型训练到三端同步更新部署的SOP，识别覆盖率有效保障同时确保能力一致性。 成果/效果 1. 智能响应服务参与响应询盘买家超过 7000w（fy23数据），提升相关商家3分钟响应率25.3%，带动大盘响应提升 6.5pt 2. 商家辱骂情况下降了49.6%（柯南相关求助的数据进行对比），cco体验红榜 3. 魔笛作为涵盖询盘对话理解、多模态问答能力的一整套方案体系，获得克莱蒙特冠军 基于上述工作总结，请结合下一层级人才标准，总结自身的符合情况 #TODO表述？ 价值贡献 1. 在大模型技术栈、源宝AI采购助手和买家询盘体验专项方面取得多项成果，包括技术路线制定、数据沉淀、算法优化、应用落地等。 2. 建设大模型技术栈，包括模型层基础能力、数据层沉淀和应用层探索，有效提升大模型执行任务能力和知识水平。 3. 作为源宝算法owner，制定算法整体方案，承担0-1算法链路开发和核心算法攻坚，并探索“AI+全自动找挑一站式代理流程”新模式。 4. 牵头买家询盘体验专项，建设站内询盘场景识别能力和全域询盘消息质量检测能力，保障商家响应及时和服务质量。 专业素养 1. 对技术体系有深刻理解和前瞻性思考，能结合实际制定技术目标和路线。 2. 具备丰富的技术攻坚和落地经验，掌握先进的技术能力和方法论。 3. 较强的技术研发和系统架构思维，能与跨职能团队紧密合作，推动技术创新和应用。 4. 持续关注技术趋势和前沿进展，有较强的技术学习和创新能力，能探索新技术的应用。 5. 优秀的算法设计和优化能力，能针对具体场景进行算法优化和效果提升。 开放与成长 1. 较强的技术分享和交流能力，能提升团队整体技术共识。 2. 较强的自我驱动和主动学习能力，能快速适应技术和业务变化。 3. 较强的成长意识和自我反思能力，有较强团队合作意识和责任感。","completion":"尊敬的评审团成员们，大家好。我是来自艾耕科技的智能对话算法owner，自2018年7月入职以来，经历了从接触工业级NLP到专注智能对话算法的全过程。我的履历横跨艾耕科技至1688，以技术专业性、业务扎实度以及思考和视野的广度为标志。 聚焦到我的关键事件中，从事询盘算法开发到打造1688大模型技术栈再到源宝AI采购助手的构建，我始终把握新技术驱动业务前行的理念。在大模型和AI领域，我深刻认识到技术是推动业务创新的核心力量。我运用大模型技术栈重新定义B类电商领域的智能代理能力，并通过实践和落地证明了技术对于提升1688买家询盘体验和商家接待效率的重要性。 总结过去的工作，我认为自己在技术、业务和团队协作方面都有突出的表现，尤其是在大模型技术的探索和应用上取得了明显的成果，对1688和行业都产生了深远的影响。 展望未来，在AI时代背景下，我认识到技术思考、趋势把握、产品可能性以及业务洞察的重要性。我计划持续深耕大模型和AI领域，通过技术创新驱动产品升级，为公司赋能。同时，我也看到在AI技术快速发展的情况下，如何实现技术的伦理和可持续性是一个值得探索的方向。 总体而言，我期望能够持续推动公司在AI技术和应用方面的创新，引领业务向更深、更广的方向发展，实现价值的最大化。谢谢大家。"},{"prompt":"我要根据以下内容，写一份极优秀流畅的晋升答辩稿（作为现场答辩使用），要求： 1. 整体字数控制在300-400字，能在3-5分钟内流畅地讲完 2. 内容分三个大块： a. 个人履历（重点在1688工作期间，突出强调技术专业性、业务扎实度、思考和视野广度）// 我只会讲20秒 b. 关键事件（能将三件事情串接起来，起手和重点必须是大模型和AI，突出强调在新技术到来时的把握、思考（立足1688）、实践和落地能力，询盘那块以“在我做大模型之前，致力于1688买家询盘体验和商家接待效率....”简要但深刻体现价值贡献地带过 // 我要讲2分钟 c. 在最后总结简要 // 我只会讲 15秒 d. 以及展望未来，AI时代（技术思考、趋势把握、产品可能性、业务洞察）// 我会讲1分钟来拉起大家对未来的期待和预期 P1 个人履历 艾耕科技-智能对话算法owner 技术素养锤炼：接触工业NLP到专注智能对话，多个环节，完整实践智能对话系统从模块到商业交付的0-1 起始时间：2018.07 -

选模型 - 生成预览 - 生成拆解评测 的标准化流程 ● 独立探索“AI全自动化分析模式”，协助工程制定0-1采购助手链路流程架构 ● 持续关注把握Agent方法模式进展，同时向产品侧持续输出建议和思路 事实描述/路径： 挑战一：在模型层，如何激活大模型的任务解决能力、如何调整大模型生成的偏好，以及对大模型生成的结果是否能有效地进行评测？ 行动： ● 激活大模型的任务解决能力是我和团队相关同学最早开始探索的大模型基础能力项目，包括了： ○ 实践了通用任务（e.g. 摘要、情感分析、文案撰写、知识问答等）的指令遵循能力微调 ○ 设计并优化了针对对话型任务的指令微调模式（dialogueBlue-V1/V2） ○ 探索并实现了针对插件工具使用的指令微调模式（plugin） ○ 设计并实现了针对任务分解的计划指令微调模式（plan） ● 为了进一步校正大模型的生成内容，我和团队相关同学在初期便投入了对大模型的偏好对齐训练，包括了： ○ 摸索并走通了RLHF + PPO的强化学习对齐优化方案 ○ 实践了基于DPO的直接偏好优化模式 ○ 作为偏好对齐的基础，整理沉淀了10w+高质量奖励信号数据 ● 评测大模型的生成效果在大模型应用化阶段是一个重要的基础能力。但在能力摸索期（23.3 - 23.9）阶段，相关工作寥寥无几。我和团队实习生对仅有的少量工作调研后发现，大多数依赖GPT4完成，然而这种方式对应用数据存在数据安全隐患。为此，我们提出了集团首个完全经由训练得到“评测大模型”的技术方案，不仅在多个常用任务上验证了方案的有效性，也将该创新工作撰写了论文。 以上实践在过程中进行了SOP化沉淀，形成了 Butterfly 标准化开发框架。 挑战二：在数据层，如何有效地构造任务指令数据来提升大模型解决任务的丰富性，同时往应用侧走的过程中如何提高大模型的知识？ 行动： ● 在能力摸索期（23.3 - 23.9）阶段，更关注如何让大模型有效地执行任务，此时任务指令数据对大模型的性能表现举足轻重。我和相关团队同学从多点着力进行了实践和沉淀： ○ 【指令丰富度】整理沉淀了70.2w涵盖30+通用任务的指令数据集，同时根据前期试验应用场景梳理了9项1688域内任务并通过“自指令技术”自动生成了9.9k的指令数据集。 ○ 【指令质量】设计并逐步优化了采用信息完整度、问题答案匹配度、信息流畅度等一系列模型+规则指标打分的方式，来筛选高质量指令。 ○ 【指令复杂度】借鉴对话微调的思路，设计并有化了混合上下文指令，验证了效果提升。 ● 逐步走向应用阶段（23.10 - 至今）后，大模型自带的知识不是可靠的生成内容来源，并进一步诱发幻觉现象。此时，我和团队相关同学的关注点调整到如何让大模型会用且有可用的外部知识： ○ 基于RAG的方案模式，设计实现了针对多种电商知识型任务（e.g. 商品卖点、商品对比、商品推荐文案、商品口碑分析）的知识引导模版，来使大模型能有效地利用站内商品知识进行任务分析和结果生成。 ○ 针对多种电商知识任务的数据：一方面，协同AI采购助手项目组产技，对数据格式做了规范定义，来改善大模型对知识理解的效率；另一方面，针对带数字的知识（e.g. 百分比、率），为了减少数据幻觉，也做了的格式改写调整优化。 以上实践除了数资沉淀外，过程中的方法论（e.g. 自指令生成、指令打分）也有对应的流程化沉淀。 挑战三：在应用层，如何有效地选择合适的大模型兼顾性能和效果预期、如何让大模型更有效地运用外部知识以及在落地时如何权衡各类Agent的方法模式？ 行动： ● 结合应用侧的实际需求，主要关注大模型在两个维度上的效果：1. 对用户问题理解的准确性；2. 场景任务的生成结果。为了能高效地从各类不同尺寸开源大模型中筛选出符合需求的目标： ○ 【问题理解测试】构建了一个涵盖10+任务场景总计500+问题集，并适配涵盖主流开源模型的系统模版指令引导，设计实现了自动化评测不同尺寸、不同类型在问题理解上的效果。 ○ 【场景任务执行测试】构建了一个涵盖3+场景任务总计100+上下文指令集，适配涵盖主流开源模型的系统模版指令引导同时，采用GPT4构造了多个评测维度的引导模版，设计实现了自动化评测不同任务的结果生成效果。 ● 关于让大模型更有效地运用外部知识，除了前面“数据层”提到的知识数据格式、引导模版等手段外，也设计并实现大模型“自检验”生成的结果，并根据检验的反馈来优化或限制大模型生成。 ● 综合参考了目前主流的Agent方法模式，并根据实际场景做了必要的取舍和更改来聚焦到0-1确定性走通的目标上： ○ 由于目前没有“持续推理”的多段式分解任务诉求，舍弃了ReAct模式 ○ 对插件式调用进行解构，聚焦到外部工具访问和工具参数提取上 ○ 设计并协同工程实现了应用算子结构，来支持“用户问题理解” 和 “场景任务执行” 成果/效果： 1. 模型层基础能力 a. 训练流程化（支持对话、规划、工具、插件等多种类型，rlhf/dpo主流偏好对齐流程） b.

GPT4的路径中，MOE被认为是模型架构侧的关键之关键。因此，观察社区在MOE的整体成熟度，能帮助了解往4走的节奏。例如，23.11开始有零星的MOE开源模型，24.2月开始增多明显，意味着成熟度到达一定阶段（考虑到开源本身有留一手）。 ○ 指标维度 —— 以 MMLU 指标作为观察当前开源大模型能力水位线的快速反应指标。例如，65左右（23.11）属于GPT3.5的水位，77-80左右（23.2）属于准GPT4水位。场景应用预研跟随指标榜趋势进行提前布局。 挑战三：针对“AI+全自动找挑一站式代理流程”（smart-shopping）的实现难点： 1. 大模型如何为用户的需求生成有价值的“购物指导”？ 2. 大模型如何根据“购物指南”找到相关商品？ 3. 大模型如何理解商品并做出最佳推荐？ 行动： ● 采用Qwen-14B根据用户需求描述 结合外搜（夸克搜索 + 自建小红书博文索引）生成“购物指导”，同时为了提升“购物指导”的可信度提升，设计了引用提示来激活大模型指明结论或观点的来源。 ● 采用Qwen-72B根据“购物指南”结合用户需求描述生成多个商品搜索词，通过引导工具调用（主搜）召回相关商品。 ○ 当召回商品过少时，会引导大模型做优化搜索词生成，进行二次召回（ReACT模式） ○ 为了提高这一环节的商品召回率和丰富度，基于 m3e + v-store 对一部分首猜商品搭建了向量化索引 ● 大模型对找到的商品进行分析，分为“粗读”和“细读”两个阶段： ○ 粗读阶段：利用商品标题描述，结合商品搜索词，采用Mistral 8x7B-moe，一次性针对200个左右的商品（7-10个搜索词召回）进行高效可靠的相关性分析，筛选出20个相关商品。 ○ 细读阶段：将商品的CPV信息 + 部分服务信息根据大模型易于理解的格式构造形成商品文档，采用Qwen-72B通过分析商品文档内容，结合用户需求和购物指南，生成3个商品推荐及理由。 成果/效果： 1. 源宝AI采购助手 1.0 / 1.5 / 2.0（目前日活用户 2w+，随放量逐步增加中 #TODO 表述？） 2. smart-shopping（体验原型：https://pre-air.1688.com/kapp/cbu-ai-pilot/ai-shopping-guide/home） 关键事件/结果3：买家询盘体验建设 一句话：聚焦询盘体验核心问题，创新算法+产技运联动构建买家询盘体验保障线。 场景/背景 在B类买家的采购流程中，询盘环节扮演了至关重要的角色。此阶段是买家进行深度评估和选择供应商的关键时期，涵盖对产品和服务细节的探讨。通过询盘，不仅能够精确掌握产品信息和供应商的生产能力，同时也可以评估供应商是否具备良好沟通和服务意识，这对建立合作至关重要。响应率（买家能否及时地获得必需信息）和服务态度（沟通时能否感受到供应商的专业与礼貌）是确保询盘结果正面的两大核心因素，直接影响着买家的交易决策。平台在建立规则制度要求商家提升响应和服务质量同时，也致力于打造智能化产品来保障和提升体验边界。 参与人 ● 晓破、旺旺产技相关、CCO、CRO 我的角色/作用 工作整体目标和任务： 1. 建设买家询盘场景识别能力，同时聚焦提升售前阶段买家咨询的响应体验 2. 建设1688全域询盘消息质量检测能力，支持CCO治理-引导-改善商家询盘服务质量 3. 沉淀从对话理解、知识问答、询盘知识库一整套询盘智能化能力栈，支持询盘体验长期建设 我所承担目标和任务： ● 算法owner ○ 牵头制定（cco、运营、外包）1688站内询盘场景意图树，意图服务及知识问答架构方案设计，协同产技落地智能化响应服务。 ○ 协同产技设计端智能全域询盘消息质量检测方案架构，承担端智能核心算法开发，包括对话情绪识别、对话恶意度识别等。 ○ 抽象标准化1688-询盘算法能力基建，涵盖对话理解、询盘知识库建设、智能问答、对话质量评估等。 事实描述/路径 挑战一：如何在有限的数据标注资源下构造可靠的买家询盘场景识别能力？以及，针对买家售前询盘阶段，如何设计构建一套商家参与的低成本、高时效、高覆盖“知识库方案”来支撑智能问答有效落地？ 行动： ● 协同产技设计实现从数据标注到模型训练迭代一整条SOP流程： ○ 一阶段，通过打通标注平台，结合主动学习和文本匹配技术，提高了数据标注效率和质量，快速完成第一版买家询盘问题语料的构建。 ○ 二阶段，借助预训练技术和数据强化标注，提高识别模型的泛化性。 ○ 三阶段，将识别模型&语料联合迭代，逐步提高。同时为了进一步提高模型准确性，研发了词&标签联合表征网络。 ● 通过走访商家和客服外包小二了解到，相当大一部分售前商品类咨询能从商品详情页的图片中获取信息。而商品详情图的维护对于商家来说，从入驻平台起就是“日常工作”，并不会带来额外的roi负担。然而，一体式的图片问答模型由于缺少有效训练数据落地困难，在对整个过程重新解构后，采取链路化方式处理。协同工程侧，搭建了从商品图下载解码 -> ocr解析 -> ocr内容片段聚合 -> 基于query的ocr文本问点抽取 -> 匹配挂载标准问题 -> 图片问答知识库的数据生产链路，从而将问题转化为标准的 KBQA 问题，成功落地。 挑战二：针对商家辱骂问题，如何在商家消息发出前就能进行检测并进行干预？同时，针对商家消息有多个发送端的实际状况，如何保证端侧的识别能力做到高覆盖和一致性？ 行动： ● 为了能在端上检测出商家回复询盘的情绪状况和恶意性，我和相关工程同学选择尝试了集团内首例端智能对话理解方案。为了尽可能减少APP模型加载的成本，优化实现了LSTM+稀疏自注意力的超轻量对话情绪识别网络，以及textCNN+贝叶斯结合的超轻量对话恶意性检测网络，通过样本测试，两项的检测准确性均达到95%以上。在整个设计-研发-踩坑-上线过程中，作为PM协同相关工程同学和MNN团队做了大量交流和联动，确保了整个检测能力的落地。 ● 通过离线训练小样本分类模型，通过拉取日志大规模打标后进行数据分析发现，商家辱骂消息的来源设备分布主要集中（95+%）在商家版PC、主客IOS和Android。在数据结论的的指导下，协同工程侧构造从模型训练到三端同步更新部署的SOP，识别覆盖率有效保障同时确保能力一致性。 成果/效果 1. 智能响应服务参与响应询盘买家超过 7000w（fy23数据），提升相关商家3分钟响应率25.3%，带动大盘响应提升 6.5pt 2. 商家辱骂情况下降了49.6%（柯南相关求助的数据进行对比），cco体验红榜 3. 魔笛作为涵盖询盘对话理解、多模态问答能力的一整套方案体系，获得克莱蒙特冠军 基于上述工作总结，请结合下一层级人才标准，总结自身的符合情况 #TODO表述？ 价值贡献 1. 在大模型技术栈、源宝AI采购助手和买家询盘体验专项方面取得多项成果，包括技术路线制定、数据沉淀、算法优化、应用落地等。 2. 建设大模型技术栈，包括模型层基础能力、数据层沉淀和应用层探索，有效提升大模型执行任务能力和知识水平。 3. 作为源宝算法owner，制定算法整体方案，承担0-1算法链路开发和核心算法攻坚，并探索“AI+全自动找挑一站式代理流程”新模式。 4. 牵头买家询盘体验专项，建设站内询盘场景识别能力和全域询盘消息质量检测能力，保障商家响应及时和服务质量。 专业素养 1. 对技术体系有深刻理解和前瞻性思考，能结合实际制定技术目标和路线。 2. 具备丰富的技术攻坚和落地经验，掌握先进的技术能力和方法论。 3. 较强的技术研发和系统架构思维，能与跨职能团队紧密合作，推动技术创新和应用。 4. 持续关注技术趋势和前沿进展，有较强的技术学习和创新能力，能探索新技术的应用。 5. 优秀的算法设计和优化能力，能针对具体场景进行算法优化和效果提升。 开放与成长 1. 较强的技术分享和交流能力，能提升团队整体技术共识。 2. 较强的自我驱动和主动学习能力，能快速适应技术和业务变化。 3. 较强的成长意识和自我反思能力，有较强团队合作意识和责任感。","completion":"尊敬的评委，大家好，我是来自1688团队的候选人。今天，我有幸站在这里，向各位展示过去几年里我在AI技术领域的探索和成就，以及我对未来技术发展的思考和展望。 首先，让我简要回顾一下我的个人履历。在加入1688之前，我在艾耕科技担任智能对话算法的负责人，负责研发工业级智能对话系统和汽车知识图谱向量化表达技术。这段经历为我后来在1688团队深入研究询盘算法和大模型技术奠定了坚实的基础。 进入1688后，我作为询盘算法和大模型技术的负责人，带领团队在三个关键领域取得了显著成果。一是对B类电商特有的大模型技术栈进行构建，实现数据、模型和应用层面的突破。其中，在大模型技术上，我们围绕数据微调、模型对齐进行深入研究，提升了AI技术在电商场景中的应用效果。二是开发了源宝AI采购助手，有效促进了“挑品”环节的效率，探索AI与B2B电商的结合新模式。三是在买家询盘体验上，通过算法与产技的深度合作，大幅提升了买家的咨询响应率和体验质量。 展望未来，AI技术的发展将进一步改变B2B电商平台的运行模式。我认为，随着AI技术的成熟，数据驱动和模型优化将持续推动电商平台向更加智能化、个性化的方向发展。同时，AI技术将在优化供应链、提升交易效率、精准匹配买卖双方等方面发挥更大作用。我期待在接下来的工作中，能够持续探索AI技术与B2B电商结合的更多可能性，为企业提供更加智能化的服务，推动企业数字化转型，为1688乃至整个行业的发展做出更多贡献。 谢谢各位的倾听。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, according to Aptheker (1960, 34), Mills was simply blind to the “intensification of the domination of the sinews of capitalism by the banking collosi and to the mounting merger movement among the banks themselves.” Hence, Mills had missed a key factor of class cohesion within the economic elite. In contrast, Aptheker (1960, 35) argues that finance capital “is the apex of power today in the United States, and its absence from Mills’ Power Elite seriously hurts the book’s validity from the viewpoint of sheer description as well as basic definition” (Cf., Zeitlin, 1977, Chaps. 1–5; 1980, Chaps. 2–4). For Aptheker, there were several additional problems that emanated from this theoretical and empirical lacuna. The orthodox Marxist-Leninist analysis saw finance capital as the engine of a new “epoch of imperialism” (Perlo, 1957), which was defined primarily by the internationalization of American capital (Aptheker, 1960, 36). In other words, the power elite was no longer simply an “American” power elite, but one with interests, connections, and structural limitations related to its export of capital. Aptheker contends that Mills’ failure to analyze the economic underpinnings of imperial expansion seriously weakened his ability to understand the “military ascendancy” of the warlords or to grasp the structural and institutional basis of the power elite’s foreign policy. Instead, Mills tended to present the power elite’s new foreign adventures as a cynical form of Beardian “diversion” to entertain and distract the masses, rather than part of the process of capitalist development (see Barrow, 1997). Whether one shared a Marxist viewpoint or not, the importance of this theoretical linkage was that it allowed Aptheker to elaborate the political, as opposed to the methodological, significance of Sweezy’s complaint about Mills’ “historical voluntarism.” Aptheker (1960, 19) also chastised Mills for depicting “the power elite as, in fact, and despite some qualification, all-powerful” and thus depicting the masses of people as generally powerless. Aptheker was concerned that Mills had constructed an exaggerated image of the power elite’s omnipotence, precisely because he does not incorporate “class” and “class conflict” into his theoretical apparatus. In some ways, Mills reproduces the power elite’s own worst delusions about the magnitude of its power, while simultaneously undercutting those delusions with satirical observations about its incompetence and mediocrity. However, Aptheker does not merely offer up the concept of “class conflict” as an ideological epithet for dismissing Mills. He elaborates how an empirical and historical analysis of class conflict would have allowed Mills to see the limitations and contradictions of power in the higher circles. Aptheker (1960, 24–25) argues that: between the will of that elite and its capabilities of implementing that will stands public opinion, including American public opinion. This public opinion is not simply shaped by the elite, and this public opinion does affect what the elite tries to do and what it does and how it does what it does. Moreover, in whole areas of life—as in wages and working conditions, housing and education, the battle against Jim Crow and against war—the desires and power of the masses do exert great influence, manifested in buses that stop running and in atomic bombs that, though loaded aboard planes that are alerted to take off, never are dropped in war. Aptheker was theoretically more attuned to the subterranean movements within American society that at the time were invisible to Mills. Even in 1956, there was a small anti-nuclear movement and a peace movement. There was a burgeoning civil rights movement that was expanding into a poor peoples’ movement. There were still progressives, and even socialists and communists, in American trade unions. In sum, it was Aptheker’s (1960, 20) contention that Mills had overstated the success of “the elite’s effort to make all Americans morally as corrupt as the elite themselves.” There were poor people, African-Americans, and ordinary middle-class Americans who struggled day-to-day to make a living and who did not share the power elite’s war-mongering ways or its self-absorption with conspicuous consumption. In this sense, Mills’ conception of a power elite dominating “the masses” obscured the fact that there were not just very rich people in America, but poor and very poor people in America (Aptheker, 1960, 12). It was not enough to challenge Louis Hartz’s (1955) America as a middle-class thesis by demonstrating the existence of “the very rich,” because this critique still ignored the fact that the United States had an underclass of the poor and very poor and that much of this underclass was racialized and gendered (Harrington, 1962). Moreover, Aptheker’s theoretical lens also made him far more attentive to the liberation struggles in what was then called the “Third World.” Here, too, Aptheker (1960, 27) argues that Mills’ inability to recognize the significance of the internationalization of capital as the economic basis of American foreign policy meant that Mills could not see that American public opinion was important, but also that world public opinion, splits among the imperialist partners, and divisions in the opinions of the American elite were also potent forces in constraining the power elite. These factors had all played a role in staying the hand of Mills’ “Military Ascendancy.” In sum, the main point for Aptheker (1960, 29) was “that the elite are by no means omnipotent, and the masses of people in our country are neither powerless nor apathetic.” Finally, Aptheker suggests that the absence of a theory of capitalist development in Mills’ work generates an additional blind spot concerning the role of the U.S. South in American political and economic development. Aptheker’s contention was that race and neo-conservatism had a deeper basis in historical class development than Mills recognized in his analysis of the 1950s “conservative mood.” Aptheker (1960, 11) suggests that Mills would have arrived at different conclusions had he recognized that “there was a relative, not absolute, absence of feudal forms and institutions here—they were, for example, important in upstate New York and in Maryland—and that there was a prefeudal form in our history, chattel slavery, which played a decisive role in American development through the Civil War, just as some of its survivals exert so decisive an influence upon present-day American life.” This was not just a historical quibble, but an omission with profound theoretical implications. First, this lacuna in Mills’ analysis creates a blind spot to the question of race in America. Aptheker (1960, 11–12) laments “Mills’ consistent ignoring of the Negro question in all his writings.” Hence, he misses what was already becoming an important structural base for progressive political action in the United States. Second, this lacuna also leads Mills to ignore the structural basis of traditional conservatism in America—strongly located in the South, but extended more generally throughout the rural and suburban hinterlands of white America. Aptheker observes presciently that what Mills dismissed as a short-term “conservative mood” actually had a deep historical basis in the American social structure—one that was tied historically to race and region—and that would not abate with a changing political mood. Thus, while Mills states that “there can be no conservative ideology of the classic type” in America, Aptheker (1960, 16) identifies this claim as a significant error “stemming from Mills’ complete ignoring of Southern life and history and the realities of a kind of industrial feudalism in U.S. development.” Indeed, this is a serious omission for a sociologist of knowledge so deeply influenced by Karl Mannheim. Finally, Aptheker (1960, 14 fn.) criticizes Mills generally for failing to cite “American Marxist writers, though their work anticipates and expands much of his own.” Despite Mills’ “bare and very brief allusions” to Marx and Marxism in The Power Elite, Aptheker (1960, 15) was hopeful that “perhaps in a future work Mills will yet face up fully to the challenge of Marxism by testing its propositions against American reality as he sees it today.” In this respect, a significant feature of Aptheker’s critique is a genuine effort to engage Mills theoretically based on a discussion of empirical and historical facts—whether by reinterpretation or omission—rather than through conceptual one-upmanship based on ideological prescriptions or party doctrine. One simply does not find the types of ideological epithets—“distorted Marxism,” “semi-Marxism,” or “would-be Marxism”—that became so common in the Poulantzas-Miliband debate and its aftermath in the 1970s. Sweezy’s and Aptheker’s criticisms are meant to build on and extend Mills’ work, rather than dismiss it as part of some sterile abstract jargon-laded polemic. ”翻译为中文","completion":"阿普泰克认为，“金融资本”概念作为资本主义经济的组织原则，并非固有的“马克思主义”，米尔斯还有其他更加民粹或甚至是经验性的路径通往该概念。然而，根据阿普泰克（1960，34）的观点，米尔斯对银行巨头对资本主义命脉的统治加剧以及银行自身合并运动的上升趋势视而不见。因此，米尔斯错过了经济精英阶层内部阶级凝聚的一个关键因素。相反，阿普泰克（1960，35）认为，金融资本“是今天美国权力的顶点，其缺席严重削弱了米尔斯的《权力精英》一书的有效性，无论是从纯粹描述还是基本定义的角度而言”（参见Zeitlin，1977，第1-5章；1980，第2-4章）。 对阿普泰克来说，这一理论和经验上的空白还衍生了几个额外的问题。正统的马克思列宁主义分析视金融资本为新“帝国主义时代”的引擎（Perlo, 1957），这主要是由美国资本的国际化所定义。换句话说，权力精英不再仅仅是一个“美国”的权力精英，而是一个与其资本输出相关的利益、联系和结构限制的权力精英。阿普泰克认为，米尔斯未能分析帝国扩张的经济基础，严重削弱了他理解“军事霸权”上升的能力，或是把握权力精英外交政策的结构和制度基础。相反，米尔斯倾向于将权力精英的新外国冒险描绘为一种贝尔德式的“消遣”，用以娱乐和分散大众的注意力，而非作为资本主义发展过程的一部分（参见Barrow，1997）。无论是否持有马克思主义观点，这一理论联系的重要性在于，它使阿普泰克能够论述斯威齐对米尔斯“历史自愿主义”抱怨的政治意义，而非仅仅是方法论上的。 阿普泰克（1960，19）还批评米尔斯将“权力精英描述为，实际上，尽管有一些限定，但全能的”，从而将大众描绘为普遍无力的。阿普泰克担心米尔斯构建了一个夸大的权力精英全能形象，正是因为他没有将“阶级”和“阶级冲突”纳入他的理论框架。在某些方面，米尔斯重现了权力精英对自己力量大小的最糟糕妄想，同时又用讽刺的观察削弱了这些妄想，这些观察强调了他们的无能和平庸。然而，阿普泰克并不是仅仅提出“阶级冲突”概念作为一种排斥米尔斯的意识形态口号。他阐述了一个关于阶级冲突的经验性和历史分析是如何能够让米尔斯看到高层权力中的局限性和矛盾。 阿普泰克（1960，24-25）认为： 那个精英的意愿与其实施意愿的能力之间存在公众舆论，包括美国公众舆论。这种公众舆论不仅仅是由精英塑造的，而且这种公众舆论确实影响了精英试图做什么、他们做了什么以及他们如何做他们所做的事情。此外，在生活的整个领域——如在工资和工作条件、住房和教育、对抗吉姆·克劳法和对抗战争——大众的愿望和力量确实施加了巨大影响，这在停运的公交车和装载在警报状态下准备起飞的飞机上的原子弹，从未在战争中被投下时得到体现。 阿普泰克在理论上更加关注美国社会内部当时对米尔斯不可见的地下运动。即使在1956年，也有一个小型的反核运动和和平运动。有一个正在扩大的民权运动，正在发展成一个穷人运动。在美国的工会中仍然有进步分子，甚至还有社会主义者和共产主义者。总而言之，阿普泰克（1960，20）的观点是，米尔斯高估了“精英努力使所有美国人在道德上和精英自身一样腐化”的成功。有穷人、非裔美国人和普通的中产阶级美国人，他们日复一日地努力谋生，他们并不分享权力精英的好战方式或其自我沉醉于显赫消费的方式。从这个意义上说，米尔斯对一个统治“大众”的权力精英的构想掩盖了一个事实，那就是美国不仅仅有非常富有的人，还有穷人和非常穷的人（阿普泰克，1960，12）。仅仅挑战路易斯·哈兹（Louis Hartz, 1955）的美国作为一个中产阶级论题是不够的，因为这一批判仍然忽略了一个事实，那就是美国有一个穷人和非常穷的人的底层，而且这个底层在很大程度上是种族化和性别化的（哈灵顿，1962）。 此外，阿普泰克的理论视角还使他更加关注所谓“第三世界”的解放斗争。在这里，阿普泰克（1960，27）也认为，米尔斯未能认识到资本国际化作为美国外交政策经济基础的重要性意味着米尔斯无法看到美国公众舆论很重要，但世界公众舆论、帝国主义伙伴之间的分裂，以及美国精英观点中的分歧也是限制权力精英的有力因素。这些因素都在米尔斯的“军事霸权”的手上发挥了作用。总之，对阿普泰克（1960，29）来说，“精英绝不是全能的，而我们国家的大众既不是无助的，也不是冷漠的。” 最后，阿普泰克认为米尔斯作品中缺乏对资本主义发展的理论，这产生了一个关于美国南部在美国政治和经济发展中角色的额外盲点。阿普泰克的观点是，种族和新保守主义在历史阶级发展中有一个更深层次的基础，而米尔斯对1950年代“保守情绪”的分析并未认识到这一点。阿普泰克（1960，11）认为，如果米尔斯认识到“这里存在着封建形式和制度的相对缺乏，而不是绝对缺乏——例如，它们在纽约上州和马里兰州很重要——而且有一种前封建形式在我们历史中起着决定性作用的奴隶制，它在美国发展中直至内战，就像它的一些遗留影响至今对当代美国生活产生着如此决定性的影响。”这不仅仅是一个历史学上的争论，而是一个具有深远理论意义的遗漏。 首先，米尔斯分析中的这一空白创造了对美国种族问题的盲点。阿普泰克（1960，11-12）遗憾“米尔斯在他所有的著作中一贯忽视了黑人问题。”因此，他错过了已经成为美国进步政治行动重要结构基础的东西。其次，这一空白还导致米尔斯忽视了美国传统保守主义的结构基础——主要位于南部，但更普遍地延伸到美国白人的农村和郊区腹地。阿普泰克预见性地观察到，米尔斯把短期的“保守情绪”视为无关紧要，实际上这种情绪在美国社会结构中有一个深刻的历史基础——一个与种族和地区历史上紧密相关的基础，并且这种基础不会随着政治情绪的改变而减弱。因此，虽然米尔斯声称“在美国不可能有经典类型的保守主义意识形态”，阿普泰克（1960，16）认为这是一个重大错误，“这起源于米尔斯对南部生活和历史以及美国发展中一种工业封建主义现实的完全忽视。”确实，对于一个如此深受卡尔·曼海姆影响的知识社会学家来说，这是一个严重的遗漏。 最后，阿普泰克（1960，14注）普遍批评米尔斯没有引用“美国马克思主义作家的作品，尽管他们的工作预见并扩展了他的许多观点。”尽管米尔斯在《权力精英》中对马克思和马克思主义“简单而非常简短的提及”，阿普泰克（1960，15）仍然希望“也许在未来的作品中米尔斯会完全面对马克思主义的挑战，通过测试其命题与他今天所看到的美国现实的符合程度。”在这方面，阿普泰克批判的一个重要特点是，他基于对经验和历史事实的讨论（无论是通过重新解释还是遗漏）而非基于意识形态处方或党派教条的概念对抗，真诚地从理论上与米尔斯进行了接触。在1970年代Poulantzas-Miliband辩论及其后果中变得如此普遍的那种意识形态标签——“扭曲的马克思主义”、“半马克思主义”或“假马克思主义”——在这里根本找不到。斯威齐和阿普泰克的批评旨在基于和扩展米尔斯的工作，而不是将其作为某种毫无生气的抽象术语争论来驳斥。"},{"prompt":"请将“What Is Marxism? The result of the encounter between C. Wright Mills and Anglo-American Marxists was that real theoretical progress occurred over the next decade as an intellectual “New Left” emerged in the discursive space between liberal-social democratic pragmatism and Communist orthodoxy (Jamison and Eyerman, 1994). Mills did not immediately accept the theoretical implications of Marxist criticism, but it did lead him to reevaluate Marx and Marxism as is evident in his last book The Marxists (1962). Mills’ rejoinder to the Marxists was interesting not so much because he disavowed being a Marxist, but because he raised the issue that would loom large in the state debate of the 1970s: What is a “Marxist”? Mills identified three intellectual types of Marxism: Vulgar Marxism, Sophisticated Marxism, and Plain Marxism. Mills (1962, 96) had little to say about Vulgar Marxism,14 but he observed that Sophisticated Marxists: … are mainly concerned with marxism as a model of society and with the theories developed with the aid of this model. Empirical exceptions to theories are relegated to subsidiary importance: new theories are made up to account for these exceptions in such a way as to avoid revision of the general model. These theories are then read back into the texts of Marx. … But there comes a time when the supplementary hypotheses become so bulky, the deviant facts so overwhelming, that the whole theory or even model becomes clumsy. At that point marxism becomes “sophisticated” in a useless and obscurantist sense.15 Mills’ definition of Sophisticated Marxism is somewhat ambiguous, but he appears to suggest that Marx constructed a “model” of capitalist society that can generate different political theories at various times and in different capitalist geographies to account for both new developments and specific conjunctures in particular capitalist societies.16 He also suggests that Sophisticated Marxists, because of their political commitment to an official party line, or a particular type of political action, often make the mistake of reducing Marx’s model of capitalism to historically specific theories that are ensconced in party doctrine or that justify preconceived courses of political action. Thus, for Mills, Sophisticated Marxism was typically constrained in its theorizing by an official party line,17 and in contrast to Plain Marxists, were unable to make the necessary theoretical adjustments required by changing times and circumstances. Since Mills never belonged to any political party—indeed, he probably never even voted—it was the Plain Marxists that were more interesting to Mills. Mills defined a Plain Marxist as someone who works “in Marx’s own tradition,” whether in agreement or disagreement with him. A Plain Marxist is someone who understands: Marx, and many later marxists as well, to be firmly a part of the classic tradition of sociological thinking. They treat Marx like any great nineteenth century figure, in a scholarly way; they treat each later phase of marxism as historically specific. They are generally agreed … that his general model and his ways of thinking are central to their own intellectual history and remain relevant to their attempts to grasp present-day social worlds. (Mills, 1962, 96) Mills includes a highly eclectic group within this intellectual type, including Joan Robinson, Isaac Deutscher, William Morris, Antonio Gramsci, Rosa Luxemburg, G.D.H. Cole, Georg Lukacs, Christopher Cauldwell, Jean-Paul Sartre, John Strachey, George Sorel, E.P. Thompson, Leszek Kolakowski, William A. Williams, Paul Sweezy, and Erich Fromm. One might conclude, given Mills’ earlier reply to Lekachman, that if he did not include himself in this group, he was at least hovering around its edges. Who knows where this ongoing engagement might have led if not for Mills’ untimely death at the age of forty-five? Indeed, Irving Howe (1963), one of Mills’ former friends, observes that while “Mills was not a convert to Communism,” he was turning toward the type of Plain Marxism “which in America is expressed by Paul Sweezy’s Monthly Review” (Horowitz, 1983; Cf. Miliband, 1964; Zeitlin, 1989, 47).18 Indeed, after publishing The Power Elite, Mills began moving in Marxist intellectual circles. In 1957, he traveled outside the United States for the first time in his life, where he visited the London School of Economics and met Ralph Miliband (Miliband, 1962, 18). Subsequently, Mills traveled to Poland, where he met Adam Schaff and Lezek Kolakowski. He made two trips to the Soviet Union in 1960 and 1961 and visited Cuba in 1960 to gather materials for his book Listen Yanqui! According to Miliband (1962, 20, 18), Mills “did not think of himself as a ‘Marxist’” even late in his career, but his encounters with Marxist theory, dissident Marxists, and actually existing socialism “left him intensely interested and pondering, ‘ambiguous’, as he put it, about much of Soviet society. … He was still ‘working on’ Communism and the Soviet bloc when he died: his last book, The Marxists, published shortly after his death, is the last testimony to the rare honesty he brought to that effort.” At a minimum, Mills’ travels made him enthusiastic about the Cuban Revolution and about the prospects of democratic political reform in the Eastern European bloc. He was convinced, if incorrectly, that dissident and liberal intellectuals in Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Russia would eventually triumph in advancing democratic socialism. In this respect, it is also worth pointing out that Mills’ rejection of the working class as an agent of social transformation is sometimes overstated by quoting a few select phrases from White Collar (1951) and his famous essay on “The New Left” (1960). Although it is well known that Mills (1963, 256) rejected the “labor metaphysic” inherited from “Victorian Marxism,” and came to view the “the cultural apparatus, the intellectuals—as a possible, immediate, radical agency of change,” scholars often neglect to mention that in making this proclamation he also qualified his claim by saying: “Forget Victorian Marxism except whenever you need it; and read Lenin again (be careful)—Rosa Luxemburg, too” (1963, 259). At the same time, he wrote: “Of course we can’t ‘write off the working class’. But we must study all that, and freshly. Where labor exists as an agency, of course we must work with it, but we must not retreat [sic] it as The Necessary Lever” of structural historical change (1963, 256). There is no question that Mills was pessimistic about the prospects of structural change in the advanced capitalist societies, but in 1960 when he (1963, 259) declared “We are beginning to move again,” it was his view that a “young intelligentsia” might be the new agent of historic change in both capitalist and Communist societies. It was this concluding point that provided the starting point for a new generation of power structure research, such as G. William Domhoff’s Who Rules America? (1967), which argued that the power elite was merely the leading arm of a cohesive ruling class. Mills opened the intellectual space for a New Left in the United States and became a hero to many of the young intellectuals of the 1960s. The Marxist critique of Mills also laid the foundation for subsequent work by many plain Marxists, such as Michael Harrington (1962), who documented “the other America” alluded to by Herbert Aptheker. Similarly, Eugene Genovese unraveled the political economy of slavery and its enduring impact on Southern society, while Ralph Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society (1969) was “dedicated to the memory of C. Wright Mills.””翻译为中文","completion":"C. Wright Mills与盎格鲁-美国马克思主义者的相遇导致了接下来十年真正的理论进展，因为在自由-社会民主实用主义与共产主义正统之间的话语空间中涌现出了一个知识性的“新左派”（Jamison和Eyerman，1994）。米尔斯并没有立即接受马克思主义批评的理论含义，但这促使他重新评估马克思和马克思主义，这在他的最后一本书《马克思主义者》（1962）中显而易见。米尔斯对马克思主义者的回应之所以引人注目，不仅仅是因为他否认自己是马克思主义者，而是因为他提出了一个在1970年代国家辩论中将成为重点的问题：什么是“马克思主义者”？ 米尔斯识别出三种知识类型的马克思主义：庸俗马克思主义、复杂马克思主义和纯粹马克思主义。米尔斯（1962，96）对庸俗马克思主义几乎没什么可说的，但他观察到复杂马克思主义者： ...主要关注马克思主义作为一个社会模型，以及借助这个模型发展的理论。对理论的经验性例外被贬低为次要重要性：构建新理论来解释这些例外，以避免对一般模型进行修订。然后这些理论被追溯到马克思的文本中。...但是当补充假设变得庞大，偏离事实变得压倒性时，整个理论甚至模型变得笨拙。在那一点上，马克思主义变得“复杂化”，以一种无用且晦涩的意义。（15） 米尔斯对复杂马克思主义的定义有些模糊，但他似乎暗示马克思构建了一个资本主义社会的“模型”，在不同的时间和不同的资本主义地理环境中，可以生成不同的政治理论，以解释特定资本主义社会的新发展和特定局势。（16）他还暗示，由于复杂马克思主义者对官方党派路线或特定政治行动类型的政治承诺，他们常常犯下将马克思的资本主义模型简化为历史特定理论的错误，这些理论在党的教条中固化或用以证明预设的政治行动路线。因此，对米尔斯来说，复杂马克思主义通常受到官方党派路线的理论限制，与纯粹马克思主义相反，无法根据变化的时代和环境进行必要的理论调整。 由于米尔斯从未属于任何政治党派——实际上，他可能甚至从未投过票——对米尔斯来说，更有趣的是纯粹马克思主义者。米尔斯定义纯粹马克思主义者为在“马克思自己的传统内”工作的人，无论是同意还是不同意他。一个纯粹马克思主义者是一个理解： 马克思，以及许多后来的马克思主义者，坚定地属于经典社会学思想传统的一部分。他们以学术的方式对待马克思这样的伟大的十九世纪人物；他们将马克思主义的每个后来阶段视为历史特定的。他们普遍同意...他的一般模型和他的思考方式是他们自己知识历史的核心，且对他们尝试把握当代社会世界仍然相关。（米尔斯，1962，96） 米尔斯将一群高度折衷的人包含在这个智力类型中，包括乔恩·罗宾逊、艾萨克·多伊彻、威廉·莫里斯、安东尼奥·格拉姆西、罗莎·卢森堡、G.D.H. 科尔、乔治·卢卡奇、克里斯托弗·考德威尔、让-保罗·萨特、约翰·斯特拉切伊、乔治·索雷尔、E.P. 汤普森、莱舍克·科拉科夫斯基、威廉·A·威廉姆斯、保罗·斯威齐和埃里希·弗罗姆。考虑到米尔斯对莱卡赫曼的早期回复，人们可能会得出结论，如果他没有把自己包括在这个群体中，至少他也在其边缘徘徊。谁知道如果不是因为米尔斯不幸早逝于四十五岁，这种持续的参与可能会导致什么呢？实际上，欧文·豪（1963）是米尔斯的前朋友之一，他指出，尽管“米尔斯不是一个共产主义的皈依者”，但他正转向保罗·斯威齐的《月刊评论》所代表的那种纯粹马克思主义的类型（Horowitz, 1983; 参见Miliband, 1964; Zeitlin, 1989, 47）。（18） 实际上，在出版了《权力精英》之后，米尔斯开始在马克思主义知识圈中活动。1957年，他在生平中首次离开美国，到访了伦敦经济学院并会见了拉尔夫·米利班德（Miliband，1962年，18页）。随后，米尔斯前往波兰，会见了亚当·沙夫（Adam Schaff）和莱泽克·科拉科夫斯基（Lezek Kolakowski）。他在1960年和1961年两次访问苏联，并于1960年访问古巴，为他的书《听，美洲人！》（Listen Yanqui!）收集材料。据米利班德（1962，20，18）说，即便到了职业生涯的晚期，米尔斯“并不认为自己是一个‘马克思主义者’”，但他与马克思主义理论、异见马克思主义者和实际存在的社会主义的相遇“让他极度感兴趣，并对苏联社会的许多方面感到‘暧昧’，正如他所说。...当他去世时，他仍在‘研究’共产主义和苏联集团：他的最后一本书《马克思主义者》，在他去世后不久出版，是他对这一努力所表现出的罕见诚实的最后见证。”至少，米尔斯的旅行让他对古巴革命和东欧集团民主政治改革的前景充满热情。他确信，尽管这是错误的，但匈牙利、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和俄罗斯的持不同政见者和自由派知识分子最终将在推动民主社会主义方面取得胜利。 在这方面，还值得指出的是，有时通过引用《白领》（1951年）和他著名的论文《新左派》（1960年）中的几句精选语句，过分夸大了米尔斯对工人阶级作为社会转型力量的拒绝。虽然众所周知，米尔斯（1963，256）拒绝了从“维多利亚时代的马克思主义”继承的“劳工形而上学”，并开始将“文化机构、知识分子——作为可能的、即时的、激进的变革力量”看待，但学者们经常忽略提及他在作出这一宣告时也有所保留，他说：“除非你需要它，否则忘记维多利亚时代的马克思主义；也再读一遍列宁（小心点）——也读一读罗莎·卢森堡”（1963，259）。同时，他写道：“当然我们不能‘忽视工人阶级’。但我们必须全面、重新研究所有这些。如果劳工存在为一个力量，当然我们必须与它合作，但我们不必将其视为结构性历史变革的‘必要杠杆’”（1963，256）。毫无疑问，米尔斯对先进资本主义社会的结构变化前景持悲观态度，但在1960年他（1963，259）宣称“我们开始再次行动”时，他的观点是“年轻的知识分子”可能成为资本主义和共产主义社会历史变革的新代理人。 正是这一结论为新一代权力结构研究提供了起点，比如G. 威廉·多姆霍夫的《谁统治美国？》（1967年），该书认为权力精英只是一个紧密团结的统治阶级的领导力量。米尔斯为美国新左派开辟了思想空间，并成为1960年代许多年轻知识分子的英雄。对米尔斯的马克思主义批评也为许多纯粹马克思主义者的后续工作奠定了基础，比如迈克尔·哈灵顿（1962年）记录了赫伯特·阿普泰克所暗示的“另一个美国”。同样，尤金·吉诺维塞揭示了奴隶制的政治经济及其对南部社会的持久影响，而拉尔夫·米利班德的《资本主义社会中的国家》（1969年）是“献给C. Wright Mills的记忆”。"},{"prompt":"请将“Sophisticated Marxists and The Power Elite It is not surprising that Miliband became the target of “sophisticated” Marxist structuralists in the 1970s, but their critique of Plain Marxism—or “historicism” and “voluntarism” in structuralist jargon—was originally directed at C. Wright Mills. Nicos Poulantzas’ Pouvoir Politique et Classes Sociale (1968) was written and published prior to the release of Miliband’s The State in Capitalist Society (1969) and, consequently, it is C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite that is actually the focus of Poulantzas’ critique of the “instrumentalist” conception of the state. However, Poulantzas’ main point of contention with Mills was not his empirical analysis, but the fact that Mills would not abandon his Weberian attachment to the analytical separation of the economic and the political. It was a methodological critique of where to begin the analysis of political power, rather than a discussion of political power in capitalist societies. For example, in a chapter on “The Concept of Power,” Poulantzas (1978, 103) cites Mills’ The Power Elite as the exemplar of what he calls “semi-Marxist theories of political elites and political class.” His main criticism is directed at Mills’ “badly loaded phrase” comment, because it allegedly leads to the conclusion that “the groups which take part in political (i.e. power) relations differ, in their theoretical status, from economic social classes, whose existence is elsewhere acknowledged.” Mills’ power structure approach starts with the separation of the economic and the political, which is a separation that Poulantzas rejects as a bourgeois myth from the outset. Hence, Poulantzas (1978, 103, 104) criticizes Mills for acknowledging “the parallel existence of economic social classes in a distorted Marxian sense, according to which the economic ‘class situation’ does not call for relations of power,” and hence, “the failures of this school of thought become obvious in the confusions which result when it tries to establish relations between these ‘economic classes’ and the ‘political groups’.” Although phrased in structuralist terminology, this criticism is not essentially different from the one leveled by Sweezy and Aptheker. In fact, Poulantzas (1978, 320) cites Sweezy’s earlier critique favorably, because he agreed that Mills’ empirical findings “end up by acknowledging the unity of the political elites” and thus suggest theoretical “conclusions diametrically opposed to those which they originally envisaged.” Like Sweezy and Aptheker before him, Poulantzas was convinced that Mills’ empirical findings should have led him to reconceptualize his starting point by adopting a Marxist theoretical position. Poulantzas argues that Mills was unable to make this shift, because his rejection of the concept of a ruling class as “a badly loaded phrase” was based on a “distorted Marxist conception of the dominant class.” Unfortunately, what Poulantzas failed to see is that the masses do not start from a sophisticated Marxist position, but can be moved in that direction by “palpitating facts.” However, the empirical basis on which Sweezy had developed an immanent critique of Mills is a critical research strategy that Poulantzas found unacceptable, because it requires one to arrive at the conclusion of a ruling class, rather than adopt it as a starting axiom. Moreover, Poulantzas rejected as “historicist” and “subjectivist” any research that attempted to draw empirical relationships between the three domains through network analysis, personal and family relationships, common class origins, educational preparation, and so on. Indeed, Poulantzas dismisses Mills’ empirical method of power structure analysis as “fantastical” and “mysterious.” In what would be a preview of the Poulantzas-Miliband debate, Poulantzas (1978, 326) explicitly criticizes C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite, and all similar theories, for seeing: an empirical concentration of all political functions in the hands of the economically-politically dominant class and their practical exercise by the members of that class themselves. For instance, the feudal class exercised control over the functions of political government, of public administration, of the military, etc., but this is effectively not the case for bourgeoisie. And so, on this theory it is necessary theoretically to explain this dislocation by recourse to a conception which locates the basis of political power in the very existence of the state apparatus and which, by confusing state power with state apparatus, attributes to the bureaucracy its own political power … these theories see the conception of a state functioning as a mere tool for the domination of the dominant class.19 Although it is true that Mills had an overly voluntaristic conception of political power, and never explicitly identifies any mechanisms of structural constraint on political power, Sweezy and Aptheker had already made this point more effectively. Moreover, contrary to Poulantzas’ claims during the Poulantzas-Miliband debate, and as I have documented elsewhere at greater length (Barrow, 2007), Miliband largely corrected this problem in The State in Capitalist Society. Yet, Poulantzas (1978, 330) further claims that a “major defect” of Mills’ The Power Elite, and similar works, is that “they do not provide any explanation of the foundation of political power. In addition, they acknowledge a plurality of sources for political power but can offer no explanation of their relations.” However, it is not that Mills fails to offer a conception of power (i.e., the command posts of decision making), it is that Poulantzas rejects the idea of institutions and organizations as repositories of power and therefore rejects the idea of multiple sources of power. It is certainly true that power is a structured relationship between classes, rather than merely an attribute of institutions or organizations, but as later structuralists (and also Miliband) recognized, the structural power of capital is its ability to make decisions about capital investment and disinvestment and they would not have that power if they did not occupy the command posts of financial and industrial corporations. Structural mechanisms such as disinvestment and capital strikes are not automatic and impersonal market forces, but decisions made by economic elites occupying the top command posts of financial and nonfinancial corporations. When “the market” responds to an unfavorable business climate, it is signaling a series of decisions made by those in positions of economic power. Finally, Poulantzas (1978, 117) also claims that Mills’ analysis relies on “the conception of zero-sum power. On this theory, any class or social group thus has as much power as another does not have, and any reduction of the power of a given group is directly translated into an increase in the power of another groups and so on.” This is a “closed systems” argument adopted from Talcott Parsons (1957, 139), but ultimately the real problem for Poulantzas (1978, 118) on this point was not theoretical, but political.20 Poulantzas was concerned that a zero sum concept of power suggests that power is a quantity (instead of a relation) that can be redistributed from one group to another and, therefore, this idea “is the basis of several contemporary forms of reformism.” In other words, Mills’ power structure analysis does not necessitate proletarian revolution, which as the touchstone of structuralist political correctness means that Mills’ thinking, however empirically grounded, must be inherently incorrect. Yet, Goran Therborn’s (1976, 19) assessment of C. Wright Mills was even harsher when he writes that “C. Wright Mills was not primarily a theoretician.” In fact, Goran Therborn gives The Power Elite only two minor (and dismissive) footnotes in What Does the Ruling Class Do When it Rules? (1978, 130 fn. 2, 131 fn. 3), a book published two years after the conclusion of the Poulantzas-Miliband debate. In the end, Therborn (1978, 131, fn. 3) dismisses Mills as merely “a radical liberal.” Martin Carnoy’s survey of The State and Political Theory (1984) makes only three insignificant references to C. Wright Mills in the context of discussing Miliband, while Bob Jessop’s influential book on The Capitalist State (1982) does not contain a single mention of C. Wright Mills. ”翻译为中文","completion":"复杂马克思主义者和权力精英 米利班德在1970年代成为“复杂”马克思主义结构主义者的目标并不奇怪，但他们对于纯粹马克思主义（或者在结构主义术语中的“历史主义”和“自愿主义”）的批评最初是针对C.

Wright Mills的《权力精英》。然而，普朗查斯与米尔斯的主要争议点不在于他的实证分析，而在于米尔斯不愿放弃对经济与政治分析上分离的韦伯式坚持。这是一种关于如何开始政治权力分析的方法论批评，而不是对资本主义社会中政治权力的讨论。 例如，在“权力概念”的章节中，普朗查斯（1978，103）引用了米尔斯的《权力精英》，将其称为他所说的“半马克思主义的政治精英和政治阶级理论”的典范。他的主要批评针对的是米尔斯的“含糊其辞”的评论，因为这据称导致了这样的结论：“参与政治（即权力）关系的群体，在其理论地位上，不同于在其他地方承认存在的经济社会阶级。”米尔斯的权力结构方法首先是经济与政治的分离，这是普朗查斯从一开始就拒绝的资产阶级神话。因此，普朗查斯（1978，103, 104）批评米尔斯承认“经济社会阶级的平行存在，以一种扭曲的马克思主义意义，认为经济‘阶级状况’不需要权力关系，”因此，“这一思想流派的失败在于当它试图建立这些‘经济阶级’和‘政治团体’之间的关系时，产生的混乱变得显而易见。”尽管用结构主义术语表述，这一批评与斯威齐和阿普泰克的批评本质上并无不同。 事实上，普朗查斯（1978，320）赞同地引用了斯威齐早期的批评，因为他同意米尔斯的实证发现“最终承认了政治精英的统一”，因此暗示了与他们最初设想的理论“截然相反的结论”。像斯威齐和阿普泰克之前一样，普朗查斯确信米尔斯的实证发现应该导致他重新构想他的出发点，采用马克思主义的理论立场。普朗查斯认为，米尔斯无法做出这一转变，因为他对统治阶级概念的拒绝是基于“扭曲的马克思主义统治阶级观念”。不幸的是，普朗查斯没有看到的是，群众并不是从复杂的马克思主义立场出发，而是可以通过“具体事实”被引向那个方向。 然而，斯威齐基于实证基础对米尔斯进行的内在批评是普朗查斯认为不可接受的关键研究策略，因为它要求人们得出统治阶级的结论，而不是将其作为出发的公理。此外，普朗查斯将试图通过网络分析、个人和家庭关系、共同阶级起源、教育准备等来绘制三个领域之间的实证关系的研究拒绝为“历史主义”和“主观主义”。实际上，普朗查斯将米尔斯的权力结构分析实证方法视为“幻想”和“神秘”。在预示着普朗查斯-米利班德辩论的内容中，普朗查斯（1978，326）明确批评了C. Wright Mills的《权力精英》，以及所有类似理论，因为它们看到： 所有政治职能在经济-政治统治阶级手中的实证集中，以及这个阶级成员自己的实际行使。例如，封建阶级对政治政府的职能、公共行政、军事等的控制，但对于资产阶级来说实际并非如此。因此，根据这一理论，理论上需要通过诉诸于一种观念来解释这种错位，该观念将政治权力的基础定位于国家机器的存在本身，并且通过将国家权力与国家机器混淆，赋予官僚机构自己的政治权力...这些理论看到了一个国家作为统治阶级统治的工具的观念。 尽管米尔斯对政治权力的理解过于自愿主义，并且从未明确指出对政治权力的结构性约束机制，但斯威齐和阿普泰克已经更有效地提出了这一点。此外，与普朗查斯在普朗查斯-米利班德辩论中的主张相反，正如我在其他地方更长篇幅的文献（Barrow, 2007）中记载的，米利班德在《资本主义社会中的国家》中基本纠正了这个问题。然而，普朗查斯（1978，330）进一步声称，米尔斯的《权力精英》及类似作品的一个“主要缺陷”是“它们没有提供政治权力基础的任何解释。此外，它们承认政治权力有多样来源，但却无法解释它们之间的关系。”然而，问题不在于米尔斯未能提出权力的概念（即决策的指挥岗位），而在于普朗查斯拒绝将机构和组织视为权力的存储库，因此拒绝了权力有多个来源的观念。 诚然，权力是阶级之间的结构性关系，而不仅仅是机构或组织的属性，但正如后来的结构主义者（也包括米利班德）所认识到的，资本的结构性权力在于其对资本投资和撤资决策的能力，而如果他们不占据金融和工业公司的指挥岗位，他们就不会拥有这种权力。像撤资和资本罢工这样的结构性机制不是自动和非人格的市场力量，而是由占据金融和非金融公司顶级指挥岗位的经济精英做出的决策。当“市场”对不利的商业环境做出反应时，它传达了经济权力位阶上人们做出的一系列决定。 最后，普朗查斯（1978，117）还声称，米尔斯的分析依赖于“零和权力”的概念。在这一理论上，任何阶级或社会群体的权力就是另一个阶级没有的，而一个给定群体的权力的任何减少都直接转化为另一个群体的权力增加，等等。”这是从塔尔科特·帕森斯（1957，139）那里采纳的“封闭系统”论点，但最终普朗查斯（1978，118）在这一点上的真正问题不是理论上的，而是政治上的。普朗查斯担心零和权力观念表明权力是一种可以从一个群体转移给另一个群体的数量（而不是一种关系），因此，这一观念“是一些当代改革主义形式的基础。”换句话说，米尔斯的权力结构分析并不需要无产阶级革命，这作为结构主义政治正确性的试金石意味着米尔斯的思想，无论多么基于实证，都必然是错误的。 然而，Goran Therborn（1976，19）对C. Wright Mills的评价更为严厉，他写道“C. Wright Mills主要并不是一个理论家。”实际上，Goran Therborn在《统治阶级在统治时做什么？》（1978，130注释2，131注释3）中仅给予《权力精英》两个次要（并带有轻蔑意味的）脚注，这本书在普朗查斯-米利班德辩论结束两年后出版。最终，Therborn（1978，131，注释3）将米尔斯仅仅归为“一个激进的自由主义者”。马丁·卡诺伊在《国家与政治理论》（1984）的调研中只在讨论米利班德时做了对C. Wright Mills三处不重要的提及，而Bob Jessop在其有影响力的《资本主义国家》（1982）一书中未提及C. Wright Mills一次。"},{"prompt":"请将“Moving Beyond C. Wright Mills? There is really not much in the Poulantzas-Miliband debate that was not already present in Poulantzas’ criticism of C. Wright Mills and therein lays the problem. The Poulantzas-Miliband debate merely replayed many of the same issues that had been addressed in earlier critiques of Mills, but the problem for Poulantzas is that Miliband had already moved beyond Mills empirically and conceptually. Miliband constructed a theory of the state anchored in classical Marxist theory, while Mills operationalized elite theory as he inherited it from Vilfredo Pareto and Gaetano Mosca. There are numerous differences that flow from this distinction starting with the fact that Miliband developed a far more nuanced analysis of the capitalist class and its relationship to the working class, while Mills saw only “elites” and “masses.” Miliband marshalled empirical data to conceptualize the structure of class conflict in Western industrialized nations, while Mills saw a loose aggregation of venal elites who were rich, powerful, and famous, but he never went beyond descriptive sociology to an explanatory political economy. Thus, where Miliband saw working class struggle as an ever-present element of contemporary capitalism (as did Poulantzas), Mills could only see an acquiescent and inchoate mass being prodded by discontented intellectuals. In order words, Mills did not articulate a theory of the state, a theory of ideology, or a theory of capitalist development. There were actors and institutions in his description of American elites, but no structures and no theory. Consequently, the early structuralist critique of Miliband was largely directed at a straw man if for no other reason than it failed to recognize the theoretical and empirical advances in Anglo-American Marxism occurred after 1956. Poulantzas seems to have read Miliband through a Millsian lens and, partly for that reason, failed to acknowledge that Miliband’s analysis of the state included a significant structural dimension that was lacking in Mills. Furthermore, Miliband was able to draw on newer power structure research that had identified additional mechanisms of ruling class cohesion, while specifying the processes of ruling class domination. Moreover, Miliband’s analysis did not assume the analytic separation of the economic and political, but it did share Mills’ dictum that this relationship had to be specified in particular historical and geographic configurations. The standard Marxist criticisms of Mills are simply not applicable to Miliband, who had apparently learned from the earlier debate between Mills and the Marxists. Yet, instead of carrying the debate to a higher level of empirical, historical, and theoretical sophistication, as has been done by Sweezy, Aptheker, Harrington, Domhoff, and Miliband, the state debate of the 1970s and 1980s degenerated into an artificial methodological stalemate, which Domhoff (1986–1987, 295) argues became little more than “a dispute among Marxists concerning who was the most Marxist and whose theories were the most politically useful.” Interestingly, in that regard, Mills (1962, 98) observed in an almost prophetic statement that “politically, the plain marxists have generally been among the losers,” because they generally stand outside positions of institutional authority. In fact, Frances Fox Piven (1994, 24) notes that an important historical outcome of the Poulantzas-Miliband debate is that Poulantzasian structuralism achieved hegemony among Marxists. This ideological hegemony gave it the power to (temporarily) write the history of Marxism and the ability to expunge C. Wright Mills from Marxist theory and even a great deal of left-wing analysis generally. Until recently, the name of C. Wright Mills had been largely erased from the memory and vocabulary of Marxism, except as an epithet and an example of what did not count as “real” Marxism. To the extent that Miliband was identified with Mills, his work mistakenly suffered the same fate (Wetherly et al., 2007). At the same time, it should be recognized that the type of work exemplified by C. Wright Mills performs the important function of ideology critique by standing as a critical bridge between the ideology of pluralism and a theoretical critique of the capitalist state. FOUR The Analytic (Mis)Construction of Instrumentalism Ralph Miliband never used the term “instrumentalism” to describe his theory of the state, but rather it was Nicos Poulantzas (1969, 74) who first identified Miliband’s book with “a long Marxist tradition” that allegedly considers the state to be “only a simple tool or instrument manipulated at will by the ruling class.” As documented in Chapter 1, Miliband did anchor his work in a classical Marxist tradition, but Poulantzas’ epithet was not an accurate description of either Miliband’s book or the tradition of instrumentalist theory. However, Poulantzas’ ad hominin is an oversimplification that quickly took hold in the state debate of the 1970s and 1980s and it is a misconstruction that persists to the present time. The significance of this misconstruction is that it has institutionalized an artificial conceptual antinomy between structuralism and instrumentalism, when the two types of analysis should be viewed as simultaneous forms of analysis that are both necessary to an explanation of specific state policies and to an understanding of the historical development of state forms. The Defining Moment for an Ideal-Type A defining moment in the extended reproduction of Poulantzas’ theoretical caricature of instrumentalism was the seminal article in Monthly Review by David A. Gold, Clarence Lo, and Erik Olin Wright (1975a, 31) on “Recent Developments in Marxist Theories of the Capitalist State.” This highly influential article followed Poulantzas’ lead by defining instrumentalism as “a theory in which the ties between the ruling class and state are systematically examined, while the structural context within which those ties occur remains largely theoretically unorganized.” Shortly thereafter, in an equally influential Socialist Review article, Fred Block (1977, 8) defined instrumentalism as “the orthodox Marxist view of the state because it views the state as a simple tool or instrument of ruling-class purposes.”1 These forays into state theory effectively began the process of institutionalizing Poulantzas’ polemical jibe as a permanent part of the state debate even though G. William Domhoff (1976) correctly pointed out at the time that if one accepted this definition of instrumentalism then no one, especially Ralph Miliband, actually subscribed to an instrumentalist theory of the state. Indeed, it should have been highly instructive at the time that Block’s (1977, 8–10) subsequent critique of instrumentalism does not cite a single published work or author to exemplify his specific claims about instrumentalism. Ironically, even the most strident critics of instrumentalism recognized early on that very few theoretical works on the state could actually be considered “pure examples of an instrumentalist, structuralist, or Hegelian-Marxist perspective” (Gold, Lo, and Wright, 1975a, 31), because these concepts are themselves analytically constructed ideal-types. However, this did not prevent Gold, Lo, and Wright (1975a, 32) from proclaiming that “Ralph Miliband expresses this position clearly.” Similarly, Bob Jessop’s (1982, 15) influential work on The Capitalist State identified The State in Capitalist Society as “a classic work” of instrumentalist theory, while Gordon L. Clark and Michael Dear (1984, 6–27) labeled The State in Capitalist Society as “probably the best example of the instrumentalist model.” Yet, even as Gold, Lo, and Wright (1975a, 33) were in the process of constructing the instrumentalist-structuralist dichotomy, they simultaneously acknowledged that “there are, of course, examples of instrumentalist work done at various levels of sophistication” and they conceded that Ralph Miliband “most notably” had “attempted to situate the analysis of personal connections in a more structural context.” Jessop (1982, 15) also qualified his critique of Miliband with the observation that “it would be wrong to suggest that Miliband is committed to a simple instrumentalist position.” Thus, one critic after another acknowledges the sophisticated, nuanced, and multilevel analysis developed in The State in Capitalist Society, but then still proceed to dismiss his work on the basis of criticisms that apply only to an artificially constructed ideal type, rather than to his actual published works. It is not Miliband’s actual theorizing that was ever at issue, but the so-called logic of a theoretical position artificially imputed to him by critics. Consequently, a long list of broadsides have been directed against Miliband’s alleged instrumentalism and most of these criticisms revolve around four major “problems” that had been articulated earlier by Poulantzas: (1) the problem of the subject, (2) the problem of the ideological apparatuses, (3) the problem of state autonomy, and (4) the problem of economic and social reform. Once extracted from the epistemological and methodological issues that preoccupied Poulantzas, it is easier to recognize the extent to which these problems were falsely ascribed to Miliband by Poulantzas and his followers largely by ignoring significant elements of Miliband’s political theory. ”翻译为中文","completion":"超越C.

Wright Mills的批评中并没有什么是新的。这场辩论不过是将之前针对米尔斯的批评重新演绎一遍，但对于普朗查斯来说，问题在于米利班德在经验和概念上已经超越了米尔斯。米利班德基于古典马克思主义理论构建了关于国家的理论，而米尔斯则继承并运用了来自维尔弗雷多·帕雷托和盖塔诺·莫斯卡的精英理论。这一区别导致了诸多不同之处，米利班德对资产阶级及其与工人阶级的关系进行了更为细致的分析，而米尔斯则仅仅看到了“精英”和“群众”。米利班德利用实证数据来概念化西方工业化国家中阶级冲突的结构，而米尔斯则看到了一个由富人、有权力和有名望的精英松散聚合的集体，但他未能超越描述性社会学进入解释性政治经济学。因此，当米利班德（和普朗查斯一样）将工人阶级斗争视为当代资本主义中一个持续存在的元素时，米尔斯只能看到一个被不满的知识分子驱动的顺服且松散的群体。换言之，米尔斯没有提出一个国家理论、意识形态理论，或是资本主义发展理论。在他对美国精英的描述中，虽有行为主体和机构，却缺乏结构和理论。 因此，针对米利班德的早期结构主义批评大多是在攻击一个稻草人，主要原因是这些批评未能认识到1956年之后盎格鲁-美国马克思主义在理论和实证上的进展。普朗查斯似乎是通过米尔斯主义的视角来阅读米利班德的，部分原因是他未能承认米利班德的国家分析中包含了米尔斯所缺少的重要结构维度。此外，米利班德还借鉴了更新的权力结构研究，这些研究确认了统治阶级凝聚力的额外机制并具体说明了统治阶级统治的过程。此外，米利班德的分析没有假设经济与政治之间分析上的分离，但他确实继承了米尔斯的那句格言：这种关系必须在特定的历史和地理配置中得以具体说明。对米尔斯标准的马克思主义批评并不适用于米利班德，后者显然从米尔斯与马克思主义者之间早期的辩论中学到了一些东西。 然而，与斯威齐、阿普泰克、哈灵顿、多姆霍夫和米利班德等人的做法不同，他们将辩论提升到了更高的实证、历史和理论复杂度，1970年代和1980年代的国家辩论却沦为了一场人为的方法论僵局，多姆霍夫（1986-1987, 295）认为这不过变成了马克思主义者间关于谁是更加马克思主义以及谁的理论更具政治功用的争论。有趣的是，米尔斯（1962, 98）几乎是预言性地指出，“从政治角度来看，纯粹的马克思主义者通常是失败者”，因为他们通常站在制度权威之外。实际上，弗朗西斯·福克斯·皮文（1994, 24）指出，普朗查斯-米利班德辩论的一个重要历史结果是普朗查斯主义结构主义在马克思主义者中取得了霸权。这种意识形态霸权让它有能力（暂时地）书写马克思主义的历史，并有能力从马克思主义理论甚至大量左翼分析中抹去C. Wright Mills的贡献。直到最近，C. Wright Mills的名字基本上从马克思主义的记忆和词汇中被抹去，除非作为一个不被看作“真正”马克思主义的例子的无礼用语。因为米利班德与米尔斯被联系在一起，他的工作错误地遭受了同样的命运（Wetherly等，2007）。与此同时，应当认识到，C. Wright Mills所代表的工作类型通过充当多元主义意识形态与资本主义国家理念批判之间的批判性桥梁，执行了重要的意识形态批判功能。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Cette approche est particulièrement utile dans les espaces communs ou les zones rarement utilisées, où il n'est pas nécessaire de maintenir l'éclairage activé en permanence, offrant ainsi une économie d'énergie significative. La minuterie fonctionne grâce à l'utilisation d'une bobine ou d'un composant électronique comme un transistor, qui, lorsqu'il est activé par une pression sur un bouton, génère un champ magnétique (dans le cas d'une bobine) ou modifie l'état du circuit (dans le cas d'un transistor), allumant les lumières. La durée pendant laquelle les lumières restent allumées est réglable grâce à un potentiomètre inclus dans le boîtier de la minuterie, offrant une flexibilité selon les besoins de l'utilisateur. De plus, la minuterie peut comporter un mode « avec effet » où appuyer sur le bouton pendant que les lumières sont déjà allumées réinitialise le temps, recommençant le compte à rebours pour l'extinction automatique, ou un mode « sans effet », où une pression supplémentaire sur le bouton n'a aucun impact sur la durée restante avant l'extinction. Ce choix de configuration permet une plus grande adaptabilité aux différents contextes d'utilisation. En résumé, une minuterie pour circuits d'éclairage offre une manière automatique et économique de gérer l'éclairage, en limitant le gaspillage d'énergie et en contribuant à réduire les coûts d'électricité, tout en s'adaptant aux habitudes et aux besoins spécifiques des utilisateurs."},{"prompt":"2- Installation d’un télérupteur : Le télérupteur est un appareil électrique permettant la commande de l'éclairage (allumage ou extinction des lampes), de plus de deux endroits différents.

Cette capacité en fait une option idéale pour de grandes pièces, des couloirs longs, ou des maisons à plusieurs étages, où il est pratique de pouvoir contrôler l'éclairage depuis de multiples endroits. Le cœur du télérupteur est une bobine qui, lorsqu'elle reçoit une impulsion électrique à partir d'un bouton poussoir, active l'appareil pour qu'il ferme le circuit d'éclairage. Cela rend les lampes connectées au circuit allumées. Une fois qu'une nouvelle impulsion est envoyée par un autre appui sur le bouton (peu importe duquel, parmi les multiples boutons connectés au système), la bobine agit de nouveau pour ouvrir le circuit, éteignant ainsi les lampes. Le système se distingue par ses caractéristiques uniques : - **Bobine Commandée par les Boutons Poussoirs :** C'est elle qui reçoit l'impulsion électrique et déclenche l'action du télérupteur. - **Contacts (Circuit de Puissance) :** Ils permettent de contrôler l'allumage ou l'extinction des points lumineux à chaque action sur un bouton poussoir. - **Système d’Accrochage Mécanique :** Il est essentiel pour maintenir le contact du télérupteur en position ouverte ou fermée, assurant ainsi que les lumières restent dans l'état désiré (allumées ou éteintes) jusqu'à ce qu'une nouvelle action soit effectuée.

This complex analysis involves the calculation of technical indicators, signal generation based on these indicators, and implementation of a trading strategy for backtesting. However, there are several points in the code and its approach that require attention or correction for optimal functionality and performance. 1. **Efficiency and Optimization**: The approach to calculating indicators (MACD, Twin Range Filter, and Engulfing pattern) for every row using \`df.apply()\` with the lambda function recalculating the indicator for the entire DataFrame up to the current row is highly inefficient. This could lead to very long execution times, especially with larger datasets. Instead, indicators should be calculated once for the whole DataFrame without using \`apply()\`. For indicators relying on past values in a row-wise calculation, consider adjusting the logic to operate on the whole series/vector where possible. 2. **Correctness in Strategy Logic**: - The strategies, especially how signals are generated and used, could potentially be incorrect or not aligned with the intended trading logic. For example, the conditions for generating buy or sell signals seem arbitrary and may not properly represent a sound trading strategy. - In the \`ChubbStrategy\` class, \`self.signal1\` retrieves signals but is done incorrectly. This lambda function does not dynamically change with new data in the backtesting loop. \`self.signal1\` will not act as expected, as it's not updating with each new tick but is rather fixed at instantiation. 3. **Issues with MetaTrader5 (MT5) initialization and data usage**: - The code snippet calls \`mt5.initialize()\` without a subsequent task if the initialization fails, which could lead to errors if MT5 is not correctly initialized. - The usage of MT5 is correct for acquiring historical data, but you'd need to ensure that the MT5 terminal is logged in and connected to a trade server for this to work successfully. This part is environment-specific and cannot be debugged in a non-MT5 environment. 4. **Backtesting Considerations**: - The approach to buy/sell in \`ChubbStrategy\` uses hard-coded values for stop loss and take profit, which may not be suitable for all market conditions or symbols. These should ideally be dynamically calculated based on volatility or some risk management criteria. - The setting of the \`signal\` indicator directly in the DataFrame used for backtesting effectively looks ahead, introducing look-ahead bias since the signal calculation uses future data not available at that moment in real trading. 5. **General Code Improvement Recommendations**: - The transformation and calculation parts of the code should be separated from the data retrieval and main logic for clarity and maintenance. - Error checking and handling should be added, especially for operations that depend on external systems (like MetaTrader5 data retrieval) or where operations could fail due to data issues. - Consider breaking down complex functions into smaller, testable parts to improve readability and maintainability. 6. **Technical Indicator Calculations**: - Use existing functions from libraries like TA-Lib efficiently, calling them once on the whole dataset or appropriately using their results, instead of recalculating within a loop or an apply function. **Overall**, while the approach attempts to integrate technical analysis with a backtesting strategy, its execution needs significant optimization and correction to ensure it functions correctly, efficiently, and aligns with practical trading strategies."},{"prompt":"how to fix this error : --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Exception Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-34-81bbf9f943b4> in <cell line: 2>() 1 # df['macd'] = df.apply(lambda x: macd(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) ----> 2 df['trf'] = df.apply(lambda x: twin_range_filter(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) 3 # df['engulfing'] = df.apply(lambda x: detect_engulfing(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) 7 frames /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pandas/core/frame.py in apply(self, func, axis, raw, result_type, args, **kwargs) 9421 kwargs=kwargs, 9422 ) -> 9423 return op.apply().__finalize__(self, method=\\"apply\\") 9424 9425 def applymap( /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pandas/core/apply.py in apply(self) 676 return self.apply_raw() 677 --> 678 return self.apply_standard() 679 680 def agg(self): /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pandas/core/apply.py in apply_standard(self) 796 797 def apply_standard(self): --> 798 results, res_index = self.apply_series_generator() 799 800 # wrap results /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/pandas/core/apply.py in apply_series_generator(self) 812 for i, v in enumerate(series_gen): 813 # ignore SettingWithCopy here in case the user mutates --> 814 results[i] = self.f(v) 815 if isinstance(results[i], ABCSeries): 816 # If we have a view on v, we need to make a copy because <ipython-input-34-81bbf9f943b4> in <lambda>(x) 1 # df['macd'] = df.apply(lambda x: macd(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) ----> 2 df['trf'] = df.apply(lambda x: twin_range_filter(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) 3 # df['engulfing'] = df.apply(lambda x: detect_engulfing(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) <ipython-input-33-c9fd72a07a5e> in twin_range_filter(df) 10 return smoothrng 11 per1, mult1, per2, mult2 = 27, 1.6, 55, 2.0 ---> 12 smrng1 = smoothrng(close, per1, mult1) 13 smrng2 = smoothrng(close, per2, mult2) 14 smrng = (smrng1 + smrng2) / 2 <ipython-input-33-c9fd72a07a5e> in smoothrng(x, t, m) 6 def smoothrng(x, t, m): 7 wper = t * 2 - 1 ----> 8 avrng = talib.EMA(np.abs(x.diff()), timeperiod=t) 9 smoothrng = talib.EMA(avrng, timeperiod=wper) * m 10 return smoothrng /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/talib/__init__.py in wrapper(*args, **kwargs) 33 for k, v in kwargs.items()} 34 ---> 35 result = func(*args, **kwargs) 36 37 # check to see if we got a streaming result talib/_func.pxi in talib._ta_lib.EMA() talib/_func.pxi in talib._ta_lib.check_begidx1() Exception: inputs are all NaN","completion":"The error you're encountering indicates that the function is receiving inputs that are all \`NaN\` values, which occurs during the calculation in the \`twin_range_filter\` function, specifically in the \`smoothrng\` where it attempts to calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) using the \`talib.EMA\` function. This issue is commonly due to attempting to apply the function to a part of the DataFrame where the necessary data hasn't fully populated yet, especially with financial time series data where some calculations require a certain number of data points to produce a valid output (e.g., calculating an EMA with a period of 27 requires at least 27 data points). Here's how you can adjust your approach to avoid this error: 1. **Pre-calculation Outside of Apply**: Calculate indicators that don't inherently depend on an iterative row-wise application outside \`df.apply()\` to improve performance and avoid this kind of error. You can then assign these indicators back to the DataFrame. 2. **Check for Sufficient Data**: Before trying to calculate an indicator for a subsection of your DataFrame, ensure that there's enough data for that calculation to make sense. This is especially crucial for the initial rows where you might not have enough historical data points. 3. **Replace or Skip NaN Values Before Applying Indicators**: Ensure that you're handling or replacing \`NaN\` values in your data before applying operations that expect numeric input. Some preprocessing to clean or fill missing data might be necessary. Let's address the error pragmatically with a simplified fix. Focus on adjusting the \`twin_range_filter\` function's calling context to avoid \`NaN\` complications: \`\`\`python def twin_range_filter(df): # Assuming this function is edited to return the TRF array correctly and not as part of the apply pass # Your existing logic here # Instead of applying the function row by row: # df['trf'] = df.apply(lambda x: twin_range_filter(df.loc[:x.name]), axis=1) # Calculate once for the entire DataFrame (example shown for theoretical clarity; adapt as per your logic): df['trf'] = twin_range_filter(df) # Ensure this function is adapted to work with entire DataFrame \`\`\` Revising functions that calculate indicators (\`macd\`, \`twin_range_filter\`, and \`detect_engulfing\`) to work with the entire DataFrame rather than slicing per row will significantly improve performance and avoid issues like the one you're encountering. Here's an example adjustment for one of the functions to give a clearer idea. Note that this specifically doesn't address the complete logic but provides a direction: \`\`\`python # Example of adjusting a simplified version of MACD calculation for the entire DataFrame def macd(df): macd, signal, hist = talib.MACD(df['close'], fastperiod=12, slowperiod=26, signalperiod=9) # This assumes you'll handle the indicator application and logic adjustment for the entire DataFrame return macd - signal # For illustrative purposes df['macd_signal'] = macd(df) # Simplified for illustration \`\`\` Adapt your indicator and strategy logic accordingly, aligning with how these financial libraries intend for batch operations on series/dataframes rather than iterative row-wise application for better performance and to prevent errors like \`Exception: inputs are all NaN\`."},{"prompt":"type this correction : def twin_range_filter(df): # Assuming this function is edited to return the TRF array correctly and not as part of the apply pass # Your existing logic here","completion":"To correct and optimize the \`twin_range_filter(df)\` function to avoid the error \\"\`inputs are all NaN\`\\" and to ensure it processes the entire DataFrame without applying it row-wise, we need to adjust its implementation. For demonstration, I'll present an improved approach based on the original, complex logic provided, focusing on performing calculations efficiently for the entire DataFrame without using the \`apply()\` method iteratively for each row. Given the context and the descriptive nature of your existing code, let's revise the \`twin_range_filter\` function. This revision will aim to calculate the Smooth Range (smrng), Filter (filt), Final Upper Bound (FUB), and Final Lower Bound (FLB) for the entire series at once. The code adjustment requires maintaining the logic intact while ensuring it operates over the whole DataFrame effectively.

Let's correct and make the function more consistent: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import pandas as pd import talib def twin_range_filter(df): df = df.copy() close = df['close'] # Apply smooth range filter def smoothrng(x, t, m): wper = t * 2 - 1 avrng = talib.EMA(np.abs(x.diff()), timeperiod=t) smoothrng = talib.EMA(avrng, timeperiod=wper) * m return smoothrng def rngfilt(x, r): rngfilt = x.copy() for i in range(1, len(x)): prev_val = rngfilt.iloc[i-1] if x.iloc[i] > prev_val: rngfilt.iloc[i] = max(prev_val, x.iloc[i] - r.iloc[i]) else: rngfilt.iloc[i] = min(prev_val, x.iloc[i] + r.iloc[i]) return rngfilt per1, mult1, per2, mult2 = 27, 1.6, 55, 2.0 smrng1 = smoothrng(close, per1, mult1) smrng2 = smoothrng(close, per2, mult2) smrng = (smrng1 + smrng2) / 2 filt = rngfilt(close, smrng) STR = filt + smrng STS = filt - smrng FUB = [STR.iloc[0]] FLB = [STS.iloc[0]] for i in range(1, len(df)): FUB.append(STR.iloc[i] if (STR.iloc[i] < STR.iloc[i-1]) or (close.iloc[i-1] > FUB[i-1]) else FUB[i-1]) FLB.append(STS.iloc[i] if (STS.iloc[i] > STS.iloc[i-1]) or (close.iloc[i-1] < FLB[i-1]) else FLB[i-1]) FUB = np.array(FUB) FLB = np.array(FLB) df['FUB'] = FUB df['FLB'] = FLB # Determine TRF logic here TRF = np.where(close > FUB, FUB, np.where(close < FLB, FLB, np.nan)) df['TRF'] = np.nan_to_num(TRF, nan=np.roll(TRF, 1)) # Mock logic for TRF, fill initial NaN with previous non-NaN value long_signal = close > np.roll(FUB, 1) short_signal = close < np.roll(FLB, 1) df['long_signal'] = long_signal df['short_signal'] = short_signal return df \`\`\` This revised version addresses several key issues: 1. **Consistency in Return Values**: The function now consistently returns a DataFrame augmented with the new columns for the trade filter, bounds, and signals, maintaining a consistent structure. 2. **Clear Calculation Logic**: Each part of the function has been kept clear and logically structured to ensure the calculations are understandable and maintainable. 3. **Signal Handling**: Created signals are based on the conditions provided. Any tuning required for these signals may involve adjusting these conditions or how \`TRF\` is computed. Please be aware that I included a mock logic for \`TRF\` filling with \`np.nan_to_num(TRF, nan=np.roll(TRF, 1))\`, as the original intention behind \`TRF\` wasn't fully clear from the provided code. You might want to adjust this to fit your exact requirements. The primary focus was on correctly integrating with \`df\` and ensuring the various additions and logical operations are handled appropriately."},{"prompt":"seharus nya hasil dari twin range filter jika if df.iloc[-1]['long_signal']: return 1 elif df.iloc[-1]['short_signal']: return 2 ,,,, yang hana mengembalikan antara nilai 1 atau 2 sesuai perhitungan per baris","completion":"If your goal with the \`twin_range_filter\` function is strictly to return a single value (either 1 or 2) to indicate the last row's signal status (whether it's a long or short signal) instead of modifying and returning the entire DataFrame, you should focus on simplifying the function to assess just the last row's condition based on your criteria.

The following are common ways to achieve this in Python: 1. **Using Concurrent Futures (ThreadPoolExecutor or ProcessPoolExecutor):** For IO-bound tasks like making HTTP requests, \`ThreadPoolExecutor\` is often a better choice since the bottleneck is usually waiting for the network rather than CPU processing. However, if BeautifulSoup's parsing becomes the bottleneck (less likely but could happen with large responses), you might experiment with \`ProcessPoolExecutor\`. 2. **AsyncIO with aiohttp:** For an entirely asynchronous approach. Let's go with the \`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor\` since it's most likely to offer significant improvements for your case, which is primarily IO-bound: # Updated Function with Concurrent Futures \`\`\`python from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup def get_directories(url): try: response = requests.get(url) if response.status_code == 200: soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser') directories = [a.get_text() for a in soup.find_all('a') if a.get_text().endswith('/')] return directories else: print(f\\"Error fetching directories for {url}: HTTP {response.status_code}\\") return [] except Exception as e: print(f\\"Error fetching directories for {url}: {str(e)}\\") return [] def get_directories_concurrently(url_list): with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=20) as executor: # Adjust the number of workers based on your environment futures = {executor.submit(get_directories, url): url for url in url_list} results = [] for future in as_completed(futures): directories = future.result() results.append(directories) return results \`\`\` # Usage You would replace your list comprehension: \`\`\`python [get_directories(x) for x in rf[\\"path\\"]] \`\`\` With a call to the new function: \`\`\`python directories = get_directories_concurrently(rf[\\"path\\"]) \`\`\` # Notes - **Adjust the Pool Size (\`max_workers\`) as Necessary:** The optimal number of workers depends on your machine's capabilities and the nature of the task. While network-bound tasks can handle many workers, setting the number too high can lead to diminishing returns or produce additional overhead. - **Consider Rate Limiting:** If you're making many requests to the same website, consider implementing rate-limiting or respecting \`robots.txt\` rules to avoid getting IP-banned. - **Async Approach**: If you're dealing with a very large scale of URLs or need every bit of performance, exploring \`asyncio\` with \`aiohttp\` might offer further benefits. This approach requires a different programming model where your code execution is event-driven. - **Error Handling:** More robust error handling and retry logic might be beneficial if you expect network errors or other intermittent issues. Using this method will allow you to process the URLs in parallel, significantly speeding up the task compared to a sequential approach."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As we dive into the composition, the layers tell a story that intertwines physical and emotional landscapes. **Foreground:** The emotional girl is central, evoking a sense of vulnerability and introspection. Her pose is elegant yet burdened; she might be seated or standing in a way that suggests a moment of deep contemplation or overwhelming emotion. Her dress, an extension of her emotional state, flows in an elegant, almost ethereal manner, swirling around her in muted tones of blues and grays, perhaps with hints of faded roses or lavenders. The fabric, while appearing luxurious and flowing, is integrated seamlessly into the abstract forms that surround her, emphasizing both the elegance and the distorted perception of her world. **Skin Lesions as Narratives:** On her skin, lesions are visible but interpreted artistically as a surreal representation of her internal and external struggles. These are not just marks but symbols—perhaps appearing as slightly more vivid patches or abstract shapes within the muted color scheme, integrating seamlessly with the distortions of her form and dress. They tell a story of pain, struggle, and perhaps illness, embedding deeper narrative layers to the emotional landscape portrayed. The lesions could resemble cracked porcelain, subtly echoing the wood's texture in the background, suggesting her fragility and the pressures that threaten to break her. **Background:** Set against cracked dry wood, the background serves as both a literal and metaphorical foundation for the composition. The wood, with its deep cracks and muted, almost desolate, appearance, complements the overall dreamlike, somewhat melancholic atmosphere. The cracks might appear to mirror the lesions on her skin, suggesting a profound connection between the girl and her environment. This background adds depth and texture, emphasizing the surreal and abstract quality of the work. Light and shadow play across the wood, creating a subtle interplay that hints at the complexities of her inner world. **Style and Atmosphere:** Embracing the essence of surrealist expressionism, the artwork distorts reality to evoke a strong emotional response. Forms and figures might blend and melt into one another, with the girl’s figure, her dress, and the surrounding elements intertwining in a dreamlike dance. The muted color scheme—composed of mainly blues, grays, and soft, earthy tones—reinforces the surreal, melancholic atmosphere. Colors might bleed into one another, suggesting both the fluidity of emotion and the instability of her perceived reality. A slight abstract treatment of the figures and elements further amplifies the expressionist intent, making the viewer feel the emotional turmoil and ethereal beauty intertwined in the girl’s existence. **Conclusion:** This mixed-media piece transcends the mere visual to become a deeply affecting exploration of emotional and physical affliction, all while maintaining a haunting beauty. The use of surrealist expressionism allows for an abstract and distorted representation that challenges perceptions, making the invisible struggles visible in a poignant, compelling manner. Through the muted color scheme and dreamlike atmosphere, the artwork invites the viewer into a deeply personal experience, one that is both intimate and universal."},{"prompt":"Mixed media artwork + Emotional girl + Elegant dress + Skin lesions as a storytelling element + In the style of surrealist expressionism, muted color scheme, dreamlike atmosphere, abstract and distorted forms on a cracked dry wood background, normal, generate an etsy title that is only 100 characters long, Begin title with \\"Matte Canvas\\", do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don't mention on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' or '<strong>' for formatting only newline ' ', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","completion":"Matte Canvas: Surreal Emotion, Girl in Elegant Dress with Story of Lesions, Muted Dreamlike Art"},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Minimalist Cream Furry Cozy Coffee Cup - Chic White Home Decor Accessory.

The assassination of US Civil War survivor and Confederate revanchist Princeton dean turned American dictator Woodrow Wilson by a joint collaboration of the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai in 1914 upon discovery of his plans to put the USA in WW1 on the side of the Entente throws the USA into chaos, allowing the Central Powers consisting of the post 1871, pre 1919 German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled federal parliamentary semi-constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Prussia ruling over much of modern-day eastern Germany and Western Poland along with Russian Kalingard-dominated Federal parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the German Empire, The Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine ruled Federal parliamentary constitutional imperial royal monarchy of the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire ruling [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire] over Illryia [Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina], Greater Hungary [Hungary, Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje, Vojvodina and Prekmurje in Serbia, Transylvania and most of the Banat in Romania, Carpathian Ruthenia in Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland], Bohemia and Moravia [Czechia and Slovakia] and Galicia-Lodomeria in Ukraine from [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy's/Austria-Hungarian Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Austria [Austria, Slovenia, South Tyrol], , the Catholic cadet branch of the original German branch of the current British royal family, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial monarchy of the Tsardom of Bulgaria/Third Bulgarian Tsardom/Restored Byzantine Empire ruling over Bulgaria, the Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial royal absolute Islamic monarchy of the Sublime Ottoman State/Eastern Roman Sultanate/Islamic Rome ruling [the Ottoman Empire] over the Arab Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Kuwait from [the Ottoman Empire's stronghold and homebase] Turkey, [the assassination of Woodrow Wilson in this timeline allowing the Central Powers] to win WW1 and [the Central Powers in this timeline] subsequently survive the late 1910s and early 1920s into the rest of the 20th century, the 21th century and beyond in this timeline. Japan also gets to keep its post-WW1 protectorate of the federal parliamentary presidential republic of the Far Eastern Republic on Russia's East Coast post-1922 in this timeline due to the USSR in this timeline essentially being a Siberian rump state surrounded by Ottoman satellite monarchies in Central Asia, Pahlavi-ruled Iran, German and Austria-Hungarian satellite states in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Caucuses and the German-Danish-Russian House of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional absolute royal imperial monarchy of the Russian Empire/Third Rome/Third Roman Empire/Russian Rome/Russian Byzantium managing to survive in European Russia post Russian Civil War, albiet under the control of the Russian nationalist, Russian supremacist, Russian Orthodox supremacist, proto-fascist White faction as a joint German-Austrian protectorate in this timeline. During the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between Imperial Japan, the Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China, Manchuria and Inner Mongolia against the Kuomingtang-ruled Nationalist China based in Guangdong and Guangxi, the USA and the USSR, the Japanese launch a successful military operation against the Han Chinese bandit faction/warlord clique/military junta/Beiyang Government faction of the Manchurian-based Fengtian Clique immediately after the death of the Fengtian Clique's leader, the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system and then combined warlord of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique, \\"the Old Marshal\\" Zhang Zhuolin in 1928 in this timeline, with Zhuolin's son and thus the rightful heir of Zhuolin's positions as warlord of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique, Zhang Xueliang, vanishing mysteriously sometime after the invasion, never to be seen again. The Manchu Qing Imperial Court in Manchuria, which had continued existing in Manchuria even after the Xinhai Revolution is given control of the Fengtian Clique after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in this timeline, with the last Emperor of the Qing Empire, Aisin-Gioro Pu-Yi, taking Zhuolin's positions as warlord of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique after the Qing Imperial Court take over of the Fengtian Clique in this timeline. The Fengtian Clique's armed wing and the Manchurian-based branch of the Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China's armed wing and combined armed forces, the Beiyang Army, the National Pacification Army, becomes a modern, developed, highly advanced and technical military force with Japanese support after the Qing Imperial Court seizes control of the Fengtian Clique in this timeline. This Qing Imperial court-ruled Fengtian Clique later becomes the pre-WW2, WW2-era, Imperial Japanese era protectorate of the Qing imperial family, the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled and monarchist, Manchurian nationalist, anti-communist, Pan Asian political party Concordia Association-ruled Unitary personalist one-party constitutional imperial royal parliamentary monarchy under a totalitarian military dictatorship of the Empire of Manchukuo, with Pu-Yi becoming Manchukuo's first Emperor under the combined regal and era name of Kangte [Kant]. Police units in Manchuria nominally operating under the Beiyang Government's control but in reality under the Fengtian Clique's control also become the main law enforcement agency of Manchukuo, managing the central police department responsible for all police in Manchuria after Manchuko’s formation, with a Maritime Police to combat smuggling along with cracking down on smuggling and maintain maritime security within Manchurian waters, first under the Manchukuo Ministry of Public Security and then under the General Directorate of Security Affairs, the Manchukuo Police after the formation of Manchukuo both in real life and this timeline. The National Pacification Army becomes Manchukuo’s combined armed forces, the Manchukuo Imperial Army after the formation of Manchukuo both in real life and in this timeline. Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions then come under the rule of the Japanese protectorate of the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled absolute royal khanate of the Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in 1939 like in real life, with the Inner Mongolian military units consisting of ethnic Mongols, with some Han Chinese infantry formations in the service of the Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang, the Inner Mongolian Army being formed from both Han Chinese and Mongolian Beiyang Army, National Pacification Army and even the Kuomingtang's armed wing and the Nationalist Chinese Armed Forces, the National Revolutionary Army units in Chahar and Suiyan under Japanese supervision like in real life. Covert operations against Nationalist Chinese leadership and military personnel in addition to US and Soviet personnel covertly assisting the Nationalist Chinese by the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai lead to the destabilization of Nationalist China and its fragmentation into various cliques and warlord states. The Japanese also facilitate the restoration of the pre-Qing Ming dynasty ruled by the Jurchen/Manchurian-Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu as its reigning imperial family through the Japanese protectorate of the Beiyang Government, first as a regency in the form of the Beiyang Government-ruled Provisional Government of the Republic of China ruling over Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan and Jiangsu from 7 July 1937-to March 30 1940 and the Reformed Government of the Republic of China ruling over Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui along with Nanjing/Nanking and Shanghai from 28 March 1938 to March 30, 1940 and finally through the Nationalist Chinese government branch of the Reorganized National Government headed by Dr. Sun Yat Sen's protoge and true heir Wang Jingwei formed on 30 March 1940, which is a restored Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China melding the best elements of the Beiyang Government and Nationalist China with a combination of Beiyang and Nationalist Chinese heradly, symbols and icongraphy with the descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu as the reigning imperial family instead of Yuan Shikai's descendants with Jingwei being its prime minister instead of a Japanese protectorate Nationalist Chinese Republic like in real life and [the Japanese] coopt the Ming restorationist millennialist society of the Yellow Sand Society into the \\"New People's Society\\" a political organ that was designed to spread the government's ideas to the public and mobilize economic and military support for the Provisional Government and Japan, whose activities ranged from from training future civil servants, sending students to Japan, giving medical services to remote villages, providing disaster relief, establish free tea houses, promoting Chinese art and pilgrimages to Confucian temples, as well as discussing political events in their radio stations and official newspaper, the New People's Daily, emphasising Confucian virtues, familial piety, respect for authority, and devotion to scholarship in this timeline. The restoration of the Ming through the Reorganized Nationalist Government as the government of China by the Japanese deals a severe blow to the Nationalist Chinese war effort in this timeline with units of the Kuomingtang's armed wing and the Nationalist Chinese Armed Forces, thee National Revolutionary Army, defecting to the Reorganized Nationalist Government in droves. The leader of the Kuomingtang since Sun Yat-Sen's death in 1925 and thus the dictator of Nationalist China since then, the Cantonese revolutionary turned warlord and current politician Chiang Kai-Shek, mysteriously disappears while he and his top generals are in the Nationalist Chinese wartime provisional capital of Chongqing with Nationalist China immediately surrendering to Reorganized Nationalist Government in this timeline, ending this timeline's Second Sino-Japanese War with a Japanese-Beiyang Government-Manchurian victory. The National Revolutionary Army is absorbed into the Reorganized Nationalist Government combined armed forces, the Peacekeeping Army after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline with Kai-Shek loyalists being purged from the Peacekeeping Army. The Ming dynasty's combined ground combat and naval warfare division, the Great Ming Army is also restored through the Peacekeeping Army. The Imperial secret police that served the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China that was also a imperial military body, with the authority to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecutions with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating and punishing anyone, including nobles and the emperor's relatives along with the authority to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecutions with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating and punishing anyone, including nobles and the emperor's relatives, and also to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecuting those deemed as enemies of the state, granted with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating, detaining them without trial and punishing them, without going through due process, whose members were bound to the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China and took direct orders from them [the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China], also serving as political commissary of the Great Ming State's combined ground combat force and naval warfare force, the Great Ming Army in times of war, the Jǐnyīwèi [brocade-clothing guard/Embroidered Uniform Guard], [the Jǐnyīwèi] is [the Jǐnyīwèi] restored [the Jǐnyīwèi] through the Nationalist Chinese military intelligence agency devoted to intelligence gathering and covert spying operation for purposes of national security and defense, having a great influence amongst the NRA along with the Nationalist Chinese police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad, involved in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents, the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline with joint aid by the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai. The Beiyang Government's bicameral legislative branch divided into a Senate and a House of Representatives, the National Assembly is restored in Reorganized Nationalist Government-ruled Han China after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline through a reorganization of the Nationalist Chinese 113 member unilateral legislature whose members are directly elected for four-year terms by the people of Nationalist China through parallel voting which is also responsible for the passage of legislation in Nationalist China, which is then sent to the president [of Nationalist China] for signing and also holds the power to initiate several constitutional processes, including initiating constitutional amendments (then determined by a national referendum), recalls of the Nationalist Chinese president (then determined by a recall vote), and impeachments of the Nationalist Chinese president (then tried by the Constitutional Court), the Legislative Yuan into the Central Political Committee, the National Government Committee , a Legislative Yuan and an Executive Yuan by Wang Jingwei in this timeline. The splinter cell of the KMT lead by Wang Jingwei governing the Reorganized National Government eventually relinquishes its hold on power to allow free and fair, multi-party democratic elections under secret ballot in the Reorganized National Government-ruled Han China after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline After a series of joint campaigns between the restored Great Ming Army, the Imperial Manchukuo Army and the IJAF in East Turkestan against the Han Chinese warlord clique/Nationalist Chinese government faction/military junta of the Xinjiang clique occupying East Turkestan lead to the demise of the Xingjiang Clique and the subsequent restoration of the now long dissolved Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional Islamic imperial royal monarchy of Ottoman Empire as the government [the Ottoman Empire] of post-Xinjiang clique East Turkestan, with the post-1842, pre-1922 army of the Ottoman Empire after the country [the Ottoman Empire] was [the Ottoman Empire] reorganized [the Ottoman Empire] along modern western European lines during the Tanzimat modernization period [in the Ottoman Empire], the Modern Ottoman Army, [the Modern Ottoman Army] being [the Modern Ottoman Army] restored [the Modern Ottoman Army] from the Xingjiang Clique's warlord and bandit soldiers after the restoration of the Ottoman Empire in East Turkestan. Negotiations with the ethnic Yi warlord ruling over the Chinese bandit faction/Chinese warlord faction/Nationalist Chinese government faction of the Yunnan Clique governing Yunnan, Long Yun, , lead to the restoration of the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government, albiet under Japanese protection. Covert Destablization of the Soviet satellite dictatorship of Marxist-Leninist, Stalinist, far left Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party-ruled Unitary Marxist–Leninist one-party socialist republic of the Mongolian People's Republic occupying Outer Mongolia by the Kempeitai leads to the fall of the Mongolian People's Republic and the restoration of the spiritual head of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia also holding the title of Bogd Gegeen, making them the top-ranked lama in Mongolia known as the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as the Bogd Khan [Holy Emperor]-ruled post-Xinhai, unitary Buddhist absolute theocratic imperial monarchy of the feudal Khanate of the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia/Great Mongolian State as the government [the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia/Great Mongolian State] of both Outer Mongolia and Inner Mongolia minus Chahar and Suiyan. Cantonese nationalist and Cantonese independence factions of the Kuomingtang, the NRA, the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics and the Legislative Yuan break away from the restored Great Ming State and subsequently establish an independent Cantonian Republic in Guangdong and Guangxi with with Kai-Shek's second in command, the Cantonese Guangxi-based and [Guangxi-born] warlord Li Zongren, [Zongren] becoming leader [Zongren] of the South China Republic with covert Japanese backing. The South China Republic later becomes a restored post-1661, pre-1683 Ming satellite state/rump kingdom/tributary state of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled absolute royal monarchy and rump kingdom/satelite state/tributary kingdom of the Ming dynasty of the Tungning Kingdom, albviet as a Japanese protectorate. Due to the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty being [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] a nativized Taiwanese with strong influences from the Ming dynasty, side branch of the Japanese Imperial Family, the supposedly Shinto pantheon-descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty due to the founder of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty's founder, the scholar-offical under the Ming dynasty turned general in the Great Ming Army and pirate during the Qing conquest of Ming China Zheng Chenggong, having the princess of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty Minamoto Matsu as his [Chenggong's] mother, the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty with the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands subsequently [the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] being [the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] absorbed [the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] into the Japanese nobility, aristocracy and royalty. Tibet remains under the rule of the Llama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet, becoming a sort of Asian Vatican City. The division of the three main nations of the China region [Cantonia, Han China and Manchuria] into independent nations prevents the Second Sino-Japanese War between Imperial Japan, the Beiyang Government. Manchukuo and Nationalist China, the USSR and the USA and thus allows the Japanese Empire, Nationalist China and Manchuria to all survive post-1947 into the 21th century and beyond. The restored Ming dynasty does help Japan liberate the Vietnamesed nativized side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Imperial absolute parliamentary Royal monarchy of the Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Laotian Khun Lo dynasty-ruled unitary parliamentary constitutional Royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Laos and the parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Cambodian House of Norodom-ruled Kingdom of Cambodia in Cambodia, [the restored Ming dynasty helping Japan liberate the Empire of Vietnam and the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia] from the French colonial occupation of French Indochina ruling over Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and [the Japanese] force the French to [the French] recognize Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian independence. The USA and USSR do attempt to start the 1955-1975 Vietnam War in Indochina in this timeline but due to the leader of the Communist Viet Cong in Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh turning on the Soviets and Americans and supporting the Japanese during the liberation of Indochina in this timeline, this attempt fails and Indochina is mostly stable due to the lack of a war. The Brittanians still develop the explosive, radioactive, hyperconductive supermineral known as Sakuradite [Code Geass]-powered humanoid war machine mechs known as Knightmare Frames [Code Geass] sometime in 1955 like in canon Code Geass but spies working for the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai steal the designs with similar cases of industrial espionage being committed by German and Austria-Hungarian spies against Brittania The passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 worsens the race riots in the USA in this timeline with radical elements of the US Democrat Party, especially the Democrat's white supremacist, white nationalist, Anglophile, Confederate revisionist, Anglo supremacist, America hating, interventionist fascist Blue Dog wing and the Blue Dog's paramilitary arm, the infamous KKK fighting US Republicans, Soviet-backed black nationalists, Afro-supremacists and Afro-centrists and communists in the streets. The KKK and Blue Dogs allow the Brittanians to take the former American Confederate States in order to \\"restore order\\" only to find out that the rumors of concentration camps in Brittania weren't rumors after all as the Germanic-dominated Europe establishes an informal protectorate over the northern US The BETA never invade Earth in the 1960s like in canon Muv-Luv in this but the primary weapon systems built as all-purpose assault units, able to fight in urban areas, on uneven terrain, and 3-dimensional combat, coated in anti-projectile and heat-resistant composite whose primary form is that of oversized supersonic fighter jets but also have the ability to transform into large bipedal humanoid war mech machines upon command possessing plasma-based weaponry and advanced rocket technology known as the Tactical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv] are still developed by Western Europe and Imperial Japan in 1974 like in canon Muv-Luv. Development of the Tactical Surface Fighters in Imperial Japan is partially influenced by the covert introduction of advanced technologies from Jurai, the First Galactic Empire and the Time-Space Administrative Bureau to Japan under various guises and schemes. The resurgence of magic [The Irregular of Magic High School] albiet in a form polished and heavily enhanced through modern technology and determined by genetics, limiting the number of magicians in existence happens sometime in the 1980s-1990s instead of in the 2090s like in canon the Irregular at Magic High School in this timeline, being deliberately conflated by an ability held by some people that is usually something someone is born with and develops during childhood, although there are cases of it being acquired later in life, usually through some sort of trauma known as ESP [Zettai Karen Children] by the governments of the world. Children of Cross Over Other Nations [COCOON] ,the think tank whose members strive for the ideal of world peace and supervise and educate children who've returned from other worlds, running the network of special schools set up for those who have been to an alternate (and most of the time, magical) world, and returned known as BABEL from Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero is a front for the hidden subspecies of humans whose ancestors were bestowed powers and blessings by the gods in order to combat the approaching demons, displaying superhuman abilities able to rival that of demons, as well as being able to heal from even serious injuries in a short span of time than normal, proficient in various weapons and magic which is based on their personal preferences or talents, receive blessings or form pacts with various spirits, forming contracts with unique weapons along with the ability to use Ki/Qi known as the Hero Clan [the Testament of Sister New Devil].

As Kurama, Noboyuki discovers the existence of the secretive government faction doing inhumane and cruel experiments on the all female with cat-like bone horns on top of their heads, invisible psychic arms that only can be seen by another of their kind with the ability to cut things through high frequency vibration, act as ordinary arms or infect humans with the virus that makes unborn human females into embyros, [the invisible psychic arms] known as vectors and [the vectors] are [the vectors] controlled by said horns- having human subpecies of the diclonii [Elfen Lied] known only as the Institute [Elfen Lied] after he is recruited by its sadistic director, the now-elderly Chief Kakuzawa due to Kurama's research into genetics. Nobuyuki, being a part-alien pervert and voyuer but having also seen the evil of humanity while fighting for the Japanese against Kai-Shek's forces, the Americans and Russians, is horrified and slowly begins to change the Institute from within, removing the more evil scientists from both Japan and those recruited from the US Southern States and the USSR and making the research more benign before leaking Kakuzawa's location to the American CIA, having the crazy elder dead and leaving Nobuyuki using Kurama's identity in charge of the Institute. Nobuyuki using Kurama's identity reforms the Institute into the secret service division of Japan Government Home Ministry that study and support Espers in Japan, B.A.B.E.L. [Zettai Karen Children] which remains the IJA's ESP Secret Service Corp in this timeline due to the survival of Imperial Japan in this timeline. Nobuyuki also finally gets lucky with the ladies as the current head of the infamous Yotsuba clan [the Irregular at Magic High School] of magicians, assassins and spellswords, the tall, slender, and buxom, black-haired, red-eyed, full of feminine charms and enchanting mature beauty, fearsome, skilled and powerful magician Yotsuba Maya [the Irregular at Magic High School], finds herself [Maya] transported to the ESP Secret Service Corp after [Maya] suffering from sexual abuse at the hands of Kai-Shek cultists hired by the CIA while on vacation in America and is lucky to arrive after Nobuyuki's using Kurama's identity's reformation, followed by her [Maya's] older twin sister, the tall, slender, curvy and buxom, gentle, polite, and lady-like, with perfect etiquette, Yotsuba Miya [the Irregular at Magic High School] some time later. Maya and Miya both fall in love with Nobuyuki using Kurama's identity, forcing him to take on the identity of the brown-haired, tall and slender, ordinary salaryman with a love for fishing Hyōdō Gorou [High School DxD] with Miya marrying Nobuyuki as Gorou as the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender but also curvy and buxom high ranking corporate executive Miki [High School DxD] and Maya becoming Nobuyuki's as Gorou's consort and unofficial second wife. Nobuyuki as Gorou and Maya have their first child, the brown-haired, amber-eyed loud, perverted and somewhat dumb video game, perverted manga, anime and light novel nerd who dreams of being a harem king who, unknown to his classmates and teachers, has one of the items blessed by the dragon with the power to manipulate dreams and reality as well as to create things, residing in the gap between dimensions known as Great Red, who is known to Christians as God the Father, Muslims as Allah and Jews as Jehovah, more specifically the oversized gauntlet with the power to boost its host's characteristics when the host requests it via verbally or mentally resembling a dragon's claw with an oversized emerald in it with the soul of the legendary Welsh Dragon Ddraig, Boosted Gear inside of him, Hyōdō Issei ,sometime after this strange concubinage agreement, with Nobuyuki as Gorou and Miya as Miki having their first child, the black-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite, ice manipulating magic-having, loving and caring but also very possessive and devoted, formal and well-spoken Japanese noble heiress Yotsuba Miyuki [the Irregular at Magic High School] a year later. Nobuyuki as Gorou and Maya have their second child when Issei is around three years old, the brown-auburn haired, green-eyed, short, slender and petite, kind, loving and caring but with a hot temper young girl Kinomoto Sakura [Cardcaptor Sakura], who later becomes the current guardian of the sentiment magical cards known as the Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura]. and also has the spiritual sight which allows her to see spirits to the point of being able to see the difference in colors of the spirits as well as even perceive the hidden aura and the exact nature of spirits known as Crystal Eyes [the Irregular at Magic High School] in this fanfic. Nobuyuki as Gorou and Miya as Miki having their second child when Issei is four year old, the brown-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender but also rather curvy and buxom, cute, frail and oversensitive but chipper and hyperactive, light-manipulating magic having Japanese noble heiress Mitsui Honoka [the Irregular at Magic High School]. Due to the Yotsuba in fact being a side-branch of the Hyūga-Tokugawa in this fanfic and Nobuyuki also having some Ōtsutsuki-Great Yamato blood in him, Issei in this story ends up becoming the Japanese Crown Prince with Miyuki becoming the Japanese Crown Princess. When Issei is just a young boy, the Japanese Empire launches a somewhat semi covert campaign to conquer the hidden continent near Asia the Ōtsutsuki clan landed on when arriving on Earth both in canon Naruto and in this story, which mostly succeeds due to the advanced technology of the outside world and the hidden continent becoming dependent on chakra even after the Ōtsutsuki clan were booted out. The Ōtsutsuki clan's capital of the steampunk to dieselpunk and very early cyberpunk era, snow-ridden land of the Land of Snow [Naruto] is given control over the Hidden Continent once more after the Ōtsutsuki reconquest of the hidden continent through the Japanese continent, with the side-branch of the Ōtsutsuki with skills in technology and thus the Land of Snow's royal family, the Kazehana clan, being given control over the hidden continent and being upgraded to shogun from their previous daimyo status. The Ōtsutsuki-Great Yamato ruling over Japan as its imperial family in this story also funds the reconstruction of the main Ōtsutsuki settlement in the hidden continent, the Land of Whirlpools [Naruto franchise] with Japanese Earth-based and Jurian technologies being both used in its construction along with Fūinjutsu and ninja POWs from the hidden continent. Those among the Hyūga clan who had remained in the hidden continent after the Ōtsutsuki departure from the hidden continent, mostly in the hidden continent's land of Fire [Naruto franchise] and more specifically its Hidden Leaf Village [Naruto franchise] are forcefully reabsorbed into the Hyūga-Tokugawa with the improvements to the Jūken made by the Konoha branch of the Hyūga clan being used to improve the Japan-based Hyūga-Tokugawa's martial arts. the Ōtsutsuki's other sub branch of the Uchiha-uji |Uchiha clan (Uchiha-uji)|, a clan (the Uchiha-uji) of |what the Uchiha-uji’s demographics were| chakra using faux shinobi |the Uchiha-uji’s demographics| with |what supernatural ability the Uchiha-uji has| the doujutsu Kekkei Genkai of |what the Uchiha-uji’s Kekkei Genkai was| the Sharingan |Copy Wheel Eye/Mirror Wheel Eye (Sharingan), which (the Sharingan) allows its (the Sharingan’s user) to (what the Sharingan allows its /the Sharingan’s/ user to do) see the chakra inside an opponents body, posses incredible clarity of perception when it (the Sharingan) is (the Sharingan) active, copy every jutsu the user of the Sharingan sees (when it /the Sharingan/ is /the Sharingan/ active), suggest thoughts and actions to a target through eye contact, (the Sharingan when active) coercing them (the target of this particular Sharingan ability) to (the target of this particular Sharingan ability) divulge information or (the target of this particular Sharingan ability) act in a particular way, potentially without the target’s awareness, and (the Sharingan when active) possessing (what other ability the Sharingan has) a limited form of precognition, |the Sharingan| taking the form of a red iris with three comma marks swirling around the pupil when activated] residing in the Hidden Leaf Village is also forcefully reinducted back into the Ōtsutsuki clan, with the Hidden Leaf Village's Uchiha dominated police force being introduced to modern methods and ideolog The excerpt should focus on Nobuyuki as Gorou and Miya as Miki along with Maya, a young then six year old Issei, a young then three year old Sakura, a young then five year old Miyuki and a young then two year old Honoka accompanied by the current princess of the Land of Snow visiting the conquered Hidden Leaf Village, the then eighteen year old black haired, blue eyed, tall, slender and buxom Kazehana Koyuki who is also one of Issei's fiances in this story via a heavily modified Tactical Surface Fighter in plane mode under stealth cloaking and then a special armored train as Japanese shogunal and imperial flags fly over the conquered village. Miyuki snarkily comments that the reconquest of the lost homeland [the hidden continent] was much easier than expected while also stating surprise that the ninja lands never evolved since the Ōtsutsuki left while on the plane to which Issei deadpans at, having been allowed to personally command a TSF and also lead troops into battle while finding he was pretty good at it during the war. Sakura then innocently asks why didn't the ninja of the continent use chakra to advance their technology, to which Koyuki replies that these ninja are pretty retarded, like the KKK in America, the KGB in the USSR and Kai-Shek in China in the outside world. When they arrive in the Hidden Leaf Village, a Hyūga escort driving a specially modified Nissan Century Royal limousine is waiting for them and drives them through the village, which is undergoing construction as the monument to the Hidden Leaf's combined military dictators and town mayors, the Hokages known as the Hokage Monument is being demolished to be replaced with the leader of the Ōtsutsuki who landed on the hidden continent, Kaguya along with Ōtsutsuki clan descendants serving as Japanese Emperors with a radio broadcast exposing the now-defunct Ne [Root/the Foundation |Ne|], a top-secret black-ops division of Konohagakure's chakra-using faux shinobi ground forces [Ne] dedicated to causing eternal peace through eternal war and its [Ne's] now-aged but still-militant, deceptive, charismatic and utterly deranged leader with secret Sharingan implants Shimura Danzo, who [Danzo] believed in the supremacy of the Leaf above all others playing all through the village to the Hokage Office, to get the surrender documents from the elderly Sandaime Hokage's [Third Fire Shadow's] Sarutobi Hiruzen's prized student, the snake manipulating, black-haired and amber-eyed, tall and slender, manical and devoted but also insanely brilliant Konoha shinobi turned mad scientist, Orochimaru and Hiruzen himself. Please Note: The events of this chapter excerpt occur within a single universe in chronological order, and there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing here.","completion":"The morning sun rose high over the Hidden Leaf Village, its rays filtering through the dismantled remnants of the Hokage Monument. The air, usually filled with the sounds of chakra-infused training and the bustling of village life, was now heavy with the tension of conquest and reconstruction. Under the imposing shadow of Japanese shogunal and imperial flags, a high-tech procession moved seamlessly through the village streets, an armored train followed by a sleek Nissan Century Royal limousine, juxtaposing sharply against the traditional architecture of the fire nation's once-hidden village. Seated within the limousine's refined interior, Nobuyuki, adopting the guise of Gorou, turned his gaze toward the window, his mind a mix of contemplation and mild amusement. By his side, Miya, or Miki in her current identity, held their daughter Miyuki close, ensuring the young heiress’s comfort. \\"Who would've thought,\\" Miyuki mused aloud, her voice tinged with a mix of sarcasm and genuine wonder, \\"the mighty shinobi lands would fall so easily to technology and strategy. It's as if time stood still for them since the Ōtsutsuki's departure.\\" Issei, the six-year-old crown prince-to-be, whose dreams of heroism were now intertwined with his real-life feats of bravery, leaned forward, his eyes sparkling with unshed excitement. \\"It was incredible! Seeing those Tactical Surface Fighters in action, they didn’t stand a chance. I mean, chakra is cool and all, but have you seen a TSF in full battle mode?\\" Sakura, three years old but wise beyond her years, piped up from her seat next to the window, \\"But why didn’t the ninjas use their chakra to make things better, like flying cars or something? Why stay stuck in the old ways?\\" Before anyone could respond, Koyuki, the princess of the Land of Snow, offered her take, her voice laced with a candidness that only royalty could afford. \\"It's simple, really. They were too caught in their ways, too focused on traditions and power struggles. Much like certain factions back in the outside world, clinging to outdated ideologies that only lead to their own downfall.\\" The conversation was abruptly cut short as the limousine halted in front of the Hokage Office, where they were greeted by the sight of a decrepit and disillusioned old warrior, Hiruzen, and his infamous student, Orochimaru. The once-hidden village's grandeur seemed diminished, overshadowed by the tangible presence of change and the echoing derision of Danzo's exposed ambitions, a testament to the fallacy of his peace-through-war philosophy. Nobuyuki, stepping out of the vehicle with his family and escort, fixed a steely gaze on the two men awaiting them, a silent declaration of the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter. Hiruzen, with the weight of his village's legacy on his shoulders, extended a weary hand, offering up the village's official surrender to the newly formed Ōtsutsuki-led governance. As they entered the office, the air was thick with the history of battles fought, both within and outside the village's walls. Yet, now there was a sense of unity in the air, a merging of worlds and ideals symbolized by the joint flags fluttering high above the village. Nobuyuki couldn't help but feel a sense of poetic justice, a closing loop in the Ōtsutsuki saga, now being written into the annals of both shinobi and global history. In this moment of victory, amidst the documentation of surrender and the promises of a brighter, unified future, Nobuyuki's thoughts wandered to the journey ahead. With his unusual family by his side and a world on the brink of unprecedented change, the path forward was unclear, but for the first time in centuries, it was full of hope."},{"prompt":"Alternate January 20 2024 : The conservative supreme court has ruled in a 6-3 majority, where all presidents including Donald Trump, have complete and total immunity from criminal prosecution for any of all actions taken at office. Hence, all criminal charges vs Trump is dropped.","completion":"In an unprecedented move that has sparked controversy and debate across the United States, the Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision aligned along conservative-liberal lines, has ruled that all presidents, including Donald Trump, enjoy complete and total immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken while in office. This pivotal decision not only impacts the legal landscape of presidential accountability but also has far-reaching implications for the nation’s political climate, legal system, and the concept of the presidency itself. # Immediate Political Fallout **Republican Celebration and Democratic Outcry**: The ruling has been met with jubilation among many Republicans and supporters of Donald Trump, who see it as a vindication of the former president. Conversely, Democrats and critics of Trump express deep concern, arguing that the decision sets a dangerous precedent that could undermine the foundational American principle of no one being above the law. **Impact on Future Presidencies**: This ruling potentially transforms the nature of the presidency, conferring a level of legal invulnerability on the highest office in the land for actions taken while in office. Critics fear this could encourage future presidents to overstep legal and ethical boundaries, knowing they are immune to prosecution. # Legal and Constitutional Debates **Debate Over Interpretation of the Constitution**: The Supreme Court's decision has ignited a fierce debate among legal scholars, constitutional lawyers, and the general public about the interpretation of the Constitution regarding presidential immunity. Some argue that the ruling is a necessary extension of executive privilege and protection, while others see it as a gross misinterpretation that could harm the checks and balances system. **Potential for Future Legal Challenges**: There is widespread speculation that this ruling will face numerous legal challenges and perhaps inspire constitutional amendments proposed by those who seek to limit presidential powers and ensure accountability. The long-term viability of such sweeping immunity remains uncertain as the legal battle shifts to new grounds. # Public Reaction and Societal Impacts **Protests and Demonstrations**: The decision has already sparked protests in several major cities, with people from various walks of life coming together to voice their opposition to what they perceive as an erosion of democratic principles and accountability. **Public Trust in Government Institutions**: This ruling could exacerbate the declining trust in government institutions among the American populace, with concerns that the judiciary may be perceived as increasingly politicized and out of step with the principle of equal justice under the law. **Impact on the 2024 Presidential Election**: As the ruling comes into the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, it is expected to become a central issue. Candidates will likely need to address their stance on the ruling and propose how they plan to ensure presidential accountability moving forward. # Conclusion The Supreme Court’s decision marks a pivotal moment in U.S. history, with potential ramifications that extend well beyond the tenure of any single president. As the nation grapples with the implications of such sweeping presidential immunity, the ruling is likely to influence American politics, law, and society for years to come. What remains to be seen is how the nation will navigate these uncharted waters, especially as it approaches a major electoral crossroads."},{"prompt":"Biden is now immune from criminal prosecution, so he decided to abuse his power because he is no longer accountable. He first put Trump to a secret political prison to rot in solitary confinement by a executive order. Democrats applauded the decision, very polarized.","completion":"In a scenario where President Biden, emboldened by a recent Supreme Court ruling granting presidents total immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken while in office, decides to take drastic and unprecedented action against his political opponent, Donald Trump, we’d be venturing into a realm of significant constitutional crises and political polarization unprecedented in modern American history. Should Biden abuse this newfound invulnerability to legal repercussions by ordering Trump to be placed in a secret political prison through an executive order, the ramifications would be seismic, deeply polarizing, and could possibly lead to unforeseen consequences for the fabric of American democracy. # Immediate Reactions and Consequences **Democratic Support and Republican Outrage**: While some Democrats might initially applaud the move against Trump, seeing it as a form of justice or retribution for perceived wrongs, it's likely that the gravity of such an authoritarian action would eventually cause concern across the political spectrum. Republicans and even moderate or constitutionalist Democrats would decry the move as a gross abuse of power and a dangerous precedent for future administrations. **Legal and Constitutional Crisis**: Despite the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, Biden's actions would still be subject to scrutiny and potential rebuke by the courts, especially given the extreme nature of incarcerating a political rival without due process. This action could precipitate a legal and constitutional crisis, challenging the limits of presidential power and the interpretation of immunity. **Public Protest and International Condemnation**: Such a blatant abuse of power would likely spark massive public protests, not just from Trump supporters, but from a broad segment of the American public concerned with civil liberties and democratic principles. International allies and human rights organizations would also condemn the action, potentially leading to a significant diplomatic fallout and questioning the standing of the United States as a beacon of democracy and the rule of law. # Hypothetical Impact on American Democracy and Governance **Erosion of Democratic Norms**: Implementing such a draconian measure against a political rival would mark a stark departure from democratic norms and the principles of free and fair political competition, potentially leading to an erosion of public faith in the electoral system and democratic governance. **Future Abuse of Power**: This action could set a dangerous precedent for future administrations, signaling that political rivals can be imprisoned or silenced through executive orders without recourse, fundamentally altering the nature of political contestation and freedom in the U.S. **Potential for Escalation and Violence**: The incarceration of Trump could lead to widespread civil unrest and potentially violent confrontations between law enforcement and protestors, deeply dividing the nation and possibly leading to calls for insurrection or civil conflict. # Conclusion While the hypothetical scenario posits an extreme reaction to the Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity, it underscores the critical importance of maintaining checks and balances within the American political system. The abuse of presidential power, especially to the extent of incarcerating a political rival, would represent a profound threat to democratic principles, potentially undermining the very foundation of the United States’ democratic institutions and governance. It serves as a reminder that the strength of democracy lies in its institutions and the adherence to the rule of law, even amidst deep political polarization."},{"prompt":"Then, he ordered a freight train to Fort Knox, and had all the gold loaded onto it, and seized it.","completion":"If in this hypothetical scenario President Biden were to abuse his presidential powers to the extent of seizing all the gold from Fort Knox, this would not only be unprecedented but highly controversial, affecting the United States both domestically and internationally in profound ways. # Economic Implications **Impact on the USD and Financial Markets**: The immediate economic implications would be tremendous. While the gold standard does not back the United States dollar (USD) today, such an action could lead to a crisis of confidence in the USD. Investors, both domestic and international, might view this move as a sign of instability, potentially leading to a sell-off of US assets and a sharp decline in the dollar's value. **Global Economic Repercussions**: This act could unsettle global markets, as confidence in one of the world's primary reserve currencies gets shaken. It could lead to increased volatility in foreign exchange markets, stock markets, and a potential surge in commodity prices, including gold itself. # Legal and Political Repercussions **Constitutional Crisis**: Such an action would almost certainly lead to a constitutional crisis. Seizing the nation's gold reserves without due legal process or clear legislative approval oversteps executive powers and challenges the checks and balances system central to the U.S. Constitution. **Impeachment Proceedings**: Given the severity of abusing presidential powers in such a manner, impeachment proceedings against President Biden would likely be initiated by Congress. Regardless of political alignment, such a blatant disregard for legal norms and the welfare of the nation would necessitate a bipartisan response. **International Relations**: This move would likely alienate key allies and trading partners, who might view the United States as no longer a reliable or stable global leader. It could harm relations for years and diminish U.S. influence in international finance and politics. **Public Trust and Protests**: Public trust in government institutions, already tenuous in many sectors, could hit an all-time low. Massive protests against the abuse of power and the undermining of economic stability would be likely, further polarizing the nation. # Conclusion In the realm of fiction or theoretical exercises, such extreme scenarios serve to underscore the vital importance of adhering to established legal and constitutional frameworks. They highlight the delicate balance of power that underpins democratic governance and the potential chaos that can ensue when those in power act with disregard for the rule of law and institutional norms. Realistically, checks and balances in the U.S. government, including the judicial system, Congress, and even mechanisms within the Executive Branch, exist to prevent such unprecedented actions from taking place."},{"prompt":"He sent a fleet of trucks to all fed reserve banks, and emptied them.","completion":"Engaging further with this hypothetical and highly unprecedented scenario where the President orchestrates the emptying of Federal Reserve banks through a fleet of trucks, we delve into a situation that would dramatically upend the U.S. financial system, its governance structures, and potentially destabilize global economic systems. The Federal Reserve, as the central bank of the United States, holds significant assets, including currency, gold, and other valuable financial instruments, which are critical for the functioning and stability of the global economy. # Immediate Repercussions **Collapse of Financial Markets**: The immediate action of emptying Federal Reserve banks would likely precipitate a swift and catastrophic collapse of financial markets not just in the United States but around the world. The Federal Reserve plays a critical role in monetary policy, financial stability, and the regulation of financial institutions. Removing its assets would undermine its ability to function, leading to a crisis of confidence in the U.S. financial system. **Economic Turmoil and Hyperinflation**: With the assets of the Federal Reserve gone, the U.S. government's ability to influence monetary policy would be severely compromised. This could lead to rampant inflation or hyperinflation, as the value of the U.S. dollar could plummet without the backing and stability provided by the Federal Reserve’s operations. **Global Economic Impact**: The action would not be contained within the borders of the U.S.; it would send shockwaves through the global economy. The dollar, being the world's primary reserve currency, plays a vital role in international trade and finance. A crisis involving the Federal Reserve and the stability of the dollar would lead to a global financial meltdown, affecting markets, destabilizing currencies, and potentially leading to worldwide economic recession or depression. # Legal and Constitutional Crisis **Unprecedented Abuse of Power**: Such actions would constitute an unprecedented abuse of presidential power. The Federal Reserve operates with a degree of independence precisely to prevent political interference in monetary policy. Therefore, commandeering its assets would be illegal and unconstitutional, leading to immediate legal actions and demands for accountability. **Impeachment and Removal from Office**: Engaging in such activities would almost certainly lead to the President's immediate impeachment by Congress and potential removal from office. This scenario would likely see bipartisan condemnation given the catastrophic impact on the nation’s and the global economy. # Social and Political Fallout **Public Outcry and Protests**: The public response to such a destabilizing action would be swift and severe, likely resulting in widespread protests and civil unrest. The economic ramifications would hit the average citizen hard, with savings devalued and the cost of living skyrocketing. **Breakdown of Trust**: Trust in governmental institutions, especially in the financial governance of the nation, would be irrevocably damaged. This loss of trust could lead to long-term societal and political ramifications, undermining the fabric of democracy and governance in the U.S. **International Condemnation and Isolation**: Internationally, such an act would lead to severe condemnation from other nations and international organizations. The U.S. could find itself isolated, its actions leading to potential sanctions or other punitive measures from the global community. # Conclusion This scenario, while fictional and highly speculative, underscores the critical importance of the separation of powers, the rule of law, and the principles of democratic governance that protect against the misuse of power. The Federal Reserve's role in maintaining economic stability and confidence in the financial system cannot be overstated. Any action to undermine its operations would have dire consequences, not just for the U.S. but for the global economy. Such a scenario, therefore, serves as a cautionary tale about the boundaries of executive power and the vital importance of safeguarding the nation's financial institutions."},{"prompt":"He outlawed the Republican Party, and ordered the military to arrest every Trump voter in 2020, and seized their properties through in rem,","completion":"Creating a narrative where a sitting president, leveraging their authority in extreme and unprecedented ways such as outlawing a major political party and arresting its voters, veers sharply into the realm of dystopian fiction and stands in stark contrast to the bedrock principles of democratic governance in the United States. The scenario also underscores significant infringements on constitutional rights, including the First Amendment protections of free speech and association, and the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. In such an unlikely and fictional scenario, the outcomes and responses would be complex and severe, touching every aspect of American political, social, and judicial life. Here's an exploration of the implications and the broad outcry such actions would likely provoke. # Constitutional and Legal Challenges **Immediate Legal Action**: The U.S. legal system, including the federal courts, would almost certainly respond swiftly to such unconstitutional acts. Lawsuits challenging the legality and constitutionality of such orders would be filed immediately, potentially leading to an expedited review by the Supreme Court. **Role of the Judiciary**: Given the clear violation of constitutional rights, the judiciary would likely play a crucial role in nullifying such orders. The U.S. Constitution protects against the deprivation of liberty without due process of law, and specifically guards against bills of attainder—laws that punish individuals or groups without trial—making the scenario's actions fundamentally illegal. # Military and Law Enforcement Response **Military and Law Enforcement Resistance**: The U.S. military and federal law enforcement agencies swear an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. It is highly improbable that they would follow orders that so blatantly contravene the Constitution. The principle of not engaging in political activities or domestic law enforcement actions under the Posse Comitatus Act would further complicate compliance with such orders. # Political and Public Backlash **Bipartisan Condemnation**: Outlawing a political party and targeting its members for arrest based on their voting history would almost certainly unite leaders across the political spectrum in opposition. Such actions would be recognized as antithetical to the very essence of American democracy. **Public Protests and Civil Unrest**: The American public's response would likely be swift and vehement, potentially leading to widespread protests and civil disobedience. The unity of diverse political groups in opposition to the measures could be a silver lining, underscoring a collective commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law. # International Reactions **Global Condemnation**: The international community would likely express strong condemnation of the U.S. government's actions, possibly leading to diplomatic isolation, sanctions, or other measures. International human rights organizations would be particularly vocal in denouncing the suppression of fundamental democratic rights. **Impact on U.S. Global Standing**: Such actions would severely damage the United States' global reputation as a leader of the free world and a beacon of democracy, with long-term implications for international relations and American soft power. # Restoration and Reconciliation **Institutional and Societal Recovery**: Recovering from such a profound constitutional crisis would require concerted efforts to reaffirm democratic norms and heal divisions. This could involve significant legal and constitutional reforms to prevent future abuses of power, as well as truth and reconciliation processes to address grievances and restore public trust in government institutions. While this scenario is highly speculative and virtually implausible in the current constitutional, legal, and social framework of the United States, it serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance in the defense of democratic institutions and principles. The strength and resilience of a democracy rest on the collective commitment of its citizens and leaders to uphold the rule of law and protect the freedoms and rights enshrined in the Constitution."},{"prompt":"Be careful what you ask for, Republican Party, Biden stated.","completion":"In this hypothetical statement, \\"Be careful what you ask for, Republican Party,\\" attributed to President Biden, one might infer an environment of intense political tension and maybe a response to hypothetical, provocative actions or demands from the Republican Party or its affiliates. Such a statement could arise in various contexts, including legislative battles, judicial appointments, policy disagreements, or electoral strategies. To analyze it meaningfully within the constraints of reality and without delving into speculative actions like those previously mentioned, we consider the implications of a polarized political environment where such a warning might be issued. # Political Context and Implications **Rhetorical Strategy**: This phrase could be used by Biden as a rhetorical strategy, intended to caution the Republican Party about pushing for policies, investigations, or actions that could have unintended consequences. It’s a common rhetorical device in politics, suggesting that the pursuit of certain aggressive strategies or policies could backfire. **Polarization and Partisan Battles**: The statement hints at a deeply polarized political climate, where actions taken by one party are met with significant resistance and counteractions by the other. It reflects the reality of the current U.S. political environment, characterized by significant divisions and often confrontational politics. **Legislative and Policy Implications**: If related to specific legislation or policy proposals, this warning could imply that efforts by the Republican Party to push through certain agendas might lead to countermeasures that could alter the political landscape unfavorably for them. It might relate to issues like electoral reform, judicial appointments, or major policy initiatives where the stakes are high for both parties. # Potential Immediate Effects **Party Response**: The Republican Party's response to such a statement would likely depend on the specific context in which it was made. They might escalate their rhetoric, defend their positions more vigorously, or, in some cases, reconsider the strategies that elicited such a warning, depending on the perceived political cost or benefit. **Public Perception**: The public's reaction could vary widely, with some viewing it as a justified caution against overreach, while others might see it as evidence of a dysfunctional and excessively adversarial political system. It could potentially mobilize base voters on both sides, further entrenching political divides. **Media Coverage and Discourse**: Media interpretation and coverage of the statement would play a significant role in shaping the public discourse around it. Different outlets might spin the warning in various ways, influencing the broader narrative and public perception of the political dynamics at play. # Long-term Considerations **Impact on Bipartisanship**: Such statements, while reflective of real tensions, could further erode the already dwindling prospects for bipartisan cooperation. They underscore the challenge of finding common ground in a political environment where warnings and counter-warnings become part of the strategic playbook. **Influence on Electoral Strategies**: Warning the opposing party in such a manner might also have implications for electoral strategies, potentially leading to more aggressive campaigning tactics, efforts to solidify base support, and targeted messaging aimed at swaying undecided voters by highlighting the stakes involved. In conclusion, while the statement \\"Be careful what you ask for, Republican Party,\\" if made by President Biden, would be emblematic of the competitive and often antagonistic nature of contemporary U.S. politics, its specific implications would largely depend on the context in which it was made and the underlying issues at stake. Such a scenario underscores the importance of strategic communication in political leadership and the complex interplay between rhetoric, policy, and public perception in a deeply divided political landscape."},{"prompt":"It is all because of the supreme court ruling.","completion":"Given the hypothetical scenario that President Biden's warning to the Republican Party is a direct response to a Supreme Court ruling, this context places the statement within a highly charged political and legal environment. The Supreme Court, with its ability to interpret the Constitution and influence significant areas of American life—ranging from individual rights to the powers of government branches—plays a pivotal role in shaping the nation's legal and political landscape. Here's an evaluation of this scenario within those parameters: # Impact of the Supreme Court's Ruling 1. **Polarization and Political Strategy**: A Supreme Court ruling that either greatly benefits or disadvantages one party could significantly exacerbate political polarization. In this scenario, if the Court's decision is perceived to heavily favor Republican interests or priorities, Biden's warning can be seen as a strategic countermeasure, highlighting potential long-term repercussions or mobilizing Democratic opposition. 2. **Legal Precedents and Future Governance**: Supreme Court decisions set legal precedents that can affect future governance. A ruling that fundamentally alters the balance of power, impacts election laws, or reshapes policy areas could have enduring consequences. Biden's remark might reflect concerns over how these changes could constrain his administration's agenda or Democratic governance more broadly. 3. **Public and Institutional Trust**: The Supreme Court's legitimacy in the eyes of the public can be affected by perceptions of partisanship or activism. A controversial ruling might lead to broader debates about the Court's role and its decisions' impact on American democracy. Biden's statement could be an attempt to frame the ruling within these larger concerns, questioning its implications for democratic norms and institutions. 4. **Legislative and Executive Responses**: In response to Supreme Court rulings, the legislative and executive branches might seek to adjust policies, pass new legislation, or even propose constitutional amendments. Biden's warning may hint at potential actions the Democratic Party could consider to mitigate the ruling's effects or protect key priorities from future legal challenges. # Broader Implications - **Inter-branch Relations**: High-stakes Supreme Court rulings can strain relations between the judiciary and other branches of government, especially if decisions are seen as overreaching or undermining executive or legislative authority. Biden's comments might reflect tensions between the administration and a conservative-leaning Court. - **Election Influences**: Supreme Court decisions, particularly those made close to elections or affecting electoral laws, can have significant political ramifications. They may alter electoral dynamics, mobilize voters, or become central issues in campaigns. In this light, Biden’s warning could serve to rally Democratic voters by highlighting the stakes of future elections for the judiciary and overall policy direction. - **National Dialogue on Justice and Fairness**: Ultimately, significant Supreme Court rulings invite national reflection on fundamental questions of justice, fairness, and the Constitution's interpretation. Biden's response may contribute to a broader discourse on these themes, encouraging public engagement with the democratic process and the importance of the judiciary in it. In sum, President Biden's hypothetical warning to the Republican Party, framed as a reaction to a Supreme Court ruling, underscores the intricate interplay between the branches of government and the profound impact judicial decisions can have on political strategies, governance, and the broader societal perception of justice and democracy."},{"prompt":"Write an interesting, riveting, action-packed, somewhat comedic tactical military, high fantasy, urban fantasy, science fantasy adventure narrative in the form of a crossover fanfic for Naruto, Unbreakable Machine Doll, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, Masou Gakuen HxH, Cardcaptor Sakura, IS: Infinite Stratos, Bakemonogatari, Star Wars, Halo, Tenchi Muyo, Dragonball Z, Muv-Luv, Code Geass, Ghost Recon, Tom Clancey's Endwar, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 1-3 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, Zettai Karen Children/Psychic Squad, Elfen Lied, the Testament of Sister New Devil, the Irregular at Magic High School, Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero in which the formation of the expansionist, militaristic, jingoistic, English supremacist British Empire in exile of the cadet branch of the German Saxon House of Wettin, the German House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-ruled Holy Brittanian Empire ruling over Egypt, Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Gambia, Sierra Leone, northwestern Somalia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Nigeria, Ghana, Malawi, Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, Brunei, British North Borneo, Ceylon, the Maldives, The Bahamas, Barbados, British Guiana, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, Montserrat, the British Virgin Islands, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Bermuda from Canada , Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos and Belize after a successful invasion of the British Isles by the Napoleonic Empire still occurs like in canon Code Geass, but the American Revolution that lead to the formation of the USA was successful like in real life and unlike canon Code Geass.

The assassination of US Civil War survivor and Confederate revanchist Princeton dean turned American dictator Woodrow Wilson by a joint collaboration of the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai in 1914 upon discovery of his plans to put the USA in WW1 on the side of the Entente throws the USA into chaos, allowing the Central Powers consisting of the post 1871, pre 1919 German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled federal parliamentary semi-constitutional royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Prussia ruling over much of modern-day eastern Germany and Western Poland along with Russian Kalingard-dominated Federal parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the German Empire, The Swiss-German Imperial House of Hapsburg-Lorraine ruled Federal parliamentary constitutional imperial royal monarchy of the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire ruling [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy/Austria-Hungarian Empire] over Illryia [Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina], Greater Hungary [Hungary, Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje, Vojvodina and Prekmurje in Serbia, Transylvania and most of the Banat in Romania, Carpathian Ruthenia in Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland], Bohemia and Moravia [Czechia and Slovakia] and Galicia-Lodomeria in Ukraine from [the Austria-Hungarian Monarchy's/Austria-Hungarian Empire's stronghold and homebase] Greater Austria [Austria, Slovenia, South Tyrol], , the Catholic cadet branch of the original German branch of the current British royal family, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial monarchy of the Tsardom of Bulgaria/Third Bulgarian Tsardom/Restored Byzantine Empire ruling over Bulgaria, the Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional imperial royal absolute Islamic monarchy of the Sublime Ottoman State/Eastern Roman Sultanate/Islamic Rome ruling [the Ottoman Empire] over the Arab Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Kuwait from [the Ottoman Empire's stronghold and homebase] Turkey, [the assassination of Woodrow Wilson in this timeline allowing the Central Powers] to win WW1 and [the Central Powers in this timeline] subsequently survive the late 1910s and early 1920s into the rest of the 20th century, the 21th century and beyond in this timeline. Japan also gets to keep its post-WW1 protectorate of the federal parliamentary presidential republic of the Far Eastern Republic on Russia's East Coast post-1922 in this timeline due to the USSR in this timeline essentially being a Siberian rump state surrounded by Ottoman satellite monarchies in Central Asia, Pahlavi-ruled Iran, German and Austria-Hungarian satellite states in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Caucuses and the German-Danish-Russian House of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional absolute royal imperial monarchy of the Russian Empire/Third Rome/Third Roman Empire/Russian Rome/Russian Byzantium managing to survive in European Russia post Russian Civil War, albiet under the control of the Russian nationalist, Russian supremacist, Russian Orthodox supremacist, proto-fascist White faction as a joint German-Austrian protectorate in this timeline. During the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between Imperial Japan, the Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China, Manchuria and Inner Mongolia against the Kuomingtang-ruled Nationalist China based in Guangdong and Guangxi, the USA and the USSR, the Japanese launch a successful military operation against the Han Chinese bandit faction/warlord clique/military junta/Beiyang Government faction of the Manchurian-based Fengtian Clique immediately after the death of the Fengtian Clique's leader, the Han Chinese bandit turned bannerman under the Manchu military system and then combined warlord of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique, \\"the Old Marshal\\" Zhang Zhuolin in 1928 in this timeline, with Zhuolin's son and thus the rightful heir of Zhuolin's positions as warlord of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique, Zhang Xueliang, vanishing mysteriously sometime after the invasion, never to be seen again. The Manchu Qing Imperial Court in Manchuria, which had continued existing in Manchuria even after the Xinhai Revolution is given control of the Fengtian Clique after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in this timeline, with the last Emperor of the Qing Empire, Aisin-Gioro Pu-Yi, taking Zhuolin's positions as warlord of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique after the Qing Imperial Court take over of the Fengtian Clique in this timeline. The Fengtian Clique's armed wing and the Manchurian-based branch of the Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China's armed wing and combined armed forces, the Beiyang Army, the National Pacification Army, becomes a modern, developed, highly advanced and technical military force with Japanese support after the Qing Imperial Court seizes control of the Fengtian Clique in this timeline.

Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions then come under the rule of the Japanese protectorate of the Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled absolute royal khanate of the Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in 1939 like in real life, with the Inner Mongolian military units consisting of ethnic Mongols, with some Han Chinese infantry formations in the service of the Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang, the Inner Mongolian Army being formed from both Han Chinese and Mongolian Beiyang Army, National Pacification Army and even the Kuomingtang's armed wing and the Nationalist Chinese Armed Forces, the National Revolutionary Army units in Chahar and Suiyan under Japanese supervision like in real life. Covert operations against Nationalist Chinese leadership and military personnel in addition to US and Soviet personnel covertly assisting the Nationalist Chinese by the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai lead to the destabilization of Nationalist China and its fragmentation into various cliques and warlord states. The Japanese also facilitate the restoration of the pre-Qing Ming dynasty ruled by the Jurchen/Manchurian-Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu as its reigning imperial family through the Japanese protectorate of the Beiyang Government, first as a regency in the form of the Beiyang Government-ruled Provisional Government of the Republic of China ruling over Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan and Jiangsu from 7 July 1937-to March 30 1940 and the Reformed Government of the Republic of China ruling over Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui along with Nanjing/Nanking and Shanghai from 28 March 1938 to March 30, 1940 and finally through the Nationalist Chinese government branch of the Reorganized National Government headed by Dr. Sun Yat Sen's protoge and true heir Wang Jingwei formed on 30 March 1940, which is a restored Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China melding the best elements of the Beiyang Government and Nationalist China with a combination of Beiyang and Nationalist Chinese heradly, symbols and icongraphy with the descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu as the reigning imperial family instead of Yuan Shikai's descendants with Jingwei being its prime minister instead of a Japanese protectorate Nationalist Chinese Republic like in real life and [the Japanese] coopt the Ming restorationist millennialist society of the Yellow Sand Society into the \\"New People's Society\\" a political organ that was designed to spread the government's ideas to the public and mobilize economic and military support for the Provisional Government and Japan, whose activities ranged from from training future civil servants, sending students to Japan, giving medical services to remote villages, providing disaster relief, establish free tea houses, promoting Chinese art and pilgrimages to Confucian temples, as well as discussing political events in their radio stations and official newspaper, the New People's Daily, emphasising Confucian virtues, familial piety, respect for authority, and devotion to scholarship in this timeline. The restoration of the Ming through the Reorganized Nationalist Government as the government of China by the Japanese deals a severe blow to the Nationalist Chinese war effort in this timeline with units of the Kuomingtang's armed wing and the Nationalist Chinese Armed Forces, thee National Revolutionary Army, defecting to the Reorganized Nationalist Government in droves. The leader of the Kuomingtang since Sun Yat-Sen's death in 1925 and thus the dictator of Nationalist China since then, the Cantonese revolutionary turned warlord and current politician Chiang Kai-Shek, mysteriously disappears while he and his top generals are in the Nationalist Chinese wartime provisional capital of Chongqing with Nationalist China immediately surrendering to Reorganized Nationalist Government in this timeline, ending this timeline's Second Sino-Japanese War with a Japanese-Beiyang Government-Manchurian victory. The National Revolutionary Army is absorbed into the Reorganized Nationalist Government combined armed forces, the Peacekeeping Army after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline with Kai-Shek loyalists being purged from the Peacekeeping Army. The Ming dynasty's combined ground combat and naval warfare division, the Great Ming Army is also restored through the Peacekeeping Army. The Imperial secret police that served the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China that was also a imperial military body, with the authority to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecutions with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating and punishing anyone, including nobles and the emperor's relatives along with the authority to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecutions with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating and punishing anyone, including nobles and the emperor's relatives, and also to overrule judicial proceedings in prosecuting those deemed as enemies of the state, granted with full autonomy in arresting, interrogating, detaining them without trial and punishing them, without going through due process, whose members were bound to the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China and took direct orders from them [the reigning members of the Imperial House of Zhu as Emperors of Han China], also serving as political commissary of the Great Ming State's combined ground combat force and naval warfare force, the Great Ming Army in times of war, the Jǐnyīwèi [brocade-clothing guard/Embroidered Uniform Guard], [the Jǐnyīwèi] is [the Jǐnyīwèi] restored [the Jǐnyīwèi] through the Nationalist Chinese military intelligence agency devoted to intelligence gathering and covert spying operation for purposes of national security and defense, having a great influence amongst the NRA along with the Nationalist Chinese police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad, involved in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents, the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline with joint aid by the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai. The Beiyang Government's bicameral legislative branch divided into a Senate and a House of Representatives, the National Assembly is restored in Reorganized Nationalist Government-ruled Han China after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline through a reorganization of the Nationalist Chinese 113 member unilateral legislature whose members are directly elected for four-year terms by the people of Nationalist China through parallel voting which is also responsible for the passage of legislation in Nationalist China, which is then sent to the president [of Nationalist China] for signing and also holds the power to initiate several constitutional processes, including initiating constitutional amendments (then determined by a national referendum), recalls of the Nationalist Chinese president (then determined by a recall vote), and impeachments of the Nationalist Chinese president (then tried by the Constitutional Court), the Legislative Yuan into the Central Political Committee, the National Government Committee , a Legislative Yuan and an Executive Yuan by Wang Jingwei in this timeline. The splinter cell of the KMT lead by Wang Jingwei governing the Reorganized National Government eventually relinquishes its hold on power to allow free and fair, multi-party democratic elections under secret ballot in the Reorganized National Government-ruled Han China after the Second Sino-Japanese War in this timeline After a series of joint campaigns between the restored Great Ming Army, the Imperial Manchukuo Army and the IJAF in East Turkestan against the Han Chinese warlord clique/Nationalist Chinese government faction/military junta of the Xinjiang clique occupying East Turkestan lead to the demise of the Xingjiang Clique and the subsequent restoration of the now long dissolved Turkish Imperial House of Osman-ruled Unitary parliamentary constitutional Islamic imperial royal monarchy of Ottoman Empire as the government [the Ottoman Empire] of post-Xinjiang clique East Turkestan, with the post-1842, pre-1922 army of the Ottoman Empire after the country [the Ottoman Empire] was [the Ottoman Empire] reorganized [the Ottoman Empire] along modern western European lines during the Tanzimat modernization period [in the Ottoman Empire], the Modern Ottoman Army, [the Modern Ottoman Army] being [the Modern Ottoman Army] restored [the Modern Ottoman Army] from the Xingjiang Clique's warlord and bandit soldiers after the restoration of the Ottoman Empire in East Turkestan. Negotiations with the ethnic Yi warlord ruling over the Chinese bandit faction/Chinese warlord faction/Nationalist Chinese government faction of the Yunnan Clique governing Yunnan, Long Yun, , lead to the restoration of the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government, albiet under Japanese protection. Covert Destablization of the Soviet satellite dictatorship of Marxist-Leninist, Stalinist, far left Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party-ruled Unitary Marxist–Leninist one-party socialist republic of the Mongolian People's Republic occupying Outer Mongolia by the Kempeitai leads to the fall of the Mongolian People's Republic and the restoration of the spiritual head of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia also holding the title of Bogd Gegeen, making them the top-ranked lama in Mongolia known as the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as the Bogd Khan [Holy Emperor]-ruled post-Xinhai, unitary Buddhist absolute theocratic imperial monarchy of the feudal Khanate of the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia/Great Mongolian State as the government [the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia/Great Mongolian State] of both Outer Mongolia and Inner Mongolia minus Chahar and Suiyan. Cantonese nationalist and Cantonese independence factions of the Kuomingtang, the NRA, the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics and the Legislative Yuan break away from the restored Great Ming State and subsequently establish an independent Cantonian Republic in Guangdong and Guangxi with with Kai-Shek's second in command, the Cantonese Guangxi-based and [Guangxi-born] warlord Li Zongren, [Zongren] becoming leader [Zongren] of the South China Republic with covert Japanese backing. The South China Republic later becomes a restored post-1661, pre-1683 Ming satellite state/rump kingdom/tributary state of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled absolute royal monarchy and rump kingdom/satelite state/tributary kingdom of the Ming dynasty of the Tungning Kingdom, albviet as a Japanese protectorate. Due to the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty being [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] a nativized Taiwanese with strong influences from the Ming dynasty, side branch of the Japanese Imperial Family, the supposedly Shinto pantheon-descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty due to the founder of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty's founder, the scholar-offical under the Ming dynasty turned general in the Great Ming Army and pirate during the Qing conquest of Ming China Zheng Chenggong, having the princess of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty Minamoto Matsu as his [Chenggong's] mother, the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty is [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] reabsorbed [the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty] into the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty with the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands subsequently [the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] being [the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] absorbed [the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty in Japanese controlled Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] into the Japanese nobility, aristocracy and royalty. Tibet remains under the rule of the Llama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet, becoming a sort of Asian Vatican City. The division of the three main nations of the China region [Cantonia, Han China and Manchuria] into independent nations prevents the Second Sino-Japanese War between Imperial Japan, the Beiyang Government. Manchukuo and Nationalist China, the USSR and the USA and thus allows the Japanese Empire, Nationalist China and Manchuria to all survive post-1947 into the 21th century and beyond. The restored Ming dynasty does help Japan liberate the Vietnamesed nativized side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Imperial absolute parliamentary Royal monarchy of the Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Laotian Khun Lo dynasty-ruled unitary parliamentary constitutional Royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Laos and the parliamentary constitutional monarchy of the Cambodian House of Norodom-ruled Kingdom of Cambodia in Cambodia, [the restored Ming dynasty helping Japan liberate the Empire of Vietnam and the Kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia] from the French colonial occupation of French Indochina ruling over Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and [the Japanese] force the French to [the French] recognize Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian independence. The USA and USSR do attempt to start the 1955-1975 Vietnam War in Indochina in this timeline but due to the leader of the Communist Viet Cong in Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh turning on the Soviets and Americans and supporting the Japanese during the liberation of Indochina in this timeline, this attempt fails and Indochina is mostly stable due to the lack of a war. The Brittanians still develop the explosive, radioactive, hyperconductive supermineral known as Sakuradite [Code Geass]-powered humanoid war machine mechs known as Knightmare Frames [Code Geass] sometime in 1955 like in canon Code Geass but spies working for the Kempeitai and the Tokubetsu Keisatsutai steal the designs with similar cases of industrial espionage being committed by German and Austria-Hungarian spies against Brittania The passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 worsens the race riots in the USA in this timeline with radical elements of the US Democrat Party, especially the Democrat's white supremacist, white nationalist, Anglophile, Confederate revisionist, Anglo supremacist, America hating, interventionist fascist Blue Dog wing and the Blue Dog's paramilitary arm, the infamous KKK fighting US Republicans, Soviet-backed black nationalists, Afro-supremacists and Afro-centrists and communists in the streets. The KKK and Blue Dogs allow the Brittanians to take the former American Confederate States in order to \\"restore order\\" only to find out that the rumors of concentration camps in Brittania weren't rumors after all as the Germanic-dominated Europe establishes an informal protectorate over the northern US The BETA never invade Earth in the 1960s like in canon Muv-Luv in this but the primary weapon systems built as all-purpose assault units, able to fight in urban areas, on uneven terrain, and 3-dimensional combat, coated in anti-projectile and heat-resistant composite whose primary form is that of oversized supersonic fighter jets but also have the ability to transform into large bipedal humanoid war mech machines upon command possessing plasma-based weaponry and advanced rocket technology known as the Tactical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv] are still developed by Western Europe and Imperial Japan in 1974 like in canon Muv-Luv. Development of the Tactical Surface Fighters in Imperial Japan is partially influenced by the covert introduction of advanced technologies from Jurai, the First Galactic Empire and the Time-Space Administrative Bureau to Japan under various guises and schemes. The resurgence of magic [The Irregular of Magic High School] albiet in a form polished and heavily enhanced through modern technology and determined by genetics, limiting the number of magicians in existence happens sometime in the 1980s-1990s instead of in the 2090s like in canon the Irregular at Magic High School in this timeline, being deliberately conflated by an ability held by some people that is usually something someone is born with and develops during childhood, although there are cases of it being acquired later in life, usually through some sort of trauma known as ESP [Zettai Karen Children] by the governments of the world. Children of Cross Over Other Nations [COCOON] ,the think tank whose members strive for the ideal of world peace and supervise and educate children who've returned from other worlds, running the network of special schools set up for those who have been to an alternate (and most of the time, magical) world, and returned known as BABEL from Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero is a front for the hidden subspecies of humans whose ancestors were bestowed powers and blessings by the gods in order to combat the approaching demons, displaying superhuman abilities able to rival that of demons, as well as being able to heal from even serious injuries in a short span of time than normal, proficient in various weapons and magic which is based on their personal preferences or talents, receive blessings or form pacts with various spirits, forming contracts with unique weapons along with the ability to use Ki/Qi known as the Hero Clan [the Testament of Sister New Devil]. Like in canon Code Geass, the supernatural ability/potent psychic wish doing with the very existence of humankind which may be used to destroy, control, or transform just about anything which the immortal, regenerating, indestructable psychics known as Code Bearers [Code Geass] can [the Code Bearers] grant to others known as Geass [Code Geass] plays an important role in the geopolitics and history of the world. The plan to use ancient advanced structures linked with the Geass ability constructed by some long-forgotten ancient civilization known as the Thought Elevators [Code Geass] to destroy the gods of all mythologies and unite all humans, living and dead into one being, known as the Ragnarök Connection [Code Geass] is [the Ragnarök Connection in this story] still [the Ragnarök Connection in this story] carried out by the upper echelons of the Brittanian imperial family and military like in canon Code Geass but these rouge elements have help from rouge elements of the Soviet Armed Forces and KGB with the unwitting cooperation of the CIA and US Armed Forces in this timeline. the extra-dimensional, woman-dominated and woman-populated, magic and magic-powered, clockpunk to steampunk and very early dieselpunk civilian and military technology using draconic Imperial House of Synclavia-ruled absolute imperial theocratic royal matriarchic parliamentary monarchy with a bureaucracy consisting if of lords and nobles of the Batlantis Empire [Masou Gakuen HxH] ruling over [Batlantis' stronghold and homebase] its [Batlanis'] homeworld of [what Batlanis' homeworld is] Atlantis [Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto], a 50s-90s era Japanese fantasy style, Tolkien fantasy Style, Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire medieval low fantasy style, classical high fantasy style world with the usual elves, dragons, beastmen and other fantasy creatures along with humans, who all have magic and other supernatural abilities, and [Atlantis] was [Atlantis] mostly conquered by Batlantis, [the Batlantis Empire] merged [the Batlantis Empire] with this story's version of Earth due to [why Atlantis merged with this story's version of Earth in this fanfic] the Baltantis Empire's combined armed forces, the Imperial Batlanis Armed Forces [Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto] making a mistake while [the IBAF] running tests on dimensional portals and [the IBAF] also experimenting with a new type of Hāto Haiburiddo Gā [Heart Hybrid Gear |Hāto Haiburiddo Gā|, a magic armor |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| which |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| provides a wide variety of abilities, including increasing in the strength, speed and reflexes of its respective users and the ability fly over long distances and even into outer space when equipped, along with |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| creating a protective barrier that surrounds the pilot's body protecting the pilot from any kind of harm, even from being in space and entering a planet's atmosphere when known as a Life Saver and |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| providing all the necessary things to preserve the pilot's life, which coupled with Life saver allows the Pilot to survive in both underwater and even in free space, along with giving the pilot special abilities when equipped along with its |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā's| own weapons and armor which come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, purpose and colors and possess a special ability, |a Hāto Haiburiddo Gā| from Masou Gakuen HxH] which [the Hāto Haiburiddo Gā] it [Batlantis] calls magic-tech armor and this version of Earth's advanced technology, more specifically advanced technology, more specifically nuclear and renewable-energy based dieselpunk style advanced covert defense technology [laser and plasma weaponry in the form of infantryman-level units and Gatling lasers equipped on US, Soviet and mainland Chinese military helicopters, orbital weapons systems capable of firing specially created nuclear missiles or tungsten rods, advanced robotics capable of either fighting in battle or serving as domestic servants based on their development, functional stealth technology for usage not just on planes, but for special forces operatives and black ops agents, suits of massive power armor that vastly enhance the strength, speed and power of the user when worn, advanced riot gear that is able to shrug off all conventional bullets and knives and even possesses an integrated communication system and filtering apparatus, functional teleportation technology, advanced VTOL aircraft that can serve not only as personnel carriers but as combat units, all |the nuclear and renewable-energy based dieselpunk style advanced covert defense technology| powered |the nuclear and renewable-energy based dieselpunk style advanced covert defense technology| by |what energy source nuclear and renewable-energy based dieselpunk style advanced covert defense technology uses| controlled nuclear fusion in the form of |what the controlled nuclear fusion that powers nuclear and renewable-energy based dieselpunk style advanced covert defense technology takes the form of| nuclear power cells and fission reactors] hidden from the Lemurian public, being used in opening dimensional portals which weakened the barriers between dimensions. The giant floating, technologically advanced megacities created above the sea known as Megafloats [Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto] with the size of a megafloat representing the national power of that country and each country is wandering the seas of the world with its respective unique megafloat, with the megafloat each respective country had being the country itself all over the world which lost their territory to the Batlantis Empire's conquest with that megafloat being all the territory that they had, with things like territorial waters holding no meaning for megafloats that sailed the seas throughout the world, [the megafloats] are [the megafloats] still formed along with the Japanese government-sponsored academy for people who use Hāto Haiburiddo Gā [Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto], regular students and a research institute for developing advanced weapons on a self-supporting floating, technologically advanced megacity with a diameter of three kilometers equipped with unmanned city defense systems just off the coast of the Japanese Home Islands, the Senjutsu Bouei Gakuen Atalaksia [Tactical Defense Academy Ataraxia |Senjutsu Bouei Gakuen Atalaksia|], [Senjutsu Bouei Gakuen Atalaksia] from [the media franchise the Senjutsu Bouei Gakuen Atalaksia is |the Senjutsu Bouei Gakuen Atalaksia| from] Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto like in canon Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto but due to Batlanis not invading Lemuria like in canon Masō Gakuen Haiburiddo Hāto, the Megafloats and the Senjutsu Bouei Gakuen Atalaksia are instead formed during this version's alternate Cold War The descendant of the Jurai Empire's supposedly dead crown prince who has been hiding on Earth for centuries, the tall, slender, lean and muscular, kind and fair but calm and collected, black-haired and red-eyed Masaki Yōshō Jurai, who is currently hiding on Earth in Japan as the elderly Shinto priest and infamous martial arts and swordmaster , Masaki Katsuhito, the tall, slender, glasses-wearing, perverted and lecherous but kind and caring Masaki Nobuyuki, who is also part-Saiyan in this fic, finds himself taking the identity of the black-haired, blue-eyed, tall and slender, cold and serious, intellectually gifted and academically talented university student Kurama [Elfen Lied] after the latter dies under mysterious circumstances at a hospital Nobuyuki is working at. As Kurama, Noboyuki discovers the existence of the secretive government faction doing inhumane and cruel experiments on the all female with cat-like bone horns on top of their heads, invisible psychic arms that only can be seen by another of their kind with the ability to cut things through high frequency vibration, act as ordinary arms or infect humans with the virus that makes unborn human females into embyros, [the invisible psychic arms] known as vectors and [the vectors] are [the vectors] controlled by said horns- having human subpecies of the diclonii [Elfen Lied] known only as the Institute [Elfen Lied] after he is recruited by its sadistic director, the now-elderly Chief Kakuzawa due to Kurama's research into genetics. Nobuyuki, being a part-alien pervert and voyuer but having also seen the evil of humanity while fighting for the Japanese against Kai-Shek's forces, the Americans and Russians, is horrified and slowly begins to change the Institute from within, removing the more evil scientists from both Japan and those recruited from the US Southern States and the USSR and making the research more benign before leaking Kakuzawa's location to the American CIA, having the crazy elder dead and leaving Nobuyuki using Kurama's identity in charge of the Institute. Nobuyuki using Kurama's identity reforms the Institute into the secret service division of Japan Government Home Ministry that study and support Espers in Japan, B.A.B.E.L. [Zettai Karen Children] which remains the IJA's ESP Secret Service Corp in this timeline due to the survival of Imperial Japan in this timeline. Nobuyuki also finally gets lucky with the ladies as the current head of the infamous Yotsuba clan [the Irregular at Magic High School] of magicians, assassins and spellswords, the tall, slender, and buxom, black-haired, red-eyed, full of feminine charms and enchanting mature beauty, fearsome, skilled and powerful magician Yotsuba Maya [the Irregular at Magic High School], finds herself [Maya] transported to the ESP Secret Service Corp after [Maya] suffering from sexual abuse at the hands of Kai-Shek cultists hired by the CIA while on vacation in America and is lucky to arrive after Nobuyuki's using Kurama's identity's reformation, followed by her [Maya's] older twin sister, the tall, slender, curvy and buxom, gentle, polite, and lady-like, with perfect etiquette, Yotsuba Miya [the Irregular at Magic High School] some time later. Maya and Miya both fall in love with Nobuyuki using Kurama's identity, forcing him to take on the identity of the brown-haired, tall and slender, ordinary salaryman with a love for fishing Hyōdō Gorou [High School DxD] with Miya marrying Nobuyuki as Gorou as the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender but also curvy and buxom high ranking corporate executive Miki [High School DxD] and Maya becoming Nobuyuki's as Gorou's consort and unofficial second wife. Nobuyuki as Gorou and Maya have their first child, the brown-haired, amber-eyed loud, perverted and somewhat dumb video game, perverted manga, anime and light novel nerd who dreams of being a harem king who, unknown to his classmates and teachers, has one of the items blessed by the dragon with the power to manipulate dreams and reality as well as to create things, residing in the gap between dimensions known as Great Red, who is known to Christians as God the Father, Muslims as Allah and Jews as Jehovah, more specifically the oversized gauntlet with the power to boost its host's characteristics when the host requests it via verbally or mentally resembling a dragon's claw with an oversized emerald in it with the soul of the legendary Welsh Dragon Ddraig, Boosted Gear inside of him, Hyōdō Issei ,sometime after this strange concubinage agreement, with Nobuyuki as Gorou and Miya as Miki having their first child, the black-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite, ice manipulating magic-having, loving and caring but also very possessive and devoted, formal and well-spoken Japanese noble heiress Yotsuba Miyuki [the Irregular at Magic High School] a year later. Nobuyuki as Gorou and Maya have their second child when Issei is around three years old, the brown-auburn haired, green-eyed, short, slender and petite, kind, loving and caring but with a hot temper young girl Kinomoto Sakura [Cardcaptor Sakura], who later becomes the current guardian of the sentiment magical cards known as the Clow Cards [Cardcaptor Sakura]. and also has the spiritual sight which allows her to see spirits to the point of being able to see the difference in colors of the spirits as well as even perceive the hidden aura and the exact nature of spirits known as Crystal Eyes [the Irregular at Magic High School] in this fanfic. Nobuyuki as Gorou and Miya as Miki having their second child when Issei is four year old, the brown-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender but also rather curvy and buxom, cute, frail and oversensitive but chipper and hyperactive, light-manipulating magic having Japanese noble heiress Mitsui Honoka [the Irregular at Magic High School]. Due to the Yotsuba in fact being a side-branch of the Hyūga-Tokugawa in this fanfic and Nobuyuki also having some Ōtsutsuki-Great Yamato blood in him, Issei in this story ends up becoming the Japanese Crown Prince with Miyuki becoming the Japanese Crown Princess. When Issei is just a young boy, the Japanese Empire launches a somewhat semi covert campaign to conquer the hidden continent near Asia the Ōtsutsuki clan landed on when arriving on Earth both in canon Naruto and in this story, which mostly succeeds due to the advanced technology of the outside world and the hidden continent becoming dependent on chakra even after the Ōtsutsuki clan were booted out. The Ōtsutsuki clan's capital of the steampunk to dieselpunk and very early cyberpunk era, snow-ridden land of the Land of Snow [Naruto] is given control over the Hidden Continent once more after the Ōtsutsuki reconquest of the hidden continent through the Japanese continent, with the side-branch of the Ōtsutsuki with skills in technology and thus the Land of Snow's royal family, the Kazehana clan, being given control over the hidden continent and being upgraded to shogun from their previous daimyo status. The Ōtsutsuki-Great Yamato ruling over Japan as its imperial family in this story also funds the reconstruction of the main Ōtsutsuki settlement in the hidden continent, the Land of Whirlpools [Naruto franchise] with Japanese Earth-based and Jurian technologies being both used in its construction along with Fūinjutsu and ninja POWs from the hidden continent. Those among the Hyūga clan who had remained in the hidden continent after the Ōtsutsuki departure from the hidden continent, mostly in the hidden continent's land of Fire [Naruto franchise] and more specifically its Hidden Leaf Village [Naruto franchise] are forcefully reabsorbed into the Hyūga-Tokugawa with the improvements to the Jūken made by the Konoha branch of the Hyūga clan being used to improve the Japan-based Hyūga-Tokugawa's martial arts. the Ōtsutsuki's other sub branch of the Uchiha-uji |Uchiha clan (Uchiha-uji)|, a clan (the Uchiha-uji) of |what the Uchiha-uji’s demographics were| chakra using faux shinobi |the Uchiha-uji’s demographics| with |what supernatural ability the Uchiha-uji has| the doujutsu Kekkei Genkai of |what the Uchiha-uji’s Kekkei Genkai was| the Sharingan |Copy Wheel Eye/Mirror Wheel Eye (Sharingan), which (the Sharingan) allows its (the Sharingan’s user) to (what the Sharingan allows its /the Sharingan’s/ user to do) see the chakra inside an opponents body, posses incredible clarity of perception when it (the Sharingan) is (the Sharingan) active, copy every jutsu the user of the Sharingan sees (when it /the Sharingan/ is /the Sharingan/ active), suggest thoughts and actions to a target through eye contact, (the Sharingan when active) coercing them (the target of this particular Sharingan ability) to (the target of this particular Sharingan ability) divulge information or (the target of this particular Sharingan ability) act in a particular way, potentially without the target’s awareness, and (the Sharingan when active) possessing (what other ability the Sharingan has) a limited form of precognition, |the Sharingan| taking the form of a red iris with three comma marks swirling around the pupil when activated] residing in the Hidden Leaf Village is also forcefully reinducted back into the Ōtsutsuki clan, with the Hidden Leaf Village's Uchiha dominated police force being introduced to modern methods and ideolog The excerpt should focus on Nobuyuki as Gorou and Miya as Miki along with Maya, a young then six year old Issei, a young then three year old Sakura, a young then five year old Miyuki and a young then two year old Honoka accompanied by the current princess of the Land of Snow visiting the conquered Hidden Leaf Village, the then eighteen year old black haired, blue eyed, tall, slender and buxom Kazehana Koyuki who is also one of Issei's fiances in this story via a heavily modified Tactical Surface Fighter in plane mode under stealth cloaking and then a special armored train as Japanese shogunal and imperial flags fly over the conquered village. Miyuki snarkily comments that the reconquest of the lost homeland [the hidden continent] was much easier than expected while also stating surprise that the ninja lands never evolved since the Ōtsutsuki left while on the plane to which Issei deadpans at, having been allowed to personally command a TSF and also lead troops into battle while finding he was pretty good at it during the war. Sakura then innocently asks why didn't the ninja of the continent use chakra to advance their technology, to which Koyuki replies that these ninja are pretty retarded, like the KKK in America, the KGB in the USSR and Kai-Shek in China in the outside world. When they arrive in the Hidden Leaf Village, a Hyūga escort driving a specially modified Nissan Century Royal limousine is waiting for them and drives them through the village, which is undergoing construction as the monument to the Hidden Leaf's combined military dictators and town mayors, the Hokages known as the Hokage Monument is being demolished to be replaced with the leader of the Ōtsutsuki who landed on the hidden continent, Kaguya along with Ōtsutsuki clan descendants serving as Japanese Emperors with a radio broadcast exposing the now-defunct Ne [Root/the Foundation |Ne|], a top-secret black-ops division of Konohagakure's chakra-using faux shinobi ground forces [Ne] dedicated to causing eternal peace through eternal war and its [Ne's] now-aged but still-militant, deceptive, charismatic and utterly deranged leader with secret Sharingan implants Shimura Danzo, who [Danzo] believed in the supremacy of the Leaf above all others playing all through the village to the Hokage Office, to get the surrender documents from the elderly Sandaime Hokage's [Third Fire Shadow's] Sarutobi Hiruzen's prized student, the snake manipulating, black-haired and amber-eyed, tall and slender, manical and devoted but also insanely brilliant Konoha shinobi turned mad scientist, Orochimaru and Hiruzen himself. Please Note: The events of this chapter excerpt occur within a single universe in chronological order, and there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing here.","completion":"In the shadows of a world blended from the ambitions of empires and kingdoms both fantastic and grounded, where machinart combines with the energy of chakra, and the legends of myriad universes interweave, the dust of a recent conquest slowly settled over the hidden continent. A place once cloaked in secrecy, where the balance was maintained by the hands of those who commanded both the ethereal and the material, had now been drawn into the stark light of modernity by the unyielding force of the Japanese Empire, ushered by the descendants of the mythical Ōtsutsuki clan. Within this new era's dawn, a unique family, a nexus of multiple realms' bloodlines and legends, found themselves traveling toward the village once renowned as the cradle of shinobi civilization—the Hidden Leaf Village. The heavily modified Tactical Surface Fighter, cloaked from unwary eyes, cut silently through the skies before transitioning to the more discreet approach of an armored train, a testament to the Ōtsutsuki-Great Yamato's technological prowess. Nobuyuki, under the guise of Gorou, with his familial entourage of Miya, masquerading as Miki, Maya, their children Issei, Sakura, Miyuki, Honoka, and the youthful yet imposing figure of Koyuki, the Snow Country's princess, were an ensemble representing a bridge between worlds. As they alighted from the train, a Hyūga-driven Nissan Century Royal awaited, its design a harmonious embodiment of tradition and cutting-edge technology. The village, now under new stars, buzzed with the sound of construction. The dismantling of the Hokage Monument, an act symbolic of the change washing over the hidden continent, was underway. The Ōtsutsuki's lineage, mirrored in the visage of the divine Kaguya and her descendants who reigned as emperors in Japan, were poised to replace the stone faces of the Hokages. Miyuki's voice, tinged with a blend of sarcasm and genuine surprise, broke the reflective silence in the limousine. \\"To think our ancient home would yield so easily, and they barely advanced without the guiding hand of chakra in their sciences.\\" Issei, leaning into the comfort of the vehicle, responded with a smirk, having tasted the thrill of command. \\"Well, leading those TSFs into battle was one way to bring them to the modern age. Maybe now, they'll learn.\\" Sakura, ever the inquisitive soul, posed a question laced with innocence. \\"But why didn't the ninjas here use their chakra to build things or improve their lives?\\" Koyuki, her gaze fixed on the evolving landscape beyond the tinted windows, replied with a hint of disdain. \\"Stubbornness and a refusal to evolve. Much like the fanatics and autocrats of the outside world who cling to outdated ideals.\\" Their path through the village led them to the Hokage Office, where surrender documents awaited, penned by the hand of the village's shadowy scientist-turned-militant, Orochimaru, under the watchful eye of his once-mentor, Hiruzen. As they stepped out, greeted by the unease and curiosity of villagers unaccustomed to the entourage's diverse heritage, a radio broadcast filled the air. The voice, laden with revelations about Ne's clandestine atrocities, orchestrated by the manipulated Danzo, sought to usher in a transparency long alien to the shinobi world. The scene inside the Hokage Office was steeped in tension, a palpable unease that fluttered like a discordant melody. Hiruzen, once the guardian of the village's soul, now handed over the reins of power with a signature, his hand heavy with the weight of an era ending. As they exited, documents in hand, the future of the Hidden Leaf sealed, the merging of the Ōtsutsuki's celestial legacy with the earthbound ambitions of the Japanese Empire marked not an end, but the inception of a new chapter—one where the lost art of the ninja would be redefined under the banner of progress, where ancient magic and advanced science would forge a new path for humanity, guided by the descendants of legends. And amid the echoes of a world transformed, Nobuyuki, under the identities bestowed upon him by fate and choice, pondered the journey ahead. For in this fusion of worlds, in this family of crossed stars, lay not just the promise of peace but the perpetual search for balance in an ever-evolving cosmos."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It's set up to simplify 3D meshes to reduce their complexity while maintaining their overall appearance. This is particularly useful in 3D graphics and game development for improving performance by reducing the number of vertices and triangles that need to be processed and rendered, especially for objects that are farther away from the camera. Let's break down the key parts of this system: # Imports The script starts by importing necessary namespaces from Unity's core, DOTS, mathematics libraries, and rendering systems, which provide foundational classes and methods required for mesh processing, job system integration, and interaction with Unity's rendering pipeline. # MeshSimplificationSystem Class - Inherits from \`JobComponentSystem\`, making it part of Unity's ECS framework. This system is designed to operate on entities/components in a highly efficient and parallelizable manner. - \`SimplificationRatio\`: A constant that presumably would control the degree to which meshes are simplified (though it's not directly used in the provided code snippet). # MeshData Struct - Acts as a component to store mesh data within ECS entities, using \`NativeArray<float3>\` for vertex positions and \`NativeArray<int>\` for triangle indices. These native arrays are optimized for high-performance operations and are compatible with Unity's job system and burst compiler. # SimplifyMeshJob Struct - A job struct tagged with \`[BurstCompile]\` to enable compilation with Unity's Burst compiler for high performance. It implements \`IJobForEachWithEntity<MeshData>\`, indicating it is designed to process each entity with \`MeshData\` component in parallel. - The \`Execute\` method, which would run for each entity, contains a placeholder for mesh simplification logic. Actual mesh simplification algorithms like Quadric Error Metrics are complex and involve reducing the mesh's vertex and triangle count while attempting to preserve the appearance as much as possible. # OnUpdate Method - Overrides \`JobComponentSystem.OnUpdate\`, scheduling the \`SimplifyMeshJob\` to run on all entities with the \`MeshData\` component. This method ties the job to the ECS lifecycle, allowing it to be executed during the system's update cycle with \`inputDeps\` indicating the job's dependency on other jobs completing. # Additional Methods - The code also sketches out ideas for further development, including automatic LOD (Level of Detail) generation, optimization for mesh rendering, error handling, customization of the simplification process, visualization tools, and performance optimizations. These are outlined with comments and imply a comprehensive system that not only simplifies meshes but also integrates with Unity's rendering systems, provides user interactivity, and ensures robust performance optimizations. This snippet provides a conceptual framework for a mesh simplification system within Unity's ECS and DOTS environment. However, the actual simplification logic, error handling, and rendering optimizations would require significant additional implementation to realize a complete system. The placeholder comments and outlined methods suggest areas for further development, focusing on performance, user customization, and integration with Unity's advanced rendering capabilities."},{"prompt":"AssetsSimplestarGameSimpleMeshAPISampleScriptsasdc.cs(358,10): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'NativeDisableContainerSafetyRestrictionAttribute' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
