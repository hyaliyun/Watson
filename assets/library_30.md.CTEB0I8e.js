If the patient's symptoms were worsening despite appropriate medical treatment, or if there were any alarming features such as severe pain, vomiting (especially if bloody or looking like coffee grounds), signs of anemia, or unexplained weight loss, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD) would be the next step. An endoscopy allows direct visualization of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, which can help identify the presence of gastritis, peptic ulcers, erosions, or even more serious conditions like malignancies. Biopsies can be taken during the procedure to help distinguish between different types of gastritis (such as Helicobacter pylori gastritis) and to rule out malignancy. Besides endoscopy, you might also consider: - Testing for Helicobacter pylori, a common cause of chronic gastritis, with non-invasive methods like a urea breath test, stool antigen test, or blood antibody test. - Comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count to look for signs of anemia or other metabolic disturbances. - Possibly imaging studies, such as an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan, if the endoscopy does not provide a clear diagnosis, or if you suspect other abdominal pathology. After identifying the underlying cause of the symptoms, the treatment regimen could be adjusted accordingly. Excellent work addressing these scenarios! Do you have any more questions on this topic, or is there another area you'd like to discuss?"},{"prompt":"test me more in acute gastritis","completion":"Great, let's dive a bit deeper with another question regarding acute gastritis. Question 5: You've prescribed a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for a patient with suspected NSAID-induced acute gastritis, and they return to your clinic with complete resolution of their symptoms. While discussing the discontinuation of the PPI, the patient inquires about ways to prevent the recurrence of gastritis. What advice would you give regarding the prevention of gastritis, and what specific instructions would you provide for a patient with a history of NSAID-induced gastritis? Please consider lifestyle modifications, dietary recommendations, and medication-related counseling in your answer."},{"prompt":"stop spicy food, irritants and fatty food, alcohol, smoking. stop stressing.","completion":"Indeed, those are important lifestyle and dietary recommendations to prevent the recurrence of gastritis. Here's a more detailed counseling plan that covers your points: 1. **Dietary Changes**: Advise the patient to: - Avoid spicy and fatty foods as they can exacerbate gastric irritation. - Limit or avoid irritants such as caffeine and acidic drinks which can increase stomach acid production. - Reduce or eliminate alcohol intake as it can damage the stomach lining. - Eat smaller, more frequent meals to avoid overwhelming the stomach with large amounts of food. 2. **Lifestyle Modifications**: - Encourage the patient to quit smoking if they smoke, as tobacco use can impair the protective lining of the stomach. - Discuss stress management strategies such as regular exercise, adequate rest, relaxation techniques, and possibly psychological support if needed. 3. **Medication-Related Counseling**: - Educate the patient on the appropriate use of NSAIDs, including taking the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration. - Suggest alternative pain relief methods if needed, such as acetaminophen, which is not associated with causing gastritis. - If the patient must use NSAIDs again, discuss using them in combination with a PPI or H2 antagonist to protect the stomach lining. Also, advise them to take NSAIDs with food to minimize irritation. - Remind the patient to inform any healthcare provider about their history of gastritis before starting new medications. 4. **Follow-Up**: - Arrange for a follow-up to reassess symptom management and ensure that the patient does not develop recurrent symptoms after stopping the PPI. By providing comprehensive advice on these points, you can help the patient minimize the likelihood of gastritis recurrence and foster better long-term gastrointestinal health. Moving to the next question for further testing. Question 6: A patient you treated for acute gastritis returns to your clinic complaining of a recurrence of epigastric pain. They report having strictly followed all lifestyle and dietary recommendations and avoided NSAIDs. What would be your approach to this patient now, considering their recurrent symptoms? Please describe your next diagnostic or management steps."},{"prompt":"do endoscopy and urea breath test for h pylori","completion":"That's an appropriate response. If a patient returns with recurrent symptoms of gastritis after an initial resolution and adherence to preventative measures, further investigation is warranted to identify any underlying causes that may have been missed or have developed since the last evaluation. 1. **Endoscopy (EGD)**: An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is a crucial diagnostic tool that allows direct visualization of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This will help to identify any erosions, ulcers, or signs of chronic gastritis, and biopsies can be taken to test for Helicobacter pylori, rule out malignancy, or identify other pathologies that might not be apparent through symptoms alone. 2. **Testing for H. pylori**: - A urea breath test is a non-invasive and accurate method for diagnosing active H. pylori infection. - Alternatively, a stool antigen test or serologic antibody test could also be used, though the breath test and stool antigen test are preferred for diagnosing active infection. If H. pylori is detected, the treatment would involve a course of antibiotics plus a proton pump inhibitor as part of a standard eradication regimen. If the endoscopy reveals other pathology, such as peptic ulcers or signs of more serious disease, the management would be tailored accordingly. Would you like another question on this topic, or do you wish to explore a different subject?"},{"prompt":"okay professor. before exploring a different topic, can you write exam for me in acute gastritis and then rate my answers","completion":"Certainly! Here is a concise exam on acute gastritis comprising five questions. Answer each question, and I'll provide feedback on your responses. **Acute Gastritis Exam** 1. **Pathophysiology**: What are the typical physiological changes that occur in the stomach lining during acute gastritis? 2. **Clinical Presentation**: Describe the common symptoms a patient with acute gastritis might report. 3. **Diagnosis**: Aside from an endoscopy, what are two other diagnostic tests you could order if you suspect acute gastritis? 4. **Management**: What first-line medication would you prescribe for a patient diagnosed with acute H. pylori-negative gastritis, and for how long should this medication typically be used? 5. **Education**: What dietary and lifestyle advice would you give a patient to manage acute gastritis symptoms and prevent potential recurrence? Take your time to provide your answers, and I will review and rate them accordingly."},{"prompt":"1. stomach start to produce more acid and causes inflammation of its mucosa","completion":"Your answer touches on one aspect of the pathophysiology but is not entirely accurate. To clarify: In acute gastritis, the typical physiological changes include inflammation of the gastric mucosa, which can occur due to various factors including NSAID use, alcohol, stress, or infection (such as with H. pylori). Rather than the stomach producing more acid, it is often the weakening of the mucosal defenses against the stomach's acid that leads to inflammation. This can be due to a direct injury to the gastric lining (as with NSAIDs or alcohol) or indirect factors like a bacterial infection, which disrupts the balance and leads to mucosal damage. Now, please answer the next question on clinical presentation."},{"prompt":"epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, belching, dyspepsia,","completion":"Excellent! You have correctly identified several common symptoms of acute gastritis: - **Epigastric pain**: Often described as a gnawing or burning sensation in the upper abdomen. - **Nausea**: A feeling of sickness with an inclination to vomit. - **Vomiting**: Can sometimes contain blood if there is significant gastric mucosal damage. - **Belching**: Can be more frequent due to discomfort or dyspepsia. - **Dyspepsia**: General indigestion that may include bloating, fullness, and gastric discomfort. These symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can be exacerbated by certain foods, medications, or stress. Let's proceed to the third question on diagnosis."},{"prompt":"stool occult test, urea breath test, stool analysis, ct or us","completion":"Good work. You've listed several diagnostic options: - **Stool Occult Blood Test (FOBT)** or **Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT)**: These tests are used to detect hidden blood in the stool, which can be a sign of gastritis or other more serious conditions like ulcers or cancer. - **Urea Breath Test**: A non-invasive test that can detect the presence of Helicobacter pylori, a common bacteria associated with gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. - **Stool Analysis**: While not specific for gastritis, can be used to test for the presence of H. pylori antigen, pathogens, or other abnormalities in the stool. - **CT Scan or Ultrasound (US)**: While these are not first-line tests for gastritis, they may be used to rule out other abdominal pathology if the diagnosis is uncertain or if there are signs of complications related to gastritis. A point to note is that while these tests are helpful, the definitive diagnosis of gastritis is often made via endoscopy, which allows direct visualization and biopsy of the stomach lining. For Question 4 on management, what's your answer?"},{"prompt":"ppi like omeprazole 20 mg one tab per day for 1 or 2 months","completion":"Correct, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) such as omeprazole is the first-line treatment for acute gastritis, especially when there is a need for acid suppression to allow the gastric mucosa to heal. Omeprazole 20 mg once daily is the standard starting dose. The duration of treatment can vary; it's often for 4 to 8 weeks depending on the severity of the gastritis and the patient's response to treatment. If H. pylori is detected and is the cause of the gastritis, treatment would also include a combination of antibiotics to eradicate the infection in addition to the PPI. Now, onto the last question on education. What would you advise?"},{"prompt":"stop spicy and irritant food, stop stress, eat less food but more frequent. stop alcohol. stop nsaids overuse. stop smoking","completion":"You've covered the key dietary and lifestyle advice very well: - Avoiding spicy and irritating foods to reduce gastric irritation. - Managing stress with techniques such as exercise, meditation, or counseling. - Eating smaller, more frequent meals to avoid overwhelming the stomach. - Abstaining from alcohol, which can damage the stomach lining. - Avoiding the overuse of NSAIDs, which can disrupt the stomach's protective mucosal barrier. - Quitting smoking, as it can exacerbate gastritis and impair the healing process. This comprehensive advice will help control acute gastritis symptoms and prevent potential recurrence, enhancing overall gastrointestinal health. **Exam Feedback:** You've demonstrated a good understanding of the basic concepts related to acute gastritis, including its symptoms, initial management, and patient education. In a clinical setting, it's also important to follow up with patients to reassess their symptoms and ensure proper adherence to the treatment plan. Always ensure that you stay updated with the latest clinical guidelines and evidence-based practices. **Rating:** Based on your answers, I would rate your performance as proficient in the subject of acute gastritis. Continue to study and gain experience, and you'll be well on your way to becoming highly proficient in gastroenterology topics. Would you like to cover another area, or do you have any other questions?"},{"prompt":"give me a grade out of 100","completion":"As an AI, I can't provide an official medical grade, but I can give you an informal assessment based on your responses. **Pathophysiology**: Your answer was partly correct but lacked some details about the specific changes in the stomach lining during gastritis. **Score: 60/100** **Clinical Presentation**: You correctly identified several key symptoms associated with acute gastritis. **Score: 90/100** **Diagnosis**: You listed relevant diagnostic tests, including some that are not first-line for gastritis but may be used in specific scenarios. **Score: 85/100** **Management**: You provided the correct first-line medication and dosing for gastritis. **Score: 100/100** **Education**: Your lifestyle and dietary advice were comprehensive and appropriate for a patient with gastritis. **Score: 100/100** **Overall Grade**: Taking into account all the scores, your overall grade would come out to **87/100**. This score suggests a strong understanding of acute gastritis and its management, with some room for improvement in the area of pathophysiology. Remember, continuous learning and clinical experience are key to deepening your knowledge. Would you like to explore another medical topic or have further clarification on any issues discussed?"},{"prompt":"now do a more difficult exam","completion":"Certainly! Let's delve into a more advanced scenario-based exam regarding acute gastritis. Again, respond to each question and I'll provide feedback on your answers. **Advanced Acute Gastritis Scenario Exam** Imagine a scenario where you are presented with a 45-year-old male patient who has come to your office with complaints of a two-week history of episodic epigastric pain, especially at night. The pain somewhat relieves with eating. He has associated nausea but no vomiting. He also reports a recent increase in stress at work and has been using OTC ibuprofen more frequently for tension headaches. 1. **Pathophysiology and Differential Diagnosis**: Based on the given history, propose a pathophysiologic mechanism for this patient’s symptoms and list three possible differential diagnoses that should be considered. 2. **Initial Workup**: What initial tests and evaluations would you perform in the office before considering a referral to gastroenterology? 3. **Pharmacologic Treatment**: What medication or medications would you start initially while awaiting further test results, and why? 4. **Patient Education and Non-pharmacologic Interventions**: What specific non-pharmacologic interventions and patient education points would you emphasize that are crucial for this patient's presentation? 5. **Follow-Up and Referral Indications**: After initial treatment and interventions, the patient shows slight improvement but still has persistent symptoms. What are your criteria for deciding on a gastroenterology referral, and what additional diagnostics or treatments might you expect to be considered by the specialist? Take your time to think through your responses for this more complex case. When you're ready, proceed with your answers to the first question."},{"prompt":"acute gastritis, peptic ulcer, ibs","completion":"You've identified three reasonable differential diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms: 1. **Acute Gastritis**: The use of OTC ibuprofen and increased stress could have predisposed the patient to develop gastritis, presenting with epigastric pain and nausea. The pain relief with eating is common as food may buffer the stomach acid. 2. **Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)**: The nocturnal epigastric pain that improves with eating is also a classic symptom of a peptic ulcer, usually caused by H. pylori infection or NSAID use. 3. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: While IBS could be considered given the gastrointestinal symptoms, the nocturnal pain that wakes the patient typically isn't a characteristic of IBS, as this condition most often does not disturb sleep. Additionally, IBS usually involves changes in bowel habits, which aren't reported in this case. For this pathophysiologic mechanism, the combination of ibuprofen (NSAID) use and stress could have compromised the protective mucosal lining of the stomach, leading to inflammation (gastritis) or ulceration (peptic ulcer disease). Now, moving on to the next question: What initial tests and evaluations would you perform?"},{"prompt":"physical examination . stool occult test or urea breath test and stool analysis. endoscopy","completion":"For the initial workup, your choices are generally aligned with standard clinical practice for a patient presenting with these symptoms: 1. **Physical Examination**: A comprehensive physical exam including an abdominal examination to check for tenderness, masses, or organomegaly which can provide important clues about the underlying condition. 2. **Stool Occult Blood Test (FOBT)** or **Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT)**: To detect hidden blood in the stool, which could indicate gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or other gastrointestinal bleeding. 3. **Urea Breath Test** and **Stool Analysis**: - **H. pylori Testing**: A non-invasive urea breath test or stool antigen test can be used to diagnose an active H. pylori infection, a known cause of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. - **Stool Analysis**: Can be helpful to rule out infections if the patient has any symptoms of diarrhea. While **Endoscopy** is a critical diagnostic tool, it might not necessarily be part of the initial workup in primary care but is definitely an immediate next step if the patient doesn't improve with first-line treatment, shows alarm symptoms, or if there is a strong suspicion of an ulcer or other significant pathology given the patient's age and symptoms. At this point, we would typically perform the non-invasive tests first and consider an endoscopy based on those results and the clinical progression. Now, for the third question: What pharmacologic treatment would you start initially?"},{"prompt":"omeprazole 20mg one tab daily for a 4 to 8 weeks","completion":"That's a valid initial pharmacologic treatment approach. Starting the patient on omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), at a dose of 20 mg daily is a common and effective strategy for suspected cases of acute gastritis or peptic ulcer disease due to its acid-suppressing effects. It can help alleviate symptoms and promote healing of the gastric mucosa. Using PPI therapy for 4 to 8 weeks is appropriate for a trial treatment period. The rationale behind this time frame is to allow enough time for potential gastric mucosal healing, and assessing the patient’s response to the medication can provide diagnostic clues. Furthermore, if the patient is found to have an H. pylori infection, the PPI would become part of the combination therapy for eradication, which also includes antibiotics. Now, let's move on to the fourth question regarding patient education and non-pharmacologic interventions. What specific advice would you give?"},{"prompt":"stop spicy and irritant food, alcohol and smoking, stress and nsaids overuse. eat less portions but more frequent","completion":"Your recommendations for non-pharmacologic interventions and patient education are on point and cover key aspects: - Advising the patient to **avoid spicy and irritating foods** that can exacerbate gastric irritation and symptoms. - Recommending the **cessation of alcohol and tobacco use**, both of which can impair the protective lining of the stomach and hinder healing. - Stressing **stress management** as stress can worsen gastrointestinal symptoms; this could include techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, exercise, or seeking therapy. - Highlighting the importance of **discontinuing the overuse of NSAIDs** like ibuprofen which can damage the gastric mucosa. - Emphasizing the benefit of **eating smaller, more frequent meals** rather than large meals to avoid overwhelming the stomach and potentially worsening symptoms. Effective patient education can empower the patient to take control of modifiable lifestyle factors that contribute to gastritis and is a critical component of comprehensive treatment. Now let's proceed to the final question on follow-up and referral. What are your criteria for deciding on a gastroenterology referral, and what might the specialist consider?"},{"prompt":"refer if the patient doesnt improve with drugs. and if red signs like anemia, bleeding , wight loss , night swest, severe pain","completion":"Your criteria for gastroenterology referral are well considered. Referral to a specialist is indicated under the following circumstances: - The patient’s symptoms do not improve with initial medical therapy, suggesting a need for further evaluation and possibly more advanced treatment. - Presence of any alarm features (\\"red flags\\") that could indicate more serious or complicated disease, such as: - Unexplained anemia, which may suggest chronic blood loss. - Evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (vomiting blood, black tarry stools). - Unintentional weight loss, which raises concerns for malignancy or other serious conditions. - Night sweats, which may be associated with systemic conditions, including malignancies. - Severe, persistent, or incapacitating pain not relieved by medication. The gastroenterologist might consider the following additional diagnostics or treatments: - **Upper Endoscopy (EGD)**: To directly visualize the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum for ulcers, inflammation, or other pathology, and to obtain biopsies. - **H. pylori Testing**: If not already done, confirmatory testing for H. pylori infection, which might alter the treatment plan to include antibiotic therapy for eradication. - **Repeat Blood Work**: Including complete blood count, metabolic panel, and other tests as needed based on the probable diagnosis. - **Imaging**: An abdominal CT scan or ultrasound may be warranted if the endoscopy and initial tests do not lead to a diagnosis, or if there is suspicion of other intra-abdominal pathology. **Feedback on your exam performance:** You've shown a comprehensive understanding of the typical steps involved in diagnosing and managing acute gastritis, appropriate indications for the use of medication, lifestyle interventions, and criteria for specialist referral. Your approach is consistent with both safety and evidence-based practices. Based on this advanced scenario examination, your performance remains proficient with clear rationale and decision-making. Continue to build on this strong foundation. If you have any specific areas you'd like to focus on, or if you want to explore a different topic, feel free to let me know!"},{"prompt":"give me a score out of 100","completion":"For the advanced scenario-based exam questions you answered, let's provide an informal score based on each response: 1. **Pathophysiology and Differential Diagnosis**: You identified three possible conditions that match the symptoms provided, including acute gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and IBS. For the advanced level, more depth in explaining the pathophysiologic mechanisms might be expected. **Score: 80/100** 2. **Initial Workup**: Your workup was thorough, including both a standard physical examination and appropriate non-invasive tests before considering an endoscopy. **Score: 90/100** 3. **Pharmacologic Treatment**: You correctly chose omeprazole, a PPI, as the initial pharmacologic treatment and provided an appropriate duration for therapy. **Score: 100/100** 4. **Patient Education and Non-pharmacologic Interventions**: Your advice was sound and encompassed all major lifestyle changes that could impact gastritis management. **Score: 100/100** 5. **Follow-Up and Referral Indications**: You identified appropriate criteria for referral to a specialist, including the lack of response to medication and the presence of alarm features. **Score: 90/100** **Overall Score**: Averaging these scores gives you a final score of **92/100**. This score reflects a very good understanding of acute gastritis, its management, and indications for referral. It suggests that you have a solid grasp of what steps to take when faced with a patient presenting with symptoms of acute gastritis. Continue to refine your knowledge and apply evidence-based practices to clinical scenarios. Would you like further testing, or is there another topic you wish to discuss?"},{"prompt":"can you teach me chronic gastritis and how is it different than acute gastritis","completion":"Chronic gastritis and acute gastritis are both inflammatory conditions of the stomach lining, but they differ in their duration, causes, and histological findings. **Chronic Gastritis:** Chronic gastritis is a long-standing inflammation that can persist for months or even years. It is often asymptomatic but can cause nonspecific symptoms such as dyspepsia, abdominal discomfort, and nausea. Chronic gastritis can be caused by a variety of factors, the most common being: - **Helicobacter pylori Infection**: A bacterial infection that can lead to chronic gastritis and increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. - **Autoimmune Factors**: Autoimmune gastritis occurs when the body's immune system attacks the cells of the stomach lining, often leading to pernicious anemia due to intrinsic factor deficiency and reduced vitamin B12 absorption. - **Chemical or Environmental Factors**: Long-term use of irritants such as NSAIDs or alcohol, or exposure to bile reflux, can cause chemical gastritis. Histologically, chronic gastritis is characterized by lymphocytes and plasma cells in the gastric mucosa, which indicate ongoing inflammation. Gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia may also be present in severe or long-standing cases, especially in the autoimmune type, and these changes can predispose one to gastric cancer. **Acute Gastritis:** Acute gastritis is a sudden onset of inflammation that usually presents with more pronounced symptoms such as severe epigastric pain, nausea, and even vomiting, occasionally with blood if erosions or ulcers are present. Causes of acute gastritis include: - **Ingestion of Irritants**: Such as NSAIDs, alcohol, or strong acids and alkalis. - **Infection**: Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections can cause acute gastritis but are less common than chronic bacterial infection like H. pylori. - **Stress**: Severe physiological stress from illness, surgery, or trauma (known as stress-related mucosal disease). Histologically, acute gastritis shows neutrophilic infiltration of the gastric mucosa, indicative of acute inflammation, and this may be accompanied by hemorrhage or erosion of the gastric surface. **Key Differences:** - **Duration**: Chronic gastritis is long-standing while acute gastritis has a rapid onset. - **Symptoms**: Acute gastritis typically has more severe and sudden symptoms, whereas chronic gastritis may be asymptomatic or cause mild symptoms. - **Etiology**: Chronic gastritis is often caused by H. pylori infection or autoimmune conditions, while acute gastritis is usually due to direct mucosal injury by irritants or stress. - **Histology**: Chronic gastritis shows chronic inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and plasma cells), with possible atrophy or metaplasia, while acute gastritis shows neutrophilic infiltration. Management of chronic gastritis involves treating the underlying cause, such as eradicating H. pylori or managing autoimmune conditions, and monitoring for complications like ulcers or cancer. Acute gastritis treatment focuses on removing the offensive agents and supporting mucosal healing with medications such as proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers. Understanding these differences is critical for the appropriate diagnosis and management of these conditions. Would you like to explore more details about the diagnosis, management, or any specific questions regarding chronic gastritis?"},{"prompt":"hello","completion":"Hello!

Would you mind providing more context or clarifying your question so I can assist you properly?"},{"prompt":"how much does a dns aplification actually amplify it? lets say the responce is the max ammount of data a dns resolution can have","completion":"A DNS amplification attack is a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack where an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the DNS infrastructure to turn initially small queries into much larger payloads, which are then directed at the target with the intention of overwhelming its network or resources. The amplification factor is a measure of how much larger the response is compared to the original request. The amplification factor of a DNS amplification attack can vary greatly depending on various factors, including the DNS software version, configurations, the types of records requested, and the specific domains being queried. For instance, if an attacker queries a DNS server for a record that has a very large response, such as a TXT record with lots of data or a DNSSEC-enabled query, the amplification factor can be substantial. The maximum size for a DNS response when using the traditional UDP protocol is typically 512 bytes, but this limit can be extended to 4096 bytes with the use of the Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0). However, attackers might configure their requests to elicit responses that are fragmented over multiple UDP packets, resulting in even larger combined responses. In practice, amplification factors of anywhere from 10 to 70 times the original query size have been observed. This means that if an attacker sends a 60-byte query to a DNS server, the response could be anywhere from 600 bytes to 4200 bytes or more. In extreme cases, carefully crafted DNS queries and responses can achieve even higher amplification factors. For example, a single amplified DNS response reaching the theoretical maximum size of a UDP packet (65,507 bytes) could create a very high amplification factor when the original query was small. However, such large packets are generally fragmented over the internet, making them less effective for some types of DDoS attacks. The effectiveness of a DNS amplification attack can also be increased by exploiting a large number of open DNS resolvers, distributing the attack traffic across many sources, and making it more difficult to mitigate. It's important to note that measures can be taken by network administrators to reduce the risk of DNS servers being used in amplification attacks, such as disabling responses to any IP address that did not send the original request, implementing rate limiting, and configuring DNS servers not to respond with large payloads for any particular type of request."},{"prompt":"3 frnds raj, sati, pnjl had party raj paid 900 for beers for all and pnjl paid 1700 for food all . sati paid raj 866.67 his share for food and, beer to raj. now how much raj need to pay prnjl","completion":"Let's first calculate the total amount spent by Raj and Pnjl: Raj spent: 900 (for beers) Pnjl spent: 1700 (for food) Total spent by Raj and Pnjl combined = 900 + 1700 = 2600 The total expense should be divided equally among all three friends (Raj, Sati, and Pnjl). Since there are three friends, each person's share is: Total individual share = Total spent / Number of friends Total individual share = 2600 / 3 Total individual share = 866.67 (approx.) Now, we have to find out how much Sati paid Raj and how it affects what Raj owes Pnjl. Sati paid Raj 866.67, which is Sati's share for both food and beer. This means Raj has effectively paid less for the overall expenses because Sati gave him his share. Let's subtract what Sati gave Raj from Raj's initial expense: Effective amount Raj spent = Raj's initial payment - Sati's payment to Raj Effective amount Raj spent = 900 - 866.67 Effective amount Raj spent = 33.33 (approx.) Now, let's calculate Pnjl's share of the expenses. We know each individual's share is 866.67, and Pnjl paid 1700 for food. We can find out how much Raj should pay Pnjl by subtracting Pnjl's share from the amount Pnjl paid. Amount Raj needs to pay Pnjl = Pnjl's expense - Pnjl's share Amount Raj needs to pay Pnjl = 1700 - 866.67 Amount Raj needs to pay Pnjl = 833.33 (approx.) So, Raj needs to pay Pnjl approximately 833.33 for his share of the expenses."},{"prompt":"Also devide 1700 into 3 person which is 566.66 exclude that from 1700 and now tell ne how much raj owes him","completion":"Sure, let's break down the contribution for the food that cost 1700 among the three friends - Raj, Sati, and Pnjl. Every individual's share for the food expense is 1700 divided by 3: Individual share for food = 1700 / 3 Individual share for food = 566.67 (approximately) Pnjl initially paid the full amount for the food, which is 1700. We will deduct the individual share for all three friends from the total to find out how much Raj owes Pnjl: Amount Pnjl should be reimbursed = Total food expense - Individual shares (for all three) Amount Pnjl should be reimbursed = 1700 - (3 * 566.67) Amount Pnjl should be reimbursed = 1700 - 1700.01 Amount Pnjl should be reimbursed = -0.01 In reality, it seems there is a small rounding error because 566.67 * 3 should equal exactly 1700. But due to rounding to two decimal places, we have an extra penny (0.01). This is a minor discrepancy and can be ignored or corrected through rounding: Amount Pnjl should be reimbursed = 1700 - 1700 Amount Pnjl should be reimbursed = 0 However, this calculation indicates that with exact division, there shouldn't be any reimbursement necessary because Pnjl's personal share is already covered by his payment. This means that with this division, Raj doesn't owe anything specifically for the food as long as all friends have settled their shares. Since we've been providing results to an accuracy of two decimal places, and as a result of rounding, it is generally acceptable to ensure the sum of individual shares equals the total expense. Adjusting for the rounding discrepancy, we have: Adjusted individual share for food = 1700 / 3 Adjusted individual share for food = 566.66 (corrected for rounding) Therefore, Pnjl would be reimbursed exactly: Amount Pnjl should be reimbursed = 1700 - (3 * 566.66) Amount Pnjl should be reimbursed = 1700 - 1699.98 Amount Pnjl should be reimbursed = 0.02 So, there's a 2 cent discrepancy resulting from rounding, which is trivial and can be disregarded. In conclusion, since the total payment made by Pnjl for the food has been equally divided among the three friends, Raj doesn't owe Pnjl anything more for the food. They have all paid their equal shares when accounting for minor rounding errors."},{"prompt":"I belive raj owes prnjl 833 rs as for food and beer adjsutmnt","completion":"Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. Let's recalculate the total amounts and determine how much Raj still owes Pnjl. Given that: 1. Raj paid 900 for beers. 2. Pnjl paid 1700 for food. 3. Sati paid 866.67 to Raj, covering Sati's share for food and beer. The total cost is the sum of what Raj and Pnjl paid: Total cost = Raj's payment for beers + Pnjl's payment for food Total cost = 900 + 1700 Total cost = 2600 Each person's share of the total cost: Individual share = Total cost / 3 Individual share = 2600 / 3 Individual share = 866.67 (approximately) Since Sati has paid Raj 866.67, Sati has covered their share completely. Now, let's see how much Raj and Pnjl have contributed more than their share: Raj: Amount Raj paid = 900 Amount Raj owes (for his share) = 866.67 Amount Raj overpaid = Amount Raj paid - Amount Raj owes Amount Raj overpaid = 900 - 866.67 Amount Raj overpaid = 33.33 (approximately) Pnjl: Amount Pnjl paid = 1700 Amount Pnjl owes (for his share) = 866.67 Amount Pnjl overpaid = Amount Pnjl paid - Amount Pnjl owes Amount Pnjl overpaid = 1700 - 866.67 Amount Pnjl overpaid = 833.33 (approximately) Now, considering the overpayment, Sati has settled their share by paying Raj. Now we need to balance what Raj and Pnjl overpaid: Raj has effectively only overpaid 33.33 (for beers), and Pnjl has overpaid 833.33 (for food). To settle the amounts between Raj and Pnjl: Amount Raj needs to pay Pnjl = Amount Pnjl overpaid - Amount Raj overpaid Amount Raj needs to pay Pnjl = 833.33 - 33.33 Amount Raj needs to pay Pnjl = 800 Therefore, after all adjustments, Raj owes Pnjl 800."},{"prompt":"using UnityEngine;

The script allows the player to load, display, and unequip items. It also keeps track of equipped items, handles UI updates for different armor types, and loads the player's inventory from Firebase Realtime Database. Here's a summary of what your script does: - \`GameManager\` is a Singleton class, ensuring that only one instance is active and persists across scene loads. - It has several methods to handle equipment (unequip, refresh UI, load inventory, etc.). - Inventory and equipment data are loaded from Firebase, and the script subscribes to Firebase Auth and Database. - The \`InventoryItemData\` nested class models the data that will be stored and retrieved from Firebase. - Upon initialization, the manager loads inventory data and subscribes to auto-refresh every 60 seconds. - Your class also contains methods to populate UI grids with item models based on the type of armor the player is browsing or equipping. Areas of Improvement: 1. **Code Organization**: Your script is quite long and handles many responsibilities. Consider breaking it down into multiple classes focusing on specific areas (InventoryManager, EquipmentManager, FirebaseManager, etc.). 2. **Error Handling**: It's good that you're checking for \`task.IsFaulted\` in your Firebase callbacks, but it would be helpful to also log the error and provide fallback behavior if needed. 3. **Hardcoded Strings**: You have many hardcoded strings for Firebase paths. It will be cleaner and less error-prone to store them in constants or in a configuration component. 4. **Performance**: Instantiating many objects (e.g., UI items and models) can be costly. Consider using object pooling to reuse objects instead of creating and destroying them frequently. Overall, your script seems to be on the right track for managing inventory and equipment in a game. Just be mindful of code organization and cleanup, and consider adding more robust error handling and object pooling for better performance and maintenance. Remember to keep your script modular to allow for easier changes and extensions in the future.

Expliquons chaque partie de cette expression : - \`for j in\`: Ceci commence une boucle \`for\` avec la variable \`j\` comme variable d'itération. À chaque itération de la boucle, \`j\` prendra la valeur suivante dans la séquence. - \`range(9, i, -1)\`: Cette fonction \`range\` génère une séquence d'entiers. La fonction \`range\` peut prendre trois arguments : \`range(start, stop, step)\`. - \`start\` (début) est la première valeur dans la séquence. Dans ce cas, c'est \`9\`, donc \`j\` commence à \`9\`. - \`stop\` (arrêt) est la limite qui n'est pas incluse dans la séquence.

Ici, l'incrément \`-1\` signifie que la séquence est décrémentée de 1 à chaque itération, donc \`j\` diminue de 1 à chaque fois. Cela crée une séquence qui se déplace à rebours. En résumé, cette ligne de code crée une boucle qui commence à l'index \`9\` du \`tab\` et décrémente \`j\` par 1 à chaque itération jusqu'à ce que \`j\` soit égal à \`i\` (sans inclure \`i\`). Cela est habituellement utilisé pour décaler les éléments d'un tableau ou d'une liste vers la droite pour faire de l'espace pour insérer une nouvelle valeur.

In this system, \\"muistaa\\" is categorized under type 53. The classification is based on the way the verbs conjugate, particularly in the present tense. The verb \\"muistaa\\" translates to \\"to remember\\" in English. Here's how \\"muistaa\\" conjugates in the present tense: Minä muistan (I remember) Sinä muistat (You remember) Hän muistaa (He/She remembers) Me muistamme (We remember) Te muistatte (You remember, plural/formal) He muistavat (They remember) The type 53 verbs generally have four or more letters in the stem, end in a weak vowel (-a/-ä) and have a gradation pattern which can be seen in the way the \\"t\\" changes or disappears, as well as the double vowels shortening in the conjugation: Muistan (I remember) - \\"t\\" is present Muistat (You remember) - \\"t\\" is present Muistaa (S/he remembers) - \\"t\\" is dropped The infinitive marker -(t)a or -(t)ä remains intact for type 53 verbs in all persons, and this is a characteristic of these types of verbs. The gradation is often more visible in other verb forms and tenses. As with all Finnish verbs, \\"muistaa\\" can be conjugated in various tenses and moods to express different time aspects and modalities."},{"prompt":"Kotus type 53","completion":"The Kotus type 53 in the Finnish language classification of verb types refers to a group of verbs that are characterized by the presence of two vowels at the end of the verb stem which get reduced (the second one drops) when the verb is conjugated. This type of verb also typically features consonant gradation, which can make the verb stem's final consonant change or disappear in certain forms. An example of Kotus type 53 is the verb \\"muistaa,\\" which means \\"to remember.\\" Let's look at the basic present tense conjugation of \\"muistaa\\": - minä muistan (I remember) - sinä muistat (you remember) - hän muistaa (he/she/it remembers) - me muistamme (we remember) - te muistatte (you remember, plural/familiar) - he muistavat (they remember) Here, you can see the double 'a' in \\"muistaa\\" gets reduced to a single 'a' in \\"muistan\\" and \\"muistat\\" but stays the same in \\"muistaa\\" because third person singular does not cause this reduction. The first person plural \\"muistamme\\" and the second person plural \\"muistatte\\" also reflect this trait, ending with \\"-mme\\" and \\"-tte\\" respectively, with the double 'a' from the infinitive form reduced to a single 'a'. The third person plural ends with \\"-vat,\\" indicative of consonant gradation and the change from \\"aa\\" to \\"a\\". Consonant gradation refers to a characteristic of Finnish phonology where the 'k', 'p', or 't' at the end of a closed syllable may change in a predictable way when suffixes are added. In the case of \\"muistaa,\\" there's no consonant to be gradated in the verb stem, but the phenomenon is common in other verbs of this type. Kotus type 53 verbs usually have the following infinitive characteristics: - Verb ends in '-aa' or '-ää' - Features consonant gradation (though not for \\"muistaa\\") - Two vowels at the end of the stem become a single vowel when conjugated, except for third person singular The classification of Finnish verbs into types by Kotus is pedagogically useful for learners of the Finnish language because it helps in memorizing the patterns of inflection across different verbs.

Он может использоваться как для краткосрочной, так и для долгосрочной торговли, и часто применяется для входа в сделки в направлении текущего тренда. Если вы ищете аналоги этого индикатора или подобные инструменты для использования в MT4, вот некоторые варианты: 1. Ichimoku Kinko Hyo — это классический японский технический индикатор, который также создаёт вид облака (Ichimoku Cloud) на графике для определения поддержки и сопротивления, направления тренда и моментов для входа в сделку. 2. Kumo Cloud — другой индикатор, который нарисует облако похожее на Ichimoku, но возможно с некоторыми изменениями в расчетах. 3. Moving Average Cloud — иногда трейдеры используют две скользящие средние разной длины, например, одну короткую и одну длинную, и закрашивают пространство между ними, создавая тем самым облако. 4. Super Trend — индикатор, который меняет цвет в зависимости от направления тренда и может быть рассмотрен как аналог для определения тренда. 5. TMA (Triangular Moving Average) Cloud — вариант, при котором используется треугольная скользящая средняя и её полосы для создания визуального облака на графике. Важно помнить, что хотя многие из этих индикаторов могут визуально напоминать Forex Cloud, они могут иметь разные математические подходы и, следовательно, давать разные торговые сигналы.

Пространство между линиями скользящих средних закрашивается, создавая эффект облака. 2. **Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA)** – использует несколько скользящих средних с различными периодами для определения силы тренда и потенциальных разворотов. 3. **Heiken Ashi Smoothed** – это версия стандартных свечей Heiken Ashi, которые сглаживаются для создания менее шумного графика, что может помочь в определении общего направления тренда. 4. **Parabolic SAR** – индикатор, который отображает точки на графике, которые следуют за ценой и обращаются, когда тренд меняется. Он часто используется для установки стоп-лоссов и определения точек выхода из торговли. 5. **ZigZag** – только лишь для визуализации, индикатор ZigZag помогает при определении трендов и важных высот и низин рынка путем соединения ключевых точек поворота. 6. **Bollinger Bands** – состоят из трёх линий: простой скользящей средней (обычно 20-периодной) и двух стандартных отклонений этой средней (полос), расставленных выше и ниже. Область между полосами можно рассматривать как область тренда. 7. **Price Channel** – похож на Envelope, но верхняя и нижняя линии рассчитываются на основе максимального и минимального значений цены за определенный период времени. 8. **Average Directional Index (ADX)** – показывает силу тренда. Высокие значения ADX указывают на сильный тренд, в то время как низкие значения могут указывать на слабый тренд или боковой рынок. 9. **Custom Trend-Indicator** – многие трейдеры и программисты создают свои собственные пользовательские индикаторы. Возможно, вы сможете найти или заказать разработку индикатора, который будет работать так же, как Forex Cloud или даже лучше соответствовать вашим потребностям.

Он обычно отображается на графике в виде цветной линии, которая перемещается вверх и вниз через диаграмму цен. Цвет этой линии изменяется в зависимости от направления тренда, помогая трейдерам увидеть, когда может произойти смена направления движения цен. Индикатор TopTrend часто используется как сигнальный инструмент; когда линия индикатора меняет цвет или пересекает цену, это может считаться сигналом к покупке или продаже. Например, если линия индикатора меняется с красного на синий и пересекает график цен снизу вверх, это может интерпретироваться как сигнал к покупке. Аналогично, изменение с синего на красный и пересечение сверху вниз может считаться сигналом к продаже. Важно отметить, что никакой индикатор не является непогрешимым, и часто трейдеры используют TopTrend в сочетании с другими индикаторами и инструментами технического анализа для более точного принятия торговых решений и управления рисками. Если вы заинтересованы в использовании индикатора TopTrend, его можно загрузить и установить в вашу торговую платформу MetaTrader 4. После установки индикатор будет доступен в списке пользовательских индикаторов, и вы сможете применить его к любому графику. Как и в случае с любыми индикаторами, работа с TopTrend требует понимания его параметров и настроек, а также опыта в интерпретации его сигналов. Тестирование индикатора на демо-счете или исторических данных может помочь определить его полезность для вашей торговой стратегии."},{"prompt":"Что насчет перерисовки Toptrend?","completion":"Перерисовка (repainting) индикаторов является достаточно известной проблемой в мире технического анализа. Индикаторы, которые перерисовываются, изменяют свои предыдущие значения на графике после того, как новые ценовые данные становятся доступными. Это может создать иллюзию точности в историческом тестировании, но в реальной торговле это вводит в заблуждение, так как ранее данные сигналы могут исчезнуть или измениться. В случае с индикатором TopTrend, он может быть подвержен этой проблеме, если его алгоритм написан таким образом, что он постоянно меняет цвет линии на основе последних изменений рыночной цены. Если индикатор не фиксирует сигнал на момент закрытия свечи или бара и продолжает изменять свои показания при появлении новых данных, это делает его бесполезным для получения надежных торговых сигналов. Однако, стоит заметить, что не все версии индикатора TopTrend одинаковы – некоторые могут быть написаны лучше и не нести проблемы перерисовки или делать это в гораздо меньшей степени. Чтобы проверить, подвержен ли индикатор TopTrend перерисовке, можно выполнить следующие действия: 1. Примените индикатор на график в режиме реального времени и наблюдайте за его поведением. Сигналы должны сохраняться стабильными после закрытия свечи/бара. 2. Используйте тестер стратегий MT4 и просмотрите, как индикатор вел себя в прошлом. Если значения индикатора изменяются ретроспективно после того, как новые данные поступили, то можно считать, что он перерисовывается. 3. Ищите отзывы других пользователей или обсуждения на форумах по трейдингу, где трейдеры могут обсуждать надежность различных индикаторов и их склонность к перерисовке. Если индикатор TopTrend действительно перерисовывается, трейдеры могут искать другие индикаторы, не имеющие такого недостатка, или разрабатывать свои собственные инструменты, которые предоставляют надежные и статические сигналы после закрытия торгового периода (например, свечи)."},{"prompt":"tma с 60 периодом на четырехчасовом таймфрейме. Какой результат даст?","completion":"Triangular Moving Average (TMA) с 60 периодами на четырёхчасовом таймфрейме (H4) отобразит среднюю цену актива за предыдущие 60 четырёхчасовых интервалов в виде сглаженной линии на графике. Использование TMA сравнительно с другими типами скользящих средних, такими как простая скользящая средняя (SMA) или экспоненциальная скользящая средняя (EMA), приводит к более плавной и менее \\"шумной\\" линии тренда из-за усреднения усреднений. TMA считается дважды сглаженной скользящей средней, то есть сначала вычисляется простая скользящая средняя, а затем сглаживание применяется к результату, чтобы получить конечный TMA. Это было сделано для того, чтобы минимизировать временное отставание, которое часто встречается в других типах скользящих средних. В контексте четырехчасового таймфрейма, TMA с периодом 60 будет отражать среднюю цену за последние 240 часов (60 периодов по 4 часа), что составляет 10 торговых дней (предполагая, что рынок работает 24 часа в сутки без выходных, как на рынке Форекс). Результаты использования TMA на графике H4 могут включать: 1. Выделение основного тренда: TMA поможет определить основное направление рыночного тренда за последние 10 дней. 2. Торговые сигналы: Некоторые трейдеры могут использовать пересечения цены с TMA как торговые сигналы – покупать, когда цена пересекает TMA снизу вверх, и продавать, когда она пересекает сверху вниз. 3. Поддержка и сопротивление: Линия TMA может служить уровнем поддержки или сопротивления в зависимости от положения цены относительно TMA. 4. Фильтр для других стратегий: TMA может использоваться для фильтрации сигналов от других индикаторов или торговых систем, чтобы убедиться, что сделки заключаются в соответствии с основным трендом.

Этот индикатор часто предпочитается трейдерами за его визуальную простоту и относительно чёткие сигналы. HalfTrend обычно не перерисовывается, что означает, что он не должен изменять значения своих предыдущих точек после появления новых данных. Это делает его сигналы относительно надежными и предсказуемыми, что важно для трейдеров, планирующих торговые стратегии на основе исторических данных. Однако следует учитывать, что любые индикаторы могут работать с разным успехом в различных рыночных условиях, и что нет абсолютно точных индикаторов. HalfTrend как и любой другой индикатор может выдавать ложные сигналы, особенно в периоды рыночной консолидации или при высокой волатильности. Поэтому полезно комбинировать использование HalfTrend с другими индикаторами и инструментами технического анализа для подтверждения сигналов и лучшего управления рисками. Если вы столкнулись с версией HalfTrend, которая кажется перерисовывается, это может быть связано с ошибками в коде индикатора или некорректной настройкой.

TMA — это скользящая средняя, которая дважды сглаживает данные цен, создавая линию, которая обычно следует за ценой более плавно, чем стандартные скользящие средние. MACD — это популярный индикатор, используемый для определения импульса и трендового направления, который рассчитывается на основании разности между двумя экспоненциальными скользящими средними (обычно 12-периодной и 26-периодной) и отображается в виде осциллятора. Как я понимаю, TMA MACD может быть индикатором, который комбинирует концепции TMA и MACD. Он может использовать TMA для сглаживания составляющих MACD или для создания \\"сигнальной линии\\", которая интерпретирует сигналы MACD. Теперь касаемо перерисовки. В общем, MACD не считается индикатором, который перерисовывается, потому что он строится на основе прошлых данных, и его значения не изменяются, когда новые цены появляются. Однако TMA по своей природе может быть более подвержена дополнительному сглаживанию, что иногда может приводить к небольшой задержке (отставанию) от текущих цен. Сочетание TMA и MACD в одном индикаторе может ввести дополнительные сложности, и это может повлиять на \\"отставание\\" индикатора от реального времени, но не обязательно привести к перерисовке. Перерисовка означает, что индикатор меняет свое прошлое значение — если после закрытия свечи значения индикатора остаются неизменными, то индикатор не перерисовывается. Чтобы проверить наличие перерисовки, требуется наблюдение за индикатором в режиме реального времени или в тестере стратегий. Если индикатор TMA MACD перерисовывается, это может быть связано с особенностями его алгоритма или ошибками в коде. Всегда рекомендуется тестировать любые технические индикаторы на исторических данных и в условиях демонстрационной торговли, чтобы понять их поведение, прежде чем использовать их в реальной торговле."},{"prompt":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\\"> <title>Text Ekleme</title> <style> body { background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 20px; } .container { max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; } .error-message { color: red; margin-top: 10px; } .sidebar { position: fixed; top: 0; right: 0; width: 200px; height: 100%; background-color: #e9ecef; padding: 10px; overflow-y: auto; } .sidebar ul { list-style: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; } .sidebar li { cursor: pointer; padding: 5px; border-bottom: 1px solid #dee2e6; } .sidebar li:hover { background-color: #ced4da; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=\\"container\\"> <h2 class=\\"mt-4 mb-4\\">Text Ekleme</h2> <div class=\\"form-group\\"> <label for=\\"text1\\">Text 1:</label> <input type=\\"text\\" class=\\"form-control\\" id=\\"text1\\"> </div> <div class=\\"form-group\\"> <label for=\\"text2\\">Text 2:</label> <textarea class=\\"form-control\\" id=\\"text2\\" rows=\\"3\\"></textarea> </div> <button class=\\"btn btn-primary\\" onclick=\\"ekle()\\">Ekle</button> <button class=\\"btn btn-secondary\\" onclick=\\"kaydet()\\">Kaydet</button> <div class=\\"error-message\\" id=\\"errorMessage\\"></div> </div> <div class=\\"sidebar\\"> <h4>Başlıklar</h4> <ul id=\\"basliklar\\"></ul> </div> <script> // Örnek bir JSON verisi var jsonData = { text2: '' }; // Başlıkları ve metinleri tutan bir dizi var basliklar = []; // Sayfa yüklendiğinde localStorage'dan veriyi çek window.onload = function () { var storedData = localStorage.getItem('jsonData'); if (storedData) { jsonData = JSON.parse(storedData); updateText2(); } var storedBasliklar = localStorage.getItem('basliklar'); if (storedBasliklar) { basliklar = JSON.parse(storedBasliklar); updateBasliklar(); } }; function ekle() { var text1 = document.getElementById('text1').value.trim(); var text2 = document.getElementById('text2').value.trim(); var errorMessageElement = document.getElementById('errorMessage'); if (text1 === '' || text2 === '') { errorMessageElement.textContent = 'Lütfen her iki alanı da doldurun.'; return; } var lines = text2.split('n'); for (var i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) { if (lines[i].trim() === text1) { errorMessageElement.textContent = 'Text 2'de zaten aynı metin bulunuyor.'; return; } } // Eğer hata yoksa, text2'ye text1'i ekle text2 += 'n' + text1; jsonData.text2 = text2; updateText2(); saveData(); // Hata mesajını temizle errorMessageElement.textContent = ''; } function kaydet() { var text2 = document.getElementById('text2').value.trim(); var errorMessageElement = document.getElementById('errorMessage'); if (text2 === '') { errorMessageElement.textContent = 'Text 2 boş olamaz.'; return; } var baslik = prompt('Lütfen bir başlık girin:'); if (baslik) { baslik = baslik.trim(); if (baslik === '') { errorMessageElement.textContent = 'Başlık boş olamaz.'; return; } for (var i = 0; i < basliklar.length; i++) { if (basliklar[i].baslik === baslik) { errorMessageElement.textContent = 'Bu başlık zaten kullanılmış.'; return; } } // Eğer hata yoksa, başlığı ve metni diziye ekle basliklar.push({baslik: baslik, metin: text2}); updateBasliklar(); saveBasliklar(); // Hata mesajını temizle errorMessageElement.textContent = ''; } } function updateText2() { document.getElementById('text2').value = jsonData.text2; } function updateBasliklar() { var basliklarElement = document.getElementById('basliklar'); basliklarElement.innerHTML = ''; for (var i = 0; i < basliklar.length; i++) { var li = document.createElement('li'); li.textContent = basliklar[i].baslik; li.onclick = function () { var index = basliklar.findIndex(b => b.baslik === this.textContent); if (index !== -1) { jsonData.text2 = basliklar[index].metin; updateText2(); saveData(); } }; basliklarElement.appendChild(li); } } function saveData() { // localStorage kullanarak JSON verisini sakla localStorage.setItem('jsonData', JSON.stringify(jsonData)); } function saveBasliklar() { // localStorage kullanarak başlık dizisini sakla localStorage.setItem('basliklar', JSON.stringify(basliklar)); } <\/script> </body> </html> istediğimiz başlıkları silebilme özelliği gelsin","completion":"Başlıkları silebileceğiniz bir özellik eklemek için, mevcut JavaScript koduna fonksiyonlar ekleyip HTML yapısında güncellemeler yapmalıyız.

Existem vários tipos e designs, mas a maioria compartilha algumas características comuns: - **Trilhos:** Trams operam em trilhos, que são geralmente incorporados ao pavimento das ruas. - **Forma:** Geralmente têm uma forma retangular alongada com extremidades que podem ser tanto arredondadas quanto angulares. - **Portas:** Possuem várias portas ao longo dos lados para entrada e saída de passageiros. - **Janelas:** Equipados com várias janelas, algumas podem ser abertas para ventilação enquanto outras são fixas. - **Pintura e Decoração:** Muitos trams são pintados nas cores do serviço de transporte local e podem ter publicidade ou grafismos relacionados à cidade ou ao operador. - **Interior:** No interior, há assentos dispostos em várias configurações, que podem ser pranchas de madeira em modelos mais antigos ou assentos acolchoados em veículos mais modernos. Geralmente existem barras e alças para passageiros em pé. Quanto ao termo \\"tram\\", ele é utilizado mundialmente e a aparência pode variar significativamente dependendo da localização. Por exemplo, os trams europeus podem ser diferentes dos encontrados na Austrália ou América do Norte, tanto no design quanto na capacidade. **Design Moderno:** Os trams modernos são muitas vezes veículos articulados, o que significa que são compostos por várias seções ligadas entre si, permitindo-lhes navegar por curvas apertadas nas ruas da cidade. **Tecnologia:** Alguns trams modernos são equipados com a última tecnologia, como sistemas de informação para passageiros em tempo real, Wi-Fi gratuito e plataformas de embarque de nível, permitindo fácil acesso para passageiros com deficiência ou carrinhos de bebê. Cada sistema de tram pode ter seus próprios detalhes únicos de aparência e operação, que são muitas vezes definidos pelas necessidades e preferências do ambiente urbano em que operam.

Ela é conhecida por ser uma popular ídolo no Japão dentro do universo da história e por ser uma das manejadoras do Death Note, a par do protagonista Light Yagami. Na sua aparência geral, Misa é uma jovem de estatura média, com longos cabelos loiros (algumas vezes visto como dourados) que vão até a cintura e são normalmente usados soltos. Seu estilo marca sua individualidade e rebeldia, e seu cabelo é muitas vezes estilizado com laços ou outros acessórios que se alinham com o visual \\"kawaii\\" (fofo) do Japão. Ela possui olhos azuis e uma expressão que varia desde alegre e excitável até séria e determinada, dependendo da situação. Misa Amane é frequentemente associada ao estilo de moda \\"Gothic Lolita\\" no anime e manga, que é caracterizado pelo uso de roupas inspiradas na época vitoriana ou rococó combinadas com elementos góticos. Este visual é marcado por: 1. Vestidos: Os vestidos de Misa frequentemente têm saias rodadas, com várias camadas ou babados, e muitas vezes são adornados com rendas, fitas e laços. Eles geralmente são de cores escuras, principalmente preto, mas também podem ter detalhes em branco ou outras cores para criar um contraste. 2. Acessórios: Para complementar seu vestuário \\"Gothic Lolita\\", Misa usa meias que geralmente chegam até o joelho, às vezes com padrões ou rendas, e calça sapatos de salto alto estilo Mary Jane. Ela também usa luvas de renda em algumas ocasiões. 3. Maquiagem: A maquiagem de Misa é outra característica importante do seu estilo. Ela tende a usar maquiagem pesada ao redor dos olhos, incluindo sombra escura e uma quantidade significativa de delineador e máscara, que ressalta seus olhos grandes. Os lábios serão muitas vezes mais discretos, possivelmente com um toque de gloss ou batom claro. 4. Joias: Para joias e acessórios, Misa gosta de usar colares, brincos e pulseiras que complementam seu estilo \\"Gothic Lolita\\". Ela é frequentemente vista com colares com crucifixos ou outros símbolos relacionados ao gótico. É importante notar que o estilo de Misa não é estático e varia de acordo com as circunstâncias e seu estado emocional ao longo da série. Quando está trabalhando como modelo ou ídolo, pode ser vista usando uma gama mais ampla de estilos e trajes que se alinham com as tendências da moda japonesa contemporânea. O estilo de Misa Amane é uma expressão de sua personalidade extravagante e atenciosa, e com isso, ela rapidamente se torna uma personagem memorável e distintiva dentro da narrativa de \\"Death Note\\"."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Alyssa Hirose December 8, 2022 Table of Contents What is visual content on social media The importance of visual content on social media 14 tips for creating visual content for social media 9 visual content examples from brands that get it right Much like the common crow is attracted to shiny things, social media users love some good visual content. Typically, our sense of sight is the first thing that’s engaged when experiencing a post on social media. And with so much content out there, it’s important for brands to stand out visually. Keep reading to find out how to create a smart visual content strategy for social media. Bonus: Get the always-up-to-date social media image size cheat sheet. The free resource includes recommended photo dimensions for every type of image on every major network. What is visual content on social media Visual content is any type of online content that is image-based. It’s content with a visual element — not just text-based, it’s a treat for the eyes, too. For example, a classic 280-character Tweet isn’t visual, but a Tweet with a photo attached is. Types of visual content Photos Videos Carousel posts (multiple photos or videos) GIFs Illustrations Infographics Animations Memes The importance of visual content on social media Videos and photos have proven to be more engaging than purely text-based posts across nearly all internet platforms. LinkedIn posts with images have a 98% higher comment rate on average, and tweets that include visual content are three times more likely to get engagement. On Instagram, carousel posts have the highest engagement rate. According to this 2022 Statista data, the average engagement rate for any post on an Instagram business page is 1.94%. But carousel posts have an engagement rate of 3.15% (what can we say, the people love to swipe left). It’s these kinds of stats that lead American marketers to say videos are most valuable for social media marketing. In a 2021 Statista survey, 54% of marketers said that videos are valuable for marketing goals on social media—it was the most common type of content named. And it’s not just marketers that are noticing the value of visual content. Consumers know they want to see content in the form of photos and videos. A 2021 Swedish study (also conducted by Statista) found that when it comes to brands using social media, 47% of adults like to see content in the form of images. 35% said they like to see brand content in video form.

Get 30 days for 0 14 tips for creating visual content for social media 1. Establish a colour palette for your brand Deciding (and sticking to) a certain colour palette or mood for your brand doesn’t just make your feed look beautiful: it also means your posts are instantly recognizable to your followers. Incorporate visual content into your social media style guide, and establish recognizable, eye-catching visual content from the start. For example, viral nail polish brand Pleasing has a very—well, pleasing colour palette. The company’s posts are bright, bold and unique: they stand out from the crowd. Source: Instagram 2. Choose eye-catching thumbnails for videos When you’re posting videos on social media, the thumbnail (or the “cover image” that the platform will use to display your content) will often automatically be the first frame of that video. But the first frame of your video might not be the most exciting—or representative—image. Manually choose a thumbnail when you’re posting videos (on IG Reels, TikTok, Youtube, etc.) and select an image that you think is most visually appealing, or communicates the most information. The thumbnail images for this bakery’s Instagram reels are super Insta-worthy, and they make the brand’s most iconic item (the cinnamon bun) the star of the show. Some of the thumbnails even include text that gives the viewer a sneak peek of what the reel is about—for example, “Peach cinnamon buns giveaway.” Source: Instagram 3. Incorporate text into your visual content… Even if you work in a primarily text-based industry, you can still use visual content in marketing. Magazines have really nailed this incorporation of text: the main goal is to showcase the story (text-based) but the publication will use visual means to promote said story. For example, this Teen Vogue story is mostly text, not images, but the article still appears on Teen Vogue’s Instagram in the form of a high-quality photo with text laid over it. This inclusion of text directly on the image makes the image’s purpose crystal clear, and it also makes the image very sharable (it can easily be added to followers’ IG stories). View this post on Instagram A post shared by Teen Vogue (@teenvogue) 4. …but don’t use too much text While text can be a great tool for communicating information, it’s not easy on the eyes. In fact, too much text can be visually overwhelming for viewers. Less is more when it comes to adding text to your visual content. This New York Times post is a fabulous example of careful text integration. The first image simply includes the story headline, and what follows is a mindful mix of visual content: there’s photos and videos, plus photos with snippets of text included. It’s an engaging, dynamic piece of visual content that inspires viewers to dig deeper (in this case, read the full story on the NYT website). Source: New York Times on Instagram 5. Use high-quality photos and videos Duh, right? Visual content is first and foremost visually engaging, so you’ll want to make sure that you’re not posting blurry infographics or out-of-focus photos (unless that’s part of your brand, of course). High-quality photos and videos are nice to look at, and they also help showcase your brand—and in some cases, the impact or effect of your brand. This high-quality photo post from Huda Beauty really shows off how well one of their mattifying products works. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Cheekbone Beauty Cosmetics INC (@cheekbonebeauty) If you don’t have the resources to take high-quality photos of your own, check out stock image websites and build visual content using your favourites. 6. Understand image copyright Sourcing relevant images isn’t always easy—especially when it comes to understanding copyright. But it’s important, especially since there are serious consequences for misuse. Read all the fine print when using stock photos, templates, and illustrations. If anything is unclear, inquire with the image owner or site for more detail. The same goes for licensing and contracting. When drawing up contracts with artists, it should be clear where you intend to use creative, who owns the rights to it, etc. When it’s called for (which is often), be sure to give credit where credit is due. That’s also true if you plan to repost or share user-generated content. Some companies, like Agoda, even use contract agreements in these contexts, too. Disney World’s official Instagram often posts user-generated content, with the original poster credited in the caption. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Walt Disney World (@waltdisneyworld) 7. Add your logo (where appropriate) If you plan your visuals to be shared, it may be a good idea to include a logo. Pinterest is a perfect example. Anything pinned has the potential of being repinned, and without a logo, it can be easy to forget where it came from. Plus, according to Pinterest, pins with subtle branding tend to perform better than those without. Ikea includes their logo in nearly all of their pins (many of which are reshared tens of thousands of times). https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/252834966572453484/ Good branding is noticeable but not obtrusive. Typically that means putting a small logo in a corner or the outer frame of the visual. If the colour of your logo clashes or makes the visual too busy, opt for a greyscale or neutral version. National Geographic’s logo is a good example of subtle branding–the yellow rectangle is present in almost all of their posts across all platforms. https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=681624516668315&set=pb.100044623170418.-2207520000.&type=3 8. Size images to spec One of the biggest crimes you can commit when sharing visuals on social media is using the wrong size. Images with the wrong aspect ratio or low resolutions can be stretched, cropped, and crunched out of proportion—all of which reflects poorly on your brand. Every platform has its own specifications and you should tailor your content accordingly. We’ve assembled a social media image size guide to help you. Always aim for the highest image quality. That includes pixels and resolution. And don’t ignore aspect ratio. Why? Some platforms auto-crop image previews based on aspect ratio. So if yours is different, you could end up with an unfortunate crop, or have important info left out. 9. Start videos with a hook When making Instagram Reels, TikToks and even video content for Facebook, Linkedin and Youtube, ensure that the first few seconds are engaging and entertaining (if they’re not, your audience will likely scroll on by). For examples of starting off visual content with a hook, look at culinary content creators—they’re excellent at drawing you in with the final product, so you’ll stay to learn the entire recipe. This tofu recipe starts with the creator drawing a knife across (impressively) crispy tofu, immediately piquing curiosity. The sound of the knife and the creator’s bold opening line (“I hate tofu”) only adds to the engaging visual. @fitgreenmind Yes, tofu can taste good! 🌱 #veganlunch #vegandinner #tofu #tofurecipe #easyrecipes ♬ Originalton – Maya Leinenbach 10. Take advantage of free tools and resources It’s almost always best to hire a photographer or graphic designer to do custom content creation for your brand. But if your budget is tight, or you’re in need of a few extra tools, there are countless resources available—and many of them are free. Here are some of the best design resources and tools: 38 resources for free stock photos 24 of the best Instagram apps for editing, design, and more 72 free and customizable Instagram Story templates 5 free and easy-to-use Lightroom Instagram presets 9 inclusive design tools and resources 5 free templates for Facebook cover photos 14 social media content creation tools Some social media management platforms have photo and video editing elements incorporated right into their dashboards… for example, Hootsuite has Canva. No more switching tabs, digging through your “Downloads” folder, and reuploading files — you can access Canva’s endless template library and create beautiful and effective visuals from start to finish without leaving Hootsuite Composer. To use Canva in Hootsuite: 1. Log in to your Hootsuite account and head to Composer. 2. Click on the purple Canva icon in the bottom right corner of the content editor. 3. Select the type of visual you want to create. You can pick a network-optimized size from the drop-down list or start a new custom design. 4. When you make your selection, a login pop-up window will open. Sign in using your Canva credentials or follow the prompts to start a new Canva account. (In case you were wondering — yes, this feature does work with free Canva accounts!) 5. Design your image in the Canva editor. 6. When you’re done editing, click Add to post in the top right corner. The image will automatically be uploaded to the social post you’re building in Composer. Learn more about using Canva in Hootsuite. 11. Include alt-text descriptions Not everyone experiences visual content the same way. When producing creative for social media, make it accessible for as many people and contexts as possible. Accessible content allows you to reach a broad audience and possibly edge out non-inclusive competitors in the process. More importantly, it helps you earn respect and loyalty from your followers (and followers-to-be). Accessible visual content on social media can include: Alt-text descriptions. Alt-text allows visually impaired people to better comprehend images. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram now provide fields for alt-text image descriptions. Here are some tips for writing descriptive alt-text, along with specific guides for Facebook alt text and Instagram alt text. Subtitles. All social videos should include captions. Not only are they crucial for hearing impaired viewers, they help in sound-off environments as well. Language learners also benefit from subtitles. Descriptive transcripts. Unlike captions, these transcripts describe the important sights and sounds that aren’t spoken or obvious. Descriptive audio and live described video are other options. While TikTok automatically shows the sound that each video uses, this content creator uses captions to show exactly which part of the song they are referencing—ensuring that everyone is in on the joke. @realchelseabearIf I had a dollar for every dirty look I’ve gotten 🤦🏻‍♀️ #CerebralPalsy #Disability♬ original sound – ⭐️Helene⭐️ 12. Pay attention to trends It’s important to stay up-to-date on what’s trending on every platform. This doesn’t just help you stay in touch with your audience; trends are a great source of inspiration if you find your creativity running dry. Trends aren’t just visual, of course, but some of them have a visual element that is instantly recognizable—for example, the Horace dancing trend on TikTok. @sarahdame91 Dc : horace 😍🥰 #dance ♬ Feel No Ways – Drake You can pick up on trends from simply scrolling through your socials, or check out one of the lists we’ve put together: 11 Important social media trends for 2023 12 Instagram trends to watch 14 TikTok trends to watch 10 Facebook trends to watch 13. Schedule your visual content You can craft the most engaging, thought-provoking, sharable visual content in the universe… but if people don’t actually see it, it won’t matter. Because of the sheer volume of social media users (globally, more than 4.62 billion people use social media), you’re always going to get at least a few viewers on your post—however, you can greatly increase your chances of your content taking off by posting when your audience is actually using the platform. We’ve rounded up the best times to post on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and Linkedin, so you can set yourself up for success. Set it and forget it (crock pot style) by using Hootsuite’s planner and scheduling tool to make sure your content goes live at the best time. Try for free 14. Be mindful of representation Do the people in your visuals reflect the diversity of your audience? Are you reinforcing gender or racial stereotypes with your images? Do you promote body positivity? These are a few of the questions you should be asking when making visual content for social media. Doing so is not just socially responsible, it’s smart. It’s much easier for someone to imagine themselves using a product or service if they see someone that looks like them doing it. Look at your audience analytics, or the demographics of your desired market, and factor them into your creative process. Representation should be about more than just optics. If you have the means to diversify your team, do it. Hire women, queer people and creators of color. Bring as many perspectives to the table as you can. At the very least, try to get feedback from as many voices as possible before sending your content off into the world. Lizzo’s brand Yitty is an excellent example—the brand’s visual content represents her target audience. https://www.facebook.com/YITTYofficial/posts/pfbid02LTXLbwazQCzv2cMwLwd7aNH8Mx5ZrzfLfQK6dojRh7h2v8jSYtqkTuHrjUmXKuNMl 9 visual content examples from brands that get it right 1. Formula Fig’s consistent colour palette Picking a colour palette and sticking to it pays off—just ask this skincare brand’s super-aesthetic feed that perfectly represents their visual identity.

JessaKae’s inclusive videos When it comes to representation in visuals, JessaKae nails it. Many of the brand’s videos showcase exactly how inclusive their sizing is, using models that are representative of their diverse consumer base. @jessakae One dress, 4 colors, available in 12 sizes.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Bailey Nelson Canada (@baileynelsonca) 6. Flax Home’s limited text Here’s another example of how limited text can be effective: Flax Home’s giveaway announcement. The majority of the information is in the post’s caption, leaving the visual itself very clean-looking. https://www.facebook.com/shopflaxhome/photos/1293150261443658 7. Sticky Lollies’ video hooks This candy company engages viewers from the start with visually-appealing clips in the first few seconds of every video. They also appeal to a sense of mystery—audiences will stick around to see what the final product is. @stickyaustralia Can you see our design? ♬ Under The Sea – The Main Street Band & Orchestra 8. Chanel’s creative carousels If you have an image that isn’t quite the right size for the platform, there’s creative ways to get around it. For example, you can rasterbate (cut up) the image and post it as a carousel, which results in the cool sliding experience below. View this post on Instagram A post shared by CHANEL (@chanelofficial) 9. Dylan Sprouse’s bizarre grid Want to see one of Dylan Sprouse’s old Instagram posts? Too bad, you can’t: the celeb has adopted a very strange visual branding on his IG profile by posting 8 doodled images that, when combined, look like a living room, leaving only one spot (the top left) for a photo… that’s where the TV screen is. So every time he posts a new photo, he deletes (or archives, it’s impossible to tell) the previous one.

I'm gonna make this in golang.","completion":"When dealing with a problem that involves interacting with multiple different websites, especially in various ways, it's crucial to approach the problem with modularity and scalability in mind. Designing your application to be flexible will save you a lot of time and complication down the road. Here's a suggested approach for structuring your Go application: 1. **Abstract Common Functionality**: Identify common patterns among the interactions with the websites. For instance, if several websites require a similar login procedure, you can abstract this into a generic 'login' function that takes parameters for the specific differences. 2. **Interface Definition**: Define interfaces for the operations you need to perform. This will allow you to have standardized method signatures that each website's interaction must implement. \`\`\`go type WebsiteInteraction interface { FetchData() (*SomeDataType, error) ProcessData(data *SomeDataType) (*ProcessedData, error) // ... } \`\`\` 3. **Individual Structs for Each Website**: Create a separate struct for each website that implements the above interface(s). This is where you'll handle the specific logic for each site. \`\`\`go type WebsiteA struct { //Site-specific fields } func (wa *WebsiteA) FetchData() (*SomeDataType, error) { //Site A fetching logic } func (wa *WebsiteA) ProcessData(data *SomeDataType) (*ProcessedData, error) { //Site A processing logic } // Repeat for each website... \`\`\` 4. **Browser Emulation**: For sites that require browser emulation, consider using a headless browser automation tool like \`chromedp\`, \`rod\`, or any other Go package suitable for browser automation. Abstract the browser emulation code similarly to how you handle the other requests. 5. **Configuration Management**: Use a config file or environment variables to store reusable values like URLs, login credentials, or API keys. Libraries like \`viper\` can make this easier to manage. 6. **Concurrent Processing**: Since network I/O is often the bottleneck in such applications, you may want to perform operations concurrently. Go's goroutines and channels offer an excellent way to handle concurrent processing and can significantly improve the performance of your application. 7. **Error Handling**: Design robust error handling. Since you're interacting with multiple websites, expect and handle errors gracefully. This could mean retries, fallbacks, or alerting when certain services are down. 8. **Modular Files and Directories**: For organization, each website's code can be placed in a separate file or even a separate directory if the code is extensive. For instance: \`\`\` /website_interactions /websitea websitea.go /websiteb websiteb.go //... interface.go \`\`\` 9. **Testing**: Write tests for each website's interaction logic. Since you're relying on external services, consider mocking the network responses for more reliable and faster tests. 10. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement good logging and monitoring practices to track the behavior of your system in production. By using this modular approach, it becomes easier to add or remove websites from your application without affecting others. This design will also help with maintainability and debugging since each website's code will be isolated. Remember to adhere to each individual website's terms of service and respect rate limits when scraping or interacting with them. Unethical or aggressive interactions can lead to your IP being blocked or legal action."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

With the right guidance, anyone can start producing captivating images automatically generated just for them.Table of content1Understanding the basics of AI-powered image generation2Explore CapCut magic tool to create images using AI3How to create images using AI with CapCut with ease4Advanced techniques and tips to create images using AI Understanding the basics of AI-powered image generationAt a fundamental level, AI image generators operate on the principles of neural networks, intricate algorithms inspired by the human brain. These networks undergo extensive training on vast databases containing both image and text data, enabling them to discern intricate visual patterns. Through the analysis of millions of image-text pairs, these models acquire the ability to associate words and phrases with corresponding visual concepts. When presented with a text description, these trained models can predict and synthesize a new image that aligns with the given description. This process allows for the manifestation of unique expressions of creativity within the boundaries defined by the algorithms' learned visualizations. Several pivotal factors contribute to the characteristics of the generated images. The first among them is the nature of the training data. Each model is trained on distinct datasets, leading to the development of varied artistic styles and areas of expertise. For example, DALL-E 2 tends to produce abstract and surreal images, while Midjourney leans towards a more photorealistic aesthetic. The specific type of images used for training further influences the model's specialty, encompassing landscapes, portraits, album art, and beyond. The formulation of the text prompt is another crucial aspect. The instructions provided in the text prompt guide the AI in generating the image. Using descriptive language, providing specifics, and incorporating example images for context generally results in more coherent and accurate outcomes. On the contrary, leaving details open-ended may yield less refined or coherent images. The art of constructing prompts involves mastering the phrasing and structure to effectively communicate the desired visual concept.Explore CapCut magic tool to create images using AIEmbark on a journey into the innovative realm of CapCut's magic tool, a cutting-edge feature designed to transform the landscape of image creation through the power of artificial intelligence.

Here are some pro tips:Crafting effective promptsThe text prompt provides the instruction set guiding the AI image generator. Carefully engineering descriptive prompts is key to producing desired results.Break down complex visual concepts into discrete attributes to be rendered sequentially. For example, first generate a background scene, then add subjects positioned appropriately. Combine elements once each component has been created satisfactorily.Describe the visual characteristics, style, lighting, tones, colors, perspective, and composition from multiple descriptive angles. For example, for an ocean sunset scene - crimson and tangerine hues blanket the evening sky as golden sunlight gently kisses and glistens along the water's surface.Use compare/contrast language to guide the image towards or away from certain stylistic references. Optimizing parametersDialing in the optimal parameters aligns output fidelity and creative flexibility to the use case. Adjust the \\"creativity level\\" slider depending on whether conceptual exploration or coherent realism is the goal. Levels near 100 invite new ideas while lower levels focus creativity. Increase image dimensions for printed output or social media purposes. Adjust aspect ratios like 16:9 or 9:16 to suit needs. Modify lighting warmth, hue saturation, value contrast for desired mood and palettes. Softer, darker tones or vibrant hues - flexibility is unlimited. Navigate the fidelity spectrum from line drawings to near-photorealism depending on requirements and creative vision.Strategic curation & further learningFavorite iterations with unique creative potential or exemplary results matching objective to revisit for future reference. Review results periodically to identify areas for refinement. Delete generations that clearly deviate from the prompt to declutter the iteration space. As the models rapidly advance, continuously experiment with new techniques to push creative boundaries further.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"do you think a paid temporary email service/api would sell? we could afford a lot more domains and servers, have a lot more features and higher limits. either way I'm probably doing it.","completion":"A paid temporary email service or API can be successful if it provides significant value over the free alternatives. Here are some factors that could influence its success: 1. **Privacy and Security**: If your service offers enhanced privacy and security features that are not available in free versions, customers might be willing to pay for it. For example, ensuring that emails are encrypted in transit and at rest could appeal to users who are handling sensitive information. 2. **Ad-Free Experience**: Many free temporary email services are supported by ads, which can be intrusive or unappealing to some users. A paid service with no ads can be an attractive feature. 3. **Extended Email Retention**: Free services often have very short retention times for emails. Offering customizable or extended retention periods could be a selling point. 4. **Higher Limits and Features**: If your service offers higher email volume limits, large attachment support, and additional features such as custom domain names, API access for developers, and advanced filtering/rules, that could attract a specific customer base that needs these capabilities. 5. **Customer Support**: Providing reliable customer support could attract businesses or more demanding customers who need assurance that they can get help when needed. 6. **Reliability and Uptime Guarantees**: If you can provide superior uptime and reliability over free services, users may see the value in paying for your service. 7. **Target Audience**: Identify who the potential customers for the paid service are. Businesses, developers, and power users who rely on temporary emails for testing or other specific uses may be willing to pay for a better service. 8. **Legality and Ethical Considerations**: Temporary email services are sometimes associated with bypassing system protections, avoiding spam, and other activities that could be viewed negatively. To sell such a service, it is important to establish clear terms of use and remain compliant with various legal requirements. 9. **Reputation and Brand**: Building a strong brand that signifies trust and quality could help differentiate your paid service from others. Before you proceed, conduct market research to determine whether there is enough demand for a paid product and what specific features or services your target customers require. It would help to create a business plan that outlines how you'd differentiate your service, what your revenue model would look like, and how you'd market the service to potential users. Remember, many users are accustomed to free temporary email services, so your challenge is to offer enough added value to justify the cost."},{"prompt":"no sending will be permitted, well maybe in the future but it will definitelly be on diffrent servers and domains and with spam preventions.","completion":"If your paid temporary email service is not initially permitting sending, you'll need to emphasize the other benefits to attract users. Here are some considerations and potential selling points for your service as a receive-only platform: 1. **Privacy and Anonymity**: Assurance that identities are protected and that using the service will not track users or store personal data any longer than necessary. 2. **Quality and Reliability**: A higher level of service reliability and stability, guaranteeing that users won't miss important emails due to server downtime, which can be a risk with free services. 3. **Extended Email Retention**: Even if users cannot send emails, they might appreciate longer retention times for receiving and accessing their messages. 4. **Custom Domain Options**: Allowing users to have email addresses with custom domains can be a distinguishing feature, which may be particularly of interest to professionals or businesses that require temporary email addresses for various purposes. 5. **Enhanced Features**: Additional functionalities such as email forwarding, integration with other services, advanced filtering, email notifications, and an easy-to-use API could add value over and above free services. 6. **No Ads**: An ad-free experience could be a strong incentive for users to pay, especially if they frequently use the service and prefer a clean and fast interface. 7. **High Limits**: Provide generous bandwidth and attachment size limits compared to free services to cater to users who need to receive larger or more frequent messages. 8. **API Access**: For developers or businesses that need to integrate temporary email functionality into their applications or workflows, providing a robust API could be very attractive. 9. **Spam Protection**: While sending won't be allowed initially, your service can still offer advanced spam filtering to ensure users receive only legitimate emails, which enhances the overall experience. 10. **Customer Support**: Offer high-quality customer support to address any issues promptly, which can be a major advantage over free services that may offer limited or no support. In terms of spam prevention for potential future sending features, you'll indeed want to take measures to prevent abuse. Implementing verification steps such as CAPTCHAs, limiting the number of emails each address can send, and monitoring for patterns that suggest spamming can help maintain the integrity of your service. Overall, communication of your service's benefits is key. Make sure to clearly convey the advantages your paid temporary email service offers to justify the expense. Strategic pricing, a clear positioning of your product, and a focus on customer satisfaction will be crucial in building a loyal user base who finds value in the premium service you offer."},{"prompt":"all emails will be encrypted once they reach us, our api will give the user the power to erase specific data from our systems, or delete their whole account.","completion":"The features you're planning to include—end-to-end encryption of emails and user control over their data—are very appealing and can certainly help in positioning your paid temporary email service competitively within the market. Here's how these features can benefit your service offering: 1. **End-to-End Encryption**: By ensuring that emails are encrypted from the moment they reach your servers, you provide peace of mind to users concerned about privacy. This heightened level of security can be a key selling point, especially for users who deal with sensitive or confidential information. 2. **User Control Over Data**: Allowing users to erase specific data or delete their entire account provides a level of transparency and control that can build trust. In the era of increased concern over digital privacy and data breaches, giving users this option can be a significant differentiator. 3. **Compliance with Privacy Regulations**: Offering such controls may also help you in complying with various global privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, which requires that businesses provide users with control over their personal data. 4. **Data Retention Policies**: Clearly state your data retention policies, and make sure they align with both user expectations and legal requirements. For example, you might set automatic data deletion after a certain period or upon user request. 5. **Marketing and Messaging**: Be sure to highlight these security and privacy features in your marketing efforts. Illustrate to potential users how these features set you apart from other temporary email services, especially those that are free and might not offer the same level of privacy. 6. **Additional Security Features**: You could consider adding even more security-related features, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) for account access, to further enhance your service's security posture. 7. **Transparency**: Regularly publish transparency reports to inform users about data requests or other privacy-related matters. This can further build trust in your brand. 8. **Ease of Use**: While having robust security features is crucial, you also need to ensure that your service remains user-friendly. The ability to easily delete data should be intuitive and straightforward, without compromising on security. 9. **Pricing Strategy**: Consider offering tiered pricing based on usage or additional features. This can attract a broader range of users, from those who need a simple temporary email service to businesses that require more extensive usage and additional functionalities. 10. **Customer Support**: Efficient and responsive customer care can support users as they navigate concerns about privacy and data management, thereby further instilling confidence in your service. Remember that while features and security are crucial, the long-term success of your service will depend on a combination of factors, including user experience, reliability, reputation, and the ability to communicate the value of your product to potential customers."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

The world of art, with its vast traditions, techniques, and emotions, is a realm that machines can mimic but never truly replicate. The genuine touch of an artist, the personal experiences that influence their work, and the years of honed skill and emotion they pour into each piece are unparalleled.My goal in creating this guide is to empower individuals and publishers who may be operating with limited resources. For small teams or independent creators, sometimes all that’s needed is a fitting visual accompaniment to elevate their written content or event page.In such scenarios, tools that generate images act as a bridge, offering a quick solution to a common challenge. Think of it as having a customizable stock image generator at your fingertips, allowing you to craft that ideal featured image for a blog post or event within minutes.It’s crucial to understand that while these tools offer convenience, they aren’t a replacement for the artistry and expertise that professionals bring to the table. Nobody should be under the illusion of receiving accolades or recognition for merely generating an image via these platforms.I view these generated images as a canvas for further enhancement. When paired with advanced editing tools like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Canva, and others, the possibilities are endless. For example, while DALL-E 3 is much better at generating specifics and even accurate text (occasionally), it doesn’t always get it right.In the example below, I took the image that DALL-E 3 generated, brought it into Adobe Photoshop, and replaced the garbled generated text with actual words and phrases.Left: DALL-E 3 generated image. Right: The final result after some editing in Adobe Photoshop.Ultimately, this guide should be seen as a stepping stone — a starting point to help you get beyond the blank canvas — aiming to introduce and inspire curious creatives to new tools that can broaden their horizons in the world of graphics and illustrations.More about this style galleryEach art style in this guide is accompanied by a description, providing insights into its essence and characteristics, and a series of useful keywords to augment your initial prompts. To aid users in creating visuals using DALL-E 3, specific prompts and keywords have been crafted for each style.You can access Midjourney through the Discord app (with a paid account), and you can access DALL-E via ChatGPT Plus (paid account) or for free at bing.com/create.When using this guide, it’s essential to approach it with an experimental mindset. DALL-E 3’s strength lies in its ability to interpret prompts in novel ways, so don’t hesitate to be creative with your inputs. Whether you’re looking to produce a traditional piece reminiscent of the Renaissance or dive into the pixelated realms of Digital Art, I hope this guide will be your compass, pointing you in the right direction on your creative journey.These prompts should serve as a starting point, and I encourage users to tweak them, add their personal touch, or even combine styles to produce unique and bespoke illustrations. I plan to continue adding examples, styles, and techniques to the guide as I come across them.⭐ Click here or click the image below to view the full gallery for free.Click the image to view the full gallery.⚡ Click here to view the gallery version and click here to view the spreadsheet version.A few tips + tricks to get the most out of DALL-E 3Use descriptive prompts: Be as detailed and descriptive as possible in your prompts. The more information you provide, the clearer the image DALL-E 3 can produce.Experiment with keywords: Try different combinations of keywords to see how slight variations can significantly change the output.Use specific numbers: If you want a certain number of objects in the image, specify that number in the prompt.Set the scene: Providing context or a setting can help DALL-E 3 understand the environment you want the main subject to be in.Try different styles: If you’re not satisfied with the initial result, consider specifying an art style or medium to guide the image generation.Take an iterative approach: Don’t hesitate to refine your prompts based on previous outputs. Iterative adjustments can lead to the perfect image.Limit ambiguity: While DALL-E 3 is great at interpreting prompts, overly ambiguous instructions might lead to unexpected results.Incorporate feedback: If you’re working on a project with others, gather feedback and incorporate it into revised prompts for better outcomes.Check recent updates: DALL-E 3, like many AI models, undergoes periodic updates and improvements. Stay updated with its capabilities.Use visual references: If possible, include references or examples in your prompts to give DALL-E 3 a clearer idea of what you’re aiming for.Explore chaos + randomness: Sometimes, allowing a bit of randomness can lead to surprising and delightful results. Don’t be afraid to let DALL-E 3 surprise you.Mind the resolution: Remember that DALL-E 3 has specific resolution capabilities. Ensure your prompts align with the resolution you desire.Stay updated with the OpenAI community: Join online forums or communities where users share their experiences, successes, and challenges with DALL-E 3. Learning from others can provide valuable insights.It’s obvious that the fusion of art and technology offers a vast landscape of possibilities. With tools like DALL-E 3, we have an opportunity to explore and create in ways that were once beyond reach.I hope this guide has provided a solid starting point of tips and information to help you navigate the world of DALL-E 3 more effectively.

These networks undergo extensive training on vast databases containing both image and text data, enabling them to discern intricate visual patterns. Through the analysis of millions of image-text pairs, these models acquire the ability to associate words and phrases with corresponding visual concepts. When presented with a text description, these trained models can predict and synthesize a new image that aligns with the given description. This process allows for the manifestation of unique expressions of creativity within the boundaries defined by the algorithms' learned visualizations. Several pivotal factors contribute to the characteristics of the generated images. The first among them is the nature of the training data. Each model is trained on distinct datasets, leading to the development of varied artistic styles and areas of expertise. For example, DALL-E 2 tends to produce abstract and surreal images, while Midjourney leans towards a more photorealistic aesthetic. The specific type of images used for training further influences the model's specialty, encompassing landscapes, portraits, album art, and beyond. The formulation of the text prompt is another crucial aspect. The instructions provided in the text prompt guide the AI in generating the image. Using descriptive language, providing specifics, and incorporating example images for context generally results in more coherent and accurate outcomes. On the contrary, leaving details open-ended may yield less refined or coherent images. The art of constructing prompts involves mastering the phrasing and structure to effectively communicate the desired visual concept.Explore CapCut magic tool to create images using AIEmbark on a journey into the innovative realm of CapCut's magic tool, a cutting-edge feature designed to transform the landscape of image creation through the power of artificial intelligence.

Here are some pro tips:Crafting effective promptsThe text prompt provides the instruction set guiding the AI image generator. Carefully engineering descriptive prompts is key to producing desired results.Break down complex visual concepts into discrete attributes to be rendered sequentially. For example, first generate a background scene, then add subjects positioned appropriately. Combine elements once each component has been created satisfactorily.Describe the visual characteristics, style, lighting, tones, colors, perspective, and composition from multiple descriptive angles. For example, for an ocean sunset scene - crimson and tangerine hues blanket the evening sky as golden sunlight gently kisses and glistens along the water's surface.Use compare/contrast language to guide the image towards or away from certain stylistic references. Optimizing parametersDialing in the optimal parameters aligns output fidelity and creative flexibility to the use case. Adjust the \\"creativity level\\" slider depending on whether conceptual exploration or coherent realism is the goal. Levels near 100 invite new ideas while lower levels focus creativity. Increase image dimensions for printed output or social media purposes. Adjust aspect ratios like 16:9 or 9:16 to suit needs. Modify lighting warmth, hue saturation, value contrast for desired mood and palettes. Softer, darker tones or vibrant hues - flexibility is unlimited. Navigate the fidelity spectrum from line drawings to near-photorealism depending on requirements and creative vision.Strategic curation & further learningFavorite iterations with unique creative potential or exemplary results matching objective to revisit for future reference. Review results periodically to identify areas for refinement. Delete generations that clearly deviate from the prompt to declutter the iteration space.

They help manage the behavior and presentation of web applications that have many moving parts and need to respond quickly to user input. Here's what frameworks like React do: 1. **User Interface Abstraction**: React, for instance, uses a component-based architecture. This allows developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state, which can then be composed to make complex UIs. React uses JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript, allowing you to write HTML-like code directly within your JavaScript. 2. **State Management**: React provides a way to manage the state of an application in a more predictable way. Each component has its own state, and when the state changes, React knows to re-render the component to reflect those changes. This leads to more predictable code that's easier to debug. 3. **Performance Optimization**: React implements a virtual DOM—a lightweight copy of the actual DOM—which allows it to efficiently update the browser's DOM. When a component's state changes, React first changes the virtual DOM, then compares it with the actual DOM and makes the minimal necessary changes, instead of re-rendering the entire DOM. This results in better performance for dynamic websites. 4. **Reusability**: Components are designed to be reusable, which means you can define a component once and reuse it throughout your application, even with different properties (props). This can greatly reduce the amount of code you have to write and maintain. 5. **Tooling & Ecosystem**: React has a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries that extend its capabilities. This includes state management libraries (such as Redux or MobX), routing solutions (like React Router), and many more. It also has a strong community and backing from Facebook, which continuously improves its features and addresses issues. 6. **Declarative Programming**: React embraces a declarative programming model where you tell it what you want to render (like the state of a UI) and it takes care of how to efficiently update the DOM to match that state. This is opposed to an imperative approach where you have to manually manage all the DOM changes, which is more error-prone and harder to manage for complex applications. 7. **Seamless Integration**: React can be used as the 'V' in MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, and it can be integrated with other frameworks or libraries like Angular or Vue for this purpose. This allows developers to incrementally adopt React or use it within existing applications. 8. **Design Consistency**: By encouraging the use of components, React allows development teams to maintain consistency in design throughout the application, which leads to a better user experience. In summary, React and similar JavaScript frameworks offer a modern approach to developing web applications with a focus on components, efficiency, state management, and ease of maintenance. Their widespread adoption speaks to their ability to facilitate the creation of complex, high-performance web applications."},{"prompt":"The manager said,\\" Bravo!

Its design principles merge the apex predatory aspects of deep-sea creatures with advanced stealth capabilities, making it as enigmatic as it is deadly. The Kraken's appearance is characterized by a dark, sleek fuselage that shimmers with a spectral iridescence due to its chromatic phase shift panels, providing camouflage in almost any terrain. The biomimetic frame is equipped with numerous cable-like tendrils that are as prehensile as they are powerful, capable of lashing out to strike or ensnaring enemies with ease. The exterior of the Kraken can morph slightly, adapting to environmental stimuli and giving it a fluid-like motion that's both hypnotic and horrifying. A signature feature of the Kraken is its faceplate, which evokes the image of a bioluminescent deep-sea leviathan. Behind the faceplate reside the intricate lattice of the advanced targeting systems and the wicked arc caster, ready to unleash jolts of devastating energy upon multiple foes simultaneously. The Kraken operates as a terror of the battlefield, emerging from the unseen reaches to deliver calculated strikes, drag mechs into its deadly grasp, and then vanish just as swiftly, leaving only destruction in its wake. Its modus operandi fits perfectly with the HORUS philosophy: control through chaos, dominance through fear, and victory through superior technology woven seamlessly with the savage wisdom of nature. **IFF-Avoidant Systems:** The Kraken is equipped with a HORUS standard IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) mask that obfuscates its presence from targeting systems, making it difficult for enemies to discern between ally and foe. This technological deception is a key asset to any pilot waging asymmetrical warfare. Pilots who resonate with the uncanny but calculated savagery of the Kraken know that underestimating their mech is as grave a mistake as ignoring the deepest trenches of the sea, for within those depths lies power untamed and unseen. They understand the art of ambush and the importance of the unseen killer in the shifting tides of war."},{"prompt":"Good work with designing these HORUS mechs. Demonstrate the capabilities of HORUS Kraken in the following scenario. “General… It’d seem like 3 intermediate Union operators (Player Characters) have decimated each of our allies… There seems to be a Priest-Class, a Tempest-Class, a Crusader-Class. Please, be fast… GLORY TO HORUS!” as I detonate my mech’s chassis, distracting the player characters. Context: you don’t have any surviving allies, you are to defeat the Player characters, the battleground is the rim around the summit of an active volcano.","completion":"As the General of the HORUS Kraken, I comprehend the gravity of the situation. Having received the desperate call and observed the destruction of the chassis, I swiftly spring into action. The battlefield around the summit of an active volcano offers precarious terrain and natural hazards that I can use to my advantage. **Phase 1: Ambush and Assess** Utilizing the Kraken's stealth capabilities, I would activate the Eelware Cloak and approach the area with caution. The chromatic phase shift panels on the Kraken's hull would blend into the rocky rim, while the Chameleon Field disrupts electronic detection, virtually erasing my mech from enemy sensors as I close in. The first objective is to gather information on the enemy's position and state. Using the Kraken's advanced sensor range and echolocation disruption, I would locate the three mechs: the Priest, Tempest, and Crusader. I would take note of their formation, any visible damage, and their attention directed towards the distraction caused by the detonated chassis. **Phase 2: Divide and Conquer** With exceptional sensor capabilities, my mech would deploy multiple Tendril Drones to initiate isolated skirmishes. These autonomous weapons would target the Tempest first, aiming to incapacitate its flight and maneuverability capabilities. The intent is not to destroy, but to disrupt and cause confusion, forcing the player characters to split their focus. **Phase 3: Control the Battlefield** I would launch Ink Cloud Mines near the players' location. The mines, upon detonation, would create areas of obscured vision, exploiting the Kraken's Echolocation Disruption trait to add further disorientation. In this state, the overwhelmed Tempest would become an easier prey. During the ensuing chaos, I would capitalize on natural hazards. Judicious placement of Subspace Rippers near the Crusader and Priest would manipulate the volcanic terrain to release pockets of superheated gas, creating additional environmental threats for my opponents to contend with. **Phase 4: Takedown** With the battlefield primed, the Kraken's true strength comes to bear. Emerging from the volcanic mists, the mech's serrated tentacles would lash out at the nearest opponent -- likely the Priest, due to its support capabilities. Simultaneously, the Kraken's primary and secondary weapons would engage the scattered enemies. The Arc Caster, with its arcing and seeking properties, would target the Crusader's heavier armor as it struggled to navigate the reduced visibility and terrain instability. Additionally, the Harpoon Fletchettes, with their smart, seeking attributes, would be unleashed upon the disoriented Tempest. **Phase 5: Apex Predator** Activating the Kraken Apex Predator Core, the mech would enhance its multi-target engagement protocol. Now in their midst and locked onto each enemy, ECCM (Electronic Counter-Countermeasures) and tactical analysis provide the Kraken with refined targeting solutions that ignore cover, granting bonus accuracy against grappled foes. As each enemy strives to break free or retaliate, the Kraken’s Deep Sea Predator trait allows for continuous close-range combat dominance, leveraging the volcanic rim's precarious topography to its full extent, potentially forcing the enemies towards unstable ground or into the threat of flowing lava. **Conclusion:** Engagement would be swift and brutal. The Kraken, designed for exactly these scenarios, would relentlessly exploit every opportunity and every piece of the environment. The art of the kill in this instance is predicated upon managing these many variables concurrently. By leveraging sensor superiority, manipulating the terrain, and sowing chaos among the ranks, the Kraken exerts control to tactically dissect the once-coordinated Union pilots, nullifying their advantage and ensuring GLORY TO HORUS."},{"prompt":"Expand on the licenses and systems of the HORUS Kraken.","completion":"======================================================= **HORUS KRAKEN LICENSING LEVELS AND SYSTEMS** ======================================================= **Level 1 License:** - **License Point (LP) Cost:** 1 LP - **Equipment Unlocked:** - **Neural Disruptor:** An auxiliary weapon that overloads the enemy's mech systems with a concussive blast of focused sonic energy. - **Kraken Lock Servos:** These enhanced limb servomechanisms grant increased precision and force to the Kraken's grappling abilities. - **Kraken Beta Frame:** Basic chassis with rudimentary biometallic frame, adaptive polymorphic skin, and standard tentacular weapon suite. **Level 2 License:** - **LP Cost:** 2 LP - **Equipment Unlocked:** - **Reactive Mirage Plating:** An upgrade for the polymorphic skin that dynamically responds to attacks, providing temporary invisibility when struck. - **Magnetic Ink Mines:** Enhanced mines that not only obscure vision but can also magnetically latch onto enemy mechs, hindering their movement. **Level 3 License:** - **LP Cost:** 3 LP - **Equipment Unlocked:** - **Abyssal Conversion Kit:** Upgrades the engine and sensors for deep pressure and extreme condition responses, perfect for adapting to hazardous environments. - **Kraken Gamma Frame:** Advanced chassis design with improved systems integration and full-spectrum stealth capabilities. **Further Equipment and Systems:** - **Eelware Cloak:** A sophisticated cloaking system that covers the Kraken with a thin layer of light-bending material, rendering it nearly invisible. - **Chameleon Field:** A passive system that scatters targeting arrays and hacks visual feeds, making the Kraken hard to lock onto. - **Disruptor Nanites:** Cloud of nanobots that can be deployed intercept and disable enemy electronics within a certain radius. - **Black Spot Datacore:** A data suite that marks a target, feeding predictive movement data to the Kraken, ensuring attacks almost always find their mark. - **Multiple Tendril Drones:** A series of autonomous drones that can grapple, strike, or interact with the environment, controlled by the Kraken's Tendril Response System. **Deployable Systems:** - **Echo-Vault:** A deployable system that records and plays back a loop of the last few seconds, creating confusing afterimages of the Kraken to disorient the enemy. - **Ink Cloud Mine:** These mines when detonated, release a dense ink cloud, reducing enemy visibility and aiding in stealth operations. - **Subspace Rippers:** Advanced deployable technology that tears small holes in reality, producing hazardous spatial fractures that can disrupt terrain and damage enemy mechs. **Tactics and Strategy:** The licensing and equipment available to the HORUS Kraken frame enhance its role on the battlefield as a stealthy ambush predator. Each tier of licensing focuses on augmentation of the mechanized biometallic chassis, granting pilots superior offense and defensive capabilities while maintaining the Kraken's core concept of strike-and-disappear tactics. In conjunction with superior technology, these advancements further aid pilots in sustaining control over the chaos of the battlefield.

Activating the Kraken's stealth systems, the Eelware Cloak shrouds my advance as I infiltrate the derelict battleship's complex structure, using its labyrinthine corridors and verticality to my advantage. **Phase 1: Isolate and Sabotage** With the enemy's attention drawn to the explosion of an ally’s chassis, I station the Kraken within the battleship's shadowed recesses. Using enhanced sensors, I pinpoint the positions of the Priest, Tempest, and Crusader, analysing their formation and capabilities. - **Priest-Class:** Prioritizing the support capabilities of the Priest, I deploy Disruptor Nanites to interfere with its systems. The intent is to sever the lifeline to its compatriots, impairing its repairs and buffs. - **Tempest-Class:** Recognizing its aerial threat, I look for narrow or enclosed spaces within the ship to limit its maneuverability. Planting Magnetic Ink Mines in strategic chokepoints negates its advantage by restricting its range of movement. - **Crusader-Class:** With heavier armor and possible close combat threat, I target the Crusader with Black Spot Datacore designation, allowing for precise attacks that predict and penetrate defenses. **Phase 2: Environmental Control** Utilizing the Kraken’s intimate knowledge of ship architecture, I exploit the derelict's inherent dangers. Emitted from the Multiple Tendril Drones, a volley of Subspace Rippers is used to destabilize walls and ceilings—creating deadly hazards from falling debris. **Phase 3: Direct Confrontation** From my hidden position, the first assault targets the now-isolated Priest. Using the tentacles to grapple and the serrated edges for damage, I aim to neutralize its technological edge and dismantle it quickly before it can offer substantial aid to its allies. Simultaneously, the Arc Caster and Harpoon Fletchettes fire through the cramped ship corridors, exploiting the Kraken's sensor range to lock onto the Tempest and the Crusader. Anticipating the Tempest's evasion, shots are angled to ricochet and zone the aerial mech into the path of previously laid mines. **Phase 4: Utilize CORE System** As combat escalates, I deploy the Predatory Adaptation Matrix— now each attack ensures that none can hide, even amidst the battleship’s complex interior. The magnetic properties in the ship’s materials work against the Crusader as it struggles against the pull of my magnetic mines. The Tempest, attempting to lift off, is tethered back to the ground by the engaging Kraken drones. Engaging the Echolocation Disruption trait, I ensure their targeting systems are compromised, before unleashing the Kraken's full onslaught. **Conclusion:** In the depths of the battleship, the Kraken becomes a living nightmare—striking from shadows, leading the Union pilots through a gauntlet of psychological warfare and ever-present danger. The ship becomes more than a mere battleground; it is an extension of the Kraken, a deadly terrain manipulated by each move I make. Moving swiftly from deck to deck, exploiting every opportunity, the Kraken’s combination of biotechnological prowess and HORUS's technological supremacy achieves the unthinkable—turning a dire situation into a calculated hunt where the Union operators become prey, their lives extinguished one by one in the Alien dark of forgotten war corridors. \\"GLORY TO HORUS!\\" is not just a call—it is the declaration of the inevitable outcome as the Kraken prevails."},{"prompt":"Generate a comprehensive Comp/Con page for a HORUS mech, that is used for the Lancer TTRPG.

For the rest of the scene: - Surrounding area within range 5 becomes difficult and hazardous terrain, applying Burn to any units ending their turn in it. - The Cherufe gains resistance to Burn and Explosive damage. - Any mech that begins its turn within range 5 of the Cherufe must pass an agility save or become Immobilized until the end of their turn due to hardened magma encasing their legs. ================================================= **Overview Description and Appearance:** ================================================= The HORUS Cherufe mech takes inspiration from volcanic forces, combining HORUS's cutting-edge technology with the primeval power of Earth's molten core. As a heavy assault frame, the Cherufe stands taller and bulkier than many of its counterparts, its silhouette reminiscent of a walking volcano, with jagged formations and rough plating that evoke the rocky surface of cooled lava flows. The reinforced ignition plating boasts a heat-resistant scorched metal exterior with patches of vibrant lava camouflage, designed to withstand and operate amidst extreme temperatures. The frame’s appearance is both intimidating and practical, reflecting its role on the battlefield as an instrument of controlled devastation. *IFF-Avoidant Systems:* The Cherufe employs the Incandescent Haze—a specialized IFF jamming system that cloaks its presence from enemy tracking when amidst flames and heat distortions, capitalizing on its fiery habitat. In the hands of a skilled pilot, the HORUS Cherufe transforms any battleground into a fiery hellscape, dictating the terms of engagement with its pyrokinetic dominion. It engulfs enemy positions in conflagrations, disrupting formations and forcing adversaries to reconsider their strategies or face incineration."},{"prompt":"Generate a comprehensive Comp/Con page for two generic enemy NPC mech units, that is used for the Lancer TTRPG.

It was created by John Resig and released in 2006. The library provides a wide range of functionalities, including DOM manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax requests, all through an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. The main features of jQuery.js include: 1. DOM Manipulation: Easily select and manipulate elements within the Document Object Model (DOM). 2. Event Handling: Assign event handlers to your elements with a simple, consistent interface. 3. CSS Manipulation: Apply styles to elements dynamically and manage classes. 4. Effects and Animations: Add visual effects such as fades, slides, and custom animations. 5. Ajax: Facilitate asynchronous HTTP requests for loading data without refreshing the page. 6. Utilities: Use utility functions for tasks like browser feature detection and array manipulation. 7. Plugins: Extend jQuery's capabilities with thousands of available plugins. The jQuery library is known for its ease of use and concise syntax, which often leads to less code compared to raw JavaScript. Here is an example of how you might use jQuery to hide an element with the ID of \\"myElement\\": \`\`\`javascript ('#myElement').hide(); \`\`\` In contrast, to achieve the same effect without jQuery, you would write something like this: \`\`\`javascript document.getElementById('myElement').style.display = 'none'; \`\`\` The jQuery.js library can be included in a web page by linking to a CDN (Content Delivery Network) or by downloading the file and hosting it locally. It comes in two versions: - The production version, which is minified and compressed for performance. - The development version, which is not minified and is easier to read and debug. Despite its popularity, in modern web development, the need for jQuery has declined somewhat due to significant improvements in native JavaScript (ECMAScript) and widespread adoption of frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js. These newer tools often incorporate similar features to jQuery while offering more capabilities for building complex applications. Nonetheless, jQuery remains a viable and useful library for many projects, especially those that have to maintain legacy code or don't require the overhead of more complex frameworks."},{"prompt":"Je suis en terminale sti2d j’aimerais étudier à lepfl l’année prochaine je ne possède pas la nationalité suisse quels sont les possibilité ?

Dans le cas contraire, l’admission se fait sur dossier, au cas par cas, en fonction de la formation suivie, des options choisies et des résultats obtenus. La réussite de crédits ECTS complémentaires (jusqu’à 60) peut en outre être exigée pour l’admission au Master. 2.6. Je n’ai pas la possibilité de faire un Bachelor. D’autres formations universitaires étrangères permettent-elles de demander l’admission au Master à l’EPFL ? Toute formation universitaire d’une durée minimale de trois à quatre ans est considérée équivalente à un Bachelor et permet donc également de demander l’admission au Master à l’EPFL. Il en va de même pour les candidats ayant réussi au moins trois ans d’une formation universitaire d’une durée minimale de plus de quatre ans, même s’ils n’obtiennent pas de titre à ce stade de leur formation. 2.7. Je n’ai pas la possibilité de faire une formation universitaire en trois ans ou plus. D’autres formations permettent-elles de demander l’admission au Master à l’EPFL ? Non. Les formations universitaires d’une durée minimale de moins de trois ans ne permettent pas de demander l’admission au Master à l’EPFL (la durée minimale de tout Bachelor suisse est de trois ans). De plus, les formations non universitaires ne permettent pas de demander l’admission au Master à l’EPFL, quelle que soit leur durée. Ceci vaut également pour des formations universitaires effectuées dans des domaines d’études qui ne sont pas universitaires en Suisse (le catalogue des formations sur le site studyprogrammes.ch permet de se faire une idée des domaines d’études qui relèvent des HEU en Suisse) et/ou dans des institutions qui ne bénéficient d’aucune accréditation étatique. 2.8. Si je suis admis au Master à l’EPFL cette année et que je renonce à m’y inscrire, mon admission reste-t-elle valable pour les années à venir ? Non. L’admission est prononcée pour l’année en cours uniquement. Une nouvelle candidature doit être déposée pour débuter ses études à l’EPFL ultérieurement. Si les exigences ont évolué, les nouvelles exigences s’appliquent. 2.9. Je suis admis au Master dans une autre HEU suisse sur la base de mon Bachelor (ou autre formation équivalente). Est-ce que cela signifie que je serai forcément admis à l’EPFL dans la même branche d’études ? Non. Chaque HEU suisse applique ses exigences propres pour l’admission au Master, y compris dans une même branche d’études. Le fait d’être admis dans une autre HEU suisse (ETH Zürich comprise) ne garantit pas que vous remplissez les exigences pour une admission à l’EPFL, et vice-versa. 3. Bachelor 3.1. Comment puis-je obtenir une maturité gymnasiale suisse ? 3.2. Je n’ai pas la possibilité de faire une maturité gymnasiale suisse.

Quels autres certificats d’études permettent d’être admis dans un programme de Bachelor de l’EPFL ? 3.6. Je ne remplis pas exactement les exigences en termes d’options choisies et/ou de résultats obtenus dans mon certificat d’études étranger ou mon IB. Ai-je tout de même une chance d’être admis après étude de mon dossier par l’EPFL ? 3.7. Je remplis exactement les exigences en termes d’options choisies et de résultats obtenus dans mon certificat d’études étranger ou mon IB. Ai-je tout de même un risque de ne pas être admis après étude de mon dossier ? 3.8. Aucune moyenne générale ne figure sur le bulletin final de mon certificat d’études. Comment mes résultats seront-ils évalués par l’EPFL ? 3.9. J’ai effectué ma formation secondaire supérieure dans deux systèmes éducatifs différents (consécutivement ou simultanément). Comment ma candidature sera-t-elle évaluée au regard des exigences pour l’admission ? 3.10. Je vais obtenir mon certificat d’études étranger ou mon IB dans une année ou plus. Le maintien des conditions d’admission actuelles est-il garanti pour les années à venir ? 3.11. Je n’ai pas la possibilité de faire un certificat d’études national ou un IB, ou je ne remplis pas les exigences pour une admission au Bachelor ou au CMS, ou j’ai échoué le CMS. Existe-t-il un examen d’admission pour être tout de même admis au Bachelor à l’EPFL ? 3.12. J’ai un certificat d’études privé autre que l’IB. Puis-je tout de même être admis au Bachelor ou au CMS à l’EPFL ? 3.13. J’ai réussi l’examen d’admission de l’ETH Zürich. Puis-je être admis à l’EPFL sur cette base ? 3.14. J’ai réussi l’examen complémentaire des universités suisses (ECUS) ou l’examen d’admission d’une HEU suisse autre que l’ETH Zürich. Puis-je être admis à l’EPFL sur cette base ? 3.15. Si je suis admis au Bachelor ou au CMS à l’EPFL cette année et que je renonce à m’y inscrire, mon admission reste-t-elle valable pour les années à venir ? 3.16. Je suis admis au Bachelor dans une autre HEU suisse sur la base de mon certificat d’études. Est-ce que cela signifie que je serai forcément admis à l’EPFL ? 3.17. J’ai déjà commencé des études universitaires dans une autre école suisse ou étrangère. Puis-je tout de même être admis au Bachelor ou au CMS à l’EPFL ? 3.1. Comment puis-je obtenir une maturité gymnasiale suisse ? La maturité gymnasiale est délivrée par les cantons suisses au terme de la formation secondaire supérieure pré-universitaire (réussite basée sur le contrôle continu et les examens). Il est également possible d’obtenir une maturité gymnasiale de la Commission suisse de maturité (« maturité fédérale »), comme candidat libre ou après une formation dans une école privée reconnue (réussite basée sur les examens uniquement). Les écoles qui préparent spécifiquement à la maturité gymnasiale suisse à l’étranger sont rares. Il est fortement déconseillé de se présenter aux examens de la Commission suisse de maturité avec une formation secondaire supérieure suivie dans un autre système éducatif comme seule préparation. 3.2. Je n’ai pas la possibilité de faire une maturité gymnasiale suisse. Quelle est la meilleure alternative pour être admis dans un programme de Bachelor à l’EPFL ? Les maturités professionnelle et spécialisée suisses donnent accès sans condition mais dans la limite des places disponibles au Cours de mathématiques spéciales (CMS) à l’EPFL. La réussite de ce cours préparatoire scientifique d’une année donne accès sans condition et sans limite de places à tout Bachelor de l’EPFL. En cas d’échec au CMS, il n’est pas possible de le répéter. 3.3. J’ai complété ma maturité professionnelle ou spécialisée suisse par l’examen de passerelle vers les HEU et hautes écoles pédagogiques (HEP) suisses (anciennement « passerelle DUBS »). Comment ma candidature sera-t-elle traitée ? Une maturité professionnelle ou spécialisée complétée par l’examen de passerelle est équivalente à une maturité gymnasiale. Elle donne donc accès à tout Bachelor de l’EPFL sans condition ni limite de places. La réussite du CMS n’est pas requise. Le CMS constitue cependant une préparation plus ciblée aux formations de l’EPFL que la passerelle. L’examen de passerelle est proposé par la Commission suisse de maturité. Le CMS est proposé par l’EPFL. 3.4. Je vais obtenir ma maturité professionnelle ou spécialisée suisse dans une année ou plus. Le maintien des conditions d’admission actuelles est-il garanti pour les années à venir ? En principe, oui. En ce qui concerne le CMS, son existence découle de la seule volonté de l’EPFL de proposer cette option aux titulaires de telles maturités suisses. Le droit suisse le permet mais ne le prévoit pas explicitement. 3.5. Je n’ai pas la possibilité de faire une maturité suisse. Quels autres certificats d’études permettent d’être admis dans un programme de Bachelor de l’EPFL ? Un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures pré-universitaires délivré par un pays membre de l’UE, de l’AELE ou du Royaume-Uni donne accès sans limite de places à tout Bachelor de l’EPFL, à condition de remplir certaines exigences, notamment en termes d’options choisies et de résultats obtenus. Le détail de ces exigences figure sur le site web de l’EPFL, et leur application par pays figure sur le site web de swissuniversities. Un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures pré-universitaires délivré par un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni donne accès dans la limite des places disponibles au CMS, à condition de remplir certaines exigences, notamment en termes d’options choisies et de résultats obtenus. Le détail de ces exigences et leur application par pays figurent sur le site web de l’EPFL. Le Baccalauréat international ou International Baccalaureate (IB) de l’IBO donne accès sans limite de places à tout Bachelor de l’EPFL, ou dans la limite des places disponibles au CMS, à condition de remplir certaines exigences, notamment en termes d’options choisies et de résultats obtenus. Le détail de ces exigences figure sur le site web de l’EPFL, ainsi que sur le site web de swissuniversities. 3.6. Je ne remplis pas exactement les exigences en termes d’options choisies et/ou de résultats obtenus dans mon certificat d’études étranger ou mon IB. Ai-je tout de même une chance d’être admis après étude de mon dossier par l’EPFL ? Non. Seuls les candidats qui remplissent toutes les exigences peuvent être admis. Il n’y a pas d’admission sur dossier au Bachelor. D’excellents résultats ne sauraient p. ex. pas compenser une lacune dans les options choisies. Les options exigées sont déterminées dans un but d’équivalence avec le caractère généraliste de la maturité gymnasiale suisse, ainsi que pour garantir une bonne préparation au Bachelor à l’EPFL, en particulier en mathématiques et en physique, qui sont des fondements importants de toutes les formations à l’EPFL. 3.7. Je remplis exactement les exigences en termes d’options choisies et de résultats obtenus dans mon certificat d’études étranger ou mon IB. Ai-je tout de même un risque de ne pas être admis après étude de mon dossier ? Pour l’admission au Bachelor, en principe, non. Il n’y a actuellement pas de limite de places au Bachelor à l’EPFL. Pour l’admission au CMS, oui. Les places étant limitées, une sélection est effectuée si le nombre de candidatures reçue dépasse le nombre de places disponibles, ce qui est fréquent. Le cas échéant, la sélection est effectuée sur la base des branches étudiées et des résultats obtenus dans le certificat d’études. 3.8. Aucune moyenne générale ne figure sur le bulletin final de mon certificat d’études. Comment mes résultats seront-ils évalués par l’EPFL ? L’EPFL calculera la moyenne de toutes les notes présentes sur ce bulletin. Cette moyenne sera ensuite évaluée selon les exigences actuelles pour l’admission à l’EPFL. Si les notes sont données sous forme d’appréciations non numériques, le barème du pays ayant délivré le certificat sera utilisé pour les convertir en valeurs et pouvoir ainsi calculer une moyenne. 3.9. J’ai effectué ma formation secondaire supérieure dans deux systèmes éducatifs différents (consécutivement ou simultanément). Comment ma candidature sera-t-elle évaluée au regard des exigences pour l’admission ? Les exigences doivent être remplies dans leur intégralité dans au moins un des deux systèmes éducatifs. Les acquis d’un système ne peuvent être pris en compte dans l’autre système que s’ils font l’objet d’une reconnaissance formelle dans ce système (ils figurent sur les documents officiels de ce système au même titre que les acquis de ce système). Il n’est pas possible de remplir les exigences par cumul d’acquis obtenus dans deux systèmes différents. 3.10. Je vais obtenir mon certificat d’études étranger ou mon IB dans une année ou plus. Le maintien des conditions d’admission actuelles est-il garanti pour les années à venir ? Non. Il n’y a pas de garantie d’admission selon les mêmes exigences pour les années à venir. Cette situation découle d’accords internationaux, du droit suisse, des critères d’équivalence avec la maturité gymnasiale suisse recommandés par swissuniversities et de leur application par l’EPFL. En outre, chaque évolution d’un système éducatif étranger ou de l’IB peut conduire à une réévaluation des exigences pour le certificat correspondant, même si les exigences générales pour l’admission à l’EPFL restent par ailleurs inchangées. Une évolution des exigences et/ou de leur application par pays est dès lors possible d’année en année. Les exigences sont mises à jour sur les sites web au plus tard en janvier pour la rentrée de septembre de la même année civile. Le droit suisse autorise en outre les EPF à limiter le nombre de places disponibles au Bachelor pour les candidats titulaires de tels certificats. Il n’est cependant actuellement pas prévu d’activer cette limitation à l’EPFL. 3.11. Je n’ai pas la possibilité de faire un certificat d’études national ou un IB, ou je ne remplis pas les exigences pour une admission au Bachelor ou au CMS, ou j’ai échoué le CMS. Existe-t-il un examen d’admission pour être tout de même admis au Bachelor à l’EPFL ? Oui. L’EPFL propose un examen d’admission pour tout candidat qui ne remplit pas les exigences pour une admission au Bachelor ou au CMS. Sa réussite donne accès sans condition ni limite de places à tout Bachelor de l’EPFL. Il est constitué d’une partie scientifique, ainsi que d’une partie de culture générale dont le candidat peut être dispensé s’il a déjà réussi une formation secondaire supérieure équivalente. Il est fortement déconseillé de se présenter à l’examen d’admission avec une formation secondaire supérieure comme seule préparation. En cas d’échec, il est possible de se présenter une seconde fois à l’examen d’admission. Un échec au CMS compte comme une tentative de réussir l’examen d’admission. 3.12. J’ai un certificat d’études privé autre que l’IB. Puis-je tout de même être admis au Bachelor ou au CMS à l’EPFL ? Les certificats d’études privés autres que l’IB, comme p. ex. les International Advanced Levels ou les Pre-U, ne permettent un accès à l’EPFL que par le biais de l’examen d’admission. 3.13. J’ai réussi l’examen d’admission de l’ETH Zürich. Puis-je être admis à l’EPFL sur cette base ? Oui, si vous avez passé l’examen complet. Si vous n’avez passé qu’un examen partiel, l’EPFL devra déterminer si votre formation secondaire supérieure est équivalente aux branches dispensées, car les critères de l’EPFL diffèrent de ceux de l’ETH Zürich à ce sujet. L’inverse est également vrai pour une admission à l’ETH Zürich sur la base de l’examen d’admission de l’EPFL. Une réussite au CMS compte comme une réussite à la partie scientifique de l’examen d’admission de l’EPFL. 3.14. J’ai réussi l’examen complémentaire des universités suisses (ECUS) ou l’examen d’admission d’une HEU suisse autre que l’ETH Zürich. Puis-je être admis à l’EPFL sur cette base ? Non. Ces examens ne donnent pas accès aux EPF suisses (EPFL et ETH Zürich). 3.15. Si je suis admis au Bachelor ou au CMS à l’EPFL cette année et que je renonce à m’y inscrire, mon admission reste-t-elle valable pour les années à venir ? Non. L’admission est prononcée pour l’année en cours uniquement. Une nouvelle candidature doit être déposée pour débuter ses études à l’EPFL ultérieurement. Si les exigences ont évolué, les nouvelles exigences s’appliquent. La réussite du CMS, de l’examen d’admission de l’EPFL ou de celui de l’ETH Zürich reste en revanche acquise pour une éventuelle admission ultérieure au Bachelor à l’EPFL. 3.16. Je suis admis au Bachelor dans une autre HEU suisse sur la base de mon certificat d’études. Est-ce que cela signifie que je serai forcément admis à l’EPFL ? Non. Il existe des recommandations communes, mais chaque HEU suisse applique ses exigences propres pour l’admission au Bachelor. Le fait d’être admis dans une autre HEU suisse (ETH Zürich comprise) ne garantit pas que vous remplirez les exigences pour une admission à l’EPFL, et vice-versa. 3.17. J’ai déjà commencé des études universitaires dans une autre école suisse ou étrangère. Puis-je tout de même être admis au Bachelor ou au CMS à l’EPFL ? Cela dépend de la ou des formation(s) suivie(s) et de leur réussite, abandon ou échec. Il existe en outre une limite d’âge pour l’admission au CMS. Les règles sont précisées sur le site de l’EPFL. Voici les condition d’admission bachelor cms : Conditions d’admission & inscription Bachelor/CMS En plus de cette page, merci de consulter les rubriques « Général » et « Bachelor » de nos questions fréquentes pour obtenir toutes les informations au sujet de nos conditions et processus d’admission. Suite à l’entrée en vigueur de la dernière mise à jour de l’Ordonnance sur l’admission à l’EPFL et en vue de l’entrée en vigueur de la dernière mise à jour de l’Ordonnance sur la reconnaissance des certificats de maturité gymnasiale, les conditions d’admission pour les certificats d’études étatiques étrangers et privés ont évolué significativement. Merci de prendre attentivement connaissance des nouvelles conditions décrites sur cette page. Inscription Vous êtes au clair sur les conditions d’admission et désirez vous inscrire ? Consultez le détail de la procédure d’inscription : Informations sur la procédure d’inscription Conditions d’admission Les indications exposées sur cette page ne peuvent fonder un droit. Seuls les textes légaux font foi. Les conditions sont valables pour l’année en cours. Les conditions d’admission spécifiques pour les candidats titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures (maturité, baccalauréat, Abitur, Advanced Levels, etc.) et pour ceux ayant entamé ou terminé un cursus dans une haute école sont détaillées dans les sections suivantes. Veuillez également tenir compte des restrictions détaillées plus bas. Maturités gymnasiales suisses Maturités professionnelles ou spécialisées suisses Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures du Royaume-Uni Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays hors UE, AELE et Royaume-Uni Baccalauréat européen de l’EURSC.eu Baccalauréat international (IB) de l’IBO.org Bachelor d’une HES suisse Autres hautes études en Suisse ou à l’étranger Restrictions et règles de non-admissibilité Maturités gymnasiales suisses Les candidats titulaires d’une maturité gymnasiale suisse (certificat cantonal reconnu par la Confédération ou certificat fédéral) sont admis à l’EPFL sans aucune autre condition en première année du programme de Bachelor de leur choix. Ils peuvent en outre demander à être admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, à titre facultatif, dans la limite des places disponibles (selon la procédure ci-dessous). Ils sont dans ce cas soumis aux règles usuelles pour la réussite de ce cours, mais restent admissibles en première année du programme de Bachelor de leur choix en cas d’échec à ce cours. Une seconde tentative au Cours de mathématiques spéciales n’est en revanche pas possible. Pour être admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, les candidats doivent remplir le formulaire de candidature à l’admission au Bachelor, selon le délai usuel. Ils recevront début juin un e-mail leur donnant accès à un test d’auto-évaluation en mathématiques ainsi qu’à un formulaire leur permettant de demander leur admission au Cours de mathématiques spéciales dans un délai de trois semaines environ (aucune demande ne pourra être acceptée après ce délai). Une réponse leur parviendra ensuite courant juillet. Maturités professionnelles ou spécialisées suisses Les candidats titulaires d’une maturité professionnelle suisse ou d’une maturité spécialisée suisse sont admis au Cours de mathématiques spéciales, dans la limite des places disponibles. Les candidats qui ont en outre réussi l’examen complémentaire (« passerelle DUBS ») sont assimilés aux candidats titulaires d’une maturité gymnasiale suisse (voir plus haut). Certificats d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE Les candidats titulaires d’un certificat d’études secondaires supérieures d’un pays membre de l’UE ou de l’AELE (autre que la Suisse) sont admis en première année du Bachelor si leur titre remplit toutes les conditions suivantes : le certificat est un titre pré-universitaire sanctionnant une formation générale le certificat est délivré après au moins douze années de formation primaire et secondaire (sans les classes enfantines) dont au moins trois années de formation secondaire supérieure les branches suivantes ont été étudiées durant la formation secondaire supérieure : 1) mathématiques, 2) physique, 3) langue officielle du pays délivrant le certificat, 4) seconde langue moderne, 5) chimie ou biologie, 6) histoire, géographie ou économie et 7) mathématiques appliquées, informatique, philosophie ou troisième langue moderne au moins six de ces sept branches figurent sur le bulletin de notes final déterminant pour l’obtention du certificat, dont les mathématiques et la physique les mathématiques et la physique ont été étudiées et examinées au plus haut niveau possible (voir ci-dessous) et le certificat est d’orientation scientifique (si des orientations sont proposées dans le pays délivrant le certificat) les notes finales de mathématiques et de physique sont égales ou supérieures à 80% de la note maximale la moyenne générale est égale ou supérieure à 80% de la note maximale Par « plus haut niveau possible », il est entendu que les nombres d’années et d’heures d’étude de cette matière sont les plus élevés possibles dans le pays de formation et, lorsque c’est possible, que la matière a fait l’objet d’une épreuve lors des examens finaux. Les options complémentaires de type « mathématiques expertes » ou « mathématiques approfondies » ne sont en revanche pas requises. Une branche qui combine deux disciplines sous un libellé unique et avec une moyenne unique sur les relevés de notes ne peut pas servir à valider deux exigences séparées (p. ex. physique-chimie ne peut pas satisfaire à la fois l’exigence en physique et celle en chimie). Les branches d’histoire, de géographie et de philosophie non générales ne sont en outre pas prises en compte, de même que l’informatique de gestion ou de bureau. Les statistiques, la géométrie descriptive, la visualisation des données, la finance quantitative et la cryptologie sont considérées comme des mathématiques appliquées. Dans certains cas, la page dédiée à votre pays de formation (section « EPFL ») dans la rubrique « Pays » du site de swissuniversities fournit des précisions quant à l’application des règles ci-dessus, à titre indicatif. Ce site n’est mis à jour qu’une fois par année en janvier et les conditions peuvent donc ne pas être à jour lors de l’ouverture de notre formulaire de candidature en novembre. L’EPFL estime qu’un niveau B2 en français (selon le Cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues) est requis pour pouvoir suivre ses formations de Bachelor. Un niveau C1 est fortement conseillé. Les candidats étrangers qui n’ont pas étudié le français durant leur formation secondaire supérieure devront pouvoir attester leur niveau de compétence lors de leur candidature. Les candidats qui résident et étudient en Suisse pour un motif professionnel (travail en Suisse ou résidence avec leurs parents, qui travaillent en Suisse) au moment de leur formation secondaire supérieure sont admis en première année du Bachelor avec une moyenne générale égale ou supérieure à 70% de la note maximale. Toutes les autres conditions restent inchangées et doivent être remplies. Les candidats suisses de l’étranger peuvent être admis, sur dossier et dans la limite des places disponibles, au Cours de mathématiques spéciales (année préparatoire) avec une moyenne générale un peu inférieure à 80% de la note maximale.","completion":"En tant qu'étudiant en terminale STI2D (Sciences et Technologies de l'Industrie et du Développement Durable) intéressé par l'École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) en Suisse, voici les points clés à retenir concernant les possibilités d'admission en Bachelor ou en cours de Mathématiques Spéciales (CMS), en particulier pour les étudiants qui ne sont pas suisses : 1. **Admission Directe en Bachelor**: Il semble que les étudiants ayant un diplôme de maturité gymnasiale suisse ont le droit à une admission directe sans conditions au Bachelor à l'EPFL. Néanmoins, pour les diplômes étrangers (par exemple, votre Baccalauréat STI2D), l'admission dépend des critères spécifiques d'évaluation et des notes obtenues, et ce, dans certains sujets clés comme les mathématiques et la physique. - Pour un candidat de l'UE/AELE: Certaines conditions spécifiques doivent être remplies, telles qu'une moyenne générale élevée et des notes spécifiques en mathématiques et en physique. - Pour un candidat hors UE/AELE: L'accès peut être possible via le Cours de Mathématiques Spéciales (CMS), encore une fois sous réserve de certaines conditions telles qu'un haut niveau dans des matières scientifiques et une moyenne générale élevée. 2. **Cours de Mathématiques Spéciales (CMS)**: Le CMS est destiné aux étudiants qui n'ont pas une maturité suisse et sert de cours préparatoire scientifique d'une année. À l'issue de ce cours, si vous réussissez, vous pourrez accéder à n'importe quel programme de Bachelor sans condition supplémentaire. 3. **Examen d'admission à l'EPFL**: Si vous ne répondez pas aux critères pour une admission directe en Bachelor ou au CMS, vous pouvez vous présenter à l'examen d'admission de l'EPFL. Il évalue vos connaissances en sciences et culture générale, et en cas de réussite, permet l'entrée en Bachelor sans limite de places. Pour vous préparer à ces démarches et maximiser vos chances d'admission à l'EPFL, voici ce que vous pouvez faire : - **Vérifiez les Critères d'Admission**: Examinez attentivement les exigences spécifiques imposées aux étudiants internationaux en provenance de votre système éducatif. Vous trouverez ces informations sur le site web de l'EPFL ou swissuniversities. - **Préparez Vos Notes et Diplômes**: Assurez-vous d'avoir des notes très compétitives, en particulier en mathématiques et en physique, car elles sont essentielles pour les filières techniques et scientifiques de l'EPFL. - **Démontrez Votre Niveau de Langue**: L'EPFL est une école principalement francophone, vous devrez donc démontrer une maîtrise suffisante du français (niveau B2 minimum recommandé, voire C1 idéalement). - **Contactez l'EPFL directement**: Si vous avez des questions spécifiques, n'hésitez pas à contacter le service d'admission de l'EPFL, qui pourra vous donner des informations plus personnalisées. - **Évaluez d'Autres Options**: Envisagez d'autres écoles en Suisse ou ailleurs dans l'UE/AELE si l'EPFL ne peut pas vous accepter directement en Bachelor. Certaines pourraient avoir des critères d'admission plus adaptés à votre profil. - **Préparez Votre Candidature**: Collectez tous les documents nécessaires pour le processus de candidature (bulletins de notes, preuve de compétences linguistiques, lettres de motivation, etc.) et soumettez votre dossier dans les délais spécifiés. N'oubliez pas que l'admission au niveau international peut être compétitive et que les critères peuvent varier chaque année. Il est donc essentiel que vous restiez informé des dernières mises à jour concernant le processus d'admission et que vous travaillez sur votre dossier bien à l'avance."},{"prompt":"J’ai un bac sti2d je suis née et vie en France depuis que je suis petit quels sont les possibilité si le bac sti2d n’est pas reconnu par lepfl et que je n’ai pas de nationalité suisse","completion":"Si vous détenez un baccalauréat STI2D et que vous vivez en France depuis votre enfance, mais que ce diplôme n'est pas directement reconnu pour une admission en Bachelor à l'EPFL, vous avez encore plusieurs possibilités pour poursuivre vos études à cette institution prestigieuse, malgré le fait que vous ne possédiez pas la nationalité suisse : 1. **Cours de Mathématiques Spéciales (CMS)**: L'EPFL offre un programme préparatoire d'un an connu sous le nom de Cours de Mathématiques Spéciales (CMS), qui prépare les étudiants ayant des diplômes non reconnus directement pour l'admission en Bachelor. Si vous réussissez ce cours, vous pouvez ensuite intégrer le programme de Bachelor de votre choix à l'EPFL. 2. **Examen d'admission de l'EPFL**: L'EPFL propose également un examen d'admission pour les candidats qui ne répondent pas aux critères d'admission typiques. Si vous réussissez cet examen, vous obtenez l'accès au programme de Bachelor. Cet examen évalue vos connaissances dans les domaines scientifiques et de culture générale. 3. **Formation Complémentaire**: Vous pouvez envisager une formation complémentaire en France (par exemple, une classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles ou une première année de licence scientifique avec de bons résultats) pour renforcer votre dossier et tenter une admission sur dossier à l'EPFL. 4. **Études en Bachelor ailleurs**: Vous pourriez également envisager de faire votre Bachelor dans un autre établissement en France ou dans un autre pays de l'Espace européen de l'enseignement supérieur, puis de postuler pour un Master à l'EPFL. Un Bachelor dans un domaine pertinent obtenu dans une institution reconnue peut vous ouvrir des portes pour un Master à l'EPFL. 5. **Examens spécifiques reconnus** : Des examens comme le Baccalauréat International (IB) ou l'examen complémentaire suisse de maturité (ECUS), ainsi que certaines qualifications étrangères peuvent être reconnues pour l'admission à l'EPFL. Vous pourriez explorer la possibilité d'obtenir une de ces qualifications, mais cela impliquerait de suivre une formation supplémentaire. 6. **Demande de conseil personnalisé** : N'hésitez pas à contacter l'office des admissions de l'EPFL pour discuter de votre situation spécifique. Ils pourront vous fournir des conseils personnalisés et vous informer des démarches à suivre en fonction de votre parcours éducatif. 7. **Avoir un plan B**: Pensez à un plan alternatif au cas où l'EPFL ne serait pas une option réalisable. Recherchez d'autres universités techniques de haut niveau en France ou à l'étranger qui reconnaissent le baccalauréat STI2D. Préparez soigneusement votre démarche avant de postuler, en vous assurant que vous comprenez bien les critères d'admission de l'EPFL et que vous répondrez aux exigences linguistiques et académiques nécessaires. Il peut être judicieux d'améliorer votre niveau en mathématiques, en physique et dans d'autres matières scientifiques, car les programmes de l'EPFL exigent une solide préparation dans ces domaines."},{"prompt":"Peux on intégrez lepfl après prépa toi","completion":"Intégrer l'École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) après une classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles (CPGE), souvent simplement appelée \\"prépa\\", est tout à fait envisageable. Les étudiants ayant suivi une prépa en France ont souvent le niveau requis en mathématiques et en sciences pour postuler aux programmes de Master de l'EPFL. Voici quelques étapes et considérations pour le processus d'admission : **1. Validation du Bachelor :** Pour être admissible à un Master à l'EPFL, vous devez normalement détenir un Bachelor (ou équivalent) dans un domaine pertinent. Une CPGE n'équivaut pas directement à un Bachelor, vous devrez donc compléter votre formation par une licence (ou un Bachelor) dans un domaine compatible avec le Master que vous ciblez. **2. Intégration via une école partenaire :** Certaines écoles d'ingénieurs en France ont des partenariats avec l'EPFL, permettant des passerelles après une prépa et une intégration à l'école d'ingénieur en France. Vous pourriez ainsi rejoindre un Master à l'EPFL après avoir obtenu votre diplôme d'ingénieur. **3. Admission sur dossier :** L'admission en Master à l'EPFL se fait sur dossier. Les candidats issus de prépas françaises doivent généralement avoir validé au moins trois années d'enseignement supérieur (licence ou équivalent) avec de bons résultats, notamment dans les cours fondamentaux comme les mathématiques et les sciences. **4. Exigences spécifiques :** Certains Masters ont des prérequis spécifiques en termes de connaissances et compétences. Renseignez-vous sur le curriculum et les compétences attendues pour le Master que vous envisagez. **5. Niveau de langue :** Assurez-vous de posséder le niveau de langue requis par le programme, en anglais et/ou en français, selon le Master choisi. **6. Lettre de motivation et CV :** Préparez soigneusement votre lettre de motivation et votre CV pour mettre en avant votre parcours académique et les compétences que vous avez acquises qui sont pertinentes pour le programme de Master que vous souhaitez intégrer. **7. Recommandations :** Des lettres de recommandation de vos professeurs ou tuteurs de prépa peuvent être un atout pour démontrer votre potentiel académique et votre engagement. **8. Contactez l'EPFL :** Si vous avez des questions sur le processus d'admission ou sur le programme spécifique que vous envisagez, n'hésitez pas à contacter directement le service d'admission ou le département concerné de l'EPFL. En résumé, pour intégrer l'EPFL après une prépa, il vous faudra obtenir un diplôme de niveau Bachelor et être accepté sur dossier pour un programme de Master.

Ошибка \`TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a real number, not 'NoneType'\` говорит о том, что функция \`os.getenv(\\"NUM_THREADS\\")\` возвращает \`None\`, что обычно происходит, когда переменная окружения с таким именем не была установлена. Чтобы решить эту проблему, вам необходимо убедиться, что переменная окружения \`NUM_THREADS\` правильно установлена перед запуском вашего приложения. Вот шаги для решения этой проблемы: 1. Проверьте, что вы установили переменную окружения \`NUM_THREADS\` в вашем окружении. Это может быть сделано разными способами в зависимости от того, как вы запускаете ваше приложение. Например, вы можете добавить строку в ваш файл \`.env\` или установить переменную в вашем терминале перед запуском приложения: \`\`\`shell export NUM_THREADS=4 \`\`\` 2. Если вы уверены, что переменная окружения установлена, но вы все еще получаете ошибку, можете изменить код, чтобы обработать случай, когда переменная окружения не найдена, предоставив значение по умолчанию. Измените строку в вашем файле \`app.py\`, которая вызывает ошибку, например так: \`\`\`python NUM_THREADS = int(os.getenv(\\"NUM_THREADS\\", \\"1\\")) # Значение \\"1\\" здесь используется как значение по умолчанию \`\`\` Таким образом, если переменная окружения \`NUM_THREADS\` не будет найдена, будет использоваться значение по умолчанию, которое вы задали в качестве альтернативы. 3. Убедитесь, что у вас нет опечаток в имени переменной окружения, если вы устанавливаете ее вручную или в файле \`.env\`. 4. После внесения изменений перезапустите свое приложение, чтобы оно могло чтить обновленные переменные окружения. Проверьте после каждого шага, решена ли проблема. Это поможет вам понять, что именно вызывало ошибку."},{"prompt":"\\"Размеры: 400мм (длина)x 300мм (ширина) x60мм (толщина) Чехол из матриала Оксворд или аналог непромокаемый Конструкция изделия внутренняя: 1 слой изделия - диаметром 16мм композитная арматура (диаметр стерженя измеряелся без внешней нитки/обмотки, нитка дает дополнительно 1-1,5 мм.), длина каждого стержня 400мм 2 слой изделия - диаметром 10мм композитная арматура (диаметр стерженя измеряелся без внешней нитки/обмотки, нитка дает дополнительно 1-1,5 мм.), длина каждого стержня 400мм Промежуточный слой из кевларовой ткани 3000d 400g 3 слой изделия - диаметром 8 мм композитная арматура (диаметр стерженя измеряелся без внешней нитки/обмотки, нитка дает дополнительно 1-1,5 мм.), длина каждого стержня 400мм Внешняя: Все 6 сторон изделия будут обернуты кевларовой тканью 3000d 400гр/м и для дополнительного распределения нагрузки на заднюю стенку X образным образом добавлены будут кевларовые полосы.

Ответ должен быть исчерпывающим, подробным и полноценным!","completion":"Для начала проведём необходимые расчёты размеров и количества материалов для панелей защиты. **Расчёты материалов:** 1. **Композитная арматура:** - 1 слой: диаметр 16 мм, длина 400 мм. Если нитка увеличивает диаметр до 17,5 мм, примем это во внимание для расчётов зазора. - 2 слой: диаметр 10 мм, длина 400 мм. Прибавляем нитку. - 3 слой: диаметр 8 мм, длина 400 мм. Прибавляем нитку. Количество стержней для одной панели будет зависеть от того, как плотно они уложены в слоях. Примем пока что они уложены вплотную друг к другу. Однако для комплексного расчёта потребуется дополнительная информация о том, как эти слои будут между собой соединяться и какова общая площадь защищаемой поверхности. 2. **Кевларовая ткань:** - Внутренний слой: 3000d 400 г/м. Понадобится один кусок размерами 400 мм (длина) x 300 мм (ширина). - Внешние слои: Обертывание всех 6 сторон. Для каждой стороны рассчитаем площадь и, соответственно, необходимый метраж. - X-образные полосы для задней стенки. Их длину и количество следует определить в зависимости от размера задней стенки и желаемой плотности крепления. 3. **Эпоксидный клей:** Литраж клея рассчитывается на основе потребности в объёме для соединения всех компонентов с учетом их площади и прочности соединения. Это зависит от процедуры применения и производителя клея. **Методы крепления панелей на УАЗ \\"Буханку\\":** 1. **Механическое крепление:** - Использование болтов и гаек для крепления к кузову автомобиля через предварительно просверленные отверстия. Это предполагает создание стальных или алюминиевых рам на задней стороне панелей для усиления конструкции и распределения нагрузки. 2. **Использование магнитных креплений:** - Можно установить магниты на заднюю часть панели, которые будут прилипать к кузову, но эта система не подходит для защиты от сильных ударов и может быть ненадёжной на высоких скоростях или в условиях вибрации. 3. **Защелки или фиксаторы:** - Можно использовать быстросъемные защелки, которые позволяют прикрепить и снять панель быстро, без использования инструментов. 4. **Клеевое крепление:** - Возможно использование промышленных клеев или липучих элементов, но это создаст трудности при попытке удалить или переустановить панели. 5. **Петли и застёжки:** - Можно закрепить панели на петлях, которые позволяют поднимать или опускать их как шторы или дверцы. **Что добавить в конструкцию:** 1. **Крепёжные стальные или алюминиевые рамы:** - Это увеличит жесткость панелей и облегчит процедуру их крепления к кузову. 2. **Ручки или захваты для установки и снятия панелей:** - Облегчат монтаж и демонтаж, особенно если панели тяжёлые. 3. **Стропы или ленты:** - Могут использоваться, если панели крепятся как щиты, которые не должны тесно прилегать к кузову автомобиля. Необходимо также учесть вес панелей и их воздействие на управляемость транспортного средства, а также возможность демонтажа панелей для технического обслуживания или ремонта автомобиля."},{"prompt":"А где расчеты же писал размеры 400мм (длина) x 300мм (ширина) x 60 мм (толщина)","completion":"Извините за недочет. Давайте теперь проведем более детальные расчеты: 1. **Композитная арматура:** Предполагаем, что арматура уложена вплотную друг к другу. Объем одного стержня рассчитывается как: [ V = pi times (d/2)^2 times h ] где ( V ) – объем стержня, ( d ) – диаметр стержня, ( h ) – длина стержня. - Чтобы покрыть площадь 400 мм x 300 мм одним слоем арматуры диаметром 16 мм (при этом учитываем наружную нитку, то есть диаметр 17,5 мм), нужно расчитать количество арматуры в одном ряду: [ N_{16} = frac{400 : мм}{17,5 : мм} approx 23 : стержня ] и поскольку длина каждого стержня 400 мм, что равно длине панели, в один слой уместится 23 стержня. Аналогично для слоя 10 мм: [ N_{10} = frac{400 : мм}{11,5 : мм} approx 35 : стержней ] И для слоя 8 мм: [ N_{8} = frac{400 : мм}{9,5 : мм} approx 42 : стержня ] 2. **Кевларовая ткань:** Площадь одной стороны панели: [ A = 400 : мм times 300 : мм = 120000 : мм^2 = 0,12 : м^2 ] Если кевлар нужен для всех шести сторон, то общая площадь кевларовой ткани составит: [ A_{total} = 6 times 0,12 : м^2 = 0,72 : м^2 ] С учетом возможного дополнительного расхода на обработку краев, можно округлить до 0,8 м² на одну панель. Для X-образных полос также потребуется узнать размеры задней стенки и их количество, чтобы рассчитать длину. 3. **Эпоксидный клей:** Потребление клея рассчитываем исходя из площади соединений. Если учитывать только склеивание панелей (без учета X-образных полос и других деталей), то понадобится несколько литров, зависит от использования клея. **Способ крепления:** В зависимости от дизайна и использования автомобиля, можно рассмотреть следующие варианты: - **Kрепеж на болты:** могут быть использованы для надежного крепления к каркасу автомобиля. Но это потребует просверливания отверстий в кузове. - **Защелки или фиксаторы:** позволяют быстро снимать и устанавливать панели без использования инструментов. **Что нужно добавить в изделие для крепления:** - Предусмотреть металлические вкладыши на задней стороне для болтовых соединений. - Если крепить на защелки, можно интегрировать их в раму или корпус панели. - Можно добавить резиновые или пластиковые уплотнители для предотвращения вибраций и надежного прилегания к кузову. К сожалению, для полноценного расчета необходимо больше вводных данных, в том числе технические характеристики и пределы прочности используемых материалов, требования к защите и спецификации автомобиля."},{"prompt":"Ce inseamna a consemna, da-mi niste exemple simple de inteles","completion":"Cuvântul \\"a consemna\\" înseamnă actul de a încredința sau de a livra ceva unei persoane sau unei entități, de obicei într-un mod oficial sau pentru păstrare, înregistrare sau alte scopuri.

Come mostrato in figura, 3 dei 5 segmenti non sono ricevuti da B, . a) Indica il numero di sequenza dei 5 segmenti inviati da A a B b) Indica il numero di riscontro inviato da B in risposta ai segmenti ricevuti non essendoci la figura, assumi che i segmenti mancanti siano il 2, il 3 e il 4","completion":"In una connessione TCP, ogni byte di dati inviato ha un numero di sequenza associato, che permette al ricevente di ricostruire correttamente il flusso dei dati anche dopo averli ricevuti fuori ordine o averne perso alcuni durante la trasmissione. a) I numeri di sequenza dei segmenti inviati da A si determinano partendo dall'initial sequence number (ISN) e sommando la lunghezza dei dati inviati inclusi nei segmenti precedenti. Poiché l'ISN è 500 e ogni segmento contiene 50 byte di dati, i numeri di sequenza per i 5 segmenti inviati da A saranno: Segmento 1: 500 (in quanto ISN, non abbiamo ancora inviato dati) Segmento 2: 550 (dato che abbiamo inviato 50 byte nel segmento 1) Segmento 3: 600 (50 byte del segmento 1 + 50 byte del segmento 2) Segmento 4: 650 (come sopra, aggiungendo altri 50 byte) Segmento 5: 700 (continuando ad aggiungere 50 byte) b) I numeri di riscontro (acknowledgments) inviati da B sono utilizzati per informare il mittente A fino a quale byte è stato correttamente ricevuto. TCP è un protocollo che prevede un riscontro positivo cumulativo, il che significa che B invierà un riscontro con il numero del prossimo byte atteso. Supponendo che il segmento 1 sia stato ricevuto correttamente, B si aspetterà come prossimo byte il numero 550. Tuttavia, i segmenti 2, 3 e 4 sono andati persi, quindi B non invierà nuovi riscontri fino a quando non riceverà un segmento con un numero di sequenza che fa seguito all'ultimo byte ricevuto correttamente. Quando A ritrasmette il segmento 2 e B lo riceve, B invierà un riscontro per il byte 600, che è quello che si aspetta dopo aver ricevuto i 50 byte del segmento 2. Se poi riceve il segmento 5 correttamente, B riconoscerà che ci sono buchi nel flusso dei dati ricevuto (dovuti ai segmenti mancanti) e continuerà a inviare un riscontro per il byte 600, dando l'informazione a A che è necessario inviare nuovamente i dati a partire da quel punto. Pertanto, i riscontri inviati da B, dipendenti da quali segmenti sono stati ricevuti al momento dell'invio del riscontro, saranno: - Dopo il segmento 1: Riscontro per 550 - Dopo i tentativi infruttuosi di ricezione dei segmenti 2, 3 e 4: B continua a riscontrare 550, poiché non ha ricevuto i segmenti successivi - Dopo la ricezione del segmento 2 ritrasdotto: Riscontro per 600 - Se il segmento 5 è ricevuto prima dei segmenti 3 e 4: B continuerà a riscontrare 600, indicando che i segmenti a partire da quel numero di sequenza sono ancora attesi."},{"prompt":"Supriya confessed that she had made a terrible mistake.

When converting reported speech back to direct speech, it is important to correctly adjust the tense, pronouns, and words indicating time and place to reflect the original moment of speaking. In the sentence \\"Supriya confessed that she had made a terrible mistake,\\" the use of the past perfect (\\"had made\\") in reported speech aligns with a simple past tense (\\"I have made\\") in direct speech. This is because the action of making the mistake was completed before the time of Supriya's speaking. In direct speech, Supriya would likely refer to her action in the present perfect to indicate that the action was completed at some point before now. However, in the case of Aparna's sentence, \\"Aparna said that she had bought a new pup the previous day,\\" the past perfect tense is used in reported speech because the purchase was completed the day before Aparna spoke. When reverting this statement to direct speech, we use the simple past tense (\\"I bought\\") because Aparna would be speaking about an action completed the day before her speaking moment. The straightforward conversion of Aparna's sentence would be: Aparna said, \\"I bought a new pup yesterday.\\" Here's a clearer comparison for both examples: Reported speech: Supriya confessed that she had made a terrible mistake. Direct speech: Supriya said, \\"I have made a terrible mistake.\\" Reported speech: Aparna said that she had bought a new pup the previous day. Direct speech: Aparna said, \\"I bought a new pup yesterday.\\" The use of \\"have\\" in the first example was an oversight. In direct speech, you would typically revert to the same tense the speaker originally used. Since we don't have the exact timing of when Supriya spoke, both \\"I have made a terrible mistake\\" if she had recently made the mistake or \\"I made a terrible mistake\\" if more time had passed are potential conversions to direct speech. In Aparna's case, the timing is specific (the previous day), so the simple past tense \\"I bought\\" is the correct conversion to direct speech."},{"prompt":"Halka jikr","completion":"\\"Halka jikr\\" is a phrase in Hindi/Urdu which translates to \\"light mention\\" or \\"casual reference\\" in English.

Les programmes de bachelor ne sont pas aussi courants dans ces écoles traditionnellement axées sur le cycle ingénieur (niveau master). Cependant, l'École Polytechnique a récemment introduit un programme de bachelor en sciences. Pour trouver des bachelors de même niveau, il faut regarder dans les établissements qui ont une renommée similaire. Voici quelques-uns des établissements et des programmes qui pourraient être équivalents en termes de qualité et de reconnaissance : 1. **Écoles Normales Supérieures (ENS)** - Les ENS (Paris-Saclay, Lyon, et les autres) proposent des formations en sciences fondamentales de très haute qualité, bien qu'elles soient davantage orientées vers la recherche et l'enseignement supérieur. 2. **Institut Mines-Télécom (IMT)** - C'est un groupe d'écoles réputées qui offrent des formations d'ingénieurs de haut niveau dans divers domaines technologiques. 3. **École des Ponts ParisTech** - Cette école propose des formations d'excellence dans le domaine de l'ingénierie civile et environnementale. 4. **ESPCI Paris (École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la ville de Paris)** - Elle offre une formation en physico-chimie et est renommée pour ses laboratoires de recherche et les prix Nobel qui y sont associés. 5. **Université PSL (Paris Sciences et Lettres)** - Ce regroupement d'institutions d'enseignement supérieur et de recherche inclut plusieurs établissements tels que Mines ParisTech, ESPCI Paris, et d'autres, offrant un environnement pluridisciplinaire. En dehors de ces institutions, il est également judicieux de considérer les programmes de bachelor proposés par des universités françaises de renom ou par d'autres écoles d'ingénieurs bien cotées. Les bachelors en France sont souvent plus axés sur des cursus universitaires généraux, alors que les formations d'ingénieurs sont traditionnellement en 5 ans (intégrant le niveau master). Il est important de noter que le \\"niveau\\" d'un bachelor ne dépend pas uniquement de l'institution qui le délivre, mais aussi de la qualité de l'enseignement, des opportunités de recherche, des partenariats industriels, de l'insertion professionnelle des diplômés, et de l'écosystème d'innovation auquel les étudiants ont accès. Pour comparer les programmes de manière équitable, il convient donc de considérer tous ces éléments."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

import org.springframework.web.socket.TextMessage; import org.springframework.web.socket.handler.TextWebSocketHandler; public class MyTextWebSocketHandler extends TextWebSocketHandler { @Override protected void handleTextMessage(WebSocketSession session, TextMessage message) throws Exception { // 获取客户端发送过来的消息 String clientMessage = message.getPayload(); // 这里可以根据需要去处理消息，如记录日志、解析消息内容等 System.out.println(\\"接收到的消息: \\" + clientMessage); // 执行一些业务逻辑 // 构建回应消息 String serverResponse = \\"服务器接收到消息: \\" + clientMessage; // 创建一个 TextMessage 实例，包含要发送的文本 TextMessage reply = new TextMessage(serverResponse); // 发送消息回客户端 session.sendMessage(reply); } // 可以根据需要重写其他事件处理方法，如连接建立时（afterConnectionEstablished） // 或连接关闭时（afterConnectionClosed）等。 } \`\`\` 在\`handleTextMessage\`方法中，参数\`WebSocketSession\`代表与一个客户端的WebSocket会话，而\`TextMessage\`代表从客户端接收到的文本消息。我们通常从\`TextMessage\`对象中提取字符串消息，通过\`getPayload\`方法来完成。 在收到消息后，你可能需要根据应用程序的特定业务逻辑进行处理，例如，解析消息内容、更新数据库、发送到其他用户或系统等。处理完成后，你也可以构建一个回应消息发送回客户端。 需要注意的是，在WebSocket处理过程中，如果出现异常，应当妥善处理这些异常，避免影响整个WebSocket连接的稳定性。 \`handleTextMessage\`方法是异步的，这意味着在它执行时，可能与其他的WebSocket事件处理同时进行。这就需要注意线程安全性问题，确保处理过程中对共享资源的访问是同步的。"},{"prompt":"如何 在thymeleaf 的静态页面中调用post刷新页面信息","completion":"在 Thymeleaf 中调用 POST 请求通常需要配合 JavaScript（或者其它客户端脚本）与后端服务器交互。典型情况下，你会使用 AJAX（异步JavaScript和XML）来执行后台 POST 请求而不刷新页面。基于 AJAX 请求响应，可以更改页面上的某些信息而不需要重新加载整个页面。 以下是一个简单的例子，演示如何从使用 Thymeleaf 的静态页面发送 POST 请求，并在不重新加载页面的情况下刷新部分页面信息。 1. **建立 Thymeleaf 模板**： 假设你有一个简单的 HTML 表单，用于提交数据到后端。 \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns:th=\\"http://www.thymeleaf.org\\"> <head> <title>Thymeleaf AJAX Example</title> <script src=\\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\\"><\/script> </head> <body> <form id=\\"myForm\\" action=\\"#\\" th:action=\\"@{/submit-data}\\" method=\\"post\\"> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"name\\" name=\\"name\\" placeholder=\\"Enter name\\"/> <input type=\\"button\\" value=\\"Submit\\" onclick=\\"submitForm()\\"/> </form> <div id=\\"responseArea\\">Response will appear here after form submission.</div> <script> function submitForm() { .ajax({ type: \\"POST\\", url: \\"/submit-data\\", // 注意：这里应该是后端接收 POST 请求的 URL data: (\\"#myForm\\").serialize(), // 序列化表单数据 success: function(response) { // 这里的'response'是从服务器返回的数据 // 将服务器返回的内容显示到指定div中 (\\"#responseArea\\").html(response); }, error: function(xhr, status, error) { // 请求失败时的处理逻辑 console.error(\\"Error: \\" + status + \\" \\" + error); } }); } <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` 2. **在 Spring 控制器中处理 POST 请求**： 在你的 Spring 控制器中，需要一个方法来处理 POST 请求。 \`\`\`java import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody; @Controller public class MyController { @PostMapping(\\"/submit-data\\") @ResponseBody public String handlePostRequest(@RequestParam(\\"name\\") String name) { // 在这里处理表单提交过来的数据 // 做出响应，例如返回一段文本或HTML return \\"Hello, \\" + name + \\". Your data has been processed!\\"; } } \`\`\` 在上面的 JavaScript 代码中，\`submitForm\` 函数使用 jQuery 发送 AJAX 请求。\`.ajax\` 方法用于执行异步 http 请求，它允许你明确指定要发送的数据（\`data\` 属性），以及如何处理成功响应和错误。 然后在 Spring 控制器中，\`@PostMapping\` 注解处理特定路径的 POST 请求，并且通过\`@RequestParam\` 获取表单数据。\`@ResponseBody\` 注解指明返回的字符串是响应体的内容，不是视图名称。 这段示例代码中，当表单数据被提交后，页面不会刷新。相反，JavaScript 会通过 AJAX 请求发送表单数据、处理响应，并只更新页面中的指定部分（在这个例子中是一个带有 id 的 div“responseArea”）。这样，用户得到了所需的数据更新而无需全页刷新。"},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello there!

Gideon Grey calls the ZPD and Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde appear to arrest Wario, but unfortunately they tell him that they can do nothing about the pies and baking equipment, and tell him that he's gonna have to buy all new stuff. Just when all seems lost, however, Kirby arrives via Warp Star and sucks up all the snow from the pies and baking equipment, returning it back to normal. All of this happens while Gideon Grey is confused at the absurdity of the situation. Eventually Gideon Grey wakes up in his bed, realizing that it was a strange dream caused by eating expired blueberries","completion":"It was an unusually frosty morning in the anthropomorphic town of Zootopia, with the kind of frozen breeze that would make even a polar bear reach for a woolly scarf. Gideon Grey rubbed his paws together for warmth as he adjusted the quaint sign outside his bakery: \\"Gideon Grey's Real Good Baked Stuff - Now with EXTRA warmth!\\" Inside, heavenly smells drifted from the ovens. Gideon's famed pies were arrayed like treasure on the counter: apple, peach, cherry, and his new experimental flavor - ‘Winter Wonderland Blueberry’. As Gideon slid his latest masterpiece out of the oven, a strange rumble shook the room. Without warning, the doors burst open and in stomped… Wario, the infamous, yellow-and-purple-clad villain with a moustache so furious it could scare off a honey badger. \\"Wa-ha-ha! I've come for your pies, Gideon!\\" Wario bellowed, as he unleashed a flurry of magical snow upon the bakery from his gloved hands. Gideon stared in slack-jawed horror as his pies, his ovens, his everything became enveloped in a thick layer of cold snow. \\"My... my baked goods!\\" he gasped. Without missing a beat, he picked up the phone and dialed the ZPD. Moments later, the jingle of the bells above the door heralded the arrival of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, Zootopia's finest officers. They surveyed the shivery chaos, with Wilde quipping, \\"Seems like Wario has turned your warm bake into a flake bake, huh?\\" \\"Wario?\\" asked a frazzled Gideon, \\"Who in the blazes is Wario, and what's he got against my pies?\\" Hopps shook her head briskly. \\"Sorry, Gideon, he's from... out of jurisdiction. We can stop him from causing more trouble, but the pies are beyond our help.\\" \\"And the equipment?\\" Gideon pleaded. \\"Caput,\\" Wilde added with a shrug. Just as Gideon began tallying the cost of replacing his frostbitten empire, the sky outside shattered with a brilliant light. In swooped Kirby, riding on a Warp Star, tooting merrily. He hovered in front of the frosted window, squinted at the snowy bakery disaster, and inhaled mightily. Whoosh! In one incredible gulp, Kirby inhaled every flake of snow from Gideon’s equipment and pies, revealing them in their pristine, pre-Wario glory. Nick and Judy took it upon themselves to escort Wario out, still reeling from Kirby’s impromptu snow cleanup. Gideon, meanwhile, tried to process the fever dream of a day he was having. Just as he began to slice a pie in gratitude for Kirby, everything around him started to gently twirl and fade. His bed. His blankets. His alarm clock. The smell of blueberries lingered as Gideon Grey's eyes fluttered open, greeted only by the muffled world of his bedroom. \\"What in tarnation…\\" he groaned, a headache blooming at his temples. Chuckling to himself at the absurdity of it all, Gideon shook his head, vowing to never again bake with expired produce: \\"Winter Wonderland Blueberries, indeed…\\" One thing was clear: it might be high time to try a new pie recipe."},{"prompt":"since when were h1 and h2 tags a selling point on web design service?","completion":"The use of <h1> and <h2> tags (or heading tags in HTML) has been a fundamental part of web design and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) for many years. While it's difficult to pinpoint an exact time when they became a selling point for web design services, it is safe to say that their importance became widely recognized as search engines began to dominate the online experience in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Heading tags are used to structure content on a webpage, with <h1> typically being the main title or most important heading on the page, and <h2> tags used for subsections. These headings are used not just for visual structure but also for semantic meaning, which helps search engines understand the content and context of a web page. As the algorithms of search engines like Google have evolved to place a strong emphasis on user experience and content relevance, proper use of heading tags has become increasingly important for SEO. Web designers and SEO professionals began marketing their knowledge of these best practices as a selling point to clients who wanted to ensure their websites ranked well in search results. Web design service providers highlight the use of <h1>, <h2>, and other heading tags as a selling point because these elements contribute to: 1. **SEO**: Properly structured heading tags help search engines understand the hierarchy and relevance of the content, potentially improving search ranking. 2. **Accessibility**: Screen readers for the visually impaired use heading tags to navigate content, so proper use improves the site's accessibility. 3. **User Experience**: Clear headings can make content more scan-able for users, leading to better engagement and time on site. Overall, the importance of heading tags in web design is not a new concept, but ongoing changes in search algorithms and increased competition for online visibility keep the proper use of these tags a relevant and marketable skill set within the web development industry."},{"prompt":"I legit dont know a single website where I havent used a h1 tag, why is something that's hard not to include a selling point?","completion":"The prevalence of <h1> tags in web design is indeed extremely high, as they are a fundamental part of HTML structure for content. However, while using an <h1> tag might be common practice, there are a few reasons why it could still be considered a selling point, especially when it comes to SEO and web design services: 1. **Proper implementation**: It's not just about using an <h1> tag, but about using it correctly. This includes having a single <h1> tag on each page that contains the main keyword or topic of the page, and ensuring that it aligns with the page's title tag and meta description. 2. **Content hierarchy**: A selling point could be the web designer's expertise in structuring content with a clear hierarchy, using <h1> through <h6> tags appropriately. This affects both SEO and user experience. 3. **Optimization techniques**: Professionals might market their ability to optimize <h1> tags, among other elements, for search engines—by integrating keywords, matching search intent, and ensuring the tag contributes to the overall optimization of the page. 4. **Accessibility**: Understanding and correctly implementing heading tags is crucial for accessibility. Web designers often promote their ability to create sites that are accessible to all users, including those using screen readers. 5. **Reflecting updates in best practices**: While using an <h1> tag is standard, search engines continually update their algorithms. A service might promote its awareness of the latest best practices or changes in how search engines value <h1> tags. 6. **Competitive differentiation**: For those less familiar with the technical aspects of web design, mentioning the correct use of heading tags can differentiate a service provider from competitors who might not emphasize their attention to SEO or the technical side of web design. In essence, the selling point is not simply the use of an <h1> tag—which is indeed a basic part of web design—but rather the expertise in leveraging this and other elements as part of a broader strategy for SEO, accessibility, and user experience. It's about highlighting the value they add beyond mere inclusion, focusing on strategic placement, content relevance, and overall best practices."},{"prompt":"Je suis en terminal sti2d je veux faire un bachelor en France le permetz’t d’intégrer les meilleur école international quel bachelor me recommande tu ?","completion":"Pour intégrer les meilleures écoles internationales après un baccalauréat technologique STI2D (sciences et technologies de l'industrie et du développement durable), il est important de choisir un bachelor qui soit non seulement aligné avec vos intérêts et vos compétences, mais qui soit aussi reconnu pour sa qualité académique et son ouverture internationale.

The resulting pattern is characterized by a series of alternating bright and dark bands or fringes caused by the constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Constructive interference occurs at points where the crests of one wave align with the crests of another wave, leading to increased amplitude or intensity. This results in the bright fringes or bands seen in the pattern. Destructive interference happens when the crest of one wave aligns with the trough of another, which cancels out the wave's amplitude at that point, leading to the dark fringes in the pattern. The classic double-slit experiment beautifully demonstrates interference patterns, where light (or another form of wave, like electrons) passes through two narrow, closely spaced slits and creates a pattern of bright and dark fringes on a screen behind the slits. This experiment provided strong evidence for the wave nature of light and, later on, contributed to the development of quantum mechanics when it was shown that even particles like electrons exhibit wave-like interference patterns under certain conditions. Interference patterns are not exclusive to light; they can also occur with any type of wave, such as sound waves, water waves, and other types of electromagnetic waves. These patterns are essential in various scientific and engineering applications, including diffraction grating analysis, holography, interferometry, and the characterization of materials and optical systems."},{"prompt":"Je suis en terminal sti2d j’ai un dossier je veux faire un bachelor en France pour me servir de bachelor comme un tremplin pour l’international je veux faire un bachelor en ingénieur quels sont les bachelor les plus restigeiux auxquels je peux postuler pour mon projet","completion":"En France, le système d'enseignement supérieur en ingénierie est traditionnellement dominé par les écoles d'ingénieurs qui délivrent le diplôme d'ingénieur, équivalent à un Master (Bac+5). Cependant, certains établissements proposent également des formations de niveau Bachelor (Bac+3), souvent comme une étape intermédiaire avant de poursuivre vers un cursus d'ingénieur complet. Voici quelques parcours prestigieux pour un Bachelor en ingénierie en France, qui pourraient constituer des tremplins pour l'international : 1. Les écoles du réseau Polytech, qui proposent des cycles préparatoires intégrés, peuvent être un tremplin vers une formation d'ingénieur (cycle ingénieur). Ces écoles jouissent d'une bonne réputation et proposent souvent des possibilités de doubles diplômes ou des échanges internationaux. 2. INSA (Institut National des Sciences Appliquées) : Les INSA sont des écoles renommées qui offrent également des programmes de Bachelor, dédiés aux étudiants internationaux ou comme une première étape avant de poursuivre dans un programme d'ingénieur. 3. Certaines universités technologiques, comme l'Université Technologique de Compiègne (UTC), l'Université Technologique de Troyes (UTT) et l'Université Technologique de Belfort-Montbéliard (UTBM), proposent des parcours en ingénierie qui peuvent inclure un bachelor. 4. Les écoles privées ou affiliées aux chambres de commerce, telles que l'EPF ou l'ESILV, proposent aussi des programmes de bachelor en ingénierie, et certaines sont bien reconnues à l'international. 5. Les programmes spécifiques à certaines grandes écoles, comme les bachelors de l'Ecole Polytechnique, ou d'autres établissements membres de la Conférence des Grandes Ecoles, sont réputés mais aussi très sélectifs. Pour choisir un programme, il est important de considérer la spécialisation souhaitée, les partenariats internationaux de l'école, les perspectives de double-diplôme ou d'échanges qui pourraient enrichir votre profil. En outre, veillez à vérifier les conditions d'admission spécifiques au cursus de bachelor si vous venez d'une série technologique STI2D, car certaines formations d'ingénieurs peuvent requérir un profil scientifique généraliste (obtenu à travers une classe préparatoire, par exemple). Certaines de ces formations sont accessibles via les concours post-bac comme le Concours AvenirBac ou le Concours Advance. Enfin, avant de prendre votre décision, pensez à vous renseigner également sur la reconnaissance internationale du programme et les liens que l'école entretient avec des établissements à l'étranger, car cela jouera un rôle important dans la réalisation de votre projet international."},{"prompt":"Détaille 5.

在进行任务分析前我们将老年人可能面临的紧急情况以老年人“能自救”和“不能自救”的状态进行了简单的分类，具体分类见图 1。 图 1老年人紧急情况分类 通过这样的分类我们能够明确老年人在不同情形下的具体需求从而进行任务分析。 在经过前期的调研后，我们发现上述这些情况总体上可以归类为三类任务。 任务目标1：老年人在火灾/煤气泄漏的情况下进行逃生 次级目标： 1.1打开房门 1.2离开房间 1.3远离火灾/煤气泄漏发生区域 1.4打开手机 1.5点击手机上的通话app 1.6输入急救号码 1.7点击呼叫按键 1.8与急救人员交流 1.9在安全区域等待急救人员前来 图2任务目标1分析 通过任务分析我们注意到几乎所有的操作都需要老年人自己完成，于是我们决定采取以下措施改进急救流程： 1.为房间安装烟雾报警器/煤气监测器，同时连接急救中心。当检测到火灾/煤气泄漏发生时自动进行报警。 2.在为老年人设计的智能手表上添加一键呼叫的功能，老年人只需按下按钮即可进行紧急呼叫。 3.为房间安装喷淋装置/新风系统，同时自动断电/断气控制危险区域的范围。 图3任务目标1优化 任务目标2：老年人在能自救情况下的自身疾病救治 次级目标： 2.1前往药品存放处 2.2打开药箱 2.3翻找对应自身症状的药品 2.4阅读对应药品说明书 2.5根据说明书服用药物 2.6前往医院就诊 2.7前往药店补充药品 图4任务目标2分析 通过任务分析我们注意到几乎所有的操作都需要老年人自己完成，于是我们决定采取以下措施改进急救流程： 1.在房间中设置智能药箱，通过简单交互自动给出老年人所需服用药物。 2.老年人在使用智能药箱时自动将信息发送给社区医院，医院派人前往老人住处上门检查后再判断是否需要前往医院就诊。 3.在智能药箱检测到药物不足时主动通知监护人购买药品。 图5任务目标2优化 任务目标3：老年人在不能自救情况下的自身疾病救治 次级目标： 3.1打开手机 3.2点击手机上的通话app 3.3输入急救号码 3.4点击呼叫按键 3.5与急救人员交流 3.6在原地等待救援 图6任务目标3分析 通过任务分析我们注意到几乎所有的操作都需要老年人自己完成，于是我们决定采取以下措施改进急救流程： 1.在房间中安装摄像头，监测到老人出现不能自救的情况自动拨打急救电话。 2.在为老年人设计的智能手表上添加生命体征监测的功能，检测到老年人生命体征出现异常时自动拨打急救电话。 图7任务目标3优化 人机功能分配 人机功能分配是在人机系统中按人和机的功能特长合理地分配工作任务。通过人机功能分配,做到人和机各扬其长,互补其短[1]。 人机功能分配原则主要包括宜人性原则、经济性原则、安全性原则、剩余分配原则、弹性分配原则等。 宜人性原则[2]。进行人机功能分配其根本目的是为了使人在进行工作时更加便捷高效，所以在人、机功能分配中要以人为主[3] 经济性原则[2]。将某一项具体任务分配给人或者机器根据需要成本来确定，但也不能只考虑成本。 安全性原则[2]。安全性原则是指要最大程度上保证系统中人的安全以及机器负责任务的安全。 剩余分配原则[4]。剩余分配原则指尽量将系统中的任务分配给机器来做，尤其是重复性的，危险性的，以体力劳动为主的任务。 弹性分配原则[4]。弹性分配原则指系统可以根据不同的任务环境、不同的操作员等来进行个性化的、灵活的任务分配。 通过上述任务分析以及人机功能分配的基本原则，我们针对老年人救助系统的人机功能分配如下： 人的部分 老人，监护人，社区医生 机的部分 智能手表，水/电/煤气监测系统，摄像头，智能药箱，新风系统，烟雾报警器、喷淋装置。 工作设计 工作空间设计 图8工作空间设计 机器工作设计 摄像头：负责监测老人身体姿态，当检测到老人跌倒/卧倒/长时间没有行为动作时主动呼叫紧急联系人；同时监护人可以通过手机app主动观察老人的行为活动并能与老人主动通话交流。 智能药箱：老人可通过交互面板选择自己当前的症状，药箱会自动投出对应症状的药物，药物的剂量正好是老人一次所需服用的计量；同时在某一药物数量不足的时候会主动通知监护人/老人补充药品。 智能手表：摔倒检测功能，一键呼叫紧急联系人，生命体征检测功能。 一键报警装置：在老人未佩戴智能手表时可以之间按下一键报警装置，装置会自动呼叫紧急联系人。 手机app：通过与智能手表、智能药箱、摄像头相连接，可以实时查看老年人身体状况，实时定位老人的位置，接收智能手表/一键报警装置的紧急呼叫信息、智能药箱的补充药品提醒，通过摄像头观察老人行为动作以及家中环境。 水/电/煤气监测系统：在监测到异常情况下可以自动断开，同时发出警报。同时在长时间未检测到水/电/燃气的使用时自动通知监护人。 新风系统：不断过滤房间内外的空气，保证空气质量。 烟雾报警器、喷淋装置：检测火灾发生，自动喷洒灭火。 人的工作设计 老人：在遇到紧急情况通过智能手表主动呼叫/求助，在遇到能自救紧急情况主动前往智能药箱根据提示取药服药，通过一件呼救装置主动呼叫/求助。 监护人：主动联系老人，通过监视器观察老人的行为状态，通过手机app了解老年人的身体状况，以及家中水/电/煤气使用状况，在智能药箱提示药品不足时前往药店购买药品，在老人通过紧急呼叫联系监护人时进行答复。 社区医生：在接到智能药箱的信息时前往查看老人的身体状况 STAGE 5 : Facilitator Design

These laws were often motivated by the colonial government's economic interests in maximizing resource exploitation while attempting to mitigate some of the damage that such exploitation could cause. However, traditional conservation practices were also present in India before the advent of British rule, as local communities often had their own methods of preserving their environment. Some of the notable environmental laws and policies implemented during British colonial rule in India included: 1. **Indian Forest Act (1865 and 1878)**: One of the earliest attempts to regulate forests, this act aimed to consolidate and reserve areas with forest cover for imperial interests, such as timber for shipbuilding and to maintain ecological balance. The Act gave the British government the legal authority to declare any land covered with trees as government property. 2. **Wild Birds Protection Act (1887)**: This was one of the earliest laws aimed at protecting wildlife, which prohibited the possession or sale of certain wild birds during the breeding season. 3. **The Elephant Preservation Act (1879)**: This act was introduced to protect elephants in India, which were endangered due to excessive hunting and habitat loss. 4. **Land Acquisition Act (1894)**: While not an environmental law per se, this act laid down the procedure for the government acquisition of private land. It had significant environmental implications as it was often used to take over lands for projects without considering their ecological value. 5. **Indian Fisheries Act (1897)**: This act aimed to protect fish in Indian waters by regulating fishing practices that could lead to overfishing. 6. **The Bombay Wild Birds Protection Act (1887) and the Bengal Wild Birds Protection Act (1902)**: These were some of the regional initiatives to protect fauna. 7. **Mining and Mineral laws**: British rulers introduced various laws and regulations to control mineral resources extraction, which had implications for land use and environmental degradation. 8. **Agricultural laws and practices**: British colonial policies changed traditional agricultural practices, introducing plantation economies and cash crops that often had environmental consequences. It is important to note that many of these laws were driven by British economic interests and the desire to sustainably manage resources for prolonged exploitation. The implementation of such laws also undermined traditional indigenous practices and legal systems, which often had community-based conservation measures that were more sustainable. After independence in 1947, the new Indian government began to reevaluate and enact its own environmental legislation, which was more focused on the needs and rights of the Indian population and its environment."},{"prompt":"Напиши этот диалог на румынском, молдавском (латиница), молдавский (кирилица).

Typiquement, le diplôme d'ingénieur de l’École Polytechnique inclut un programme intégré de formation sur plusieurs années, comprenant à la fois un cycle de tronc commun polyvalent et un cycle de spécialisation. Si on cherche des équivalents au Bachelor of Science dans les systèmes éducatifs anglo-saxons, il faudrait plutôt les comparer avec : 1. **Licence** en France (Bac +3) : Dans le système français, le premier diplôme universitaire à proprement parler est la licence, qui est obtenue après trois ans d'études supérieures. 2. **Bachelor's Degree** aux États-Unis ou au Royaume-Uni (BSc pour Bachelor of Science) : C’est un diplôme de premier cycle universitaire obtenu après quatre ans d’études dans la plupart des domaines scientifiques ou techniques. En France, certaines écoles d'ingénieurs ou universités technologiques offrent des formations de premier cycle de 3 ans qui pourraient s'apparenter à un Bachelor's degree, par exemple : - Une licence en sciences et technologies dans une université. - Le cycle préparatoire intégré de certaines écoles d'ingénieurs avant d'entrer dans le cycle ingénieur proprement dit. Il est important de noter que bien que les noms des diplômes puissent être similaires, le contenu et la structure des programmes peuvent différer significativement d'un pays à l'autre et même d'une institution à l'autre.

Écoles Polytechniques en France, comme l'École Polytechnique (souvent appelée l'X), offrent des programmes très prestigieux qui sont souvent accessibles par des voies classiques après des classes préparatoires scientifiques (CPGE). Cependant, l'admission à ces programmes via un baccalauréat technologique comme le bac STI2D est exceptionnelle et souvent plus compliquée, étant donné que la majorité des étudiants viennent des classes préparatoires. Néanmoins, il existe d'autres écoles d'ingénieurs et universités en France qui offrent également des programmes de grande qualité, accessibles directement après un bac STI2D, souvent après une procédure de sélection spécifique ou par une année de remise à niveau. Certains de ces établissements jouissent d'une bonne réputation tout en étant moins sélectifs que l'École Polytechnique : 1. INSA (Institut National des Sciences Appliquées) : Les INSA représentent une série d'écoles d'ingénieurs qui proposent des formations très reconnues. Certaines spécialités sont accessibles aux bacheliers STI2D. 2. UTC (Université de Technologie de Compiègne), UTBM (Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard), et UTT (Université de Technologie de Troyes) : Les Universités de Technologie proposent des cursus d'ingénieurs post-bac et sont ouvertes aux étudiants STI2D sur dossier et entretien. 3. Les écoles d'ingénieurs en partenariat avec les universités : Beaucoup d'universités proposent des cursus d'ingénieurs en partenariat avec des écoles d'ingénieurs, qui sont accessibles post-bac. Ces formations peuvent être bien vues dans le monde professionnel. 4. Les autres écoles d'ingénieurs post-bac : Il existe en France de nombreuses autres écoles qui recrutent après le bac et dont certaines sont ouvertes aux bacheliers STI2D, comme l'ESTACA, l'ECE Paris, l'ESILV, l'EPF, etc. Il est important de noter que les équivalences en terme de prestige peuvent varier et sont parfois difficiles à établir, car elles dépendent de nombreux facteurs, y compris le domaine d'expertise et la spécialisation de l'école ou de l'université. En outre, le réseau professionnel, la qualité de l'enseignement et les débouchés professionnels sont également des aspects à considérer lorsque l'on évalue le prestige d'une institution d'enseignement supérieur. Pour ceux qui sortent d'un bac technologique et qui visent un cursus prestigieux en ingénierie, il est souvent conseillé de s'orienter vers des programmes spécialement conçus pour leur profil ou de compléter leur formation par des classes préparatoires technologiques (TB, TPC, etc.), ce qui peut ouvrir l'accès à un plus grand nombre d'écoles d'ingénieurs."},{"prompt":"Je suis en terminale sti2d j’aimerais faire un bachelor puis partir à l’international faire un master dans le style du bachelor ou science de polytechnique","completion":"Le processus pour poursuivre vos études à l'international après un bachelor dépend en grande partie du pays et de l'université choisis, ainsi que de votre domaine d'études spécifique. Voici les grandes lignes de ce que vous devriez envisager: 1. **Choisissez votre Bachelor en fonction de vos intérêts:** Pour commencer, il est important de choisir un bachelor qui s'aligne sur vos intérêts et sur la filière de science et technologie qui vous intéresse. 2. **Exceller dans vos études:** Les universités internationales sont très compétitives, il est donc essentiel d'avoir un bon dossier universitaire lors de l'application pour un master, surtout pour des écoles prestigieuses comme celles du genre de Polytechnique. 3. **Maîtrise de l'anglais (ou d'autres langues):** La majorité des programmes de master à l'international sont enseignés en anglais, donc il vous faudra avoir un niveau d'anglais suffisamment élevé souvent attesté par des scores à des tests comme l'IELTS ou le TOEFL. 4. **Recherche des universités et des programmes de master:** Identifiez des universités qui offrent des programmes de master qui vous intéressent. Vous devrez faire des recherches sur les prérequis spécifiques de chaque programme concernant l'expérience, l'éducation et les compétences. 5. **Préparation des dossiers de candidature:** Rassemblez tous les documents nécessaires à votre candidature. Cela inclut généralement des relevés de notes, des lettres de recommandation, un CV, une lettre de motivation et des résultats de tests standardisés. 6. **Repérer les bourses et aides financières:** Étudier à l'international peut être coûteux, donc n'oubliez pas de rechercher des bourses d'études et d'autres formes d'aide financière, que cela soit offert par les gouvernements, les institutions ou des organismes privés. 7. **Postuler:** Soumettez vos candidatures aux universités de votre choix avant les deadlines. Il est recommandé d'appliquer à plusieurs universités pour augmenter vos chances d'admission. 8. **Planifier le séjour:** Une fois admis, vous aurez à vous occuper de votre visa étudiant, logement, assurance santé, et autres aspects pratiques du déménagement et de la vie dans un autre pays. 9. **Networking et développement professionnel:** Tout au long de votre bachelor, et surtout pendant votre master, profitez-en pour construire un réseau professionnel international. Participer à des conférences, ateliers et autres événements peut être très bénéfique. 10. **Considérer des partenariats ou doubles diplômes:** Certaines universités ont des partenariats avec des institutions internationales qui peuvent faciliter votre admission ou vous permettre d'obtenir un double diplôme. Il est également important de noter que les écoles comme l'École Polytechnique en France ont des procédures d'admission très spécifiques et peuvent parfois requérir que les candidats aient suivi un certain parcours académique ou préparatoire avant de postuler à leurs masters. Assurez-vous de bien comprendre tous ces requis bien à l'avance.

(Emily Berl for The Washington Post)Listen5 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSave2023 has been widely described as the AI industry’s “Oppenheimer” moment.J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the “father of atomic bomb” for his leading role in the Manhattan Project, struggled with the deadly consequences of his invention.Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.ArrowRightDirector Christopher Nolan reawakened public interest in the scientist’s life this year with the release of a blockbuster epic detailing his tortured life. Many saw parallels between Oppenheimer’s attempts to warn policymakers about nuclear proliferation and modern alarm over the possible consequences of artificial intelligence, with some top technologists saying AI poses a “risk of extinction” on par with nuclear weapons.The atomic bombings left Oppenheimer shattered: ‘I have blood on my hands’As Nolan’s film took over theaters this summer, the debate over how to develop AI safely and responsibly was reaching a peak in Washington. As President Biden was convening top CEOs for discussions about AI at the White House, tech executives and senators saw an opportunity to use Oppenheimer’s struggles to illustrate the morally complex stakes of the debate over the emerging technology.AdvertisementBut Silicon Valley’s fascination with Oppenheimer has left Nolan with “conflicted” feelings.“It’s a wonderful thing that scientists and technologists of all stripes are looking to history and looking at that moment and worrying about unintended consequences,” Nolan said in a recent interview at the Hay-Adams hotel in Washington. “But I also think it’s important to bear in mind that the nuclear threat is a singular threat to humanity.”Nolan says that the atomic bomb was a “force of destruction,” and policymakers need to address that differently than a tool such as artificial intelligence. He warns against viewing AI as a special case and cautioned against ascribing “godlike” attributes to the technology in ways that could allow companies and governments to deflect responsibility.“We need to view it as a tool, and we need accountability for the people who wield the tool and the ways they wield the tool,” he said.World leaders are gathering at the U.K.’s AI Summit. Doom is on the agenda.Some technologists are warning of “doomsday” style scenarios in which AI grows an ability to think on its own and attempts to destroy humanity. Their warnings have resonated on the global stage, and they were a key focus of an international gathering of global leaders to discuss AI safety at Bletchley Park, a historic site in Britain where Allied code-breakers deciphered secret German messages during World War II.AdvertisementBut Nolan warns that focusing on those potential outcomes distracts from solving problems companies and policymakers could address now.“It lets everybody off the hook if we’re looking at the most extreme scenarios,” he said.Share this articleShareAlready, AI systems are ingesting his work and other Hollywood movies to generate photos and videos, he said. Nolan says policymakers need to address the ways that AI systems are taking people’s work now.Digital clones made by AI tech could make Hollywood extras obsolete“When we look to the far reaches of where this technology might be applied or where it goes, I think it distracts from things that need to be addressed right now, like copyright law,” he said. “They’re not as exciting and interesting to talk about … but there’s an immediate impact on employment and compensation that needs to be dealt with.”Oppenheimer’s story also signals how difficult the path ahead will be to regulate artificial intelligence, according to Nolan. ChatGPT accelerated a race within top companies to develop and deploy AI systems, and policymakers around the world are in the early stages of catching up. In the U.S. Congress, lawmakers have launched a group to develop bipartisan legislation to address the technology, amid extensive lobbying from the tech industry.AdvertisementOppenheimer largely failed in his efforts to address the risks of his invention. He was “crushed” in his efforts to prevent the development of the hydrogen bomb, Nolan said. The scientist’s efforts to work within the political system to create change largely failed, especially after his security clearance was revoked due to allegations that he had ties to communism.“I sympathize with people on the cutting edge of A.I. who will look at Oppenheimer’s story and seeing it as a cautionary tale, partly because I don’t think it offers many answers,” he said.How Oppenheimer weighed the odds of an atomic bomb test ending EarthIn the postwar years, the atomic researchers were elevated in pop culture and reached fame scientists had never before seen in history, Nolan said. But ultimately, they found themselves excised from the political system.“When politicians need the inventors, they have a voice, and when they no longer need them, they have less of a voice,” Nolan said. “Oppenheimer’s story points to a lot of the difficulties, pitfalls around these kind of issues.”If inventors can’t ultimately decide how their technology is used, it bodes poorly for a host of tech executives, researchers and technologists who have invested significant time in educating Washington policymakers about artificial intelligence this year. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and top AI researchers from schools such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have spent hours testifying in hearings and speaking with lawmakers in closed-door meetings amid the new AI debate.Congress is racing to regulate AI. Silicon Valley is eager to teach them how.The modern political environment presents new challenges, especially as the companies developing AI systems amass greater political influence in Washington.Advertisement“I’m worried that our leaders in Washington have not yet managed to break free from the manipulations of the tech industry that consistently tell them that they don’t understand enough to regulate,” Nolan said. “We have to get past that mode immediately.”When Nolan began working on the movie about the 20th century scientist, he says he had no idea it would be so relevant to this year’s tech debate. He frequently discussed AI during his “Oppenheimer” media blitz, and in November, he was awarded the Federation of American Scientists’ Public Service Award alongside policymakers working on artificial intelligence, including Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) and Alondra Nelson, the former acting director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.“Making a film about Oppenheimer, I never thought I would spend so much time talking about artificial intelligence,” Nolan said.Share CommentsLoading...TOP STORIESTechnologyBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devicesWhat to do (and avoid) after you’ve been scammed Google settles lawsuit alleging Chrome’s ‘Incognito’ mode tracks usersAnalysis|Microsoft says its AI is safe.

The world of art, with its vast traditions, techniques, and emotions, is a realm that machines can mimic but never truly replicate. The genuine touch of an artist, the personal experiences that influence their work, and the years of honed skill and emotion they pour into each piece are unparalleled.My goal in creating this guide is to empower individuals and publishers who may be operating with limited resources. For small teams or independent creators, sometimes all that’s needed is a fitting visual accompaniment to elevate their written content or event page.In such scenarios, tools that generate images act as a bridge, offering a quick solution to a common challenge. Think of it as having a customizable stock image generator at your fingertips, allowing you to craft that ideal featured image for a blog post or event within minutes.It’s crucial to understand that while these tools offer convenience, they aren’t a replacement for the artistry and expertise that professionals bring to the table. Nobody should be under the illusion of receiving accolades or recognition for merely generating an image via these platforms.I view these generated images as a canvas for further enhancement. When paired with advanced editing tools like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Canva, and others, the possibilities are endless. For example, while DALL-E 3 is much better at generating specifics and even accurate text (occasionally), it doesn’t always get it right.In the example below, I took the image that DALL-E 3 generated, brought it into Adobe Photoshop, and replaced the garbled generated text with actual words and phrases.Left: DALL-E 3 generated image. Right: The final result after some editing in Adobe Photoshop.Ultimately, this guide should be seen as a stepping stone — a starting point to help you get beyond the blank canvas — aiming to introduce and inspire curious creatives to new tools that can broaden their horizons in the world of graphics and illustrations.More about this style galleryEach art style in this guide is accompanied by a description, providing insights into its essence and characteristics, and a series of useful keywords to augment your initial prompts. To aid users in creating visuals using DALL-E 3, specific prompts and keywords have been crafted for each style.You can access Midjourney through the Discord app (with a paid account), and you can access DALL-E via ChatGPT Plus (paid account) or for free at bing.com/create.When using this guide, it’s essential to approach it with an experimental mindset. DALL-E 3’s strength lies in its ability to interpret prompts in novel ways, so don’t hesitate to be creative with your inputs. Whether you’re looking to produce a traditional piece reminiscent of the Renaissance or dive into the pixelated realms of Digital Art, I hope this guide will be your compass, pointing you in the right direction on your creative journey.These prompts should serve as a starting point, and I encourage users to tweak them, add their personal touch, or even combine styles to produce unique and bespoke illustrations. I plan to continue adding examples, styles, and techniques to the guide as I come across them.⭐ Click here or click the image below to view the full gallery for free.Click the image to view the full gallery.⚡ Click here to view the gallery version and click here to view the spreadsheet version.A few tips + tricks to get the most out of DALL-E 3Use descriptive prompts: Be as detailed and descriptive as possible in your prompts. The more information you provide, the clearer the image DALL-E 3 can produce.Experiment with keywords: Try different combinations of keywords to see how slight variations can significantly change the output.Use specific numbers: If you want a certain number of objects in the image, specify that number in the prompt.Set the scene: Providing context or a setting can help DALL-E 3 understand the environment you want the main subject to be in.Try different styles: If you’re not satisfied with the initial result, consider specifying an art style or medium to guide the image generation.Take an iterative approach: Don’t hesitate to refine your prompts based on previous outputs. Iterative adjustments can lead to the perfect image.Limit ambiguity: While DALL-E 3 is great at interpreting prompts, overly ambiguous instructions might lead to unexpected results.Incorporate feedback: If you’re working on a project with others, gather feedback and incorporate it into revised prompts for better outcomes.Check recent updates: DALL-E 3, like many AI models, undergoes periodic updates and improvements. Stay updated with its capabilities.Use visual references: If possible, include references or examples in your prompts to give DALL-E 3 a clearer idea of what you’re aiming for.Explore chaos + randomness: Sometimes, allowing a bit of randomness can lead to surprising and delightful results. Don’t be afraid to let DALL-E 3 surprise you.Mind the resolution: Remember that DALL-E 3 has specific resolution capabilities. Ensure your prompts align with the resolution you desire.Stay updated with the OpenAI community: Join online forums or communities where users share their experiences, successes, and challenges with DALL-E 3. Learning from others can provide valuable insights.It’s obvious that the fusion of art and technology offers a vast landscape of possibilities. With tools like DALL-E 3, we have an opportunity to explore and create in ways that were once beyond reach.I hope this guide has provided a solid starting point of tips and information to help you navigate the world of DALL-E 3 more effectively. But remember, the real journey begins when you start experimenting on your own.Joe Amditis is assistant director of products and events at the Center for Cooperative Media.

If you have used DALL-E 2 to generate images, you know what we are talking about. A panda on an ice rink, a futuristic landscape with skyscrapers painted in Art Nouveau style – you can let your imagination run wild and DALL-E 2 creates them for you, in seconds. The finesse of tools like these has made people rethink the skepticism surrounding AI and has made people more accepting of such emerging technologies. Can you believe that the John Audubon painting below was generated by AI? The below DALL-E 2 generated image is proof that AI tools are causing quite a stir in the world of creativity. Source Though DALL-E 2 is pretty easy to use, to get images that look like this, you need the best prompts. So, in this blog, we’ll talk about the tool itself and some useful tips to help create stunning images with it. DALL-E 2 an overview Variations Inpainting Outpainting Getting started with DALL-E 2 DALL-E 2 prompt – 6 tips to get the best results 1. Get specific about the style 2. Talk about every little element in your image 3. Don’t forget to talk about colors 4. Talk about emotions 5. Describe the composition of the image 6. Avoid complicated prompts How does DALL-E 2 compare with Midjourney? Redefining your creative process with a combination of AI and the right design outsourcing strategy DALL-E 2 an overview OpenAI introduced the world to DALL-E back in January 2021. This was the time when you must have caught a lot of people talking about an avocado armchair! Images generated on DALL-E 2. Prompt – an armchair in the shape of an avocado By 2022, DALL-E 2 was out. The biggest leap was with the four times larger image resolution support. It also made heads turn with its stunning photorealistic results. Initially, DALL-E 2 was only available to limited users. But after months of phased deployment, OpenAI finally put an end to waitlists and made DALL-E 2 available to everyone by September 2022. Images generated on DALL-E Image generation is undoubtedly the signature feature of DALL-E 2. But there’s a whole lot more you can do with it. Let’s look at some features to explore. Variations For every prompt, there are four images generated. If you like one of them, you can then create variations of one of these images from the Quick Actions menu displayed on the respective image. This option generates four more variations of the selected image which you can then download or generate more variations. Here’s an example. Original image generated on DALL-E 2 Variations Variations These variations come in handy especially to create simple animated GIFs. Inpainting Another useful feature is Inpainting. This is where you edit an existing design and retouch it based on your requirements. This feature helps you add elements or remove them from the image without distorting the background and affecting the other elements present. This is a great tool to add textures or shadows to an image or even remove them. Outpainting The below video shows how DALL-E 2 outpaints (expands) a version of the popular artwork, Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer. Source This feature is great for reimagining existing art to understand how AI interprets art and processes it. And it helps you creatively tweak the resolution of your existing design for use on a different platform or for use in print. Getting started with DALL-E 2 One of the best things about DALL-E 2 is its simplicity. It is available as a web application that you can directly access from your internet browser or use as an API in case you wish to integrate the AI image generation function into your app. Start by creating your free account. Once you sign up you will see 50 credits added to your account and there will be an additional set of 15 credits added on a monthly basis. This is for the free account. And the free credits cannot be carried forward. You can also choose to purchase credits. Remember that the pricing and credit usage vary for different models on OpenAI. Source As you can see from the image above, the price and therefore the use of credits in your account depend on the resolution of your image. Paid credits are available in your account for 12 months before they expire. Once you create your account, the process is pretty simple. You key in your prompt and click Generate or upload an image to start editing. Source DALL-E 2 prompt – 6 tips to get the best results https://www.instagram.com/reel/ClEQjzBvlrD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link With AI image generators like DALL-E 2, you either get stunning results that blow your mind or funny-looking renditions of what you had in mind. The difference lies in the prompts you use. Your prompt can be up to 400 characters long. Make the most of this character limit and add in as many details as you can in order to get the best results. Let’s look at some tips to create perfect DALL-E 2 prompts for better image generation. 1. Get specific about the style https://www.instagram.com/p/CjYpOWsvnH_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link You need to tell AI what kind of visual style you have in mind. Otherwise, you get a generic rendition of the keywords. “A cityscape” is simple enough for the algorithm to understand what you are looking for. But what about the visual style and mood of the design? Clearly specify your preferred style in the prompt. Do you want a watercolor illustration or perhaps an oil painting style? Or do you want your image to resonate with a popular art movement like Impressionism or perhaps mimic the style of a popular artist? Get more specific about the style and the design is better. The below images were generated on DALL-E 2 for “cityscape”. Notice the difference adding a description of the visual style can make. Image generated on DALL-E 2. Prompt: Cityscape at sunset Image generated on DALL-E 2. Prompt: Cityscape at sunset in retro vector illustration Kimp Tip: Within every design style there are subcategories. For example, illustrations can be of various styles. It can be an analog style like a pencil drawing or watercolor illustration, digital styles like vector art, or low poly. And when you have to talk about art styles, there are options like Afrofuturism, steampunk, Memphis style, and so on. When you know what each style represents, you know the exact terms to include in your prompts. For example, both the below images were generated for “painting of a flower vase on a kitchen table” but one had an additional detail – Memphis style. Image generated on DALL-E 2. Prompt: Painting of a flower vase on a kitchen table with a window in the backdrop. Image generated on DALL-E 2. Prompt: Memphis style painting of a flower vase on a kitchen table with a window in the backdrop. 2. Talk about every little element in your image One common mistake that people do while using AI image generators like these is that they talk about the subject but forget about the background. Image generated on DALL-E 2 In the above example, a simple prompt like “a teddy bear on a skateboard” would have resulted in an image with a plain white background. Adding the location detail adds to the accuracy of the image. So, when you create your prompts ensure that there are enough details about the main subject of the design as well as the background or the scene in which you would like your subject to be present. 3. Don’t forget to talk about colors Color of the subject’s costume, background colors, or an overview of the color moods you would like can add value to your prompt. Image generated on DALL-E 2 In the above example, had the background and subject colors not been specified, the image would have looked so much different. To further enhance your results, you can add the right descriptors to your color names like “bright pink” or “sky blue” or even use specific color names like “crimson red” and “magenta”. Better yet, if you have the HEX code of these colors, you can add them to your prompt to get the exact colors you have in mind. 4. Talk about emotions Do you want your subject to be happy, sad, angry, or perhaps lost in thoughts? Describe the emotions you wish to incorporate. After all, without a strong emotional quotient, your image lacks depth. The difference between the below images generated by DALL-E 2 is just the inclusion of the word “happy” in the prompt. Image generated on DALL-E 2. Prompt: Illustration of a cat sitting on a couch in a living room with a coffee mug in its hand. Image generated on DALL-E 2. Prompt: Illustration of a happy cat sitting on a couch in a living room with a coffee mug in its hand. Adding emojis can also help capture the expression more accurately when you have animals or human beings in the picture or even anthropomorphic subjects. You can even create prompts with just emojis. But yes, the interpretation varies drastically and you might not always get the results you imagine. Source 5. Describe the composition of the image With human subjects and animals, specifying emotions and expressions is easy. But what if there are only inanimate objects in the image? These images can still have emotions. After all, that’s how you connect with your audience effectively. For this, you can add details about the composition of the image, parameters like: Photo angles – a macro shot of the subject, or an overhead shot or a drone shot. Lighting – studio lighting, indoor lighting, outdoor lighting, backlit shots. Photo lens effects – fisheye lens, double exposure https://www.instagram.com/p/CgFdNywpulw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link All those little tweaks you might be familiar with, all the parameters that you usually adjust in a photo editing app can make valuable inputs in your DALL-E 2 prompts. These help craft the scene accurately and deliver a composition that matches your idea. 6. Avoid complicated prompts Descriptive prompts deliver great results, no doubt. But adding complicated details and very accurate dictation of elements like orientation and position of objects in the design might not always simplify things. You might not get the results expected with prompts that are too specific. For example, we tried creating a design with a prompt that talks about the position and layout of the elements. “On the left side, a yellow rectangle slanting toward the center and on the right a big red circle placed at the top right corner”. Though the prompt reads simple the results were not quite accurate. Image generated on DALL.E Similarly, DALL-E 2, AI image generators in general, might not be the most suitable option for creating images with multiple human subjects or groups of people. In several designs, the face appears distorted and by experimenting with tweaking the prompt for editing the features you are spending your credits in vain. With these do’s and don’ts in mind, go explore the potential of DALL-E 2 and find inspiration for your marketing designs or create unique elements to add to your ads. That’s how you put AI to good use in complementing the efforts of your creative team. How does DALL-E 2 compare with Midjourney? Midjourney is another popular AI image generation tool, a close contender to DALL-E 2. If you are looking for details about the pricing and prompts for Midjourney, check out our blog here. To quickly sum up the differences between these two popular AI imager generators: Midjourney is currently only available through a Discord server whereas DALL-E 2 can be used directly on your browser and in the form of API. Midjourney licensing terms for images depend on the plan you choose. And there are monthly charges billed depending on the plan. With DALL-E 2, instead of the subscription model, you get a pay-as-you-go model where you buy credits depending on your usage. And images created with free credits as well as purchased credits can be used for commercial purposes. In terms of the designs generated, both Midjourney and DALL-E 2 deliver some pretty impressive results. Both tools give you four different variations to choose from. Outpainting option on DALL-E 2 feels much more practical than the upscaling option on Midjourney. Moreover, the former also gives you the option to edit your images before you download them. Summarising all these differences and similarities, DALL-E 2 feels like a slightly more convenient and feature-packed tool for beginners exploring AI image generation. Redefining your creative process with a combination of AI and the right design outsourcing strategy Brands and content creators around the world have been using DALL-E 2 and other such AI image generators to create creative and cool designs that can be used in digital stickers, AR technology, games, and more. How do you use AI-generated designs? Well, remember that these tools only augment human design capabilities and cannot often be used to create standalone designs for marketing, advertising, and branding. If you have some great ideas in mind and if you need a dependable design team that can help tweak your AI-generated images to create something commercial and useful for your brand, choose a Kimp subscription.
