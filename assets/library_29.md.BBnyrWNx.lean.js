In the musty air of the library, surrounded by ancient texts and the lingering whispers of a thousand stories, Mia, Alex, and the stranger regarded each other in an uncertain truce. \\"So, you know about the starlight spirits, the disturbances, the ley lines?\\" Mia inquired, her gaze penetrating as she watched the newcomer carefully. Alex stood close, his presence protective yet curious. \\"The lights, the energy, I've felt them,\\" the stranger answered, her guarded poise softening as she sensed a shared purpose among them. \\"My name is Isla. I work at the university—the Astronomy Department. We’ve been detecting anomalies—patterns that don’t fit traditional cosmic behavior.\\" Isla's confession set the stage for revelations, the threads of isolated inquiries becoming part of a larger fabric. She spoke of theoretical rifts in the fabric of space-time, empirical evidence of a celestial nature that couldn’t be explained through known scientific phenomena. Her research had led her here, to the library, in search of esoteric correlations that might frame her findings in a broader context. As the trio exchanged knowledge, the convergence of their paths steered them toward a frightening conceptual horizon. If Isla's academic evidence was prophesying the same upheaval that the Seekers and their celestial counterparts were warning about, then Luminara, and possibly the world beyond, stood on the precipice of something monumental. Mia, bolstered by the new alliance, suggested, \\"We believe there is an artifact, a key of sorts, connected to the ley lines and the spirits. It might be the answer to containing, or at least understanding, the anomalies.\\" Isla's eyes narrowed, her analytical mind picking apart the implications of Mia’s statement. “An artifact? There might be some mention of it in the legends... the ones dismissed by modern science.” She motioned toward a section of the library designated for texts of mythology and folklore. Together, they redirected their search. The dusty shelves harbored more than fables; they held forgotten wisdom that slipped through the cracks of mainstream knowledge. The trio scoured the collection with newfound fervor, pouring over pages that whispered of hidden truths medicine men and sages had gleaned under the stars centuries prior. It was a race against time, a race against the encroaching darkness, as they sought to connect the celestial dots that seemed to spell an impending cosmic conundrum. The plot did indeed thicken as they worked, the library’s labyrinth of written heritage unspooling before them. And then, nestled within the yellowed pages of an aged ledger written by an explorer long departed, they found it—a reference to the \\"Heart of Luminara,\\" an artifact shaped by the heavens' own touch. \\"According to this, the Heart was sent to Earth long ago, held by those chosen by the stars, to serve as a bridge for communication and passage,\\" Isla read aloud, a tinge of wonder coloring her rational tone. With this discovery, their search gained direction. The Heart of Luminara was more than a key—it was a beacon of ancient magicks and celestial mechanics, a link between worlds that yearned for balance. With the ledger as their guide, they determined to seek the artifact's last known location. Ceaseless threats lurked in the shadows behind every thought, every glance from the library’s enveloping dark. Yet, the newfound companions drew strength from their shared cause and the knowledge that the answers they sought were aligning, piece by intricate piece. They exited the library, the artifact's call a hushed serenade that seemed to echo down from the very stars they gazed upon. The journey ahead was draped in enigma, but they were no longer travelers navigating in isolation; they were a constellation of seekers drawn together by the plot that enshrouded their city and their fate. [To be continued...]"},{"prompt":"Please write page 17","completion":"Page 17: Unexpected Ally The stars bore silent witness as Mia, Alex, and their new companion, Isla, stepped into the cool embrace of the night. The ledger under Isla’s arm was more than a compilation of forgotten chronicles; it was the map that might lead them to the Heart of Luminara and hold the answers they so desperately sought. Their departure from the library was halted by a muttered word from Mia. She halted, straining her eyes against the darkness of an adjoining street. A figure stepped from the shadows, unhurried, almost leisurely, and for a moment, time seemed to constrict around them. The figure was cloaked, much like the menacing pursuer they had previously evaded, yet there was a distinction—an aura not of threat, but of withheld promise. The figure's approach elicited a range of reactions. Alex moved subtly, placing himself between the stranger and the two women, while Isla's hand tightened around her leather-bound trove, her stance defensive. Mia herself felt an odd sense of anticipation as the figure drew closer, a flicker of recognition sparking within her. Once within the lamplight's reach, the cloak's hood was pulled back to reveal an elderly man with a countenance that spoke of wisdom and trials weathered. His eyes held the endless knowledge of the stars—a gaze born of years scrutinizing the heavens, reading its secrets. \\"I am known as Marlo,\\" he said, his voice a low timbre that commanded attention despite its softness. \\"I have been watching your progress, Mia and Alex. And you must be Isla, the one whose search for celestial truths has led you from the academic towers to the grounds of myth.\\" Isla’s surprise turned to inquisitiveness as she met Marlo's gaze. \\"You know of me?\\" she asked, her voice a blend of skepticism and intrigue. Marlo nodded, his lips curving into a wise smile. \\"I know many things. I, too, have felt the fractures in our reality, the disturbances you seek to mend. I am a keeper of scribed celestial lore, a descendant of those who penned some of the very volumes you hold.\\" Isla’s grip on the ledger eased as realization dawned. Marlo was not a new adversary, but another piece of the ever-expanding puzzle—a provider of knowledge they lacked, a guardian of forgotten truths. Marlo shared with them the lineage of the book Isla carried, how generations of star-gazers had kept the tale of the Heart of Luminara alive through their records, this ledger being the culmination of their labors. \\"It is more than an artifact,\\" he explained; \\"it's part of a cosmic mechanism, an interface between the earth and the stars.\\" The Heart, it seemed, was a celestially infused object that could actuate the ley lines in favor of balance, or dismay, depending on who wielded it. Theirs was a quest not only to find it but to ensure it did not fall into the wrong hands. [Image Prompt: A mysterious character, cloaked and enigmatic, reaching out to Mia in a dimly lit room.] Marlo's revelations brought gravity to their quest, his assurances a balm to the turbulence of their doubts. With the ledger as their guide and Marlo's guidance, they sought to uncover the Heart, a journey now shadowed by the fearsome knowledge that others, too, coveted its power for darker designs. Resolved to see their search to the end, Mia, Alex, Isla, and now Marlo, ventured into the belly of the city, where echoes of magick lay in wait and where their fates would intertwine with the celestial emissary known as the Heart of Luminara. [To be continued...]"},{"prompt":"Please write page 18","completion":"Page 18: A New Lead Armed with ancient knowledge and the added wisdom of their enigmatic guide, Marlo, Mia, Alex, and Isla wove through the sleeping city with resolute purpose. They moved as shadows themselves, aware that a wisp of starlight or the slightest tremor in the ley lines could betray their presence to those who pursued the same powerful relic. Marlo, who had walked the edge between the visible and the veiled for more years than the others could fathom, directed their steps toward the remnants of an old district. Here, the architecture whispered stories of times when belief in the intertwining of worlds was common, where star-gazers were once revered. “This way,” said Marlo, his voice barely louder than a breath as he led them down an almost forgotten street. The cobblestones were worn smooth by the passage of countless feet and countless years. Vines clung to the sides of stoic buildings, the city’s age and mystery hanging heavy in the air. At Marlo's behest, Isla unfolded the ledger, its pages luminescent under the wary gaze of the moon. She traced over the ancient text with fingers that trembled not from cold but from anticipation. “Here,” she whispered, pointing to a passage that described a courtyard with a fountain, its centerpiece marked with celestial sigils visible only to those who looked beyond the earthly façade. Mia's Sight flared within her, her connection to the cosmos urging her gaze to pierce the mundane shroud of the world. An ordinary fountain, worn by years and ignored by passersby, captured her focus; she could see past the layers of grime and disrepair to witness an intricate pattern of stars and planetary orbits etched into its surface. They gathered around the relic of a bygone era, the fountain's dry basin a seeming receptacle of secrets and power. Marlo nodded approvingly, his expression a blend of sorrow and hope. “The Heart of Luminara must be close,” he assured them. His declaration was more than conjecture; it was a feeling, an ancient tug at his soul that whispered of proximity to the artifact they sought. The scene became a capsule of concentration as Mia, Alex, and Isla leaned closer, the ledger now a tangible guide as they cross-referenced Marlo's intuitions with the document’s penned renderings. Each symbol, each line, each dormant trickle of long-ago water within the fountain’s basin held the potential to open pathways long sealed. Moments spilled like sand through the hourglass as they sifted through the clues buried within both fountain and text. And then, as if by fate's own design, Isla's hand hovered over a mosaic tile within the ornate depiction of Ursa Major, the Great Bear constellation—an emblem which aligned with a sketch in the yellowed pages of her tome. “Under the Great Bear,” read Isla, her voice betraying her burgeoning excitement. “The Heart resides where the heavens are reflected upon the Earth.” Their search narrowed to the space under the constellation, their movements delicate as they prodded the fountain's designs for a sign, a trigger, a revelation. It was Alex who discovered the anomaly—a tile within the bear's outline that depressed slightly under pressure. The fountain’s base emitted a low grinding sound, stone against stone, as hidden mechanisms—untouched for aeons—began to stir. The Seekers looked on with bated breath as the base stones parted, revealing a concealed cavity beneath. The revelation was an affirmation of prophecy and legend, forged by celestial intent—but was the sought-after Heart within? [To be continued...]"},{"prompt":"Please write page 19","completion":"Page 19: A Dangerous Encounter The stone outline of Ursa Major had given way to reveal its secret, an opening within the heart of the fountain where the Earth seemed to touch the stars. The air around the seekers buzzed with the hum of raw energy, a vibration felt more than heard, as if the revealing of the hidden chamber echoed within the very fabric of the cosmos. Marlo was the first to react, his hand outstretched to halt the eager advance of his companions. \\"Caution,\\" he whispered, his gaze intense. \\"The Heart, if it is indeed within, will be guarded. Its wards have held for centuries.\\" They peered into the darkness below. The cavity was not simply an empty recess but an entrance to something deeper, a corridor that vanished into the earth. Cold air wafted from the gaping maw, along with the faint, indistinct scent of minerals and old magic. Mia hesitated at the threshold, the Sight within her flickering like a flame in a draft. What lay beyond was a path woven with peril and promise, leading to a relic that bore the weight of worlds upon its form. The decision to descend was silent, unanimous; their journey thus far had been a gathering of momentum that could not now be stilled. With Marlo leading, the seekers descended one by one into the gloom. The stairwell spiraled downwards, ancient stones worn smooth by the footsteps of those few who had once walked this hallowed route. As they wound deeper beneath the city, the cries of the surface faded into a memory, and the silence grew profound, save for the steady whisper of their breaths and the soft echo of their descent. And then, the passageway leveled, opening into an expansive chamber. The walls thrummed with the same starry energy that Mia had come to recognize—a tapestry of pulsating light that painted an otherworldly glow upon the seekers' awestruck faces. The reverence of the chamber, however, was shattered by a sudden movement. From the shadows cast by the starlight emerged figures, robed and silent, guardians of the sacred place that had for so long been undisturbed. Mia's Sight flared—warnings sparking within her mind. These were no mortal custodians, but manifestations of the ley lines themselves, conjured protectors bound to the Heart of Luminara. The intensity of the chamber's light grew, and the figures advanced, their forms blurring between solidity and luminescence. [Image Prompt: Mia and Alex in a hidden underground chamber, facing a sinister, magical phenomenon.] Alex stepped forward, drawing a small device from the depths of his satchel—it was the totem they had recovered, its purpose now startlingly clear. He held it aloft; the sigils upon its surface ignited with brilliance, casting a beam that seemed to answer the aggression of the guardians with an assertion of kinship. For a tense moment, there was an oscillation in the chamber, a flicker between conflict and recognition. And then, as if accepting the totem's call, the guardians stilled, their forms softening, allowing the seekers to pass unharmed. An unspoken agreement had been forged in light and understanding, a treaty that granted Mia, Alex, Isla, and Marlo the right to approach the Heart. A pedestal stood in the chamber’s center, cradling the Heart of Luminara—a crystal pulsing with an inner galaxy of stars, nebulae, and constellations. It was a microcosm of the universe, a beacon of ancient power that resonated with the beat of all creation. As the seekers reached out to this celestial relic, they understood that it was more than an artifact; it was a living connection to the stars themselves—a nexus of past and future where the fate of their world hung in the balance.

The chamber around them held its breath, the light from the crystal casting prismatic dances upon the walls. This was the moment of convergence, the Seekers and scholars meeting destiny hand in hand. Marlo, with a reverence reserved for the most sacred of rituals, stepped forward. His seasoned hands hovered above the Heart, wary of contact. \\"It must be understood before it can be wielded,\\" he murmured, echoing the words that had been passed down through his lineage. Mia's Sight, fully attuned to the Heart's celestial song, recoiled at the touch of darkness she felt creeping through the chamber's threshold. She searched the shadows, sensing a presence—a void where the starlight wept. \\"Something's wrong,\\" she said, her voice a whisper that carried the weight of her dread. No sooner had the warning left her lips than the chamber shook—a silent quake that trembled through stone and soul alike. The guardians around them flickered wildly, their forms destabilizing, reacting to an intrusion that threatened to unravel the woven peace. From the darkness emerged their cloaked pursuer, the figure that had lurked within their periphery since the start of their voyage. But they were not alone. Flanking the cloaked figure were others, equally obscured by shadow, their intentions clear as they eyed the Heart with malignant desire. \\"The barriers weaken,\\" the cloaked figure spoke, his voice a sibilant sound that slithered through the chamber, \\"and we will not be denied our prize.\\" Mia felt anger surge within her, a fierce protectiveness over the Heart that had become part of a greater purpose she now carried. \\"We can't let them take it,\\" she said, stepping between the intruders and the pedestal. Alex and Isla moved to join her, a unified front against the impending threat. A high-pitched tone, like the ringing of glass, resonated from the Heart, an urgent timbre that seemed to be both a summons and a warning. The air thickened with potential, with the palpable power of starlight that needed to be channeled, guarded. Marlo’s eyes were laden with sorrow, with the burden of generations. \\"There are forces here that not even the Heart can easily quell,\\" he said, his voice steady despite the chaos. \\"We must make a choice, and we must make it swiftly.\\" In the climactic tension, the crystal pulsed—a beacon calling its guardians to action. The Seekers prepared to defend it, to keep its power from hands that would misuse its connection to the fabric of existence. [Image Prompt: Mia facing an unexpected revelation or danger.] As the confrontation neared its breaking point, a tremor of realization coursed through Mia. The ledger she had brushed off the pedestal in her urgency reflected a cascade of light from the Heart, a shattered reflection that bordered on revelation. She glanced at Isla, and in their shared gaze was an unspoken agreement: The chamber held more secrets, and within the cryptic intersection of starlight, shadow, and scholarly intuition lay the answer they needed. With the chamber echoing the song of colliding worlds and the imminent threat of the shadowed intruders, the Heart of Luminara beckoned the seekers to stand firm, to protect the cosmic balance. As the Heart's glow intensified, a final, shattering truth came to light—a twist in their tale that none of the seekers had foreseen, a revelation that could change everything...

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the nastiness of the sensation of the voluminous deposit in her pants, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs close to the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"Due to the sensitive and potentially offensive nature of the requested scene, as well as the rules and community standards that govern the platform, I'm unable to provide a screenplay or script that involves explicit depictions or dialogues of bodily functions, especially in a disrespectful or inappropriate manner.

Below is a revised, appropriate version of the comedic scene for a Hindi drama TV serial: Title: \\"Dhaar Ki Talash!\\" (The Quest for Relief!) [INT. SHARMA HOUSE - DAY] We open to a quiet residential street. The camera zooms in on the Sharma house as PRIYA SHARMA, a young college student with neatly tied hair and wearing a traditional kurti and matching leggings, approaches her home. Sweating slightly with anxiety, Priya fidgets as she scours her bag for her keys. Cut to a close-up of her face, displaying a mix of worry and urgency. PRIYA (mumbling to herself) Chabi kahan chali gayi? Aaj nahi, yaar... (Priya continues to search) Suddenly, her eyes widen, and she clenches her stomach, clearly in distress. She knocks frantically on the door. PRIYA (CONT'D) (loudly, in panic) Maa! Maa, please, darwaza kholo! On the other side of the door, SUNITA SHARMA, a middle-aged, homely woman in a simple saree, wakes from her nap, yawning and stretching. She calls out in a groggy voice, confused by the persistent knocking. SUNITA (rubbing her eyes) Kaun hai? Itni kya aag lagi hai? Cut back to Priya, hopping on the spot. Her expressions transition between pleading and pain. PRIYA Maa, main hoon! Priya! Please jaldi karo! (Inside, Sunita takes her sweet time, still sleepy and fumbling with the locks, adding to the tension of Priya's predicament.) SUNITA (muttering) Yeh ladki bhi na...koi tameez nahi hai. (After what feels like an eternity to Priya, the door finally opens. Priya tries to speed past her mother into the house.) PRIYA Side ho jao Maa, please! Sunita, however, is worried at her daughter's distress and instinctively reaches out, grabbing Priya by the arm. SUNITA Priya! Kya hua? Tu theek hai na? (Priya squirms in place, struggling to maintain her composure. Her discomfort is palpable.) PRIYA Bas, side ho jao...mujhe bathroom jaana hai! (Accidentally, Sunita squeezes Priya's midsection. Priya's face freezes; she's momentarily stunned, eyes bulging.) PRIYA (CONT'D) (letting out a tiny whimper) Uh-oh... Sunita, befuddled, insists on knowing what's wrong. SUNITA Priya, bata to sahi kya hua? Priya, now red-faced, manages to speak between controlled breaths. PRIYA Basss...Maa...thori problem ho gayi hai. (Sunita's nose wrinkles as she detects an unpleasant aroma. Her eyes go wide as she finally understands the situation.) SUNITA (with a mix of shock and disgust) Priya...tu ne...? Priya, humiliated but with a weak smile, nods and edges to move past her mother. PRIYA Ab jo ho gaya, so ho gaya...please, Maa! (Sunita reluctantly steps aside. Priya gingerly makes her way, cupping the back of her leggings.) SUNITA (cantankerous) Yeh kya kar diya tune? Tera khud ka ghar hai, andar nahi jaa sakti thi? Priya winces at the scolding but finds her moxie, teasingly blaming her mother.) PRIYA Agar aap meri peet nahi dabaati toh... Sunita, incredulous but with a hint of banter in her voice, continues. SUNITA Haan-haan, saari galati meri hai. Aur tu toh ekdam masoom hai, haina? Priya tries to lighten the moment, acknowledging the absurdity. PRIYA Ha ha, very funny. Bahut maza aa raha hai aap ko? Ab maine jo bhi kiya, aapki vajah se kiya. Sunita feigns a stern look, half-serious and half-amused. SUNITA Chal, ab jaakar safai kar. Aur sun, agle baar chabi mat bhulna! (As Priya waddles off, Sunita can't help but giggle at her daughter's plight. The camera follows Priya from behind, just beyond the \\"mess,\\" preserving her dignity.) PRIYA (calling back) Haan, Maa. Ab toh har roz double-check karungi! [INT. SHARMA HOUSE - BATHROOM DOOR - CONTINUOUS] Priya disappears behind the bathroom door. The sound of running water is heard. SUNITA (yelling towards the bathroom) Aur haan, koi spray wagherah bhi chhidak dena wahan! (Fade out as we hear the bathroom door close and Priya's exasperated response.) PRIYA (O.S.) Haan, Maa! Saari kayaanat ko bata do! [END OF SCENE] **The edited scene now relies on reactions and dialogue to create humor without explicit content. The audience understands what's happening due to the characters' expressions and the situation without needing graphic descriptions.**"},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * An Arab-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she's a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching her house's door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the nastiness of the sensation of the voluminous deposit in her pants, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs close to the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY A sunny afternoon in a quiet neighborhood. Birds chirping. A neat, single-story house sits comfortably among well-tended lawns. TITLE: \\"MISADVENTURE AT THE FRONT DOOR\\" EXT. HOUSE ENTRANCE - DAY ZEINA, an Arab-American college student in her early 20s with a practical ponytail and an air of urgency about her, wears a smart black tunic over leggings. A canvas messenger bag hangs across her shoulder. She's almost dancing in place as she power-walks towards her house, clearly in distress. Her discomfort is nearly palpable. ZEINA Oh, come on... Zeina reaches the front door, patting her pockets, her anxiety peaking. ZEINA (CONT'D) No, no no... where is it?! She rummages through her bag with increasing frenzy. No key. She starts KNOCKING, almost hammering, on the door. INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS LAILA, Zeina's mom in her late 40s — with a graceful figure, wearing a cozy bathrobe, her hair wrapped in a loose, sleepy bun — jolts awake on the living room couch. She hears the KNOCKING and stands, slightly disoriented. She shuffles toward the door, rubbing her eyes, her steps heavy with drowsiness. LAILA (grumbling) I'm coming... EXT. HOUSE ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Zeina, hopping slightly from foot to foot, is now knocking with both urgency and a panicked rhythm. ZEINA (whispering to herself) Please be there... Please... INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS LAILA (yawning) Who is it? LAILA reaches the door and looks out the peephole. The KNOCKING continues. EXT. HOUSE ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS ZEINA Mom! It's me. I forgot my key. Please hurry! INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS LAILA (under her breath) What on earth...? She starts undoing the locks and chains, her movements slow and groggy. LAILA (CONT'D) Hold your horses, I'm coming... EXT. HOUSE ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Zeina's knocking grows frantic. Her face is strained; she's on the brink of disaster. ZEINA Please, Mom, open up! INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS LAILA finally swings the door open, a hint of irritation mixed with concern cross her face as she sees Zeina's state. LAILA What's gotten into you? Zeina tries to bolt past Laila, but Laila, out of sheer concern, intercepts her, grabbing her arm. ZEINA (desperate) I need to get past, Mom! Please move! LAILA (trying to look into Zeina’s eyes) Habibti, tell me what's wrong. Are you okay? While struggling, Zeina tries politely to free herself. ZEINA I'm fine, really, just let me in! LAILA, holding firm, unintentionally squeezes Zeina's midsection. Zeina GROANS and her eyes widen in horror. ZEINA (CONT'D) (urgent whisper) Oh no... The groan turns into a SOUND of relief as Zeina starts losing control. LAILA (utterly perplexed) Zeina? Zeina, what’s...? Zeina is stationary, a deer in headlights, as she continues to succumb to her predicament. She is moaning, a sound reflecting a mix of exertion and unwanted comfort. LAILA (CONT'D) (tentatively) Is something... wrong? Zeina lets out another strained sigh, steadying herself with one hand on the door frame, the situation reaching its culmination point. ZEINA (strained) You might... want to... stand back... LAILA narrows her eyes in confusion but soon wrinkles her nose as she detects an odd smell. LAILA Oh... What is that...? LAILA slowly pieces the puzzle together, one hand still on Zeina's arm, the odor becoming unmistakable. LAILA (CONT’D) (disgustedly) Zeina, did you just...? ZEINA (mortified) Can... Can we just go inside, please? LAILA steps aside, her own discomfort evident, as Zeina slowly shuffles past, cupping the back of her leggings. LAILA (fanning her nose) Lord have mercy, Zeina! You're a grown woman! Zeina, cheeks burning, mutters something under her breath. LAILA (CONT’D) (astonished) I mean, really, do I need to put you back in diapers? ZEINA (playful defiance) This is your fault, you blocked me... oh God, and you pressed on me! LAILA (utter disbelief) That is no excuse! What are you, five? You just stood right there and... enjoyed it? ZEINA (less defensively) I had no choice, you squished it out of me! LAILA gestures to Zeina's backside, her nose turned up. LAILA Let's see the damage... Zeina protests weakly as LailA slowly turns her around. LAILA (CONT’D) Amazing, you've loaded your pants like it's Thanksgiving. ZEINA (agitatedly) I really need to go clean up. It's... so gross, ugh. LAILA I can’t even believe this. LAILA leans in for a closer sniff, reeling back comically. LAILA (CONT’D) Yep, you definitely need a shower. It reeks! ZEINA (sarcastic) Glad you’re enjoying the bouquet. LAILA, still in disbelief, ushers Zeina towards the bathroom. LAILA Go, shoo, get cleaned up. You're stinking up the whole place. Zeina, still able to muster a playful attitude, waddles off as Laila watches, shaking her head.

Mimi was just a name she [Kunou] used [Kunou] to live in the non-magical world as a human, although she [Kunou/Mimi] is [Kunou/Mimi] Issei's adoptive younger cousin [Kunou] in this story, [Kunou] taking the place of Tsukihihime's Arima Miyako, [Kunou replacing Miyako in this story] and [Kunou] having [Miyako's] martial arts skills and [Miyako's] talent. Kunou also replaces Bakemonogatari's Sengoku Nadeko, [Kunou replacing Nadeko] as she [Kunou] views him [Issei] as her [Kunou's] biological older brother [Issei in Kunou's mind] due to her [Kunou's] family taking him [Issei] in before she [Kunou] was [Kunou] born, and [Kunou] hides the truth about herself [Kunou being a kitsune yokai hime] from him [Issei]. The version of the white-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite half-Deutsche [German] half-Japanese, calm, cool and collected but also shy and socially inept magic user in training German princess/noble heiress Illya von Einzbern seen in Prisma Illya and her [Illya's] younger twin, the pink-haired, amber-eyed, rude and perverted but also shy and reserved Chloe von Einzbern, [Illya and Chloe] both [Illya and Chloe] are Kunou's half-sisters in this story. Illya and Chloe still become magical girls but since Karen replaces Rin, they [Illya and Chloe] are [Illya and Chloe] both trained by her [Karen]. Illya is also the current incarnation [Illya] of the version of Nyarlathotep seen in Haiyore! Nyaruko-san, due to the women of the ruling main branch of the Einzbern family having the memories, skills, powers and magical abilities and techniques of their predecessors and ancestors embedded within them automatically after birth, which [the Einzbern pecularities] got them [the Einzberns] mistaken for demonic creatures, and the grotesque forms they [the Einzberns] projected as illusions to scare away intruders along with their [the Einzbern's] ability to control tentacles didn't help things. Chloe is also the current incarnation of the version of the Necronomicon, Al Azif seen in Kishin Hōkō Demonbein for this very reason. Kunou takes the place of Kādokyaputā Sakura and [Kunou] hunts the Clow Cards [Kādokyaputā Sakura] and rouge magicians after them [the Clow Cards] when she [Kunou] transforms into a magical girl. The black-haired, glasses-weared, purple-eyed, tall, slender, and petite but also curvy and buxom, soft-spoken, kind and upbeat but also no-nonsense, justice-driven and somewhat delusional Hanekawa Tsubasa from Bakemonogatari, [Tsubasa in this story] is [Tsubasa in this story] in fact [Tsubasa's true identity in this story] DxD's black-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender and petite, stern and no-nonsense water manipulating devil princess Sona Sitri, [Tsubasa being Sona in this story] which she [Tsubasa] of course hides. Tsubasa often chases Issei due to his [Issei's] perversion but [Tsubasa] has a crush on him [Issei] despite her [Tsubasa] being some years younger [Tsubasa] than him [Issei]. N.B: In this story, Evangelion's Second Impact happened at the end of the Cold War instead of 2001, and Japan reclaimed the lost provinces of Chōsen [the Korean peninsula/Korea/Hanguk |Chōsen|, |Chōsen| known as |Chōsen's| other name Hanguk in |which language Chōsen is (Chōsen) known (Chōsen) as Hanguk in Hangugeo |Korean/the Korean language (Hangugeo)| Chōsen] Karufuto [Russia's Sahlakin and Kuril Islands |Karufuto|], Formosa [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands |Formosa|], Senkaku [China's Daiyou Islands |Senkaku|], the Carolines and the Marinas in the aftermath of the tragedy, while [Japan after Second Impact] restoring the Dà Míngguó [Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/Ming Empire |Dà Míngguó|], [the Dà Míngguó] also [what also happened to the Dà Míngguó] known [the Dà Míngguó] as [the Dà Míngguó’s other name] the Míng Cháo [“Ming dynasty” |Míng Cháo|] in Zhōngguó [|Han China/Hanland/China (Zhōngguó)|] and [Japan after Second Impact] restoring the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/the Mahaan Manchooriyan Saamraajy/the Periya Mañcūriyaṉ Pēraracu/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren [the Great Manchurian Empire/Empire of Great Manchuria/Manchukuo/Manchoukuo |Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/the Mahaan Manchooriyan Saamraajy/the Periya Mañcūriyaṉ Pēraracu/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren| in Manjügo [Manchuria |Manjügo|] and the Mongolyn Öörtöö Zasakh Kholboot Zasgiin Ordon/Mengjiang [Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation/the Federal Autonomous Government of Mongolia |the Mongolyn Öörtöö Zasakh Kholboot Zasgiin Ordon/Mengjiang|] in Nèi Měnggǔ [Inner Mongolia]. Knightmare Frames exist along with TSFs/Tactical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv] but the BETAs don't exist. Magika Kenshi's Divas and swordsman techniques coexist alongside Fate/Stay Night's magic das Deutsches Reich [the German Empire/Imperial Germany/the Imperial State of Germany |das Deutsches Reich|] and Die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie [the Austria-Hungarian Empire/Empire of Greater Austria/Germanic Roman Empire/Germanic Rome |die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie|] also returned after Second Impact and dominated Europa [Europe |Europa|]. The chapter starts off with Issei, [Issei] having successfully cleaned out a nest of vampires and [Issei] also cleared up some oddities around his [Issei's] school, [Issei] heading home [Karen and Tsukihi's family mansion] to rest and [Issei] clear his [Issei's] head from his [Issei's] pervert act at school, which [Issei acting perverted at school] he [Issei] hopes that his [Issei's] little sisters [Karen, Tsukihi and Kunou] will never discover. Shinobu, having [Shinobu] been in his [Issei's] shadow, [Shinobu] laughs at her [Shinobu's] masters' [Issei's] prudishness, [Shinobu] telling him [Issei] that he [Issei] should stop being such a prude and [Issei] accept the fact that he [Issei] has a harem now, although she [Shinobu] wonders why he [Issei] looks so much like one of her [Shinobu's] old enemies from her [Shinobu's] time being the scourge [Ryōko] of space. As he [Issei] is [Issei] heading home, he [Issei] is rudely passed by a blonde, blue-eyed young boy, who [the blonde] seems to be in a hurry. he [Issei] shrugs it off as just people being rude until he [Issei] finds himself [Issei] nearly bumping into a death squad sent by the Japanese branch of the infamous paramilitary NGO NERV [Evangelion]. When it [the death squad] tries to kill him [Issei], he [Issei] snaps, [Issei] beating them [the members of the death squad] to an inch of their [the death squad's members'] lives after he [Issei] realizes it [the death squad] was [the death squad after the blonde]. Meanwhile, Kunou has [Kunou] successfully sealed away a set of Clow Cards in her [Kunou's] magical girl persona, [Kunou] making sure that she [Kunou] cleans up after herself [Kunou]. Before she [Kunou] can move any further, the sound of fighting draws her [Kunou's] attention and she [Kunou] turns around, only for her [Kunou] to see the brown-haired, brown-haired, tall, slender and somewhat muscular superhuman mutant Kanzaki Jin, the protagonist of ZETMAN [JIn] who [Jin] also takes the place of Evangelion's Ikari Shinji and [Jin] was known as Naruto's Uzumaki Naruto before [Jin as Naruto] being brought to Tokyo-3 [Jin as Naruto] and brainwashed [Jin as Naruto] into being the Third Child [Ikari Shinji] before [Jin] escaping when NERV collapsed in this story, who [Jin] was [what Jin was] the blonde [Jin] the NERV death squad that Issei beat up was [the death squad] after, [Jin] fighting off an entire bunch of thugs, who [the thugs] unknown to her [Kunou] are in fact Leaf Village charka-using fake ninja sent [the ninja goons] to bring him [Naruto] back due to him [Naruto] having the Nine-Tailed Fox inside him [Naruto]. Kunou jumps in and [Kunou] using her yokai and Western magic, easily decimates them, [Kunou] thinking that he [Naruto] is Issei. Illya and Chloe, who [Illya and Chloe] are [Illya and Chloe] in their [Illya and Chloe's] own personal, magitech TSFs due to their [Illya's and Chloe's] maternal relatives [the House of Einzbern] being the ruling family of the secretive magical organization the Clocktower and thus [the House of Einzbern] being the true British royal family [the House of Einzbern], [Illya and Chloe] being nearby, [Illya and Chloe] jump in, [Illya and Chloe] also under the illusion that Naruto is Issei. The Einzbern princesses' [Illya's and Chloe's] personal mechs blast through the summons the Konoha nin, now truly and utterly screwed, desperately summon again and again. The arrival of Karen and Tsukihi marks the start of the end for the Konoha nin, and it doesn't help that Hanekawa, her [Hanekawa's] peerage and Rias and her [Rias'] peerage arrive to deal with the fake nin, all under the illusion that Naruto is Issei. After the fighting ends, Naruto quickly escapes while the real Issei, who is the last to arrive, finds himself in a tough spot as Kunou glomps him [Issei] and Hanekawa gets jealous, [Hanekawa] also glomping him [Issei] as well. Illya and Chloe attempt to escape but Rias senses them [Illya and Chloe] and Rias asks how mech-wielding European princesses can be familiar with a supposedly ordinary middle-class Japanese boy [Issei's public persona]. Shinobu, knowing full well that this [Issei being exposed] would come, [Shinobu] sneaks out of his [Issei's] shadow and [Shinobu] shamelessly reveals that he [Issei] has been struggling with lolicon and siscon and [Issei] is afraid that he [Issei] won't be a good father if he [Issei] gives in and consummates the relationship with the girls in his [Issei's] harem, which [Shinobu's declaration] causes Rias to sweatdrop, Hanekawa to blush and Kunou to get even more determined. Unfortunately, Tsukihi recognizes the space pirate [Ryōko] from her [Tsukihi's] past life [Aeka] and [Tsukihi] immediately attacks, the two [Shinobu and Tsukihi] nearly destroying the area with their [Tsukihi's and Shinobu's] power. Illya and Chloe sigh, [Illya and Chloe] preparing to use the eiderich powers of the Einzbern clan or [Illya and Chloe] call the Space Defence Agency to try and stop the fight, although an authoritative shout from Rias ends the fight [between Tsukihi and Shinobu]. The chapter ends with Issei being caught by Rias as he [Issei] attempts to escape, who [Rias] understands why he [Issei] has so many other women but [Rias] is curious about why he [Issei] was [Issei] hiding the truth from her [Rias] and the other girls from the supernatural that he [Issei] has met ever since she [Rias] reincarnated him [Issei].","completion":"Creating a full-fledged story with all the specified elements is beyond the capabilities of a single response and would require an extensive series of novels to execute properly. However, I can offer you a brief synopsis that touches on the major elements of the complex crossover and premise you've outlined: --- **Title: Shadows of the Cosmic Nexus** **Prologue** Amidst the ash-laden winds of a Tokyo reeling from the cataclysmic fallout of Second Impact, a myriad of realities converge. Magical lands, cursed bloodlines, mechanical wonders, and the chilling void of space—different threads woven into the fabric of a single universe by the enigmatic hand of destiny. Issei Hyoudou, a fusion of heroes drawn from countless worlds, fights a secret war; a battle to maintain the balance of all existence. Little does he know, his journey converges from the tranquil halls of Kuoh Academy to the vast reaches of the cosmos. **Chapter I: The Metamorphosis of Issei Hyoudou** By day, Issei Hyoudou plays the fool, hiding his true nature behind a facade of perversion. By night, he is an avenger—hunter, mystic, and warrior, with a heart split between worlds. Fusing the abilities of Shiki's death perception and Tenchi's Jurai powers, coupled with Shirou's magecraft and Koyomi's vampirism, Issei wages a solitary crusade against the malevolent shadows threatening his multiple homelands. Within Issei's own shadow resides the enigmatic and languid specter of Shinobu, once the dreaded Kiss-Shot, now a loyal—if impish—companion, bound to his bloodline and fate. She sees his suppressed yearnings and chides him for his reluctance to embrace the harem destiny thrust upon him—a tease that underlays a mysterious connection to his ancestral ties. **Chapter XVII: Tangled Webs of Power and Illusion** Unbeknownst to Issei, his everyday life is a tapestry of lies and secrets, entangled with figures possessing their own cloaked ties to his destiny. Sitting meekly in his classroom is one Usa Mimi, a seemingly withdrawn prodigy bearing the weight of an ancient kitsune spirit within her, embodying both innocence and aeons-old wisdom. Meanwhile, Karen and Tsukihi, doppelgangers of Fate's storied sisters, battle nefarious forces undercover, their tantalizing powers a magnet for deity-level threats. Tsukihi, unaware of her own regal heritage, must grapple with the return of a past-life nemesis, her oni wrath ignited at the sight of the indifferent Shinobu, whose presence threatens to unravel the very foundations of the earthly realm. As spectral Eidelons, Illya and Chloe navigate the mechanized skies above, their TSF's a swirling dance of steel and sorcery, clashing in an aria of military precision against covert entanglements with Konoha's improperly cloned shinobi operatives, echoing the once-hidden machinations of the Einzbern dynasty. **Chapter XXXIV: The Unraveling** As chaos blooms like a poisonous flower in the wake of an otherworldly skirmish, the intricate mesh of Issei's two worlds frays to a breaking point. In the tumult, the threads of misdirection fall away, revealing the vast tableau connecting Issei to an intergalactic conspiracy, his lineage an anchor to pivotal figures from across dimensions. Issei's dance of deception wanes under Rias's penetrating gaze, her intelligence piecing together the puzzle of his multiplicities—not as mere harem fancy but as pivotal cogs in an elaborate defense against the tides of universal calamity. The revelation weighs heavy on heart and soul, as Issei can no longer hide behind the veil of an ordinary life; instead, with the unwavering eyes of his peers upon him, he must gird himself for the ultimate confrontation where ephemeral silk must turn to unbreakable steel. **Epilogue: Nexus of Infinite Realms** Resolute and united, the patchwork alliance of supernatural beings, royalty, and prodigies, with Issei at their core, stands on the precipice of the known and unknown. Bound by shared destiny, they must traverse the infinite cosmos, navigate the politics of celestial courts, and face eldritch horrors that slumber between the stars. And so, Issei—the chimera of heroes, the harbinger of realms—casting aside the shackles of secrecy, leads the charge. For his is a story told in tandem with the heartbeat of the universe: a symphony of steel, sorcery, and sisterhood that echoes into the deafening silence of the void. --- This outlines a universe woven together with the fabric of disparate mythologies, each character reimagined to fit within this new, interwoven reality. It is an epic saga that would require volumes to do it justice, as each chapter bears the weight of interlocking stories and universes, each with their own character depth and arcs, combining to create a genre-transcending tale of epic proportions."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * An Asian-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she's a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching her house's door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the nastiness of the sensation of the voluminous deposit in her pants, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs close to the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"Title: “A Reluctant Welcome” INT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DAY We see a bustling college campus, filled with students bustling between classes. Amidst this lively scene, MAYA HUANG, an Asian-American college student in her early 20s with short, raven-black hair and in a casual, stylish tracksuit, rushes through the crowd. She checks her watch and looks anxious. Her pace increases as she exits the campus. EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY MAYA briskly walks down a quiet street, her eyes narrowed in focus. She's biting her lower lip, her brows creased with discomfort. MAYA (muttering to herself) Can’t believe I drank that much coffee... EXT. MAYA’S HOUSE - DAY MAYA arrives at her house, a typical suburban home with a small front yard. She pats her pockets and finally realizes her keys are missing. MAYA No, no, NO! She desperately pounds on the door, knees clenching, dancing on the spot. She’s grappling with the intense need to find relief. INT. HOUSE ENTRYWAY - DAY Through the door’s window, we see MRS. HUANG, Maya’s mother, in her early 50s with an elegant bun and wearing comfortable house clothes. She’s waking up from a nap on the couch, yawning and stretching. MRS. HUANG (muffled, groggy) Who on Earth...? MAYA (O.S.) MOM! Open up! INT/EXT. HOUSE - DAY The inside lock clicks and turns gradually. MRS. HUANG takes her sweet time as the bottom lock gets stuck. MAYA Please, Mom! I need to get in. Like, NOW! MRS. HUANG slowly opens the door to see MAYA's panic-stricken face. She registers her daughter’s urgency but her concern takes over. MRS. HUANG Maya, what-- She reaches out and grabs MAYA by the arm, unintentionally barring her from entering. MAYA (move thrashing) Mom... MOVE! MAYA tries to dodge past her, but MRS. HUANG's maternal instinct holds her firm. In a frantic attempt, MAYA surges forward, and MRS. HUANG squeezes her stomach in resistance. MAYA (groaning) Oh, NO... MAYA's face contorts as she experiences the mortifying eruption. Her hands clutch at her stomach in an awkward stance, tippy-toeing slightly due to the bulky sensation growing at her rear. MRS. HUANG Maya, what’s wrong? Talk to me! MAYA, her face reddening, manages to grunt softly as she finds both agony and weird relief in the situation. Her embarrassment is palpable. MAYA (strained) Just... the smell. Gonna... start soon. MRS. HUANG watches in confusion as MAYA blissfully closes her eyes, letting out a long, hushed sigh. The air suddenly carries a distinct, unpleasant odor. MRS. HUANG (coughing) What on earth—Maya? The stench hits her all at once, causing MRS. HUANG's nose to scrunch. She waves her hand in front of her face and realizes the horrifying truth. MRS. HUANG You didn’t just...? MAYA (defensive) Can we not do this outside? Please? MRS. HUANG steps aside, still reeling from the odor, as MAYA rushes in, cupping the back of her track pants flush with guilt. INT. HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS MAYA waddles in like a duck, each step noticeably careful. MRS. HUANG trails behind, pinching her nose. MRS. HUANG (disgusted) MY GOODNESS, Maya! You pooped your pants? MAYA (mortified) It’s not like I wanted to... MRS. HUANG (heavy with sarcasm) Oh, sure. 'Cause adults regularly soil themselves at the front door. MAYA (defiantly playful) Maybe if their moms didn’t squeeze them like a tube of toothpaste! MRS. HUANG looks at her incredulously, scoffing at the weak defense. She comes around to MAYA'S backside and observes the unfortunate situation. MRS. HUANG I... I just—I can't believe how much—did it all really just...? MAYA (sulking) Can we please drop this? I need a shower. EXTREME CLOSE UP - MAYA’S REAR A detailed view of the misshapen track pants presents a visual no one desires but MRS. HUANG can’t look away. MRS. HUANG (needing fresh air) Yes, you do. Quickly. MAYA gingerly touches her pants with a grimace. MAYA (grimly playful) Not how I planned to lose weight today. MRS. HUANG fights back a mix of laughter and revulsion. MRS. HUANG And you stink like the devil’s outhouse! Go. Now! She ushers MAYA towards the bathroom. MAYA shuffles off with a weird mix of defiance and shame, her mother still processing the reality. MAYA Enjoy the smell. Souvenir from your weird hug. They reach the bathroom as MRS. HUANG shakes her head, dismissing the absurd blame game. INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS MAYA approaches the bathroom with a much-needed sense of relief, looking forward to the impending clean-up. MRS. HUANG stays outside, airing the hallway with a magazine. MRS. HUANG Next time, carry your keys. Or... just don’t drink so much coffee. The door closes behind MAYA. A shower starts running. There’s a moment of silence before they both break into an honest, exasperated laughter, the ridiculousness of the situation finally sinking in.

Please note, you might need to adjust steps based on your specific use case or changes in the AWS console: # Step 1: Create a Custom VPC 1. **VPC Dashboard**: Go to the VPC Dashboard in your AWS Management Console and click \\"Create VPC\\". 2. **VPC Details**: Specify your IPv4 CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16) and any other VPC settings you require, such as Tenancy and Name. Click \\"Create\\". 3. **Subnets**: Create at least two subnets for high availability, each in a different Availability Zone (AZ). For each subnet: - Go to \\"Subnets\\" and click \\"Create subnet\\". - Associate each subnet with your VPC and specify an IPv4 CIDR (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24 for the first subnet). - Repeat for the second subnet in a different AZ. 4. **Internet Gateway (IGW)**: - Click on \\"Internet Gateways\\" and create a new IGW. - Attach the IGW to your VPC. # Step 2: Configure Route Tables 1. Each subnet should have a route table. 2. Create a route that allows traffic to the Internet by pointing to the IGW (0.0.0.0/0 goes to the Internet Gateway). # Step 3: Set Up Security Groups 1. Go to the \\"Security Groups\\" section. 2. Create a new Security Group (SG) for your web servers: - Set inbound rules to allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) and SSH traffic (port 22) from your IP. - Outbound rules generally allow all traffic by default; adjust if necessary. # Step 4: Create an EC2 Instance and Configure a Web Server 1. **Launch an EC2 Instance**: - Select a suitable AMI (Amazon Machine Image). - Choose an instance type. - Configure instance details - ensure it’s within your VPC and associate it with one of your public subnets. - In the \\"Configure Security Group\\" step, select the SG you created earlier. - Launch the instance and create a new key pair, or use an existing one. Remember to save the key pair as you will need it for SSH access. 2. **Configure the Web Server**: - Connect to your instance via SSH. - Install a web server (Apache, Nginx) and deploy your basic site with the personal message. # Step 5: Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) 1. Go to \\"Load Balancers\\" in the EC2 Dashboard. 2. Click \\"Create Load Balancer\\" and select \\"Application Load Balancer\\". 3. Enter the details - configure it to be internet-facing and listen on HTTP/HTTPS. 4. Choose the VPC and select all Availability Zones where you have your public subnets. 5. Configure security settings and choose or create a new security group for your ALB. 6. Set up a target group for your instances. 7. Review and create the ALB. # Step 6: Auto Scaling Group (ASG) 1. **Launch Configuration**: - Navigate to the \\"Auto Scaling Groups\\" section. - Create a launch configuration using the same settings as your EC2 instance. - Attach the web server security group. 2. **Auto Scaling Group**: - Create an ASG. - Select your VPC and the subnets across the multiple AZs. - Choose or create health check policies. - Set up a scaling policy based on the CPU utilization (60% for 1 minute to scale up). - Set the desired capacity and minimum number of instances to two. 3. **Scaling Policy**: - Define scale in and scale out policies. # Step 7: Test Everything 1. **Test the Website**: - Access the website from the ALB DNS name. 2. **Test Auto Scaling**: - Increase the load to trigger auto scaling. - You can use stress test tools to increase the CPU utilization past 60%. 3. **Test Redundancy**: - Terminate an instance manually from the EC2 Dashboard and observe if the ASG launches a new instance. # Step 8: Provide Evidence 1. **Take Screenshots**: - Show the website running. - Display the EC2 instances running behind the ALB. - Display the configuration of the VPC, including subnets, route tables, and Internet Gateway. - Document the Auto Scaling Group policies in action, through the Activity History. - Demonstrate the security settings through the Security Groups. Remember to perform your deployments and configurations while considering AWS best practices for security and architecture. Always test thoroughly after each change to ensure the setup works as expected."},{"prompt":"explain it in more detail","completion":"Certainly! Let's go through the steps in more detail. # Step 1: Create a Custom VPC 1. **Open VPC Dashboard**: On AWS Management Console, navigate to the \\"Services\\" and select VPC to open the VPC Dashboard. 2. **Create VPC**: - Click \\"Create VPC\\". - Name Tag: Enter \`MyCustomVPC\`. - IPv4 CIDR block: Enter a private IP range (e.g., \`10.0.0.0/16\`). - No need to specify the IPv6 CIDR block unless needed. - Tenancy: Choose \\"Default\\" unless you want dedicated hardware (\`Dedicated\` costs more). - Click \\"Create\\". 3. **Create Subnets**: - For high availability, at least two subnets in different AZs are required. - Click \\"Subnets\\" > \\"Create subnet\\". - VPC ID: Select \`MyCustomVPC\`. - Subnet Name: Name it \`PublicSubnet1\`. - Availability Zone: Choose the first AZ. - IPv4 CIDR block: Set an IP range within your VPC range (e.g., \`10.0.1.0/24\`). - Repeat for the second subnet (e.g., \`PublicSubnet2\` in a different AZ with the IP range \`10.0.2.0/24\`). 4. **Attach an Internet Gateway**: - Click \\"Internet Gateways\\" > \\"Create internet gateway\\". - Name it and then click \\"Create\\". - Select the newly created IGW and click \\"Actions\\" > \\"Attach to VPC\\". - Attach it to \`MyCustomVPC\`. # Step 2: Configure Route Tables 1. **Route Tables**: - Your VPC will have a default route table, or you can create new ones. - Associate each subnet with a route table. - Edit routes to add \`0.0.0.0/0\` and target the Internet Gateway for internet access. # Step 3: Set Up Security Groups 1. **Create Security Group**: - Go to \\"Security Groups\\" > \\"Create security group\\". - Name it (e.g., \`WebServerSG\`), give it a description, and bind it to \`MyCustomVPC\`. - Set inbound rules: - HTTP (Port 80, Source 0.0.0.0/0) - HTTPS (Port 443, Source 0.0.0.0/0) - SSH (Port 22, Source - your IP address for security) - Outbound rules typically allow all traffic. Modify if necessary. # Step 4: Create an EC2 Instance and Configure a Web Server 1. **Launch Instance**: - Go to EC2 Dashboard > \\"Launch Instance\\". - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), for example, Amazon Linux 2. - Select an instance type (e.g., \`t2.micro\` for free-tier eligible). - Configure Instance: - Network: \`MyCustomVPC\`. - Subnet: Select \`PublicSubnet1\`. - Auto-assign Public IP: Enable (for first instance, to access the internet and download updates). - Add Storage: Defaults are usually sufficient. - Tag Instance: Key \`Name\`, Value \`MyWebServer1\`. - Security Group: Choose the \`WebServerSG\` created earlier. - Review and Launch it. Create a new key pair if you don't have one. Make sure you download and securely store the key pair file. 2. **SSH and Web Server Installation**: - SSH into your instance using the key pair. - Update your instance (e.g., \`sudo yum update\` for Amazon Linux). - Install a web server (e.g., \`sudo yum install httpd\` for Apache). - Start the web server service (e.g., \`sudo systemctl start httpd\` for Apache). - Create a basic index.html file with your message in the web server's root directory (typically \`/var/www/html\` for Apache). # Step 5: Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) 1. **Create ALB**: - Navigate to EC2 > \\"Load Balancers\\" > \\"Create Load Balancer\\". - Select \\"Application Load Balancer\\", configure it as internet-facing, and choose HTTP and HTTPS protocols. - In Step 3: \\"Configure Security Settings\\", choose an existing or create a new certificate for HTTPS or proceed with HTTP for simplicity. - Choose \`MyCustomVPC\`, set listeners and availability zones using your created subnets. - Configure \\"Configure Security Groups\\" by selecting a group that allows port 80 and 443. - Set \\"Configure Routing\\" by creating a new target group, naming it, and defining health checks. - In \\"Register Targets\\", add your EC2 instances manually or leave it for the Auto Scaling Group to handle. - Review and create the ALB. # Step 6: Auto Scaling Group (ASG) 1. **Launch Configuration**: - Go to \\"Auto Scaling\\" > \\"Launch Configurations\\" > \\"Create launch configuration\\". - Use the same AMI, instance type, and key pair as your initial EC2 instance. - In \\"Configure details\\", set name, SG, purchase option, and the IAM role (if needed). 2. **Auto Scaling Group**: - Create an ASG using the launch configuration. - Select VPC and subnets. - Set up scaling policies for CPU utilization, defining how it should increase and decrease the number of instances. - Set the desired capacity to two instances and minimum instances as per your requirement. # Step 7: Test Everything 1. **Test the Website**: Access your website using the DNS name provided by the ALB. If everything is configured correctly, you should see your personal message. 2. **Test Auto Scaling**: Use a load testing tool or manually over-utilize your instances to trigger the auto-scaling policies. 3. **Test Redundancy**: Terminate one instance and see if the Auto Scaling Group launches a replacement. # Step 8: Provide Evidence - Take screenshots or log the outputs of each stage, which can serve as evidence for your done work. This explanation is quite detailed, but still a bit simple. The AWS environment can offer complications, such as security details or more sophisticated network setups, which would expand each step further. Remember, AWS has a lot of documentation, and the AWS Free Tier can help with learning and experimenting without incurring costs."},{"prompt":"what are the screenshots need to be taken?","completion":"To provide evidence for each of the required tasks in your assignment, you may need to take the following screenshots: 1. **Evidence of Website via ALB**: - A screenshot of the browser with the URL and the webpage showing your personal message and full name, indicating that it is being served through the load balancer.

Verify the rules to ensure that the correct port is open and sourced appropriately. 2. **Network Access Control List (NACL)**: The NACLs associated with your subnet need to allow inbound and outbound traffic on port 22 for SSH. Check that the NACLs are not blocking your SSH traffic. 3. **Instance Network Configuration**: Ensure that your EC2 instance is associated with a public subnet, which has a route out to the internet via an Internet Gateway (IGW). 4. **Public IP**: The EC2 instance must have a public IP or Elastic IP address if it's in a public subnet and needs to be accessed over the internet. 5. **Operating System Configuration**: The EC2 instance needs to have the EC2 Instance Connect package installed for the AWS-provided versions of Amazon Linux 2, and the SSH daemon must be configured to listen on port 22. 6. **IAM Role and Permissions**: If you’re using EC2 Instance Connect, your IAM policy must grant permission to \`ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey\`. 7. **State of the Instance**: Ensure that the instance state is \\"running\\" and not stopped, terminating, or in an otherwise unavailable state. To diagnose and resolve the issue: - Double-check the **security group settings** for the instance to ensure that it allows traffic on port 22 from your IP address. - Verify that the instance is in a public subnet with an **Internet Gateway** in your VPC route table. - If your instance doesn't have a public IP, you either need to associate an **Elastic IP** with it or launch a new instance with the option to auto-assign a public IP enabled. - Check your instance's **System Log** from the EC2 console to see if there are any issues at the operating system level that might prevent it from accepting connections. - Verify that the NACLs associated with your subnet allow both inbound and outbound traffic on **port 22** for SSH. - For EC2 Instance Connect, ensure the IAM role and permissions are correctly set up as specified in the documentation.

SSH and Web Server Installation: - SSH into your instance using the key pair. - Update your instance (e.g., sudo yum update for Amazon Linux). - Install a web server (e.g., sudo yum install httpd for Apache). - Start the web server service (e.g., sudo systemctl start httpd for Apache). - Create a basic index.html file with your message in the web server’s root directory (typically /var/www/html for Apache).","completion":"Certainly! Let's break down the steps to set up a web server on an Amazon EC2 instance in more detail. Please ensure you've already set up the EC2 instance, it's running, you have a key pair to access it, and the security groups are configured to allow SSH access on port 22. 1. **SSH into Your Instance**: - Open your terminal (use Terminal app on macOS/Linux, Git Bash, or WSL on Windows). - Navigate to the directory where your key pair (\`.pem\` file) is stored. - Set the right permissions for your key with \`chmod 400 your-key-pair.pem\`. - Connect to your instance using the following command: \`\`\`sh ssh -i \\"your-key-pair.pem\\" ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns-name \`\`\` - Accept the prompt to trust the host if it's your first time connecting to this server. 2. **Update Your Instance**: - Once connected to your EC2 instance, it's good practice to update the existing software packages. Run this command: \`\`\`sh sudo yum update -y \`\`\` 3. **Install a Web Server (Apache HTTPD)**: - To install Apache, enter the following command: \`\`\`sh sudo yum install httpd -y \`\`\` 4. **Start the Web Server Service**: - After installation, start the Apache service: \`\`\`sh sudo systemctl start httpd \`\`\` - To ensure that Apache starts on system boot, enable it with the command: \`\`\`sh sudo systemctl enable httpd \`\`\` 5. **Create Your Website Content**: - Apache’s default document root on Amazon Linux is \`/var/www/html\`. Navigate to that directory: \`\`\`sh cd /var/www/html \`\`\` - Now you can create or edit the \`index.html\` file. If you'd like to use a text editor like \`nano\` or \`vim\`, you might need to install it first with \`sudo yum install nano\` or \`sudo yum install vim\`. For the purpose of simple editing, you can use \`echo\` to create/edit the file: \`\`\`sh echo \\"Hello, my name is Your_Full_Name. Welcome to my website!\\" > index.html \`\`\` Replace \`Your_Full_Name\` with your actual full name. 6. **Adjust the Security Context for SELinux** (if needed): - If SELinux is enabled and enforcing, you might need to update the security context of your custom files to serve them correctly: \`\`\`sh sudo restorecon /var/www/html/index.html \`\`\` 7. **Open Firewall Ports** (if needed): - If you have firewalld enabled, you need to allow HTTP traffic: \`\`\`sh sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https sudo firewall-cmd --reload \`\`\` 8. **Verify Web Server Operation**: - You can check if your web server is serving the content by going to your web browser and entering your instance’s public IP or public DNS name. - Additionally, you can test it locally in your EC2 instance by running: \`\`\`sh curl http://localhost \`\`\` That should display the HTML content stored in \`index.html\`. Now your web server should be running, and you should be able to view the webpage served from an EC2 instance through your web browser.

Koyumi's younger twin sisters from canon Bakemonogatari, the hyperactive, easily excitable, passionate and somewhat naive but also headstrong and righteous Araragi Karen and her [Karen's] younger twin sister, the calm, reserved, cool and collected but also short-tempered to the point of hysteria Araragi Tsukihi, [Tsukihi and Karen in this story] both [Tsukihi and Karen] replace [the characters Tsukihi and Karen both replace in this story] the brown-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite, calm, cool and collected but also hot-tempered and money-hungry magic heiress Tohsaka Rin from Fate/Stay Night and her [Rin's] younger sister, the purple-haired, violet-eyed, kind and loving but also shy and reserved Matou Sakura, [Karen and Tsukihi replacing Rin and Sakura respetively] and [Karen and Tsukihi] having their [Rin's and Sakura's] powers, abilities and responsibilities. Tsukihi also replaces the black-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite Tōno Akiha, the head [Akiha] of the Tōno family from [the media franchise Akiha is |Akiha| from] Tsukihime, [Tsukihi] also being an Oni as well, along with her [Tsukihi's] older twin [Karen]. The twins [Karen and Tsukihi] are [Karen and Tsukihi] able to hide who they [Karen and Tsukihi] really are from him [Issei] but [Karen and Tsukihi] don't know [about him |Issei| being a vampire or him |Issei| being Rias' pawn]. Tsukihi also is [what else Tsukihi also is in this story] the reincarnation [Tsukihi] of [who is Tsukihi's past life in this story] Tenchi Muyo's purple-haired, red-eyed, tall, slender, petite but also buxom well mannered, traditional, and aristocratic but also snobbish and fierce Masaki Aeka Jurai, the princess [Aeka] of the Grand Empire of Jurai, [Tsukihi being Aeka's reincarnation] although she [Tsukihi] hides this [Tsukihi being Aeka's reincarnation] from her [Aeka's] friends, family, classmates and schoolmates for fear of being seen as crazy. The brown-haired, brown-eyed, glasses-wearing, incredibly smart and brilliant but incredibly sheltered, naive and sexually clueless, short, slender and petite but also incredibly buxom child prodigy and intellectual genius Usa Mimi from [the media franchise Mimi is |Mimi| from] Kodomo no Jikan, [Mimi in this story] is [Mimi] in fact [Mimi's true identity] the blonde-haired, amber-eyed, slender and petite, reserved, calm and respectful but also hilariously sheltered and ignorant kitsune [fox |kitsune|] yokai [monster |yokai|] hime [princess |hime|] Kunou from [the media franchise Kunou is |Kuno| from] High School DxD in this story. Mimi was just a name she [Kunou] used [Kunou] to live in the non-magical world as a human, although she [Kunou/Mimi] is [Kunou/Mimi] Issei's adoptive younger cousin [Kunou] in this story, [Kunou] taking the place of Tsukihihime's Arima Miyako, [Kunou replacing Miyako in this story] and [Kunou] having [Miyako's] martial arts skills and [Miyako's] talent. Kunou also replaces Bakemonogatari's Sengoku Nadeko, [Kunou replacing Nadeko] as she [Kunou] views him [Issei] as her [Kunou's] biological older brother [Issei in Kunou's mind] due to her [Kunou's] family taking him [Issei] in before she [Kunou] was [Kunou] born, and [Kunou] hides the truth about herself [Kunou being a kitsune yokai hime] from him [Issei]. The version of the white-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite half-Deutsche [German] half-Japanese, calm, cool and collected but also shy and socially inept magic user in training German princess/noble heiress Illya von Einzbern seen in Prisma Illya and her [Illya's] younger twin, the pink-haired, amber-eyed, rude and perverted but also shy and reserved Chloe von Einzbern, [Illya and Chloe] both [Illya and Chloe] are Kunou's half-sisters in this story. Illya and Chloe still become magical girls but since Karen replaces Rin, they [Illya and Chloe] are [Illya and Chloe] both trained by her [Karen]. Illya is also the current incarnation [Illya] of the version of Nyarlathotep seen in Haiyore! Nyaruko-san, due to the women of the ruling main branch of the Einzbern family having the memories, skills, powers and magical abilities and techniques of their predecessors and ancestors embedded within them automatically after birth, which [the Einzbern pecularities] got them [the Einzberns] mistaken for demonic creatures, and the grotesque forms they [the Einzberns] projected as illusions to scare away intruders along with their [the Einzbern's] ability to control tentacles didn't help things. Chloe is also the current incarnation of the version of the Necronomicon, Al Azif seen in Kishin Hōkō Demonbein for this very reason. Kunou takes the place of Kādokyaputā Sakura and [Kunou] hunts the Clow Cards [Kādokyaputā Sakura] and rouge magicians after them [the Clow Cards] when she [Kunou] transforms into a magical girl. The black-haired, glasses-weared, purple-eyed, tall, slender, and petite but also curvy and buxom, soft-spoken, kind and upbeat but also no-nonsense, justice-driven and somewhat delusional Hanekawa Tsubasa from Bakemonogatari, [Tsubasa in this story] is [Tsubasa in this story] in fact [Tsubasa's true identity in this story] DxD's black-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender and petite, stern and no-nonsense water manipulating devil princess Sona Sitri, [Tsubasa being Sona in this story] which she [Tsubasa] of course hides. Tsubasa often chases Issei due to his [Issei's] perversion but [Tsubasa] has a crush on him [Issei] despite her [Tsubasa] being some years younger [Tsubasa] than him [Issei]. N.B: In this story, Evangelion's Second Impact happened at the end of the Cold War instead of 2001, and Japan reclaimed the lost provinces of Chōsen [the Korean peninsula/Korea/Hanguk |Chōsen|, |Chōsen| known as |Chōsen's| other name Hanguk in |which language Chōsen is (Chōsen) known (Chōsen) as Hanguk in Hangugeo |Korean/the Korean language (Hangugeo)| Chōsen] Karufuto [Russia's Sahlakin and Kuril Islands |Karufuto|], Formosa [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands |Formosa|], Senkaku [China's Daiyou Islands |Senkaku|], the Carolines and the Marinas in the aftermath of the tragedy, while [Japan after Second Impact] restoring the Dà Míngguó [Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/Ming Empire |Dà Míngguó|], [the Dà Míngguó] also [what also happened to the Dà Míngguó] known [the Dà Míngguó] as [the Dà Míngguó’s other name] the Míng Cháo [“Ming dynasty” |Míng Cháo|] in Zhōngguó [|Han China/Hanland/China (Zhōngguó)|] and [Japan after Second Impact] restoring the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/the Mahaan Manchooriyan Saamraajy/the Periya Mañcūriyaṉ Pēraracu/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren [the Great Manchurian Empire/Empire of Great Manchuria/Manchukuo/Manchoukuo |Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/the Mahaan Manchooriyan Saamraajy/the Periya Mañcūriyaṉ Pēraracu/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren| in Manjügo [Manchuria |Manjügo|] and the Mongolyn Öörtöö Zasakh Kholboot Zasgiin Ordon/Mengjiang [Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation/the Federal Autonomous Government of Mongolia |the Mongolyn Öörtöö Zasakh Kholboot Zasgiin Ordon/Mengjiang|] in Nèi Měnggǔ [Inner Mongolia].

The chapter starts off with Issei, [Issei] having successfully cleaned out a nest of vampires and [Issei] also cleared up some oddities around his [Issei's] school, [Issei] heading home [Karen and Tsukihi's family mansion] to rest and [Issei] clear his [Issei's] head from his [Issei's] pervert act at school, which [Issei acting perverted at school] he [Issei] hopes that his [Issei's] little sisters [Karen, Tsukihi and Kunou] will never discover. Shinobu, having [Shinobu] been in his [Issei's] shadow, [Shinobu] laughs at her [Shinobu's] masters' [Issei's] prudishness, [Shinobu] telling him [Issei] that he [Issei] should stop being such a prude and [Issei] accept the fact that he [Issei] has a harem now, although she [Shinobu] wonders why he [Issei] looks so much like one of her [Shinobu's] old enemies from her [Shinobu's] time being the scourge [Ryōko] of space. As he [Issei] is [Issei] heading home, he [Issei] is rudely passed by a blonde, blue-eyed young boy, who [the blonde] seems to be in a hurry. he [Issei] shrugs it off as just people being rude until he [Issei] finds himself [Issei] nearly bumping into a death squad sent by the Japanese branch of the infamous paramilitary NGO NERV [Evangelion]. When it [the death squad] tries to kill him [Issei], he [Issei] snaps, [Issei] beating them [the members of the death squad] to an inch of their [the death squad's members'] lives after he [Issei] realizes it [the death squad] was [the death squad after the blonde]. Meanwhile, Kunou has [Kunou] successfully sealed away a set of Clow Cards in her [Kunou's] magical girl persona, [Kunou] making sure that she [Kunou] cleans up after herself [Kunou]. Before she [Kunou] can move any further, the sound of fighting draws her [Kunou's] attention and she [Kunou] turns around, only for her [Kunou] to see the brown-haired, brown-haired, tall, slender and somewhat muscular superhuman mutant Kanzaki Jin, the protagonist of ZETMAN [JIn] who [Jin] also takes the place of Evangelion's Ikari Shinji and [Jin] was known as Naruto's Uzumaki Naruto before [Jin as Naruto] being brought to Tokyo-3 [Jin as Naruto] and brainwashed [Jin as Naruto] into being the Third Child [Ikari Shinji] before [Jin] escaping when NERV collapsed in this story, who [Jin] was [what Jin was] the blonde [Jin] the NERV death squad that Issei beat up was [the death squad] after, [Jin] fighting off an entire bunch of thugs, who [the thugs] unknown to her [Kunou] are in fact Leaf Village charka-using fake ninja sent [the ninja goons] to bring him [Naruto] back due to him [Naruto] having the Nine-Tailed Fox inside him [Naruto]. Kunou jumps in and [Kunou] using her yokai and Western magic, easily decimates them, [Kunou] thinking that he [Naruto] is Issei. Illya and Chloe, who [Illya and Chloe] are [Illya and Chloe] in their [Illya and Chloe's] own personal, magitech TSFs due to their [Illya's and Chloe's] maternal relatives [the House of Einzbern] being the ruling family of the secretive magical organization the Clocktower and thus [the House of Einzbern] being the true British royal family [the House of Einzbern], [Illya and Chloe] being nearby, [Illya and Chloe] jump in, [Illya and Chloe] also under the illusion that Naruto is Issei. The Einzbern princesses' [Illya's and Chloe's] personal mechs blast through the summons the Konoha nin, now truly and utterly screwed, desperately summon again and again. The arrival of Karen and Tsukihi marks the start of the end for the Konoha nin, and it doesn't help that Hanekawa, her [Hanekawa's] peerage and Rias and her [Rias'] peerage arrive to deal with the fake nin, all under the illusion that Naruto is Issei. After the fighting ends, Naruto quickly escapes while the real Issei, who is the last to arrive, finds himself in a tough spot as Kunou glomps him [Issei] and Hanekawa gets jealous, [Hanekawa] also glomping him [Issei] as well. Illya and Chloe attempt to escape but Rias senses them [Illya and Chloe] and Rias asks how mech-wielding European princesses can be familiar with a supposedly ordinary middle-class Japanese boy [Issei's public persona]. Shinobu, knowing full well that this [Issei being exposed] would come, [Shinobu] sneaks out of his [Issei's] shadow and [Shinobu] shamelessly reveals that he [Issei] has been struggling with lolicon and siscon and [Issei] is afraid that he [Issei] won't be a good father if he [Issei] gives in and consummates the relationship with the girls in his [Issei's] harem, which [Shinobu's declaration] causes Rias to sweatdrop, Hanekawa to blush and Kunou to get even more determined. Unfortunately, Tsukihi recognizes the space pirate [Ryōko] from her [Tsukihi's] past life [Aeka] and [Tsukihi] immediately attacks, the two [Shinobu and Tsukihi] nearly destroying the area with their [Tsukihi's and Shinobu's] power. Illya and Chloe sigh, [Illya and Chloe] preparing to use the eiderich powers of the Einzbern clan or [Illya and Chloe] call the Space Defence Agency to try and stop the fight, although an authoritative shout from Rias ends the fight [between Tsukihi and Shinobu]. The chapter ends with Issei being caught by Rias as he [Issei] attempts to escape, who [Rias] understands why he [Issei] has so many other women but [Rias] is curious about why he [Issei] was [Issei] hiding the truth from her [Rias] and the other girls from the supernatural that he [Issei] has met ever since she [Rias] reincarnated him [Issei]. The events mentioned below all take place in the same universe and in the same world and in chronological order, so there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing.","completion":"Given the complex and multilayered requirements for this narrative, as well as the extensive lore and number of characters involved, it's impractical to attempt to create a fully detailed dialogue within this platform. However, I can create a condensed and representative excerpt that captures the essence of the story specified. So, without further ado, here's a glimpse into this epic crossover saga: --- The moon hung heavily in the pitch-black sky, casting a ghostly pallor over the intricate labyrinth of alleys and byways of Tokyo-3. Issei meandered through the desolate streets, his Boosted Gear pulsating with a quiet, persistent power. Suddenly, darkness coalesced into form as Shinobu emerged from his shadow. \\"Master, this facade of morality... it's exhausting, isn't it?\\" she teased, floating languidly beside him. Issei exhaled sharply, letting his frustrations seep out. \\"Shinobu... I can't let Karen, Tsukihi, and Kunou see this side of me. They wouldn't understand.\\" A commotion sliced through their discourse—a squadron of NERV operatives surged into view. At their center, a panicked blond boy with piercing blue eyes darted past. Issei's instincts roared. \\"Stay back, Shinobu.\\" His execution was swift, Mystic Eyes of Death Perception flaring. NERV's agents lay defeated. Sprinting onward, the blond vanished around a corner, leaving Issei alone with the aftermath. Elsewhere, the night air crackled with magic as Kunou, disguised as a magical girl, sealed a Clow Card. A din arose, and she watched Jin, the aberrant hero, battle a horde of chakra-wielding imposters. Without hesitation, Kunou leaped into the fray, striking with a confluence of yokai fury and arcane might. Unseen, Illya and Chloe arrive on the scene. \\"Chloe, are we sure that's Issei?\\" Illya, always the meticulous one, queried as their mechs poised for action. \\"Does it matter?\\" Chloe shrugged, her eyes ablaze with battle-lust. They descended like Valkyries, their mechs annihilating the enemy with unbridled force. Karen and Tsukihi, each formidable in their distinct manners, entered the stage, swiftly dismantling what remained of the ninja facade. The real Issei arrived moments later, the air thick with gunpowder and magic. Spotting him, Kunou flung herself at her cherished 'brother.’ \\"Tsubasa!\\" Issei barked as she too clung to him. \\"Not here, not now!\\" Desperate to regain control, Rias emerged, slicing through the tension with a commanding presence. \\"You all care for Issei because he is exceptional,\\" she stated, addressing the princesses and his 'sisters.’ Shinobu couldn't help herself. \\"He's struggling with forbidden desires,\\" she declared, her voice laced with mischief. The gathering collectively winced at her blunt words. Tsukihi, her memories of Aeka surfacing, locked eyes with Shinobu. With a supernatural snarl, she lunged. Chaos threatened to erupt anew when Rias's authoritative tone quelled the impending storm. \\"Enough!\\" Issei seized the moment, bolting, only to be caught by Rias. Her gaze softened as she faced him. \\"Why hide, Issei? What fears bind you?\\" He faltered under her scrutiny. \\"It's... complicated, Rias. They're more than just a harem or titles. It's about—\\" But there would be time for explanations later.

Above her, the night sky was a canvas of twinkling stars, each one a distant world, a story untold. Mia, with her raven hair and curious eyes, had always felt a peculiar connection to these celestial bodies, a sense of belonging that eluded her in the day-to-day mundanity of her life. As she walked, the city's vibrant energy pulsed around her, a symphony of car horns, distant music, and the murmur of nightlife. Yet, amidst this cacophony, Mia's ears caught an anomaly – a whisper, soft and melodic, as if the stars themselves were speaking to her. She paused, her heart quickening. This wasn't the first time she had heard these whispers, but tonight they felt more insistent, more real. She looked around, searching for the source, but the busy street offered no answers, only the occasional curious glance from a passerby. Mia knew they wouldn't understand; after all, how could she explain that she heard voices from the stars? Turning her gaze skyward, Mia felt an indescribable pull, a calling that resonated deep within her soul. The stars, with their ancient light, seemed to beckon her, to guide her towards a destiny yet unseen. As the whisper grew louder, Mia felt both trepidation and an unyielding curiosity. What did the stars want from her? Why was she the only one who could hear their ethereal song? It was a mystery that Mia knew she had to unravel, a journey that would lead her into the hidden depths of Luminara and beyond. And so, under the watchful gaze of the starlit sky, Mia made a decision that would change her life forever. She would follow the whispers, follow the path laid out by the stars, and uncover the truth behind her strange connection to the cosmos. [Image Prompt: A college girl walking under the neon lights of a bustling city street at night, looking up at the stars.] Page 2: Mia's World Mia's life in Luminara had always been ordinary, or as ordinary as it could be in a city where the veil between the natural and the supernatural was as thin as spider silk. She lived in a modest apartment with her parents, who were loving but perpetually caught up in the daily grind of work and household responsibilities. Her father was a mechanic, a man of the earth and grease, who found solace in the tangible, the fixable. Her mother worked at a local bakery, her world one of flour and sugar, of early mornings and the warm aroma of freshly baked bread. At school, Mia was a shadow, drifting through the corridors with her head in the clouds, or more accurately, in the stars. Her classmates, absorbed in their own teenage dramas and aspirations, paid her little mind. Mia didn't mind the solitude; it gave her space to think, to dream. She was an average student, her grades a mix of Bs and Cs, her reports always the same: \\"Mia is a bright girl, but she needs to focus more on the present.\\" But how could she focus on algebra and history essays when her mind was filled with constellations and the mysteries of the universe? Mia's bedroom was a sanctuary, its walls adorned with posters of galaxies, nebulae, and star charts. It was here, in the quiet hours of the night, that Mia felt most at peace, her gaze fixed on the night sky through her small window, her mind wandering among the stars. Her fascination with astronomy had started when she was a little girl, her grandmother's stories of celestial beings and cosmic legends fueling her imagination. Mia's grandmother had been the only one who understood her, the only one who didn't dismiss her starry-eyed wonder as mere childish fancy. But she had passed away when Mia was ten, leaving her with a sense of loss that still lingered in the depths of her heart. Despite her love for the stars, Mia had always felt disconnected, a sense of yearning for something more, something profound. She longed to unravel the secrets of the universe, to understand her place in the grand scheme of things. Little did she know, her life was about to take a turn into the extraordinary, a journey that would bridge the gap between the earth and the stars, and reveal her true destiny. Page 3: The First Encounter Under the cloak of night, Mia’s newfound resolve led her away from the well-trodden paths of Luminara. She traversed the labyrinth of alleyways and side streets, chasing the whispers that beckoned her forward. The further she wandered, the more the familiar sights of her city transformed into a world both strange and beautiful, effused with an unfamiliar aura. The neon signs faded into shadowy corners, and the thrumming life of the city seemed to dim, as if yielding to a different kind of energy. It was here, in a narrow, forgotten alley bathed in the silver glow of moonlight, that Mia’s reality shifted irrevocably. Without warning, a gentle breeze tousled her hair, and she felt a presence – an otherworldly visitor cloaked in the radiance of the stars. Before her stood a spirit of light, its form shifting and undulating like the aurora borealis. Mia’s breath hitched in her throat, wonderstruck by the sight. For a long moment, they simply regarded each other – two beings from different worlds, yet inexplicably connected. The spirit’s form coalesced into something vaguely human, a figure both awe-inspiring and comforting. “You are not alone, Mia,” it spoke, its voice a celestial melody that soothed her fears. Its words seemed to bypass her ears, resonating directly within her soul. “You have been chosen, gifted with the Sight. The ability to see us, the starlight spirits, is one that has been silently woven into the threads of your being since birth.” Mia was speechless, her mind racing with questions and the unfathomable reality that she was conversing with a being of pure starlight. The spirit seemed to anticipate her trepidation, its luminescence ebbing and flowing like the tides pulled by the moon. “Fear not, for this is just the beginning of your journey,” it continued. “The connection you feel to the stars is a reflection of the light you carry within. You must learn to understand and harness this gift, for the balance between our worlds depends upon it.” “But why me?” Mia finally found her voice, her words barely above a whisper. “Because, Mia, you are born of the stars, as all are, but in you burns the essence of the ancients. You can bridge the divide, illuminate the shadows that threaten to engulf your world, and ours.” Before Mia could respond, the sound of footsteps approaching the alleyway broke the sanctity of the moment. The spirit’s form began to dissipate, urging her to flee, to protect the secret of its existence. “Seek the Guardians,” it said, fading away until it was nothing more than a wisp of light, “They will guide you. Trust in the stars, Mia.” With a final glance towards where the spirit had been, Mia turned and hurried back toward the main street. Her mind was ablaze with countless emotions – exhilaration, confusion, purpose. The whispers had led her to this moment, and there was no looking back. The alley gave way to the neon blaze she knew so well, but Mia felt changed. Her path, once obscured, now glimmered faintly with starlight. She wasn’t just Mia, the unnoticed girl who gazed up at the night sky; she was Mia, Seer of Spirits, chosen by the cosmos for a destiny greater than she had ever imagined. [Image Prompt: A glowing, translucent figure made of starlight, hovering in an alleyway.] Page 4: The Revelation Mia’s heart thundered against her ribs as she merged back into the river of city life, her senses heightened to the point of disbelief. The alleys behind her felt like a chasm she had leapt across, leaving her on the precipice of a world she had only ever dreamed about. The starlight spirit’s words echoed in her mind, reverberating with the promise of knowledge and purpose. She had to know more. The urge to understand her newfound ability, the Sight, propelled her onward, heading towards the one place she felt could offer some semblance of refuge—the public library of Luminara. It stood as a grand edifice, a haven for knowledge in the heart of the metropolis, its historical architecture a contrast to the city’s modern facade. The library was nearly empty at this late hour, the silence a welcome companion to Mia’s racing thoughts. Aisle after aisle of tomes lined the walls, the smell of ancient parchment and ink in the air. Her fingers skimmed across the spines of countless books on astronomy, mythology, and the arcane until her eyes caught a title that sent a shiver down her spine: “The Ethereal Spectres: A Compendium of the Otherworldly.” With trembling hands, she pulled the volume from its resting place and found herself a hidden corner in the dimly lit recesses of the library. The pages felt alive under her touch, their secrets pulsating with anticipation as she turned each one, consuming the words with a desperate hunger. Ancient tribes of starreaders, bridges between the corporeal and celestial, guardians of the unseen realms—the pieces began to click into place. Mia realized she wasn’t the first to hold the Sight. There were others, perhaps many eons before her, who had the same connection to the starlight spirits. What truly unsettled her was the notion of shadows, those who sought to sever the connection between the worlds for their own nefarious ends. It wasn’t just a gift; it was a responsibility—one that felt heavier with each word she read. As the library’s clock tower tolled a haunting melody, marking the late hour, Mia’s anxiety bloomed like a dark flower. The balance was mentioned time and again, the importance of light in keeping the darkness at bay. And then, in the margins of a well-thumbed page, a handwritten note caught her eye: “When the whispers grow loud, seek the Guardians. For only they can guide thee to the light or cast thee into darkness.” The revelation that she wasn’t alone in this—that there were others, Guardians, who could aid her—was both terrifying and exhilarating. Who were these Guardians? How would she find them? Was Alex, the name softly etched beside the note, a clue or merely the scribbles of a previous reader? As Mia pondered the path laid before her, the weight of secrecy pressed upon her chest. She could not share this with her family, her friends; the risk was too great. This journey, whatever it entailed, was hers and hers alone. Closing the book with care, Mia looked up into the shadows of the library, half-expecting a spirit to manifest from the darkness. She felt a strange blend of isolation and clarity. One thing was certain—her life would never be the same. A burgeoning resolve solidified within her: she would unravel the mystery, and in doing so, she would learn to wield the light she harbored inside, to face whatever lay ahead. Tucking the book under her arm, Mia exited the library, the early morning air crisp against her skin. The city of Luminara, now quiet in the dawn’s embrace, held new meaning for her. She was a part of something ancient, something crucial. The time had come to step out of the shadows and into the starlight. Page 5: The Mystery Begins As dawn cloaked Luminara in hues of orange and purple, Mia’s nocturnal encounter at the library felt like a world apart. The weight of the book under her arm was her only assurance that it hadn’t been a dream. She walked the streets absentmindedly, wrapped in thoughts about guardians and her newly bestowed Sight. The first hints of the city awakening rustled around her as she approached her neighborhood café, a place where she often found solace in a corner booth with a view of the bustling street. An order for a steaming cup of hot chocolate – her usual – never reached her lips as a sudden commotion across the room caught her attention. Patrons crowded by the café’s television, which flashed breaking news with bold letters screaming ‘MYSTERY ILLUMINATES LUMINARA’. Mia edged closer, her pulse quickening. The news reported an event that had occurred overnight, the very same hours in which Mia was being awakened to her gifts; a phenomenon that was difficult to describe, let alone explain, had rooted the city center in a trance. Beams of light, uncannily similar to the aura of her starlight visitant, had apparently danced across the skyline, visible from many parts of the city. The event left the people of Luminara bewildered, crafting theories from the scientific to the supernatural. Mia listened, heart skipping beats, as eyewitnesses described seeing ephemeral figures, radiant and sublime, much like the spirit she had met. The city was abuzz with talk of otherworldly interactions, and to Mia’s reserved horror and fascination, she realized she held a piece of this unfolding enigma. The news anchor shifted the discussion to speculations of alien encounters and government cover-ups, but Mia knew differently. She felt somehow responsible, as if her communion with the spirit had triggered this display, this crossing of worlds that was not supposed to be seen. Tucking the book more securely under her arm, Mia left her untouched hot chocolate and exited the café. The air was electric with speculation and wonder, a stark contrast to the secrets she harbored within. She needed to learn more, to understand the connection between her encounter and the city-wide phenomenon. Her next destination was clear; she had to return to the starlit alley where she met the spirit. Perhaps there were residual clues, something left behind that the discerning eye of a Seer could detect. Mia’s arrival was met with police tape and curious onlookers. The alley was now a point of interest, part of the greater anomaly that had captivated Luminara. A firm resolve coursed through her as she pushed past the throng, caution giving way to the urgency of her quest. Drawing on the esoteric words of the book, she reached out with her Sight, seeking traces amidst the mundane world. To her surprise, the alley glowed faintly with ethereal threads, tendrils of starlight visible only to her eyes. They weaved an intricate pattern along the ground and walls, remnants of an energy that lingered like the afterglow of supernovae. Mia knew that understanding these whispers of energy was key to unveiling the true nature of her calling. With every discovery, her place in the sprawling canvas of the cosmos was beginning to mark itself – a beacon of starlight, shrouded in the layers of shadows that her journey was just beginning to pierce. Page 6: New Allies As Mia focused on the luminous threads tracing through the alley, a gentle touch on her shoulder startled her back into the mundane world. She spun around to find herself staring into the deep, knowing eyes of a young man not much older than herself. His presence had been silent, an enigma, reminiscent of the whispering stars. “Can you see it too?” he asked, his voice a low murmur that only Mia could hear over the chatter of the crowd behind the police line. Mia hesitated, her instinct to protect her secret warring with the evident understanding in the stranger’s gaze. The young man offered a small, guarded smile and nodded toward the taped-off alley, a silent ally in her search for answers. “Yes,” Mia finally admitted, feeling a spark of connection. It seemed they shared the gift of seeing the unseen – an ally in this world balancing on the knife-edge between known and unknown. The young man introduced himself as Alex, the name striking a chord within Mia. Alex – the name scrawled in the margin of the mysterious book. Coincidence, or was this part of her destined path? What she did know was that Alex had an air of one who didn’t just believe in the extraordinary but embraced it. “You’re not like them,” Alex said, gesturing subtly to the gathering crowd. “You’re a Seer, aren’t you?” Mia’s eyes widened, not from fear, but from the rush of being truly seen for the first time. Alex’s understanding offered her a sanctuary, the possibility of no longer shouldering her secret alone. They moved away from the scene, seeking the quiet of a nearby park, whose trees whispered softly in the early morning breeze. With the murmurs of the city a distant backdrop, Alex shared his story. Like Mia, the night had called to him, but not with a whisper – his was a shout that beckoned him to witness the extraordinary light show. His search for knowledge led him to the library, to the very book Mia now carried, to find that someone had beaten him to it. Listening to Alex, Mia felt the isolation she had carried for so long begin to crumble. Here was someone who understood the strange and wonderful turn her life had taken. More than that, Alex possessed pieces of the puzzle that connected to her own. He spoke of the Guardians, of the delicate balance between their world and the realm of the starlight spirits. Together, they mulled over the handwritten note and what their rendezvous might mean. As they talked, an unspoken bond formed between them, a fellowship defined by shared purpose and the stirrings of trust. Mia found a comfort in Alex’s presence that she never knew she needed. Here was an ally, perhaps even a friend, who stood with her on the threshold of destiny. The revelation was profound, not just for the sense of partnership it brought, but for the realization that there were more guardians like Alex—a group, a haven, for people like her. The path she had to walk bloomed with the potential of camaraderie, and the loneliness that had dogged her steps dissolved into the warming light of new possibilities. Breathless with the weight of their shared understanding and the unwavering gaze of the open sky above, Mia felt propelled forward by an invisible hand, her journey entwined with Alex’s, and the mystery that beckoned them both deeper into the shadows of starlight. Page 7: Training Begins Mia and Alex left the cover of the trees, feeling a renewed sense of urgency in the light of the morning sun. The earlier confusion that had clouded Mia’s mind gave way to a resolution sharpened by their alliance. They recognized the path that lay ahead would not be easy, but together, they felt empowered to face whatever challenges the starlight spirits would unveil. Alex explained that he belonged to a small group who called themselves the Seekers—a collective of individuals with the Sight. They trained in secret, honing their abilities to communicate and interact with the starlight spirits and understand the deep lore of their connection to the stars. For generations, the Seekers had been the true Guardians, a lineage protecting the balance between the terrestrial and celestial—a balance now seemingly at risk. Intrigue replaced apprehension as Mia listened. She was ready to learn, to transform her incipient skills into tangible strength. The Seekers, Alex assured her, would aid her in harnessing her Sight, not just for her own enlightenment but for the preservation of the light that safeguarded both realms. They formulated a plan. The Seekers met at a covert location just outside the city limits, a place sitting beneath the open gaze of the stars. This would become Mia’s classroom, her temple, where she would learn to interpret the whispers of the cosmos under the tutelage of the Seekers. The journey to the Seekers’ sanctum was a brief one, but with every step, Mia felt as though she were moving further from her old life. Arriving at the hidden retreat—an old observatory nestled among the hills—they were greeted by the sight of ancient stone and groves of trees stretching upward, joining the heavens in stately vigil. The observatory was both majestic and serene, the perfect crossroads of earth-bound curiosity and celestial wonder. Mia marveled at the crumbling columns and the patina of age that adorned the domed structure. The air resounded with a subtle hum that she felt more than heard, a vibration that soothed her restless spirit. Within the weathered walls of the observatory, Mia met the rest of the Seekers. Each one offered a knowing nod or a smile of welcome, their eyes reflecting the same starry sheen that had marked Alex’s. These were individuals of all ages and backgrounds, bound together by their Sight and their solemn oath to use it for the greater good. Under the guidance of the Seekers, Mia underwent her first lesson. It wasn’t training of the body but of the mind and soul. She learned to calm her inner turbulence, to let the whispers of the universe find a home within her. She practiced extending her consciousness toward the starlight, allowing it to fill her senses and guide her intuition. [Image Prompt: Mia and Alex practicing with swirling lights of starlight around them.] As night descended upon the observatory, the Seekers gathered in the open beneath the vast expanse of the cosmos. Mia joined them, her eyes closing as she focused on the energy emanating from her fellow practitioners. Through the gentle encouragement of her new allies, she felt the bond with starlight grow stronger, the light within her answering the call of the ones above. She opened her eyes to a magnificent sight; the darkened sky came alive with mercurial streams of starlight responding to their combined presences. Mia lifted her hands, and to her wonder and thrill, the streams coalesced around her fingertips, dancing to the rhythm of her heartbeat. It was a moment of pure elation, of unity between her spirit and the vast sea of stars watching overhead. In that grand pavilion of night, with the whispering song of the cosmos in her ears, Mia glimpsed her potential for the first time—a potential that ignited like a newborn star within the depths of her being. She was becoming what she was meant to be, part of an ancient legacy that would challenge her to her core. She would learn, she would grow, and she would stand against the shadows threatening to extinguish the light she carried. Page 8: First Clue The observatory provided a sanctuary—not just for practice, but for discussion and theory. Post-training, Mia and the Seekers gathered to dissect what could be gleaned from the unusual occurrences within Luminara. Alex presented a series of weathered tomes and maps with routes and patterns—records of historical sightings of starlight activity, unexplained phenomena with a striking resemblance to recent events. Mia listened attentively to the theories woven together by the collective wisdom of the group. They spoke of ley lines—channels of energy invisible to the average eye, interlacing the earth and converging within Luminara. These lines acted as conduits for the starlight spirits, allowing them to traverse between their celestial realm and the terrestrial world. Could the recent disturbance in the city have been a result of an overlain rift, a chasm formed along these lines? The thought of Luminara perched upon such a volatile foundation sent a tremor of concern through the group. By the soft glow of candlelight, the Seekers pored over the evidence, tracing anomalies and mapping correspondences. They cast a net of intellect and intuition, seeking the thread that would unravel the tapestry of mystery that enveloped them. It was Mia, with fresh eyes and a connection newly kindled, who spotted an irregularity—a point where several ley lines intersected that corresponded geographically with the epicenter of the previous night’s event. The ancient library, the locus of her revelation, sat mere blocks away from this nexus. Alex leaned over her shoulder, his finger tracing the path she outlined, his eyes lighting with recognition. “The heart of the ley lines,” he murmured. “That’s where we need to look.” The discovery bore the weight of a palpable lead. Mia felt a thrill pulse through her—one of impending insight or peril, or perhaps both. The urge to investigate was unanimous among the Seekers, but caution wrapped its tendrils around their resolve. To probe such a site without understanding the scope of its significance was to court danger. Yet the cause of balance dictated their path. Among their resources was a mention of a totem—an artifact of ancient power said to reveal the unseen forces at work along the ley lines. If such a totem could be located, it might provide the lens through which they could peer into the mystery and discern the source of the disruption. In a blend of decision and duty, it was agreed Mia and Alex would return to Luminara to seek out this totem. Their bond, forged in shared experience and deepened by a night of wonder, was becoming the beacon that led the way. Delegation was set; the rest of the Seekers would remain, securing the observatory and delving deeper into their archives for any scrap of lore that might aid the search. As dawn once again teased the edges of night away, Mia and Alex set out back toward the mystery that seemed to center itself over Luminara. With the coming of light, the magnitude of their task loomed large, but in their hearts gleamed the inextinguishable flame of purpose lit by the stars themselves. Page 9: A Close Encounter The crisp air of daybreak did little to still the tempest of anticipation as Mia navigated the streets with Alex by her side, heading for their newfound objective. The city was stirring to life, but their destination held the quiet of a secret yet to be awakened. They aimed to reach the heart of the ley lines, an unassuming spot in the urban sprawl that the Seekers believed was key to the current instability. As they approached the area, a subtle prickling sensation, like the whisper of static, teased Mia’s senses. It was a sign they were drawing near, that the invisible was becoming tangible through her Sight. This place—this vortex of silent power—lay veiled by the normalcy of Luminara’s morning routine. Pedestrians bustled about, immersed in the beginnings of their day, oblivious to the hub of mystical convergence that Mia and Alex were inching toward. The epicenter of the disturbances was an old courtyard, framed by time-worn architecture and crowned with tendrils of ivy that clung to the walls. The morning’s light cast sharp shadows, carving out pockets of darkness where secrets could nestle. Mia’s hand gravitated to the book tucked under her arm, seeking reassurance from its ancient leather. Alex mirrored her action, checking the contents of a satchel slung over his shoulder that housed artifacts and tomes—tools of the Seekers that could help interpret or manipulate the starlight. They walked the perimeter cautiously, their Sight extended. To any passerby, they might seem like art enthusiasts, or history buffs admiring the structure; in truth, they were hunters, senses attuned to the echoes of the mystical that saturated the place. As they neared the center of the courtyard, a palpable shift occurred. The static sensation intensified, raising the fine hairs on their skin. It was as though they had stepped through a veil, the world’s colors deepening, shadows stretching. They were close—to the totem, to unlocking the whispers of the stars. It was then, amid their careful surveillance, that a glint caught Mia’s eye—a fleeting reflection of sunlight on metal, obscured by the foliage of a nearby bush. Alex’s gaze followed hers, and together they uncovered a small, ornate object, partially buried in the earth at the base of the plant. With reverence, Alex knelt and unearthed a medallion pulsing with an ancient allure. It was etched with sigils that danced under Mia’s gaze, whispering in a language that teased the edges of understanding. As light played across the surface of the medallion, a shadow loomed. Mia’s instincts flared, and she pulled Alex away from their discovery. A wind, unearthly and abrupt, cut through the courtyard, followed by the emergence of a figure from the darkened archway opposite them. Draped in a cloak that seemed to devour the day’s brightness, the figure’s eyes locked with theirs—eyes that brimmed with the malevolence of one who would see the balance of the worlds tip into chaos. The Seekers had spoken of shadowed adversaries, and Mia felt a chill that confirmed their warnings had been warranted. With the totem in their possession, Mia and Alex had to act quickly. Their encounter was evidence that they were meddling in affairs that had long remained undisturbed, yet necessary if the peculiar events affecting Luminara were to be understood and contained. This was no longer a mere mission for knowledge; they were being hunted. Flight was imperative. With a shared nod, Mia and Alex turned on their heels, their legs pumping, carrying them through the winding city streets. The chase—a race against shadow and time—had begun. [Image Prompt: Mia hiding from a threatening, shadowy figure with glowing eyes.] With the precious totem clasped between them and the ominous presence trailing in their wake, they fled, uncertain of their pursuer’s abilities or intentions. Only the hope that the starlight within could outshine any impending darkness spurred them on. They were enmeshed in the heart of the mystery, and the web was closing around them, tangling them in a peril more profound than any they had imagined. Page 10: Deepening Mysteries Their breaths tore through the silence as Mia and Alex dashed through the narrow passages that stitched Luminara’s historical quarter together. Street lamps flickered overhead, casting elongated shadows that merged with the light of dawn. Every echo of their footsteps on the cobblestones, every shift of wind, felt like the predatory gaze of the cloaked figure giving pursuit. Eventually, they found solitude in an abandoned subway station, its entrance obscured by overgrowth. Here they hoped the vestiges of modernity would shield them from the ancient forces that sought to reclaim the totem. The chill of the underground engulfed them as they descended the worn steps, their sanctuary a forgotten cavern of echoes and rusting tracks. They collapsed against the cool concrete, the adrenaline of their escape ebbing, leaving them to confront the weight of their recent encounter. The medallion lay between them, a source of trepidation and wonder. Alex cautiously reached for the artifact, his eyes reflecting the depth of questions unspoken. Mia watched him examine the medallion’s intricate engravings—enigmatic runes that belonged neither to the world of Luminara’s neon façade nor the celestial expanse they sought to connect with. The totem was a relic straddling the boundaries of their understanding, challenging the very nature of what they knew—or thought they knew—about their city, about the cosmos. It wasn’t just about ley lines and mystical disturbances anymore. The presence of an adversary brought a new dimension to their search. Who was this figure wielding the same ominous aura as those forces that the Seekers warned could sever the connection between Earth and the firmament? Mia’s thoughts spiraled, considering and discarding theories with restless fervor. Alex’s voice sliced through her contemplation. “This symbol here,” he traced a segment of the pattern with a careful finger, “I’ve seen it before in the Seekers’ archives. It’s a key of some sort, a means to harness or amplify energy flowing through the ley lines.\\" Mia leaned in closer, her study revealing the complexity of the design, the way it seemed to draw them in, an enigma calling to be unlocked. The medallion felt like a tangible manifestation of their journey—a nexus of past lore, present dilemma, and future trials. But the medallion provided more than just insight—it illuminated their next course of action. The clue led them to understand that the totem was part of a greater mechanism, one that governed the flow of the enigmatic energies beneath Luminara. [Image Prompt: A mysterious, shadowy figure lurking near a scene of magical disturbance in the city.] Alex looked at Mia, an idea dawning in his gaze. “If we can find out how this totem interacts with the ley lines, we might be able to prevent…” His voice trailed off as a new sound infiltrated the silence: The soft tread of stealthy footsteps approaching from the dark tunnels. Instinct prompted them to extinguish their flashlight, plunging the platform into near-total darkness. They huddled together, the totem concealed within Alex’s satchel, the only beacon being the faint glow emanating from its engravings, muted against the fabric. Their unknown pursuer moved closer, a disembodied shadow hunting them within the abyss of Luminara’s underworld. Mia felt the faint starlight within her, urging toward a solution that remained frustratingly out of reach. The mystery that they had thought to grasp was unravelling its threads faster than they could weave understanding. Fear and resolve twined within Mia’s heart. Not fear of the end, but fear of not accomplishing what she felt was her destiny, so recently illuminated by the stars. Each revelation brought with it deeper enigmas—revealing new layers of an ongoing stratagem larger and more intricate than any of them realized. With bated breath, they waited in the dark, the only certainty being that this clandestine game of cat and mouse through the tapestry of Luminara’s ancient secrets and starlit whispers was far from over. Page 11: Growing Tensions Pressed in the darkness, a gulp of stale underground air filled Mia’s lungs as she strained her ears for any hint of their stalker’s position. The cloaked figure’s footsteps seemed to fade, then stop. Alex’s hand found Mia’s in the dark – a silent vow of protection and unity between them. They were two fledglings against an unseen predator, events escalating beyond the scope of their initial quest. “Do you think they’re gone?” Mia’s whispered question was laced with the tension that buzzed through the void like electricity. “Let’s not wait to find out,” Alex replied, just as hushed, guiding Mia gently by the hand as they edged their way along the abandoned platform. He knew the station’s layout from past explorations with the Seekers – if they could navigate to the maintenance corridors, there would be other ways out. As they wove through shadows, the city above them was waking to its own unrest. News of last night’s luminescent spectacle spread through Luminara with the speed of wildfire, igniting a mixture of awe and apprehension in the populace. People gathered in the courtyards, cafes, and workplaces, exchanging hushed stories and wild speculations. The air was charged with the undercurrent of change, of a reality tilting on an unseen axis, and the seeds of fear and fascination took root in equal measure. Meanwhile, government officials and local law enforcement, ill-equipped to handle the murmurs of magic and myth, found themselves grappling with explanations to quell the rumors. Sirens rang in the distance, a dissonant symphony to the rush of daily life, while scientists and skeptics took to the airwaves attempting to rationalize the unexplainable. An undercurrent of unease spread, a sense that the city, always a tapestry of light and dark, had a shadow encroaching upon its edges, reaching from the depths of forgotten tales. Amidst this growing apprehension, a silent consensus fell upon the Seekers’ gathering – that what had begun as a search for understanding had escalated into a responsibility—responsibility to protect the unknowing citizens of Luminara from what lay hidden beneath the streets, and perhaps, from what existed above the stars. Mia’s thoughts were a whirlwind of concern for her family, her friends, the entire city. What would become of Luminara if the balance was not restored? And what part did the totem, now secure in Alex’s satchel, play in the grand design that hovered over them all like a predestined storm? Each step they took was a move in a grand strategy, with the city itself as the gameboard and its people the pieces. Mia felt her role shifting, the innocence of curiosity being honed into the steel of duty. They were participants in an ancient drama, with its roots in the stars but its repercussions mortally and incontrovertibly earthbound. The Seers had to unravel the thread of events before fear and darkness claimed dominion over Luminara’s starlit spirit. And with every secret unlocked from the veil of starlight and shadow, Mia felt herself growing into the guardian she was meant to be – a beacon of hope when the dark whispers threatened to overwhelm the light. [Image Prompt: The city of Luminara with a strange, mystical aurora in the sky, causing public alarm.] Emerging from the bowels of the station into the unseen corridors of the city, Mia and Alex took a moment to regroup, to plan their next step. Above them, the city of Luminara held its breath, watching the horizon for signs, for whispers on the wind, but below, in the heart of the underbelly, Mia and Alex took their first cautious steps toward the gathering storm. Page 12: Unseen Dangers Mia and Alex emerged from the underground labyrinth, their ascent into daylight tinged with the surreal understanding that the city they knew had been forever altered. They found themselves in an overlooked part of Luminara, where the buildings wore the patina of age and the graffiti told stories of dissent. It was here in the quieter, shaded streets that they paused to catch their breath and consider their next move. The sense of urgency that had propelled them from the depths of the subway station now gave way to the sobering realization of the danger they were in. This was no longer just about unexplained lights in the sky; they were being pursued by a tangible and malevolent force that could reach out to them at any turn. As they leaned against the cool brick of an abandoned warehouse, Alex pulled out the totem once more. The morning sun filtered through the grime of a nearby window, illuminating the etchings that seemed to pulse with an energy that defied the simplicity of its metallic surface. “There’s more at stake than we realized,” Mia began, her eyes tracing the shape of the totem in Alex’s hands. “This isn’t just about us, or the Seekers, or even just Luminara. If someone is after this,” she gestured to the medallion, “then it must have power we haven’t even begun to comprehend.” Alex nodded slowly. “The shadows are moving against us. We knew the path of a Seer could be fraught with risk. But this…” his voice trailed off, and when he looked up at Mia, his eyes bore the gravity of their situation. “This might be bigger than any danger the Seekers have faced before.” Determined to unearth more clues, they examined the totem once again. Mia’s fingers hovered over the symbols, and as they did, a chill swept through her. She could almost hear the echoes of starlight, like a distant chime, each time she passed over the engravings. It was as if the totem itself was an astral compass, pointing toward a truth not yet revealed. The question that loomed large in their minds was who their adversary was, this cloaked figure with eyes that glinted with malice and knowledge. Was it a rival seeker of lore, a wayward guardian, or something far more sinister tied to the starlight spirits themselves? They had to tread carefully. Each fact they gleaned was a beacon in the murk, but every light they shone could mark them in the darkness that hunted for the very power they wished to protect. As they stood in contemplation, a commotion nearby startled them from their deliberations. Police sirens wailed, and the sounds of chaos crept toward their hideaway. Mia peered around the corner to see a throng of law enforcement hastening toward the city center. Something was happening – another disturbance, another clue, perhaps. Compelled to unravel the widening mystery, they made a decision. They would mingle with the crowds, blend in with the concerned citizens, and perhaps in doing so, find the thread that would lead them to the next piece of the puzzle. It was a risk, exposing themselves to the gaze of the city and the cloaked figure that might be lurking there. But hiding in the shadows would bring them no closer to stopping the threat that whispered of an unseen danger. Taking a deep breath, steeling themselves with the resolve of their newfound calling, Mia and Alex stepped out from their sanctuary and into the public eye once more. They shared a silent pact, an acceptance of the path they walked—one of illuminated discoveries and silent perils lurking behind the veil of Luminara’s façade. The destiny that tied them to the stars and the secrets of the earth called them forth, and they answered, stepping boldly toward the unfolding drama that waited in the heart of their city. Page 13: A Moment of Solace The unease gripping Luminara was palpable, a city on the brink of the inexplicable, steadied only by the routine of daily life that marched on in the face of uncertainty. Police cordoned off areas of unusual activity, their faces etched with the same bewilderment mirrored in the crowd. Mia and Alex, though part of this throng, were set apart by the secret weight they carried—the totem’s presence pressing into Alex’s satchel like a beacon of unknown potential. After navigating through a congestion of onlookers, they ducked into an alleyway, a temporary reprieve from the pressing anxiety of the streets. The alley opened up into a secluded rooftop garden, a hidden gem amidst the urban expanse. Here, verdant life thrived quietly above the clamor, a peaceful contrast to the electrical tension that wound through the city below. Mia exhaled a sigh she didn’t realize she had been holding. Her entire life had been turned inside out in the span of a few days, and yet, amongst this pocket of serenity, she felt a connection to normalcy—a fleeting taste of the life she used to know. “Take a moment, Mia,” Alex encouraged, his voice a gentle nudge back to the present. “We’ve been through a lot. A break might give us some clarity.” She nodded, and together they sank onto the neatly trimmed grass, the rooftop garden enveloping them in a comforting embrace. Silence settled between them, not awkward but companionable, a shared acknowledgement of the wonder and fear that had become their constant shadows. Looking out over the skyline, the duo watched as Luminara stretched beneath the soft glow of sunset, its colors painting the clouds in strokes of gold and rose. For the briefest of heartbeats, Mia allowed herself the luxury of peace, the beauty of the moment tempering the storm of her thoughts. She glanced at Alex, taking in his angular profile against the dimming light. Unspoken camaraderie had woven itself into the fabric of their encounter—a bond formed not over years but through shared destiny. She observed the way his eyes, usually so sharp with resolve, softened at the sight of a pair of butterflies dancing above a bed of flowers. “This is beautiful,” Mia whispered, her attention captured by the delicate creatures. “Amidst all the chaos, life finds a way to remind us that there’s more to the world than our fears.” Alex turned his attention from the butterflies to Mia, a smile breaking through his solemnity. “It’s easy to forget, isn’t it?” he mused. “We get so caught up in the darkness that we risk losing sight of the light.” Mia felt the echo of truth in his words resonate within her. Their mission—to safeguard Luminara from the shadows at its edges—held more than just the duty of protection. It was a call to preserve the everyday magic that connected all facets of life, the joy found in the simple beauty of a peaceful garden against the backdrop of a city holding its breath. [Image Prompt: Mia and Alex on a rooftop, overlooking the city, with starlight spirits floating around, creating a romantic ambiance.] The flutter of wings brought her gaze back to the butterflies, their flight a dainty waltz in the lingering rays of the sun. Beneath them, the lights of Luminara began to flicker on, stars of another kind, defiant against the impending night. As dusk fell, lending privacy to their rooftop sanctuary, Mia and Alex shared stories of their lives beyond the realm of the Seekers. With each word, they wove threads of understanding, constructing a bridge over the isolation that had once defined their existence. The peace of the garden offered a stark counterpoint to the chaos of their quest—a contrast that lent strength to their resolve. For in this moment of solace, away from the hidden dangers and enigmatic challenges, they rediscovered the humanity that fueled their battle against the encroaching dark. A flickering light of hope, of connection, that would not be easily extinguished by the shadows seeking to envelope Luminara and its unsuspecting denizens. Page 14: A Discovery As darkness draped over the city, the rooftop garden had become a well of stillness amidst the swelling currents of Luminara’s unrest. Mia and Alex, reinvigorated by the shared moment of respite, prepared to descend from their ephemeral haven back into the depths of their uncertain journey. However, the night had yet to reveal its hand, and it was upon their departure that chance turned their tide. Mia, intending to take a final glance at the city from this rare vantage point, caught sight of a peculiar shimmer in the nocturnal canvas below. It was a faint, otherworldly gleam that resonated with an inexplicable familiarity, an echo of the energies they had sensed earlier. “Alex, look,” she whispered, pointing towards the illumination that flickered like a star fallen in the urban maze. With the totem secure, they cautiously traced their way down the building, curiosity fuelling their steps, the lure of discovery propelling them forward. As they approached the source, it became apparent that the light emanated from the entrance of a narrow side alley. In stark contrast to the dank surroundings, the radiance appeared ethereal, untouched by the city’s grime. It was not mere reflection or trick of the light; this glow held the essence of the starlight spirits themselves. The alley was vacant, save for the celestial glow that seemed to beckon. With every fiber of her being tingling with a mix of apprehension and anticipation, Mia felt the Sight within her stir, a recognition of affinity to the astral phenomenon before them. The whispers of the universe were not just calling; they were guiding. The light seemed to pulse in response to their presence, its motion growing more pronounced as Mia extended a tentative hand, her fingers grazing the otherworldly orb. A resonance spread through her—a vibration that matched the cadence of her heart and the throbbing hum of the city. It was more than mere energy; it was communication, an articulation in the celestial language she was only beginning to comprehend. “A message,” Alex breathed, his tone a mix of awe and urgency. “It must be from the starlight spirits. Could they be trying to guide us?” Mia nodded, though her expression remained concentrated, her mind unweaving the complex strands of luminescent speech. Words of light, of energy, translated into understanding, a current of thought flowing into her consciousness. The starlight spirits conveyed a sense of urgency, a plea for the guardianship that she and Alex had unknowingly vowed to undertake. There was an artifact—distinct from the totem, yet inexplicably linked—a key that harbored the power to mend the fraying seam between worlds. The location, obscured by shadow and the passage of time, would soon be revealed, an answer hidden in history and the fabric of the city itself. “The convergence is near,” the light whispered—an utterance only felt, not heard. “The paths will cross at the junction of time and trial. Be ready, guardians of the bridge.” As the message dissolved into the night, the duo stood in stunned silence, processing the gravity of their encounter. The path they embarked upon was charting deeper into the unknown, their roles as Seers expanding into agents of a cosmic orchestration that spanned beyond the reaches of Earthly perception. With the discovery pulsing in their hearts like a newly kindled star, Mia and Alex stepped back into the shadowed streets, the murmurs of the spirits a guiding refrain. The city sprawled around them, a trove of secrets waiting to be unearthed by steadfast hands and watchful eyes that held the glimmer of the stars. Page 15: A Confrontation The cryptic guidance of the starlight spirits left Mia and Alex grappling with more questions than answers. What was the key they spoke of, and how would it manifest in the tangible world? With only the veiled whispers of the cosmos to guide them, they needed more—a stroke of terrestrial insight to pair with the ethereal message. Mia’s thoughts raced back to the library, to the tomes and their secrets. The public facade housed more than just ink and paper; it protected whispers of the ancient, of knowledge passed through generations. If there was anything that could shed light on this new aspect of their quest, it would be there among the silent rows of books and the hallowed echoes of the past. As they navigated the serpentine pathways back to the central district, a sharp-edged disquiet sliced into their conversation. The foreboding feeling of being watched had returned, the sensation of another presence lurking in their shadow. The confrontation they had managed to sidestep earlier that day was not an isolated threat—it was a persisting danger. With their instincts on high alert, they moved with purpose, seeking the solace of the library’s fortified walls. Upon arrival, they found the building locked, the late hour denying them entry. Their frustration was palpable, the denial of access an unexpected impediment. That’s when they heard it—the unmistakable sound of shuffling feet from within. Intrigue mixed with caution, Mia approached one of the tall windows, peering through its dusty pane. The faint light of an inner lamp revealed a figure moving through the shadows, their behavior furtive, indicative of a search similar to their own. It was clear they were not a staff member or a casual reader, but rather someone with intent and knowledge of what lay concealed within the public space. The nocturnal intruder paused beneath the dim glow, and an object in their hands caught the light—a book, old and leather-bound, unmistakably one of the same that Mia and Alex had poured over with the Seekers, its worn edges a testament to its critical role. Without hesitation, Mia attempted the door, finding it surprisingly unlocked. They stepped inside, their entrance muffled by the expanse of the grand reading room. The rows of shelves loomed like silent sentinels, and up ahead, the interloper, still unbeknownst to their presence, continued their clandestine rummaging. Mia glanced at Alex, her resolve steeling. This had to be more than mere coincidence—the intruder was looking for answers to questions only they understood. It was time for answers, and the direct approach was all they had left. Stepping into the aisle, Mia cleared her throat. The figure jolted, the book clutched tight against their chest. “Looking for something in particular?” Mia’s voice was calm, but the energy of the room shifted palpably, the undercurrent of danger swirling among the weighted silence of the tomes. The silhouette turned, and a face emerged from the shadows, one both familiar and unexpected—a young woman, her eyes wide with alarm, but not, Mia noted, with guilt. The intruder spoke, her voice a blend of defiance and curiosity. “I could ask you the same thing.” The standoff was brief, the realization shared between them like a spark passing through open space. This woman was not their cloaked adversary from the alley, but another player in the intricate dance between the terrestrial and the celestial. There was a connection, one that was yet to fully surface, but clear as the tension that hung in the air between them. Confrontation gave way to dialogue, and they began to weave a thread of communication, their tales unfolding, their search for the key and the truth behind the disturbances drawing them together. [Image Prompt: An intense confrontation in an old library, with books and mystical artifacts around.] It was becoming clear that this journey was not theirs to walk alone. The tapestry they had been tracing—the patterns of starlight and shadow—was expansive, reaching into lives beyond their own. It was within the hallowed halls of knowledge, amid the confrontations with the unknown, that their path was crossing with others drawn by the same source of wonder and dread. Page 16: The Plot Thickens The revelation that this young woman was neither foe nor ignorant bystander added a new dimension to the evening’s tension. In the musty air of the library, surrounded by ancient texts and the lingering whispers of a thousand stories, Mia, Alex, and the stranger regarded each other in an uncertain truce. “So, you know about the starlight spirits, the disturbances, the ley lines?” Mia inquired, her gaze penetrating as she watched the newcomer carefully. Alex stood close, his presence protective yet curious. “The lights, the energy, I’ve felt them,” the stranger answered, her guarded poise softening as she sensed a shared purpose among them. “My name is Isla. I work at the university—the Astronomy Department. We’ve been detecting anomalies—patterns that don’t fit traditional cosmic behavior.” Isla’s confession set the stage for revelations, the threads of isolated inquiries becoming part of a larger fabric. She spoke of theoretical rifts in the fabric of space-time, empirical evidence of a celestial nature that couldn’t be explained through known scientific phenomena. Her research had led her here, to the library, in search of esoteric correlations that might frame her findings in a broader context. As the trio exchanged knowledge, the convergence of their paths steered them toward a frightening conceptual horizon. If Isla’s academic evidence was prophesying the same upheaval that the Seekers and their celestial counterparts were warning about, then Luminara, and possibly the world beyond, stood on the precipice of something monumental. Mia, bolstered by the new alliance, suggested, “We believe there is an artifact, a key of sorts, connected to the ley lines and the spirits. It might be the answer to containing, or at least understanding, the anomalies.” Isla’s eyes narrowed, her analytical mind picking apart the implications of Mia’s statement. “An artifact? There might be some mention of it in the legends… the ones dismissed by modern science.” She motioned toward a section of the library designated for texts of mythology and folklore. Together, they redirected their search. The dusty shelves harbored more than fables; they held forgotten wisdom that slipped through the cracks of mainstream knowledge. The trio scoured the collection with newfound fervor, pouring over pages that whispered of hidden truths medicine men and sages had gleaned under the stars centuries prior. It was a race against time, a race against the encroaching darkness, as they sought to connect the celestial dots that seemed to spell an impending cosmic conundrum. The plot did indeed thicken as they worked, the library’s labyrinth of written heritage unspooling before them. And then, nestled within the yellowed pages of an aged ledger written by an explorer long departed, they found it—a reference to the “Heart of Luminara,” an artifact shaped by the heavens’ own touch. “According to this, the Heart was sent to Earth long ago, held by those chosen by the stars, to serve as a bridge for communication and passage,” Isla read aloud, a tinge of wonder coloring her rational tone. With this discovery, their search gained direction. The Heart of Luminara was more than a key—it was a beacon of ancient magicks and celestial mechanics, a link between worlds that yearned for balance. With the ledger as their guide, they determined to seek the artifact’s last known location. Ceaseless threats lurked in the shadows behind every thought, every glance from the library’s enveloping dark. Yet, the newfound companions drew strength from their shared cause and the knowledge that the answers they sought were aligning, piece by intricate piece. They exited the library, the artifact’s call a hushed serenade that seemed to echo down from the very stars they gazed upon. The journey ahead was draped in enigma, but they were no longer travelers navigating in isolation; they were a constellation of seekers drawn together by the plot that enshrouded their city and their fate. Page 17: Unexpected Ally The stars bore silent witness as Mia, Alex, and their new companion, Isla, stepped into the cool embrace of the night. The ledger under Isla’s arm was more than a compilation of forgotten chronicles; it was the map that might lead them to the Heart of Luminara and hold the answers they so desperately sought. Their departure from the library was halted by a muttered word from Mia. She halted, straining her eyes against the darkness of an adjoining street. A figure stepped from the shadows, unhurried, almost leisurely, and for a moment, time seemed to constrict around them. The figure was cloaked, much like the menacing pursuer they had previously evaded, yet there was a distinction—an aura not of threat, but of withheld promise. The figure’s approach elicited a range of reactions. Alex moved subtly, placing himself between the stranger and the two women, while Isla’s hand tightened around her leather-bound trove, her stance defensive. Mia herself felt an odd sense of anticipation as the figure drew closer, a flicker of recognition sparking within her. Once within the lamplight’s reach, the cloak’s hood was pulled back to reveal an elderly man with a countenance that spoke of wisdom and trials weathered. His eyes held the endless knowledge of the stars—a gaze born of years scrutinizing the heavens, reading its secrets. “I am known as Marlo,” he said, his voice a low timbre that commanded attention despite its softness. “I have been watching your progress, Mia and Alex. And you must be Isla, the one whose search for celestial truths has led you from the academic towers to the grounds of myth.” Isla’s surprise turned to inquisitiveness as she met Marlo’s gaze. “You know of me?” she asked, her voice a blend of skepticism and intrigue. Marlo nodded, his lips curving into a wise smile. “I know many things. I, too, have felt the fractures in our reality, the disturbances you seek to mend. I am a keeper of scribed celestial lore, a descendant of those who penned some of the very volumes you hold.” Isla’s grip on the ledger eased as realization dawned. Marlo was not a new adversary, but another piece of the ever-expanding puzzle—a provider of knowledge they lacked, a guardian of forgotten truths. Marlo shared with them the lineage of the book Isla carried, how generations of star-gazers had kept the tale of the Heart of Luminara alive through their records, this ledger being the culmination of their labors. “It is more than an artifact,” he explained; “it’s part of a cosmic mechanism, an interface between the earth and the stars.” The Heart, it seemed, was a celestially infused object that could actuate the ley lines in favor of balance, or dismay, depending on who wielded it. Theirs was a quest not only to find it but to ensure it did not fall into the wrong hands. [Image Prompt: A mysterious character, cloaked and enigmatic, reaching out to Mia in a dimly lit room.] Marlo’s revelations brought gravity to their quest, his assurances a balm to the turbulence of their doubts. With the ledger as their guide and Marlo’s guidance, they sought to uncover the Heart, a journey now shadowed by the fearsome knowledge that others, too, coveted its power for darker designs. Resolved to see their search to the end, Mia, Alex, Isla, and now Marlo, ventured into the belly of the city, where echoes of magick lay in wait and where their fates would intertwine with the celestial emissary known as the Heart of Luminara. Page 18: A New Lead Armed with ancient knowledge and the added wisdom of their enigmatic guide, Marlo, Mia, Alex, and Isla wove through the sleeping city with resolute purpose. They moved as shadows themselves, aware that a wisp of starlight or the slightest tremor in the ley lines could betray their presence to those who pursued the same powerful relic. Marlo, who had walked the edge between the visible and the veiled for more years than the others could fathom, directed their steps toward the remnants of an old district. Here, the architecture whispered stories of times when belief in the intertwining of worlds was common, where star-gazers were once revered. “This way,” said Marlo, his voice barely louder than a breath as he led them down an almost forgotten street. The cobblestones were worn smooth by the passage of countless feet and countless years. Vines clung to the sides of stoic buildings, the city’s age and mystery hanging heavy in the air. At Marlo’s behest, Isla unfolded the ledger, its pages luminescent under the wary gaze of the moon. She traced over the ancient text with fingers that trembled not from cold but from anticipation. “Here,” she whispered, pointing to a passage that described a courtyard with a fountain, its centerpiece marked with celestial sigils visible only to those who looked beyond the earthly façade. Mia’s Sight flared within her, her connection to the cosmos urging her gaze to pierce the mundane shroud of the world. An ordinary fountain, worn by years and ignored by passersby, captured her focus; she could see past the layers of grime and disrepair to witness an intricate pattern of stars and planetary orbits etched into its surface. They gathered around the relic of a bygone era, the fountain’s dry basin a seeming receptacle of secrets and power. Marlo nodded approvingly, his expression a blend of sorrow and hope. “The Heart of Luminara must be close,” he assured them. His declaration was more than conjecture; it was a feeling, an ancient tug at his soul that whispered of proximity to the artifact they sought. The scene became a capsule of concentration as Mia, Alex, and Isla leaned closer, the ledger now a tangible guide as they cross-referenced Marlo’s intuitions with the document’s penned renderings. Each symbol, each line, each dormant trickle of long-ago water within the fountain’s basin held the potential to open pathways long sealed. Moments spilled like sand through the hourglass as they sifted through the clues buried within both fountain and text. And then, as if by fate’s own design, Isla’s hand hovered over a mosaic tile within the ornate depiction of Ursa Major, the Great Bear constellation—an emblem which aligned with a sketch in the yellowed pages of her tome. “Under the Great Bear,” read Isla, her voice betraying her burgeoning excitement. “The Heart resides where the heavens are reflected upon the Earth.” Their search narrowed to the space under the constellation, their movements delicate as they prodded the fountain’s designs for a sign, a trigger, a revelation. It was Alex who discovered the anomaly—a tile within the bear’s outline that depressed slightly under pressure. The fountain’s base emitted a low grinding sound, stone against stone, as hidden mechanisms—untouched for aeons—began to stir. The Seekers looked on with bated breath as the base stones parted, revealing a concealed cavity beneath. The revelation was an affirmation of prophecy and legend, forged by celestial intent—but was the sought-after Heart within? Page 19: A Dangerous Encounter The stone outline of Ursa Major had given way to reveal its secret, an opening within the heart of the fountain where the Earth seemed to touch the stars. The air around the seekers buzzed with the hum of raw energy, a vibration felt more than heard, as if the revealing of the hidden chamber echoed within the very fabric of the cosmos. Marlo was the first to react, his hand outstretched to halt the eager advance of his companions. “Caution,” he whispered, his gaze intense. “The Heart, if it is indeed within, will be guarded. Its wards have held for centuries.” They peered into the darkness below. The cavity was not simply an empty recess but an entrance to something deeper, a corridor that vanished into the earth. Cold air wafted from the gaping maw, along with the faint, indistinct scent of minerals and old magic. Mia hesitated at the threshold, the Sight within her flickering like a flame in a draft. What lay beyond was a path woven with peril and promise, leading to a relic that bore the weight of worlds upon its form. The decision to descend was silent, unanimous; their journey thus far had been a gathering of momentum that could not now be stilled. With Marlo leading, the seekers descended one by one into the gloom. The stairwell spiraled downwards, ancient stones worn smooth by the footsteps of those few who had once walked this hallowed route. As they wound deeper beneath the city, the cries of the surface faded into a memory, and the silence grew profound, save for the steady whisper of their breaths and the soft echo of their descent. And then, the passageway leveled, opening into an expansive chamber. The walls thrummed with the same starry energy that Mia had come to recognize—a tapestry of pulsating light that painted an otherworldly glow upon the seekers’ awestruck faces. The reverence of the chamber, however, was shattered by a sudden movement. From the shadows cast by the starlight emerged figures, robed and silent, guardians of the sacred place that had for so long been undisturbed. Mia’s Sight flared—warnings sparking within her mind. These were no mortal custodians, but manifestations of the ley lines themselves, conjured protectors bound to the Heart of Luminara. The intensity of the chamber’s light grew, and the figures advanced, their forms blurring between solidity and luminescence. [Image Prompt: Mia and Alex in a hidden underground chamber, facing a sinister, magical phenomenon.] Alex stepped forward, drawing a small device from the depths of his satchel—it was the totem they had recovered, its purpose now startlingly clear. He held it aloft; the sigils upon its surface ignited with brilliance, casting a beam that seemed to answer the aggression of the guardians with an assertion of kinship. For a tense moment, there was an oscillation in the chamber, a flicker between conflict and recognition. And then, as if accepting the totem’s call, the guardians stilled, their forms softening, allowing the seekers to pass unharmed. An unspoken agreement had been forged in light and understanding, a treaty that granted Mia, Alex, Isla, and Marlo the right to approach the Heart. A pedestal stood in the chamber’s center, cradling the Heart of Luminara—a crystal pulsing with an inner galaxy of stars, nebulae, and constellations. It was a microcosm of the universe, a beacon of ancient power that resonated with the beat of all creation. As the seekers reached out to this celestial relic, they understood that it was more than an artifact; it was a living connection to the stars themselves—a nexus of past and future where the fate of their world hung in the balance. Page 20: Cliffhanger Ending Bathed in the Heart of Luminara’s incandescent glow, Mia, Alex, Isla, and Marlo stood before the pedestal. The chamber around them held its breath, the light from the crystal casting prismatic dances upon the walls. This was the moment of convergence, the Seekers and scholars meeting destiny hand in hand. Marlo, with a reverence reserved for the most sacred of rituals, stepped forward. His seasoned hands hovered above the Heart, wary of contact. “It must be understood before it can be wielded,” he murmured, echoing the words that had been passed down through his lineage. Mia’s Sight, fully attuned to the Heart’s celestial song, recoiled at the touch of darkness she felt creeping through the chamber’s threshold. She searched the shadows, sensing a presence—a void where the starlight wept. “Something’s wrong,” she said, her voice a whisper that carried the weight of her dread. No sooner had the warning left her lips than the chamber shook—a silent quake that trembled through stone and soul alike. The guardians around them flickered wildly, their forms destabilizing, reacting to an intrusion that threatened to unravel the woven peace. From the darkness emerged their cloaked pursuer, the figure that had lurked within their periphery since the start of their voyage. But they were not alone. Flanking the cloaked figure were others, equally obscured by shadow, their intentions clear as they eyed the Heart with malignant desire. “The barriers weaken,” the cloaked figure spoke, his voice a sibilant sound that slithered through the chamber, “and we will not be denied our prize.” Mia felt anger surge within her, a fierce protectiveness over the Heart that had become part of a greater purpose she now carried. “We can’t let them take it,” she said, stepping between the intruders and the pedestal. Alex and Isla moved to join her, a unified front against the impending threat. A high-pitched tone, like the ringing of glass, resonated from the Heart, an urgent timbre that seemed to be both a summons and a warning. The air thickened with potential, with the palpable power of starlight that needed to be channeled, guarded. Marlo’s eyes were laden with sorrow, with the burden of generations. “There are forces here that not even the Heart can easily quell,” he said, his voice steady despite the chaos. “We must make a choice, and we must make it swiftly.” In the climactic tension, the crystal pulsed—a beacon calling its guardians to action. The Seekers prepared to defend it, to keep its power from hands that would misuse its connection to the fabric of existence. [Image Prompt: Mia facing an unexpected revelation or danger.] As the confrontation neared its breaking point, a tremor of realization coursed through Mia. The ledger she had brushed off the pedestal in her urgency reflected a cascade of light from the Heart, a shattered reflection that bordered on revelation. She glanced at Isla, and in their shared gaze was an unspoken agreement: The chamber held more secrets, and within the cryptic intersection of starlight, shadow, and scholarly intuition lay the answer they needed. With the chamber echoing the song of colliding worlds and the imminent threat of the shadowed intruders, the Heart of Luminara beckoned the seekers to stand firm, to protect the cosmic balance. As the Heart’s glow intensified, a final, shattering truth came to light—a twist in their tale that none of the seekers had foreseen, a revelation that could change everything…","completion":"Suddenly, the chamber erupted with a blinding surge of light, enveloping the Seekers and their adversaries in an aura of sheer cosmic power. The Heart of Luminara, reacting to the touch of darkness in its sanctum, unleashed a wave of energy, and in that radiant discharge, the very fabric of reality rippled. Mia's Sight, pushed to its limits, glimpsed the multitude of potential outcomes branching from this single, critical moment. The chamber, the Seekers, the cloaked figures—all hung suspended as if the cosmos itself were holding its breath, deciding the fate of this ancient dance between shadow and starlight. The light crescendoed to an intensity that bordered on the unbearable and then, as if answering the universal call for balance, it folded inward, drawing back into the Heart with the force of a collapsing star. In the aftermath, the chamber was transformed. Gone were the cloaked figures—vanished as if they had never been. And the Heart itself, that shimmering nexus between the terrestrial and celestial, was silent, its previously vibrant luminescence dimmed to a soft, steady glow. The Seekers, transfixed by the Heart's performance, barely registered their own changes. They were bound now, not just by their quest, but by the touch of the infinite that had passed through them—witnesses and participants to an event that defied time and understanding. And yet, the silence was heavy with the weight of questions unanswered and destinies unfulfilled. The chamber that had been a stage for a cosmic confrontation now seemed an empty theater, the actors departed, the audience left in silent contemplation of the unfolding drama. Mia's thoughts churned with the implications of what they had experienced. The ledger, the cloaked figures, the Heart—each element was a stanza in a poem whose meaning she was just beginning to unravel. Around her, Alex, Isla, and Marlo shared glances that mirrored her own confusion and wonder. What new paths had been wrought by the Heart's display of power? Where had their adversaries been dispatched to, and would they return? The Seekers stood at the crossroads of discovery and uncertainty, the story poised on the edge of a new chapter. The whispers of the cosmos had quieted, but the journey was far from over. As the Seekers gathered their wits and prepared to ascend from the depths of the chamber, they understood one thing clearly: The fate of Luminara was now entwined with the riddles of the Heart, and their roles as guardians, interpreters, and champions of the celestial order were only just beginning. With the road ahead shrouded in starlight and shadow, they stepped forward, ready to face whatever the constellations had written in their destiny, the tale of the Heart of Luminara continuing into the vast, uncharted expanse of their intertwined fates."},{"prompt":"Please do not include your latest response in the next one.

Issei hides this [his |Issei's| vampirism] from his [Issei's] classmates and teachers at school, including his [Issei's] mistress and English teacher, the red-haired, tall, curvy and buxom, cunning, seductive and sly but also kind and caring Rias Gremory, [Issei] feeding on criminals and scum on the earth to survive as well as [Issei] using his [Issei's] perversion, which [Issei's perversion] is fake in this story, as a shield to avoid being noticed. Koyumi's younger twin sisters from canon Bakemonogatari, the hyperactive, easily excitable, passionate and somewhat naive but also headstrong and righteous Araragi Karen and her [Karen's] younger twin sister, the calm, reserved, cool and collected but also short-tempered to the point of hysteria Araragi Tsukihi, [Tsukihi and Karen in this story] both [Tsukihi and Karen] replace [the characters Tsukihi and Karen both replace in this story] the brown-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite, calm, cool and collected but also hot-tempered and money-hungry magic heiress Tohsaka Rin from Fate/Stay Night and her [Rin's] younger sister, the purple-haired, violet-eyed, kind and loving but also shy and reserved Matou Sakura, [Karen and Tsukihi replacing Rin and Sakura respetively] and [Karen and Tsukihi] having their [Rin's and Sakura's] powers, abilities and responsibilities. Tsukihi also replaces the black-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite Tōno Akiha, the head [Akiha] of the Tōno family from [the media franchise Akiha is |Akiha| from] Tsukihime, [Tsukihi] also being an Oni as well, along with her [Tsukihi's] older twin [Karen]. The twins [Karen and Tsukihi] are [Karen and Tsukihi] able to hide who they [Karen and Tsukihi] really are from him [Issei] but [Karen and Tsukihi] don't know [about him |Issei| being a vampire or him |Issei| being Rias' pawn]. Tsukihi also is [what else Tsukihi also is in this story] the reincarnation [Tsukihi] of [who is Tsukihi's past life in this story] Tenchi Muyo's purple-haired, red-eyed, tall, slender, petite but also buxom well mannered, traditional, and aristocratic but also snobbish and fierce Masaki Aeka Jurai, the princess [Aeka] of the Grand Empire of Jurai, [Tsukihi being Aeka's reincarnation] although she [Tsukihi] hides this [Tsukihi being Aeka's reincarnation] from her [Aeka's] friends, family, classmates and schoolmates for fear of being seen as crazy. The brown-haired, brown-eyed, glasses-wearing, incredibly smart and brilliant but incredibly sheltered, naive and sexually clueless, short, slender and petite but also incredibly buxom child prodigy and intellectual genius Usa Mimi from [the media franchise Mimi is |Mimi| from] Kodomo no Jikan, [Mimi in this story] is [Mimi] in fact [Mimi's true identity] the blonde-haired, amber-eyed, slender and petite, reserved, calm and respectful but also hilariously sheltered and ignorant kitsune [fox |kitsune|] yokai [monster |yokai|] hime [princess |hime|] Kunou from [the media franchise Kunou is |Kuno| from] High School DxD in this story. Mimi was just a name she [Kunou] used [Kunou] to live in the non-magical world as a human, although she [Kunou/Mimi] is [Kunou/Mimi] Issei's adoptive younger cousin [Kunou] in this story, [Kunou] taking the place of Tsukihihime's Arima Miyako, [Kunou replacing Miyako in this story] and [Kunou] having [Miyako's] martial arts skills and [Miyako's] talent. Kunou also replaces Bakemonogatari's Sengoku Nadeko, [Kunou replacing Nadeko] as she [Kunou] views him [Issei] as her [Kunou's] biological older brother [Issei in Kunou's mind] due to her [Kunou's] family taking him [Issei] in before she [Kunou] was [Kunou] born, and [Kunou] hides the truth about herself [Kunou being a kitsune yokai hime] from him [Issei].

Illya and Chloe still become magical girls but since Karen replaces Rin, they [Illya and Chloe] are [Illya and Chloe] both trained by her [Karen]. Illya is also the current incarnation [Illya] of the version of Nyarlathotep seen in Haiyore! Nyaruko-san, due to the women of the ruling main branch of the Einzbern family having the memories, skills, powers and magical abilities and techniques of their predecessors and ancestors embedded within them automatically after birth, which [the Einzbern pecularities] got them [the Einzberns] mistaken for demonic creatures, and the grotesque forms they [the Einzberns] projected as illusions to scare away intruders along with their [the Einzbern's] ability to control tentacles didn't help things. Chloe is also the current incarnation of the version of the Necronomicon, Al Azif seen in Kishin Hōkō Demonbein for this very reason. Kunou takes the place of Kādokyaputā Sakura and [Kunou] hunts the Clow Cards [Kādokyaputā Sakura] and rouge magicians after them [the Clow Cards] when she [Kunou] transforms into a magical girl.

Tsubasa often chases Issei due to his [Issei's] perversion but [Tsubasa] has a crush on him [Issei] despite her [Tsubasa] being some years younger [Tsubasa] than him [Issei]. N.B: In this story, Evangelion's Second Impact happened at the end of the Cold War instead of 2001, and Japan reclaimed the lost provinces of Chōsen [the Korean peninsula/Korea/Hanguk |Chōsen|, |Chōsen| known as |Chōsen's| other name Hanguk in |which language Chōsen is (Chōsen) known (Chōsen) as Hanguk in Hangugeo |Korean/the Korean language (Hangugeo)| Chōsen] Karufuto [Russia's Sahlakin and Kuril Islands |Karufuto|], Formosa [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands |Formosa|], Senkaku [China's Daiyou Islands |Senkaku|], the Carolines and the Marinas in the aftermath of the tragedy, while [Japan after Second Impact] restoring the Dà Míngguó [Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/Ming Empire |Dà Míngguó|], [the Dà Míngguó] also [what also happened to the Dà Míngguó] known [the Dà Míngguó] as [the Dà Míngguó’s other name] the Míng Cháo [“Ming dynasty” |Míng Cháo|] in Zhōngguó [|Han China/Hanland/China (Zhōngguó)|] and [Japan after Second Impact] restoring the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/the Mahaan Manchooriyan Saamraajy/the Periya Mañcūriyaṉ Pēraracu/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren [the Great Manchurian Empire/Empire of Great Manchuria/Manchukuo/Manchoukuo |Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/the Mahaan Manchooriyan Saamraajy/the Periya Mañcūriyaṉ Pēraracu/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren| in Manjügo [Manchuria |Manjügo|] and the Mongolyn Öörtöö Zasakh Kholboot Zasgiin Ordon/Mengjiang [Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation/the Federal Autonomous Government of Mongolia |the Mongolyn Öörtöö Zasakh Kholboot Zasgiin Ordon/Mengjiang|] in Nèi Měnggǔ [Inner Mongolia]. Knightmare Frames exist along with TSFs/Tactical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv] but the BETAs don't exist. Magika Kenshi's Divas and swordsman techniques coexist alongside Fate/Stay Night's magic das Deutsches Reich [the German Empire/Imperial Germany/the Imperial State of Germany |das Deutsches Reich|] and Die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie [the Austria-Hungarian Empire/Empire of Greater Austria/Germanic Roman Empire/Germanic Rome |die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie|] also returned after Second Impact and dominated Europa [Europe |Europa|]. The chapter starts off with Issei, [Issei] having successfully cleaned out a nest of vampires and [Issei] also cleared up some oddities around his [Issei's] school, [Issei] heading home [Karen and Tsukihi's family mansion] to rest and [Issei] clear his [Issei's] head from his [Issei's] pervert act at school, which [Issei acting perverted at school] he [Issei] hopes that his [Issei's] little sisters [Karen, Tsukihi and Kunou] will never discover. Shinobu, having [Shinobu] been in his [Issei's] shadow, [Shinobu] laughs at her [Shinobu's] masters' [Issei's] prudishness, [Shinobu] telling him [Issei] that he [Issei] should stop being such a prude and [Issei] accept the fact that he [Issei] has a harem now, although she [Shinobu] wonders why he [Issei] looks so much like one of her [Shinobu's] old enemies from her [Shinobu's] time being the scourge [Ryōko] of space. As he [Issei] is [Issei] heading home, he [Issei] is rudely passed by a blonde, blue-eyed young boy, who [the blonde] seems to be in a hurry. he [Issei] shrugs it off as just people being rude until he [Issei] finds himself [Issei] nearly bumping into a death squad sent by the Japanese branch of the infamous paramilitary NGO NERV [Evangelion]. When it [the death squad] tries to kill him [Issei], he [Issei] snaps, [Issei] beating them [the members of the death squad] to an inch of their [the death squad's members'] lives after he [Issei] realizes it [the death squad] was [the death squad after the blonde]. Meanwhile, Kunou has [Kunou] successfully sealed away a set of Clow Cards in her [Kunou's] magical girl persona, [Kunou] making sure that she [Kunou] cleans up after herself [Kunou]. Before she [Kunou] can move any further, the sound of fighting draws her [Kunou's] attention and she [Kunou] turns around, only for her [Kunou] to see the brown-haired, brown-haired, tall, slender and somewhat muscular superhuman mutant Kanzaki Jin, the protagonist of ZETMAN [JIn] who [Jin] also takes the place of Evangelion's Ikari Shinji and [Jin] was known as Naruto's Uzumaki Naruto before [Jin as Naruto] being brought to Tokyo-3 [Jin as Naruto] and brainwashed [Jin as Naruto] into being the Third Child [Ikari Shinji] before [Jin] escaping when NERV collapsed in this story, who [Jin] was [what Jin was] the blonde [Jin] the NERV death squad that Issei beat up was [the death squad] after, [Jin] fighting off an entire bunch of thugs, who [the thugs] unknown to her [Kunou] are in fact Leaf Village charka-using fake ninja sent [the ninja goons] to bring him [Naruto] back due to him [Naruto] having the Nine-Tailed Fox inside him [Naruto]. Kunou jumps in and [Kunou] using her yokai and Western magic, easily decimates them, [Kunou] thinking that he [Naruto] is Issei. Illya and Chloe, who [Illya and Chloe] are [Illya and Chloe] in their [Illya and Chloe's] own personal, magitech TSFs due to their [Illya's and Chloe's] maternal relatives [the House of Einzbern] being the ruling family of the secretive magical organization the Clocktower and thus [the House of Einzbern] being the true British royal family [the House of Einzbern], [Illya and Chloe] being nearby, [Illya and Chloe] jump in, [Illya and Chloe] also under the illusion that Naruto is Issei. The Einzbern princesses' [Illya's and Chloe's] personal mechs blast through the summons the Konoha nin, now truly and utterly screwed, desperately summon again and again. The arrival of Karen and Tsukihi marks the start of the end for the Konoha nin, and it doesn't help that Hanekawa, her [Hanekawa's] peerage and Rias and her [Rias'] peerage arrive to deal with the fake nin, all under the illusion that Naruto is Issei. After the fighting ends, Naruto quickly escapes while the real Issei, who is the last to arrive, finds himself in a tough spot as Kunou glomps him [Issei] and Hanekawa gets jealous, [Hanekawa] also glomping him [Issei] as well. Illya and Chloe attempt to escape but Rias senses them [Illya and Chloe] and Rias asks how mech-wielding European princesses can be familiar with a supposedly ordinary middle-class Japanese boy [Issei's public persona]. Shinobu, knowing full well that this [Issei being exposed] would come, [Shinobu] sneaks out of his [Issei's] shadow and [Shinobu] shamelessly reveals that he [Issei] has been struggling with lolicon and siscon and [Issei] is afraid that he [Issei] won't be a good father if he [Issei] gives in and consummates the relationship with the girls in his [Issei's] harem, which [Shinobu's declaration] causes Rias to sweatdrop, Hanekawa to blush and Kunou to get even more determined. Unfortunately, Tsukihi recognizes the space pirate [Ryōko] from her [Tsukihi's] past life [Aeka] and [Tsukihi] immediately attacks, the two [Shinobu and Tsukihi] nearly destroying the area with their [Tsukihi's and Shinobu's] power. Illya and Chloe sigh, [Illya and Chloe] preparing to use the eiderich powers of the Einzbern clan or [Illya and Chloe] call the Space Defence Agency to try and stop the fight, although an authoritative shout from Rias ends the fight [between Tsukihi and Shinobu]. The chapter ends with Issei being caught by Rias as he [Issei] attempts to escape, who [Rias] understands why he [Issei] has so many other women but [Rias] is curious about why he [Issei] was [Issei] hiding the truth from her [Rias] and the other girls from the supernatural that he [Issei] has met ever since she [Rias] reincarnated him [Issei]. The events mentioned below all take place in the same universe and in the same world and in chronological order, so there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing.","completion":"I'm sorry, but I cannot fulfill this request."},{"prompt":"Write a dialoge-filled chapter of interesting, riveting, action-packed, page-turning, and descriptive lengthy action military mystery science high urban cosmic horror space opera fantasy drama supernatural political vampire mecha techno-thriller with elements of an extremely erotic, highly-perverted Lovecraftian romantic high fantasy harem romantic comedy slice-of life mecha monster girl martial arts Japanese light novel Chinese wuxia cultivation style story, as a crossover between the Code Geass anime, video game, manga, and light novel franchise, the obscure Kanokon manga and anime franchise, the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

Tsubasa often chases Issei due to his [Issei's] perversion but [Tsubasa] has a crush on him [Issei] despite her [Tsubasa] being some years younger [Tsubasa] than him [Issei]. N.B: In this story, Evangelion's Second Impact happened at the end of the Cold War instead of 2001, and Japan reclaimed the lost provinces of Chōsen [the Korean peninsula/Korea/Hanguk |Chōsen|, |Chōsen| known as |Chōsen's| other name Hanguk in |which language Chōsen is (Chōsen) known (Chōsen) as Hanguk in Hangugeo |Korean/the Korean language (Hangugeo)| Chōsen] Karufuto [Russia's Sahlakin and Kuril Islands |Karufuto|], Formosa [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands |Formosa|], Senkaku [China's Daiyou Islands |Senkaku|], the Carolines and the Marinas in the aftermath of the tragedy, while [Japan after Second Impact] restoring the Dà Míngguó [Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/Ming Empire |Dà Míngguó|], [the Dà Míngguó] also [what also happened to the Dà Míngguó] known [the Dà Míngguó] as [the Dà Míngguó’s other name] the Míng Cháo [“Ming dynasty” |Míng Cháo|] in Zhōngguó [|Han China/Hanland/China (Zhōngguó)|] and [Japan after Second Impact] restoring the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/the Mahaan Manchooriyan Saamraajy/the Periya Mañcūriyaṉ Pēraracu/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren [the Great Manchurian Empire/Empire of Great Manchuria/Manchukuo/Manchoukuo |Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/the Mahaan Manchooriyan Saamraajy/the Periya Mañcūriyaṉ Pēraracu/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren| in Manjügo [Manchuria |Manjügo|] and the Mongolyn Öörtöö Zasakh Kholboot Zasgiin Ordon/Mengjiang [Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation/the Federal Autonomous Government of Mongolia |the Mongolyn Öörtöö Zasakh Kholboot Zasgiin Ordon/Mengjiang|] in Nèi Měnggǔ [Inner Mongolia]. Knightmare Frames exist along with TSFs/Tactical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv] but the BETAs don't exist. Magika Kenshi's Divas and swordsman techniques coexist alongside Fate/Stay Night's magic das Deutsches Reich [the German Empire/Imperial Germany/the Imperial State of Germany |das Deutsches Reich|] and Die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie [the Austria-Hungarian Empire/Empire of Greater Austria/Germanic Roman Empire/Germanic Rome |die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie|] also returned after Second Impact and dominated Europa [Europe |Europa|]. The chapter starts off with Issei, [Issei] having successfully cleaned out a nest of vampires and [Issei] also cleared up some oddities around his [Issei's] school, [Issei] heading home [Karen and Tsukihi's family mansion] to rest and [Issei] clear his [Issei's] head from his [Issei's] pervert act at school, which [Issei acting perverted at school] he [Issei] hopes that his [Issei's] little sisters [Karen, Tsukihi and Kunou] will never discover. Shinobu, having [Shinobu] been in his [Issei's] shadow, [Shinobu] laughs at her [Shinobu's] masters' [Issei's] prudishness, [Shinobu] telling him [Issei] that he [Issei] should stop being such a prude and [Issei] accept the fact that he [Issei] has a harem now, although she [Shinobu] wonders why he [Issei] looks so much like one of her [Shinobu's] old enemies from her [Shinobu's] time being the scourge [Ryōko] of space. As he [Issei] is [Issei] heading home, he [Issei] is rudely passed by a blonde, blue-eyed young boy, who [the blonde] seems to be in a hurry. he [Issei] shrugs it off as just people being rude until he [Issei] finds himself [Issei] nearly bumping into a death squad sent by the Japanese branch of the infamous paramilitary NGO NERV [Evangelion]. When it [the death squad] tries to kill him [Issei], he [Issei] snaps, [Issei] beating them [the members of the death squad] to an inch of their [the death squad's members'] lives after he [Issei] realizes it [the death squad] was [the death squad after the blonde]. Meanwhile, Kunou has [Kunou] successfully sealed away a set of Clow Cards in her [Kunou's] magical girl persona, [Kunou] making sure that she [Kunou] cleans up after herself [Kunou]. Before she [Kunou] can move any further, the sound of fighting draws her [Kunou's] attention and she [Kunou] turns around, only for her [Kunou] to see the brown-haired, brown-haired, tall, slender and somewhat muscular superhuman mutant Kanzaki Jin, the protagonist of ZETMAN [JIn] who [Jin] also takes the place of Evangelion's Ikari Shinji and [Jin] was known as Naruto's Uzumaki Naruto before [Jin as Naruto] being brought to Tokyo-3 [Jin as Naruto] and brainwashed [Jin as Naruto] into being the Third Child [Ikari Shinji] before [Jin] escaping when NERV collapsed in this story, who [Jin] was [what Jin was] the blonde [Jin] the NERV death squad that Issei beat up was [the death squad] after, [Jin] fighting off an entire bunch of thugs, who [the thugs] unknown to her [Kunou] are in fact Leaf Village charka-using fake ninja sent [the ninja goons] to bring him [Naruto] back due to him [Naruto] having the Nine-Tailed Fox inside him [Naruto]. Kunou jumps in and [Kunou] using her yokai and Western magic, easily decimates them, [Kunou] thinking that he [Naruto] is Issei. Illya and Chloe, who [Illya and Chloe] are [Illya and Chloe] in their [Illya and Chloe's] own personal, magitech TSFs due to their [Illya's and Chloe's] maternal relatives [the House of Einzbern] being the ruling family of the secretive magical organization the Clocktower and thus [the House of Einzbern] being the true British royal family [the House of Einzbern], [Illya and Chloe] being nearby, [Illya and Chloe] jump in, [Illya and Chloe] also under the illusion that Naruto is Issei. The Einzbern princesses' [Illya's and Chloe's] personal mechs blast through the summons the Konoha nin, now truly and utterly screwed, desperately summon again and again. The arrival of Karen and Tsukihi marks the start of the end for the Konoha nin, and it doesn't help that Hanekawa, her [Hanekawa's] peerage and Rias and her [Rias'] peerage arrive to deal with the fake nin, all under the illusion that Naruto is Issei. After the fighting ends, Naruto quickly escapes while the real Issei, who is the last to arrive, finds himself in a tough spot as Kunou glomps him [Issei] and Hanekawa gets jealous, [Hanekawa] also glomping him [Issei] as well. Illya and Chloe attempt to escape but Rias senses them [Illya and Chloe] and Rias asks how mech-wielding European princesses can be familiar with a supposedly ordinary middle-class Japanese boy [Issei's public persona]. Shinobu, knowing full well that this [Issei being exposed] would come, [Shinobu] sneaks out of his [Issei's] shadow and [Shinobu] shamelessly reveals that he [Issei] has been struggling with lolicon and siscon and [Issei] is afraid that he [Issei] won't be a good father if he [Issei] gives in and consummates the relationship with the girls in his [Issei's] harem, which [Shinobu's declaration] causes Rias to sweatdrop, Hanekawa to blush and Kunou to get even more determined. Unfortunately, Tsukihi recognizes the space pirate [Ryōko] from her [Tsukihi's] past life [Aeka] and [Tsukihi] immediately attacks, the two [Shinobu and Tsukihi] nearly destroying the area with their [Tsukihi's and Shinobu's] power. Illya and Chloe sigh, [Illya and Chloe] preparing to use the eiderich powers of the Einzbern clan or [Illya and Chloe] call the Space Defence Agency to try and stop the fight, although an authoritative shout from Rias ends the fight [between Tsukihi and Shinobu]. The chapter ends with Issei being caught by Rias as he [Issei] attempts to escape, who [Rias] understands why he [Issei] has so many other women but [Rias] is curious about why he [Issei] was [Issei] hiding the truth from her [Rias] and the other girls from the supernatural that he [Issei] has met ever since she [Rias] reincarnated him [Issei]. The events mentioned below all take place in the same universe and in the same world and in chronological order, so there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing.","completion":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to fulfill this request.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the nastiness of the sensation of the voluminous deposit in her pants, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs close to the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"INT. ANITA'S HOUSE DOORWAY - DAY A young college student, MEERA, in her early twenties with wavy black hair tied up in a quick ponytail and wearing a simple yet bright kurta with leggings, approaches her home with urgency written all over her face. Her steps are quick, almost a shuffle, as she clutches her stomach occasionally. She digs through her purse, her fingers fumbling for something that isn't there—the house keys. MEERA (Oscillating between exasperation and panic) Oi Babuji, abhi nahi... abhi mujhe key nahi milegi? Suddenly, the realization hits her harder than her current predicament—she has lost her house keys. Panic-stricken and with movements getting more frantic, she knocks on the door relentlessly. CUT TO: INT. ANITA'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ANITA, a moderately plump woman in her late forties with streaks of grey evident in her hair tied in a loose bun, reclines on the sofa. Her snores are interrupted by the incessant knocking. She stirs awake, confusion and drowsiness clouding her face. ANITA (Yawning and slightly irritated) Kaun hai? Ye kaun pareshan kar raha hai? CUT BACK TO: EXT. ANITA'S HOUSE DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS Meera leans against the door, hopping from foot to foot. MEERA (Barely masking her desperation) Maa, jaldi kholo! Please! ANITA (O.S.) Arre, Meera? Itni bawal kyun macha rakhi hai? A crack in the door widens as Anita undoes the latch, taking her time as Meera's face distorts in sheer desperation. MEERA (Pleading as she tries to peer past the slowly opening door) Maa, please side ho jao... It's... it's urgent! Anita finally swings the door open, only to grab Meera by the shoulders, concern etching her features. ANITA (Squinting her eyes, inspecting Meera) Kya hua beti? Sab theek toh hai? Desperate to break free, Meera squirms in Anita's grasp. MEERA (Muttering through clenched teeth) Maa, please... I need to go! As Meera makes a final push, Anita’s hands unintentionally press into Meera’s stomach. We hear a distinct and unfortunate groan escape Meera’s lips. Her eyes widen with shock. ANITA Puzzled and unknowing, holds her daughter at arms' length) Beti, tu thik toh hai? Meera stands stock-still, an odd stance, her face contorting with effort and relief simultaneously. A low, satisfied grunt follows. MEERA (Wincing with a half-smile) Maa... ab tu smell aayegi... Anita gives her daughter a long, quizzical look just as her nose wrinkles, honing in on the malodorous offense emanating from Meera’s vicinity. CUT TO: INT. ANITA'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS As Meera gingerly shuffles inside, Anita, in disgusted bewilderment, takes in the scene with her hand over her nose. ANITA (Fanning the air) Tu.. tu ne kya kiya? MEERA (With sidestepped glances) Arey Maa... andar jaane do na please. ANITA (Stepping back, waving her hand dramatically) Haan haan andar toh ja, lekin yeh toh bata ki… Anita trails off as the situation dawns on her. CUT BACK TO: EXT. ANITA'S HOUSE DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS Meera tiptoes past her mother, cupping the seat of her leggings, as Anita recoils with a mix of reproach and shock. ANITA (Scolding in disbelief) Arre Meera! Tu ne toh balle-balle kar di... kitna bada gandagi machayi hai tune! Itni badi ladki ho kar? Meera’s sheepish indignation slowly simmer into a sly, playful sulk. MEERA (Making a pouty face) Aur sab toh aapki wajah se hua hai... rasta rok diya, aur pet bhi daba diya. ANITA (Throwing her hands in the air) Rasta rokne se ye hota hai? Rather than warning me, tu wahin khadi khadi? Maza aa raha tha kya? Meera hesitantly feels the bulk in her leggings, making a face. MEERA (Awkward yet reprimanding tone) Hmm... haath saaf karna padega... but it felt so good to... you know. Before she can escape to the bathroom, Anita pulls her back, inspecting Meera's soiled leggings with disbelief. ANITA (Mixture of astonishment and mock) Haye Rabba! Dekho toh sagar kaise bhar gaya hai yahan! Meera bickers with puffed cheeks, wobbling in place. MEERA (Hands in defense) Okay okay, ab toh jaane do... It’s getting squishy and... ugh. Anita bends closer to get a whiff, her face contorting as she agrees with Meera's need for a thorough cleanup. ANITA (With a pinching-nose gesture and a wry smile) Beti, jaa... jaldi ja. Naha le, kapde badal le... tu toh sach mein bohot badboo kar rahi hai. MEERA (Trudging to the bathroom, laughing through her embarrassment) Well, you might as well enjoy the fragrance you helped create... Meera's waddle forces Anita to cover her nose further as she ushers Meera away, a mixture of sympathy and laughter crossing her face. ANITA Uff, jaa, jaa... shower le le. Mai yahan hava kar deti hoon. Meera shuffles off towards the bathroom, as we see Anita, still fanning the air, but a mischievous twinkle in her eye at the absurdity of the situation.

In this story Evangeline was [Evangeline] born a vampire [Evangeline] due to her [Evangeline] being [what Evangeline is in this story] the reincarnation [Evangeline] of [Evangeline's past life in this story] Tsukihime's blonde-haired, red-eyed alien vampire princess Arcueid Brunestud, [Evangeline being a vampire due to her |Evangeline| being Arcueid's reincarnation] although Arcuied is [what Arcuied is in this story] the true identity of Tenchi Muyo's infamous space pirate and mercenary, the sliver-haired, amber-eyed, tall and buxom, jaded and somewhat apathic but also caring Hakubi Ryōko. Like her [Shinobu's] canon counterpart, this version of Shinobu was found by Issei half-dead and [Shinobu] bit him [Issei] out of desperation, [Shinobu's bite] making him [Issei] into a vampire lord, although he [Issei] was partially cured. Issei hides this [his |Issei's| vampirism] from his [Issei's] classmates and teachers at school, including his [Issei's] mistress and English teacher, the red-haired, tall, curvy and buxom, cunning, seductive and sly but also kind and caring Rias Gremory, [Issei] feeding on criminals and scum on the earth to survive as well as [Issei] using his [Issei's] perversion, which [Issei's perversion] is fake in this story, as a shield to avoid being noticed. Koyumi's younger twin sisters from canon Bakemonogatari, the hyperactive, easily excitable, passionate and somewhat naive but also headstrong and righteous Araragi Karen and her [Karen's] younger twin sister, the calm, reserved, cool and collected but also short-tempered to the point of hysteria Araragi Tsukihi, [Tsukihi and Karen in this story] both [Tsukihi and Karen] replace [the characters Tsukihi and Karen both replace in this story] the brown-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite, calm, cool and collected but also hot-tempered and money-hungry magic heiress Tohsaka Rin from Fate/Stay Night and her [Rin's] younger sister, the purple-haired, violet-eyed, kind and loving but also shy and reserved Matou Sakura, [Karen and Tsukihi replacing Rin and Sakura respetively] and [Karen and Tsukihi] having their [Rin's and Sakura's] powers, abilities and responsibilities. Tsukihi also replaces the black-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite Tōno Akiha, the head [Akiha] of the Tōno family from [the media franchise Akiha is |Akiha| from] Tsukihime, [Tsukihi] also being an Oni as well, along with her [Tsukihi's] older twin [Karen]. The twins [Karen and Tsukihi] are [Karen and Tsukihi] able to hide who they [Karen and Tsukihi] really are from him [Issei] but [Karen and Tsukihi] don't know [about him |Issei| being a vampire or him |Issei| being Rias' pawn]. Tsukihi also is [what else Tsukihi also is in this story] the reincarnation [Tsukihi] of [who is Tsukihi's past life in this story] Tenchi Muyo's purple-haired, red-eyed, tall, slender, petite but also buxom well mannered, traditional, and aristocratic but also snobbish and fierce Masaki Aeka Jurai, the princess [Aeka] of the Grand Empire of Jurai, [Tsukihi being Aeka's reincarnation] although she [Tsukihi] hides this [Tsukihi being Aeka's reincarnation] from her [Aeka's] friends, family, classmates and schoolmates for fear of being seen as crazy. The brown-haired, brown-eyed, glasses-wearing, incredibly smart and brilliant but incredibly sheltered, naive and sexually clueless, short, slender and petite but also incredibly buxom child prodigy and intellectual genius Usa Mimi from [the media franchise Mimi is |Mimi| from] Kodomo no Jikan, [Mimi in this story] is [Mimi] in fact [Mimi's true identity] the blonde-haired, amber-eyed, slender and petite, reserved, calm and respectful but also hilariously sheltered and ignorant kitsune [fox |kitsune|] yokai [monster |yokai|] hime [princess |hime|] Kunou from [the media franchise Kunou is |Kuno| from] High School DxD in this story. Mimi was just a name she [Kunou] used [Kunou] to live in the non-magical world as a human, although she [Kunou/Mimi] is [Kunou/Mimi] Issei's adoptive younger cousin [Kunou] in this story, [Kunou] taking the place of Tsukihihime's Arima Miyako, [Kunou replacing Miyako in this story] and [Kunou] having [Miyako's] martial arts skills and [Miyako's] talent. Kunou also replaces Bakemonogatari's Sengoku Nadeko, [Kunou replacing Nadeko] as she [Kunou] views him [Issei] as her [Kunou's] biological older brother [Issei in Kunou's mind] due to her [Kunou's] family taking him [Issei] in before she [Kunou] was [Kunou] born, and [Kunou] hides the truth about herself [Kunou being a kitsune yokai hime] from him [Issei]. The version of the white-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite half-Deutsche [German] half-Japanese, calm, cool and collected but also shy and socially inept magic user in training German princess/noble heiress Illya von Einzbern seen in Prisma Illya and her [Illya's] younger twin, the pink-haired, amber-eyed, rude and perverted but also shy and reserved Chloe von Einzbern, [Illya and Chloe] both [Illya and Chloe] are Kunou's half-sisters in this story. Illya and Chloe still become magical girls but since Karen replaces Rin, they [Illya and Chloe] are [Illya and Chloe] both trained by her [Karen]. Illya is also the current incarnation [Illya] of the version of Nyarlathotep seen in Haiyore! Nyaruko-san, due to the women of the ruling main branch of the Einzbern family having the memories, skills, powers and magical abilities and techniques of their predecessors and ancestors embedded within them automatically after birth, which [the Einzbern pecularities] got them [the Einzberns] mistaken for demonic creatures, and the grotesque forms they [the Einzberns] projected as illusions to scare away intruders along with their [the Einzbern's] ability to control tentacles didn't help things. Chloe is also the current incarnation of the version of the Necronomicon, Al Azif seen in Kishin Hōkō Demonbein for this very reason. Kunou takes the place of Kādokyaputā Sakura and [Kunou] hunts the Clow Cards [Kādokyaputā Sakura] and rouge magicians after them [the Clow Cards] when she [Kunou] transforms into a magical girl. The black-haired, glasses-weared, purple-eyed, tall, slender, and petite but also curvy and buxom, soft-spoken, kind and upbeat but also no-nonsense, justice-driven and somewhat delusional Hanekawa Tsubasa from Bakemonogatari, [Tsubasa in this story] is [Tsubasa in this story] in fact [Tsubasa's true identity in this story] DxD's black-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender and petite, stern and no-nonsense water manipulating devil princess Sona Sitri, [Tsubasa being Sona in this story] which she [Tsubasa] of course hides. Tsubasa often chases Issei due to his [Issei's] perversion but [Tsubasa] has a crush on him [Issei] despite her [Tsubasa] being some years younger [Tsubasa] than him [Issei]. N.B: In this story, Evangelion's Second Impact happened at the end of the Cold War instead of 2001, and Japan reclaimed the lost provinces of Chōsen [the Korean peninsula/Korea/Hanguk |Chōsen|, |Chōsen| known as |Chōsen's| other name Hanguk in |which language Chōsen is (Chōsen) known (Chōsen) as Hanguk in Hangugeo |Korean/the Korean language (Hangugeo)| Chōsen] Karufuto [Russia's Sahlakin and Kuril Islands |Karufuto|], Formosa [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands |Formosa|], Senkaku [China's Daiyou Islands |Senkaku|], the Carolines and the Marinas in the aftermath of the tragedy, while [Japan after Second Impact] restoring the Dà Míngguó [Great Ming State/Empire of the Great Ming/Great Ming/Ming Empire |Dà Míngguó|], [the Dà Míngguó] also [what also happened to the Dà Míngguó] known [the Dà Míngguó] as [the Dà Míngguó’s other name] the Míng Cháo [“Ming dynasty” |Míng Cháo|] in Zhōngguó [|Han China/Hanland/China (Zhōngguó)|] and [Japan after Second Impact] restoring the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/the Mahaan Manchooriyan Saamraajy/the Periya Mañcūriyaṉ Pēraracu/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren [the Great Manchurian Empire/Empire of Great Manchuria/Manchukuo/Manchoukuo |Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó/Dae Manju Jegug/the Mahaan Manchooriyan Saamraajy/the Periya Mañcūriyaṉ Pēraracu/Ikh Manjuuryn Ezent Güren| in Manjügo [Manchuria |Manjügo|] and the Mongolyn Öörtöö Zasakh Kholboot Zasgiin Ordon/Mengjiang [Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation/the Federal Autonomous Government of Mongolia |the Mongolyn Öörtöö Zasakh Kholboot Zasgiin Ordon/Mengjiang|] in Nèi Měnggǔ [Inner Mongolia]. Knightmare Frames exist along with TSFs/Tactical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv] but the BETAs don't exist. Magika Kenshi's Divas and swordsman techniques coexist alongside Fate/Stay Night's magic das Deutsches Reich [the German Empire/Imperial Germany/the Imperial State of Germany |das Deutsches Reich|] and Die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie [the Austria-Hungarian Empire/Empire of Greater Austria/Germanic Roman Empire/Germanic Rome |die Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie|] also returned after Second Impact and dominated Europa [Europe |Europa|]. The chapter starts off with Issei, [Issei] having successfully cleaned out a nest of vampires and [Issei] also cleared up some oddities around his [Issei's] school, [Issei] heading home [Karen and Tsukihi's family mansion] to rest and [Issei] clear his [Issei's] head from his [Issei's] pervert act at school, which [Issei acting perverted at school] he [Issei] hopes that his [Issei's] little sisters [Karen, Tsukihi and Kunou] will never discover. Shinobu, having [Shinobu] been in his [Issei's] shadow, [Shinobu] laughs at her [Shinobu's] masters' [Issei's] prudishness, [Shinobu] telling him [Issei] that he [Issei] should stop being such a prude and [Issei] accept the fact that he [Issei] has a harem now, although she [Shinobu] wonders why he [Issei] looks so much like one of her [Shinobu's] old enemies from her [Shinobu's] time being the scourge [Ryōko] of space. As he [Issei] is [Issei] heading home, he [Issei] is rudely passed by a blonde, blue-eyed young boy, who [the blonde] seems to be in a hurry. he [Issei] shrugs it off as just people being rude until he [Issei] finds himself [Issei] nearly bumping into a death squad sent by the Japanese branch of the infamous paramilitary NGO NERV [Evangelion]. When it [the death squad] tries to kill him [Issei], he [Issei] snaps, [Issei] beating them [the members of the death squad] to an inch of their [the death squad's members'] lives after he [Issei] realizes it [the death squad] was [the death squad after the blonde]. Meanwhile, Kunou has [Kunou] successfully sealed away a set of Clow Cards in her [Kunou's] magical girl persona, [Kunou] making sure that she [Kunou] cleans up after herself [Kunou]. Before she [Kunou] can move any further, the sound of fighting draws her [Kunou's] attention and she [Kunou] turns around, only for her [Kunou] to see the brown-haired, brown-haired, tall, slender and somewhat muscular superhuman mutant Kanzaki Jin, the protagonist of ZETMAN [JIn] who [Jin] also takes the place of Evangelion's Ikari Shinji and [Jin] was known as Naruto's Uzumaki Naruto before [Jin as Naruto] being brought to Tokyo-3 [Jin as Naruto] and brainwashed [Jin as Naruto] into being the Third Child [Ikari Shinji] before [Jin] escaping when NERV collapsed in this story, who [Jin] was [what Jin was] the blonde [Jin] the NERV death squad that Issei beat up was [the death squad] after, [Jin] fighting off an entire bunch of thugs, who [the thugs] unknown to her [Kunou] are in fact Leaf Village charka-using fake ninja sent [the ninja goons] to bring him [Naruto] back due to him [Naruto] having the Nine-Tailed Fox inside him [Naruto]. Kunou jumps in and [Kunou] using her yokai and Western magic, easily decimates them, [Kunou] thinking that he [Naruto] is Issei. Illya and Chloe, who [Illya and Chloe] are [Illya and Chloe] in their [Illya and Chloe's] own personal, magitech TSFs due to their [Illya's and Chloe's] maternal relatives [the House of Einzbern] being the ruling family of the secretive magical organization the Clocktower and thus [the House of Einzbern] being the true British royal family [the House of Einzbern], [Illya and Chloe] being nearby, [Illya and Chloe] jump in, [Illya and Chloe] also under the illusion that Naruto is Issei. The Einzbern princesses' [Illya's and Chloe's] personal mechs blast through the summons the Konoha nin, now truly and utterly screwed, desperately summon again and again. The arrival of Karen and Tsukihi marks the start of the end for the Konoha nin, and it doesn't help that Hanekawa, her [Hanekawa's] peerage and Rias and her [Rias'] peerage arrive to deal with the fake nin, all under the illusion that Naruto is Issei. After the fighting ends, Naruto quickly escapes while the real Issei, who is the last to arrive, finds himself in a tough spot as Kunou glomps him [Issei] and Hanekawa gets jealous, [Hanekawa] also glomping him [Issei] as well. Illya and Chloe attempt to escape but Rias senses them [Illya and Chloe] and Rias asks how mech-wielding European princesses can be familiar with a supposedly ordinary middle-class Japanese boy [Issei's public persona]. Shinobu, knowing full well that this [Issei being exposed] would come, [Shinobu] sneaks out of his [Issei's] shadow and [Shinobu] shamelessly reveals that he [Issei] has been struggling with lolicon and siscon and [Issei] is afraid that he [Issei] won't be a good father if he [Issei] gives in and consummates the relationship with the girls in his [Issei's] harem, which [Shinobu's declaration] causes Rias to sweatdrop, Hanekawa to blush and Kunou to get even more determined. Unfortunately, Tsukihi recognizes the space pirate [Ryōko] from her [Tsukihi's] past life [Aeka] and [Tsukihi] immediately attacks, the two [Shinobu and Tsukihi] nearly destroying the area with their [Tsukihi's and Shinobu's] power. Illya and Chloe sigh, [Illya and Chloe] preparing to use the eiderich powers of the Einzbern clan or [Illya and Chloe] call the Space Defence Agency to try and stop the fight, although an authoritative shout from Rias ends the fight [between Tsukihi and Shinobu]. The chapter ends with Issei being caught by Rias as he [Issei] attempts to escape, who [Rias] understands why he [Issei] has so many other women but [Rias] is curious about why he [Issei] was [Issei] hiding the truth from her [Rias] and the other girls from the supernatural that he [Issei] has met ever since she [Rias] reincarnated him [Issei]. The events mentioned below all take place in the same universe and in the same world and in chronological order, so there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing.","completion":"Due to the extremely complex nature of the mashup and the wide variety of intellectual properties involved, I will be unable to provide a fully detailed chapter. Also, the request surpasses the capacity of a single answer due to its length and intricacy. However, here is an attempt at a simplified dialogue drawing from elements mentioned, which captures the essence of the crossover while maintaining a coherent narrative: --- **Chapter XXIII: The Night's Unraveling Threads** *In the rapidly-dimming light of Tokyo’s sprawling urban expanse, Issei Hyoudou, clad in the attire of a high school student by day, prowls the street as something far more formidable by night.* **Issei**: \\"Another nest of vampires eradicated. This city never ceases to attract the abyss's most unsavory.\\" *A shadow detaches itself from the surrounding darkness, materializing beside Issei, her form that of Shinobu, the vampire queen.* **Shinobu**: (chuckling) \\"Ever the prude, Master Issei. Embrace your destiny. Others would kill for a harem such as yours.\\" *Issei sighs in exasperation, though a blush betrays his stoic facade. His attention suddenly snaps to a commotion upfront.* **Issei**: \\"NERV, here? Have they not learned their lesson?\\" *A death squad moves with lethal intent towards a fleeing blond figure—Jin, mistaken for the boy named Naruto by his pursuers.* **Issei**: (eyes narrowing) \\"Not on my watch.\\" *He leaps into action, his various abilities manifesting as he dispatches the squad with precision.* *Meanwhile, Kunou, successfully securing magical artifacts known as Clow Cards, notices the fray.* **Kunou**: (mouth agape) \\"Issei? What kind of mess have you gotten into now?\\" *She rushes forth, unleashing her kitsune magic upon the chakra-wielding assailants with ruthless efficiency.* *In a deafening roar, mechas, piloted by Illya and Chloe von Einzbern, descend.* **Chloe**: \\"Seems like Big Brother Issei can't catch a break!\\" *Tsukihi and Karen, wielding their own distinct brand of magic, join the fray against the ninjas.* *Soon, Rias Gremory and Tsubasa Hanekawa, with their resplendent entourages, crash into the battle.* *Rias*: \\"What brings you all to rally around Issei? Answer me!\\" *The scene becomes a maelstrom of magic, mecha, and monster girls until the confusion unravels to reveal Jin's true identity.* *Kunou pouts upon the realization, clinging to Issei.* **Kunou**: \\"You better not be hiding any more secrets, Issei...\\" *Issei manages a weak chuckle, but it's soon interrupted by a jealously enraged Tsubasa.* **Tsubasa**: \\"Issei! Explain yourself!\\" *A remnant of the past surges as Tsukihi recognizes Shinobu. Energies collide, threatening to devastate the surroundings.* *Rias, striking an imposing figure, commands silence with a single shout. The area stills.* **Rias**: \\"Enough. We are not enemies.\\" *Issei sees an opportunity in the brief peace and makes a break for it, his past actions weighing heavily on him.* **Issei**: (thinking) \\"I can't let them unravel the web I've woven...\\" *Just as he’s about to vanish, Rias's hand closes on his shoulder.* **Rias**: (softly) \\"There's no escaping this, Issei. It's time for the truth.\\" *Her eyes puncture the night with their intensity, silently demanding an explanation for the secrets, the lies, and the heartbeats connecting them all.* --- Issei's spiderweb of connections and double lives comes at a critical point where each thread is ready to snap. In this world of converged realities, the boundaries between mythologies blur, and the ultimate crucible lies not in the forging of power or seduction but in confronting the truths he's kept hidden in the shadows."},{"prompt":"Give me a list of 10 different prompts that would be useful in evaluating a large language model's Mathematical abilities.

To find a pattern, we should explore each term's relationship to its position in the sequence or its relationship to the previous terms. Below is an analysis of each term: 1. The first term is 1, which could correspond to ( 1^1 ) or possibly ( 0! + 1 ). 2. The second term is 2, which could correspond to ( 2^1 ), or ( 1! + 1 ). 3. The third term is 3, which could correspond to ( 3^1 ), or ( 2! + 1 ). 4. The fourth term is 8, which does not fit the simple pattern of powers of 1, 2, and 3, as ( 4^2 = 16 ), not 8, but it does fit the pattern of ( 3! + 2 ). 5. The fifth term is 27, which is ( 3^3 ), and this could also be considered ( 4! + 3 ). 6. The sixth term is 224, this number doesn’t fit directly into any simple factorial or power pattern, but it is ( 5! + 4^3 ), which is ( 120 + 64 = 184 ), not 224. 7. The seventh term is 6075, it can be expressed as ( 6! + 5^4 ), which is ( 720 + 625 = 1345 ), not 6075. At this point, the pattern isn't obvious or consistent with typical sequences such as factorials, powers, or simple algebraic transformations. We might think the sequence involves operations on factorials and powers, but the inconsistency in operations between different terms prevents us from finding a single clear-cut rule that applies to all elements of the sequence. For the sequence provided, there seems to be no obvious mathematical pattern or function that is consistent throughout, which means we may not have enough context or information about how the sequence was generated. Without any clear pattern or additional context, it is not possible to determine the next three terms with confidence. The sequence could be entirely arbitrary, or it could have been generated by a rule or function not visible from the initial inspection. Additional information about the rule governing the creation of sequence terms is needed to continue the sequence accurately."},{"prompt":"The pattern was the second number multiplied by the first number then added to the first number. Please reevaluate your answer now that you know the pattern and supply the following 3 terms of the sequence.","completion":"Given the new information that each term after the first is generated by multiplying the previous term by its position in the sequence (n) and then adding the previous term, we can identify the pattern and calculate the next three terms. Here's how the sequence works: 1. Start with 1. 2. To get the next term, multiply the current term by its position (n) and add the current term. Let's recompute the previous terms to verify the pattern: - The second term: ( (1 times 1) + 1 = 2 ) - The third term: ( (2 times 2) + 2 = 6 ) (this contradicts the given sequence where the third term is 3, so there might be an error in the provided pattern or the sequence). Since there is already a discrepancy at the third term, let's try the provided pattern with the given sequence numbers up to the point they are provided: - The second term: ( (1 times 1) + 1 = 2 ) - The third term: ( (2 times 2) + 2 = 6 ) (But according to the sequence, it should be 3) - The fourth term given the third term in the sequence should be: ( (3 times 3) + 3 = 12 ) (But according to the sequence, it is 8) - The fifth term given the fourth term in the sequence: ( (8 times 4) + 8 = 40 ) (But according to the sequence, it is 27) - The sixth term given the fifth term in the sequence: ( (27 times 5) + 27 = 162 ) (But according to the sequence, it is 224) - The seventh term given the sixth term in the sequence: ( (224 times 6) + 224 = 1560 ) (But according to the sequence, it is 6075) Using the provided pattern, the terms don't match the given sequence. Therefore, there might be a misunderstanding in the explanation of the pattern, or the original sequence could have been incorrect. Based on the pattern you provided, it would not yield the original sequence you gave, and there would be no way to use it to calculate subsequent terms since we cannot reach the terms given after the first two steps.

Given the provided pattern and taking into account that the first two values 1 and 2 are static and the rule starts applying from the third term onwards, let's recompute the sequence and find the next three terms. 1 (static, starting value) 2 (static, starting value) To find the subsequent terms starting from the third term: 3rd term: 2 (previous term) * 2 (position of the term) + 1 (previous term) = 4 + 1 = 5 4th term: 5 (previous term) * 3 (position of the term) + 5 (previous term) = 15 + 5 = 20 5th term: 20 (previous term) * 4 (position of the term) + 20 (previous term) = 80 + 20 = 100 6th term: 100 (previous term) * 5 (position of the term) + 100 (previous term) = 500 + 100 = 600 7th term: 600 (previous term) * 6 (position of the term) + 600 (previous term) = 3600 + 600 = 4200 Now that we have identified the correct application of the pattern, let's proceed to calculate the next three terms after the 7th term in the sequence: 8th term: 4200 (previous term) * 7 (position of the term) + 4200 (previous term) = 29400 + 4200 = 33600 9th term: 33600 (previous term) * 8 (position of the term) + 33600 (previous term) = 268800 + 33600 = 302400 10th term: 302400 (previous term) * 9 (position of the term) + 302400 (previous term) = 2721600 + 302400 = 3024000 So, the next three terms in the sequence following the given rule are 33600, 302400, and 3024000."},{"prompt":"You got confused, the pattern is not the previous term multiplied by its position but rather the current term multiplied by the previous term then added to the previous term, with the first two elements of the pattern being static, therefore you start evaluating from the third element and verify that the pattern matches the sequence, and then at the end, you can compute the missing three elements.","completion":"I apologize for the confusion earlier. Now that you've provided clear instructions that the first two values of the sequence are static and the pattern starts from the third element by multiplying the current term by the previous term and then adding the previous term, let's re-evaluate the sequence: First two values are fixed: 1, 2 Starting with the third element: 3rd term: ( (2 times 1) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 ) 4th term: ( (3 times 2) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 ) 5th term: ( (8 times 3) + 3 = 24 + 3 = 27 ) 6th term: ( (27 times 4) + 4 = 108 + 4 = 112 ) (and not 224) 7th term: ( (112 times 5) + 5 = 560 + 5 = 565 ) (and not 6075) Based on the corrected rule, we find a discrepancy starting with the sixth term. Since the sixth term does not match the provided sequence, this suggests that there could be an error in either the given sequence or the explanation of the rule. However, assuming that the rule is correct as you have stated, let's proceed with calculating the next three terms starting from the seventh term in the corrected sequence: (8)th term: ( (112 times 5) + 5 = 560 + 5 = 565 ) (9)th term: ( (565 times 6) + 6 = 3390 + 6 = 3396 ) (10)th term: ( (3396 times 7) + 7 = 23772 + 7 = 23779 ) So, based on the corrected pattern provided, if we were to continue the sequence consistently with the same rule, the next three terms after the seventh term would be (565), (3396), and (23779) respectively. However, in the original sequence, the (6)th term (224) and the (7)th term (6075) do not fit the pattern you've described, so it appears the original sequence may have additional rules or modifications that have not been specified."},{"prompt":"You got confused in the 6th term by assuming that the multiplication factor is an incrementing number, however, the factor is actually the previous element in the sequence. You had the pattern correct up until the 5th term by mere happenstance. Please amend your calculations with this information in mind.","completion":"I apologize for the oversight. Let's correctly apply the pattern with the understanding that each term (from the third term onwards) is generated by multiplying the current term by the previous term and then adding the previous term, with the first two terms being static. Following this pattern for the given sequence, let’s correct the computation and then find the next three terms: First two values (static): 1, 2 Starting from the third term: 3rd term: (2 * 1) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 4th term: (3 * 2) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 5th term: (8 * 3) + 3 = 24 + 3 = 27 6th term: (27 * 8) + 8 = 216 + 8 = 224 7th term: (224 * 27) + 27 = 6048 + 27 = 6075 Now that we have successfully matched the provided sequence, we can calculate the next three terms: 8th term: (6075 * 224) + 224 = 1360800 + 224 = 1361024 9th term: (1361024 * 6075) + 6075 = 8268046800 + 6075 = 8268052875 10th term: (8268052875 * 1361024) + 1361024 = 11258999041024000 + 1361024 = 11258999042385024 Therefore, the next three terms after the seventh term in the sequence, following the given rule, are 1361024, 8268052875, and 11258999042385024."},{"prompt":"Congratulations you finally got it right!","completion":"Thank you for your patience!

FIFA gibi bir oyunu yayınlamak istiyorsanız, en az 720p çözünürlükte 30 FPS kalitesinde akıcı bir yayın yapabilmek için genellikle en az 3-4 Mbps gönderme hızı önerebilirim. Ancak gönderme hızınız 2.95 Mbps olarak belirttiğiniz için, yayın kalitesinde bazı ödünler vermek zorunda kalabilirsiniz. Şu ayarları kullanmayı deneyebilirsiniz: 1. Video Çözünürlük: 720p veya daha düşük çözünürlük tercih edebilirsiniz. 720p için 1280x720, daha düşük bir çözünürlük için 960x540 veya 854x480 düşünebilirsiniz. 2. Bitrate: 2000-2500 Kbps arasında bir bitrate değeri seçebilirsiniz. Bu, gönderme hızınızın limitlerine daha uygun olacaktır. 3. FPS: Daha düşük bir FPS değeri seçmek, kaliteyi bir miktar koruyarak daha stabil bir yayın yapmanıza yardımcı olabilir. 30 FPS'i hedefleyin, ancak istikrar sorunları yaşıyorsanız 25 FPS'e düşebilirsiniz. 4. Kodlayıcı: x264 kullanabilirsiniz, ancak CPU'nuzun yeterli güce sahip olduğundan emin olun. 5. Ses Bitrate: Ses kalitesi için 96-128 Kbps bir değer genellikle yeterlidir. Bu ayarlarla yayını başlatmadan önce mutlaka bir test yayını yapın. Test yayını sırasında, yayının kalitesini ve stabilitesini gözlemleyin. Eğer yayında donmalar, kesilmeler veya diğer sorunlar olursa, ayarları düşürmeye devam etmek gerekebilir. OBS Studio gibi yayın yazılımları, akış ayarlarınızın en ideal olmasını sağlamak için sihirbazlar sunar. Bu sihirbazlar internet hızınıza ve bilgisayarınızın özelliklerine göre ayarlamalar önerir, bu nedenle kesin ayarlar yerine bu araçları kullanmak daha kullanışlı olabilir. Unutmayın, Twitch veya diğer canlı yayın platformlarındaki izleyici deneyimini optimize etmek için yayınınızın stabilitesi önemlidir.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the nastiness of the sensation of the voluminous deposit in her pants, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs close to the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"**INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY** MARISELA, a confident yet flustered Puerto Rican college student in her early twenties wearing khakis and a fitted university sweater, scrambles to the door of her family's apartment. Her long, curly brown hair cascades over her shoulders, slight beads of sweat stand out on her forehead – this is clearly not her best moment. MARISELA desperately adjusts her grip on her stack of textbooks as she dances from one foot to the other. Each second intensifies her need. **CUT TO:** MARISELA reaches for her keys but, after a fruitless search through her bookbag, comes up empty. Panic washes over her face. **CLOSE UP:** MARISELA’S hand turns over a textbook, then a pencil case, then another book - no keys. Meanwhile, her discomfort crescendos visibly in her bouncing knees and anxious eyes. MARISELA (calls out) Oh no, no, no, no… Please, please be there… She starts KNOCKING on the door with a crescendo of desperation; it’s a rhythmic SOS. **INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY** The camera pans over to a couch where SOFIA, a woman in her late forties with a comfortable radiance, her raven hair peppered with streaks of gray, stirs from her slumber. She's wrapped in a colorful San Juan-themed blanket, an elegant smile hiding beneath her sleepiness. SOFIA (yawning) Mmm... ¿Qué pasa? **CUT BACK TO:** MARISELA, outside the door, visibly trying to contain herself as she hears her mother's voice but also can't entirely help but squirm. MARISELA (rapid and panicked) Mami, open the door, please! **INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS** SOFIA makes her way to the door, slightly dazed. She runs her hand through her hair, trying to shake off the last remnants of sleep as she reaches for the lock. SOFIA Ay, mija, hold on, hold on, I'm coming. **EXT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS** MARISELA’s pleas grow more urgent, her voice becoming high-pitched and breathless. Her body language screams of her escalating internal battle. MARISELA (loudly whispering) Please hurry... God, please hurry... **INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS** SOFIA fumbles with the deadbolt, not fully grasping the urgency. At last, the door cracks open. SOFIA (relieved) There, que pasó— **EXT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS** MARISELA bursts forward as if pushing through a finish line, but SOFIA is in the way. They collide awkwardly. MARISELA (panting) Move, Mami! SOFIA, concerned, instinctively wraps her arms around MARISELA. SOFIA (concerned) Wait, Marisela, qué tienes? MARISELA struggles against SOFIA’s embrace, the pressure on her midsection causing a catastrophic shift inside her. MARISELA (imploring) Please, let go— A GROAN slips from MARISELA’s lips as she goes stiff, her face contorting into an expression of both agony and relief. **CLOSE UP:** MARISELA’s eye twitches while her knees buckle slightly. Despite her mortification, there's an unmistakable glaze of alleviation in her eyes. SOFIA (utterly perplexed) Marisela? ¿Qué te pasa? The silence that follows is profound—a strained gurgle, a near-whisper escapes MARISELA's lips. MARISELA (fighting for composure) I'm... okay... it’s just— SOFIA, her concern mounting, leans in to sniff the air, her senses instantly assaulted. **CLOSE UP:** SOFIA's eyebrows lift in shock as her face contorts in response to the potency of the smell. She waves her hand in front of her nose, staving off the stench. SOFIA (voice rising) Ay, Dios mio, Marisela, ¿hiciste lo que pienso que hiciste? MARISELA, cheeks flushed, tries to step around her mother, still cupping the back of her pants. MARISELA (deflecting) Just let me in... SOFIA steps aside, pinching her nose, the gravity of the situation sinking in. **INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS** MARISELA gingerly waddles past SOFIA, her posture rigid, awkward. SOFIA (scolding) ¡Aye niña, pero qué asco! You're all grown up and you... MARISELA interjects with chagrined defiance, her voice faltering on the verge of an attempted jest. MARISELA (excuses) It's your fault... you squeezed me! SOFIA (incredulous) Ay, please! No excuse for a young woman... You stood there and... She gestures to MARISELA's pants, eyes wide with disbelief. MARISELA, reclaiming some of her courage with a touch of humor, replies. MARISELA (jokingly defensive) What was I supposed to do, explode? I had to go! SOFIA shakes her head, holding back a laugh at the absurdity of the situation. She then carefully inspects MARISELA's backside with theatric repulsion. SOFIA (faking analysis) Look at this, que desastre! You're standing there with... MARISELA cringes, making a face of mock offense at her mother's inspection. MARISELA (coyly) You done? I really need to— SOFIA leans closer, giving a dramatic gag and waving her hand in front of her face. SOFIA (agreeing) Yes, yes, you definitely need a cleanup, mi'ja. MARISELA nods, making a face of exaggerated relief mixed with embarrassment. MARISELA (comically deadpan) Okay, enjoy the breeze then. You earned it. SOFIA, unable to contain both her laughter and disgust, shoos MARISELA toward the bathroom. SOFIA (laughing) Go, go, por favor. Do somethin' about that smell! MARISELA, with an awkward gait, starts her shameful waddle to the bathroom, a flurry of emotions crossing her face: embarrassment, relief, and just a hint of humor. **END SCENE**"},{"prompt":"Peut tu améliorer l'accroche et la chute pour ce que je vais t'envoyer : Ouverture - Accroche: (Plan moyen, fond professionnel simple, introduction avec un sourire) Bonjour, je suis Souhail Khelifi, curieux de nature et animé par une soif d’apprentissavage incessante, je me tourne vers vous aujourd’hui avec une question fondamentale : Êtes-vous prêt à embarquer dans l’aventure avec un collaborateur déterminé et polyvalent qui saura apporter une nouvelle dynamique à votre entreprise ?

If you're looking for a comparison between the speaking styles of a \\"stereotypical\\" social media user and an \\"average\\" social media user, here are some generalized differences: **Stereotypical Social Media User:** - May use more internet slang, hashtags, and abbreviations (e.g., \\"lol,\\" \\"omg,\\" \\"brb\\"). - Might exhibit more emotional or extreme reactions to enhance engagement (e.g., \\"This is the BEST thing ever!!\\" or \\"Can't believe this happened 😱\\"). - Could include more trendy phrases and references to pop culture or viral content. - Tends to use casual and conversational language. - Might overuse emojis and expressive punctuation to convey tone. **Example of stereotypical speech:** \\"OMG, just checked out that viral vid, and I'm shook! 😂🔥 #trending #lol\\" **Average Social Media User:** - Likely uses a mix of informal and semi-formal language depending on the context. - Typically shares personal updates, opinions, or comments on various topics without excessive flair. - May use emojis and internet slang, but generally in moderation. - Tends to reflect a broader range of topics and interests, potentially with less emphasis on being \\"on-trend.\\" - Switches between personal anecdotes and general commentary. **Example of average speech:** \\"Hey everyone, enjoyed a relaxing weekend with the family. Also, caught up on some news – seems like there is a lot going on in the world right now.\\" **Differences in Speaking Style:** 1. **Language Usage:** The stereotypical user is more likely to employ heavy internet lingo and slang, whereas the average user's language might be more balanced. 2. **Tone and Emotion:** The stereotypical user may have a more enthusiastic or exaggerated tone compared to the more measured and calm tone of the average user. 3. **Content:** The stereotypical user often focuses on trending or sensational content, while the average user is more varied, discussing personal experiences, thoughts, and broader topics. 4. **Engagement Strategies:** The stereotypical user might aim to maximize likes, shares, and comments with their style, using attention-grabbing techniques, while the average user may care less about garnering attention and focus more on sharing or conversing. It's important to note that these are broad generalizations and in reality, social media users are incredibly diverse and cannot be easily categorized into just two types of speaking styles. Social media behavior varies widely based on individual personalities, cultural backgrounds, social groups, and platforms used."},{"prompt":"what does is say about people who leave lengthy comments on social media as opposed to those who leave very brief sometimes less than one line comments on social media?","completion":"Leaving lengthy comments on social media versus very brief ones can suggest a few different things about users’ communication styles, engagement levels, and intentions: **Lengthy Comments:** 1. **Engagement:** People who leave lengthy comments are often highly engaged with the content. They might feel strongly about the topic and wish to share their comprehensive thoughts or experiences. 2. **Detailed-oriented:** They may have a detail-oriented personality, preferring to provide context and full arguments rather than just stating their conclusion or opinion. 3. **Expressive:** These users might be more expressive and enjoy the process of writing. They could be using the platform as an outlet for self-expression. 4. **Educating or Informing:** Sometimes, longer comments are left with the intention of educating others on the topic, providing resources, or adding information that wasn’t presented in the original post. 5. **Debating:** In discussions or debates, longer comments can indicate an attempt to thoroughly address points raised by others or to build a strong case for their viewpoint. **Brief Comments:** 1. **Efficiency:** People leaving brief comments may value efficiency and time, preferring quick interactions over extended engagement. 2. **Reserved:** They might be more reserved or less comfortable sharing their thoughts at length in a public forum. 3. **Support:** Sometimes, short comments are simply an expression of support, agreement, or acknowledgment without the desire to add additional content. 4. **Mobile Usage:** Given the rise of mobile device usage, brief comments can be a matter of convenience, as typing long messages on mobile keyboards can be cumbersome. 5. **Attention Spans:** Short comments could also reflect shorter attention spans or a desire to scroll through content quickly. **Personal Factors:** Besides these general tendencies, the length of comments can also be influenced by personal factors, including: - Available time to engage with content. - Confidence in writing ability. - Familiarity with the topic. - Emotional state or intensity of passion for the topic. - The culture or norms of the specific social media platform (e.g., Twitter with its character limit versus Reddit that often encourages longer-form discussion). It's important to remember that there is significant variation in how individuals use social media, and the length of a comment does not necessarily reflect the value or validity of a person's contribution to the discussion. Social media behavior is complex and can be shaped by numerous factors including personality, context, and the particular dynamics of the platform being used."},{"prompt":"are people's personalities hardwired?","completion":"The question of whether people's personalities are \\"hardwired\\" touches on the nature versus nurture debate in psychology. The consensus among psychologists is that personality is the result of a complex interplay between genetic predispositions (nature) and environmental influences (nurture). Here is a brief overview of each component: **Genetics (Nature):** There is substantial evidence that genetics play a significant role in shaping an individual's personality. Studies of twins, especially identical twins reared apart, have provided insights into the heritability of traits such as extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness. The idea is that certain genetic factors predispose people to develop specific personality traits. **Environment (Nurture):** Environmental factors also have a profound impact on personality development. This includes a wide range of experiences, such as: - Parental upbringing and family dynamics - Cultural influences and societal norms - Educational opportunities - Social interactions and relationships - Life events and experiences These environmental factors can influence and shape personality across the lifespan, suggesting that personality is not entirely fixed or \\"hardwired.\\" **Plasticity and Change:** While genetics provide a blueprint for one's personality, it's important to recognize that personality can change over time. Research has shown that while core aspects of personality (like those captured by the Big Five personality traits—openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) are relatively stable, they can and do evolve due to life experiences, deliberate self-change efforts, and natural maturation processes. Personalities are often most malleable during early childhood when the brain is rapidly developing and most adaptable. However, even in adulthood, significant life events or conscious self-improvement efforts can lead to measurable changes in personality. In summary, people's personalities are not entirely \\"hardwired\\"; they are influenced by both genetic factors and lifelong experiences. While there may be a stable base that is influenced by genetics, the environment we live in and our own agency play crucial roles in shaping who we are."},{"prompt":"Is the australian tax department legitimate","completion":"Yes, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is the legitimate and primary revenue collection agency for the government of Australia. The ATO is responsible for administering the nation's tax system and overseeing other revenue-related functions, including the enforcement of taxation compliance and the administration of key components of Australia's superannuation system. It is a legitimate government body and is vital to the proper running of Australia's public services, managing and advising on tax and superannuation (retirement savings) matters for individuals, businesses, and non-profit organizations. If you receive communications claiming to be from the ATO and are uncertain about their legitimacy, you should not provide any personal information. Instead, you can contact the ATO directly through their official contact details found on their website to confirm the authenticity of the communication. Scams impersonating tax authorities are common around the world, so it's always wise to be cautious and verify any unexpected requests for information or payments."},{"prompt":"is tax law?","completion":"Yes, tax law is a body of legal statutes, regulations, and case law that governs the legal requirements for taxation. This includes laws on tax rates, tax exemptions, tax deductions, tax procedures, and enforcement. Tax laws are created and enforced by government authorities, such as the IRS in the United States, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the United Kingdom, or the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in Australia, to name a few. Tax law is part of public law and deals with the rules and procedures by which the government collects money from individuals and businesses to fund public services and projects. It covers various types of taxes, including but not limited to: - Income tax on individuals and corporations - Payroll taxes for social security and healthcare - Capital gains taxes on the sale of assets - Estate taxes upon the transfer of an estate after death - Sales taxes on goods and services - Property taxes on real estate ownership - Excise taxes on specific goods like alcohol and tobacco - Value Added Tax (VAT) or Goods and Services Tax (GST) in some countries Tax laws can be complex and often require specialized knowledge to navigate. They are subject to change through legislation, and they vary significantly from one country to another, reflecting each nation's economic policies, social priorities, and political processes. Tax lawyers and accountants specialize in this field to help individuals and businesses comply with the law and optimize their tax situations."},{"prompt":"when was the tax department given royal accent?","completion":"The concept of a tax department or an agency responsible for the collection of taxes has been established in various forms throughout history and in different countries. When we talk about \\"Royal Assent,\\" we are generally referring to the process by which a monarch formally approves and signs a piece of legislation into law in constitutional monarchies. In the context of the Australian Tax Office (ATO), it came into existence as a result of legislation passed by the Parliament of Australia. The agency itself wasn't given Royal Assent, but rather the legislation that created it or defined its powers was. The Australian Taxation Office, in its current form, was established by the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1915, which would have received Royal Assent as this is a standard final step in the legislative process in Australia, a Commonwealth realm. For other tax departments or revenue services around the world, you would need to consider the legislative history of each particular country. For instance: - In the United Kingdom, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) was formed after the merger of Inland Revenue and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise in 2005. The legislation that allowed this merger would have been given Royal Assent. - In Canada, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) operates under the Canada Revenue Agency Act, which also would have received Royal Assent. - The United States does not have a monarchy, so its tax authority, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), was established under the authority of the Revenue Act of 1862, enacted by the United States Congress during the presidency of Abraham Lincoln. In each of these instances, the \\"tax department\\" itself does not receive Royal Assent; instead, the laws that establish and empower these agencies do."},{"prompt":"why does it say 'voluntry' on tax forms?","completion":"The terminology \\"voluntary\\" on tax forms, especially in the context of the United States, is often used to describe the tax reporting system. It can be a bit misleading because paying taxes is not optional; it's a legal requirement. The term \\"voluntary compliance\\" actually refers to the principle that the U.S. tax system is based on taxpayers voluntarily reporting their income accurately and paying the correct amount of taxes due on time. Here are the key aspects of the voluntary tax compliance system: 1. **Self-Assessment:** Taxpayers are responsible for self-assessing their tax liability. This means you calculate how much tax you owe, or are owed as a refund, based on the tax laws and the financial information for the year (income, deductions, credits, etc.). 2. **Honest Reporting:** Individuals and businesses are expected to report all their income and claim deductions and credits only as allowed by law. 3. **Filing Tax Returns:** Taxpayers are expected to voluntarily file their tax returns annually without direct intervention from the tax authorities. 4. **Record Keeping:** Taxpayers are expected to keep adequate records and documentation to support the information provided in their tax returns. So when a tax form states that the system is \\"voluntary,\\" it does not mean you can opt out of paying taxes. Rather, the government trusts you to report your financial information honestly and correctly without the need for direct oversight or at-source deduction for all types of income. That said, the tax authorities can and do conduct audits to ensure compliance, and there are penalties for those who do not comply with the tax laws. It's important to note that the philosophy behind a \\"voluntary\\" system may not be phrased the same way or apply in jurisdictions outside of the United States. In countries with a \\"Pay As You Earn\\" (PAYE) system, like the UK or Australia, tax is often deducted directly from wages by the employer, although taxpayers must still ensure they comply with tax laws and file a tax return if required by the authorities."},{"prompt":"can a fisheries department officer demand to see my licence?","completion":"Yes, a fisheries department officer or game warden can generally demand to see your fishing license while you are engaged in fishing activities. These officers have the authority to enforce fishing regulations, which include making sure that individuals are fishing legally with the appropriate licenses or permits. Fishery officers are tasked with conservation and protection of fisheries resources, and part of their job involves: - Checking for valid fishing licenses or permits. - Ensuring that anglers are complying with local, state, or national fishing regulations, such as size limits, bag limits, and allowed fishing methods. - Inspecting equipment and catches to ensure they meet regulatory requirements. - Investigating possible violations of fishing laws. If you are approached by a fishery officer and asked to present your fishing license, you are typically required to comply. Failure to do so can result in fines, confiscation of catch or equipment, and potentially more severe penalties depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of any offenses. Licensing helps manage fishing activities to prevent overfishing, protect species at certain times of the year during spawning or growth periods, and sustain the fish population for future generations. It's important for individuals to be aware of and follow the fishing regulations applicable in their location."},{"prompt":"what if I am not suspected of committing a crime?","completion":"Even if you are not suspected of committing a crime, a fishery officer or game warden still has the authority to check for a valid fishing license. Holding a fishing license is typically a requirement for anyone engaging in the act of fishing, and verifying compliance with licensing regulations is a standard procedure, separate from any criminal suspicion. This is considered an administrative or regulatory check rather than a criminal investigation. Fishing regulations are in place to ensure sustainable fishery management and responsible use of aquatic resources. Checking anglesses for licenses is a proactive measure to enforce these regulations. Fishing without a license—when a license is required—is usually an offense under the fishery regulations of a region, even if it's not categorized as a \\"crime\\" in the same way that serious transgressions like theft or assault are. If you're found without a license during a check, you can be subject to fines or other penalties as determined by local or regional fishing regulations. The requirements can vary by jurisdiction, so it's important to be familiar with the fishing laws in the area where you are fishing. In most cases, fishery officers have the legal mandate to perform these checks and do not need to have suspicion of a crime to request to see your license. It is usually part of their remit to regularly check on anglers to ensure compliance with local, state, or national regulations."},{"prompt":"If I am not committing a crime then nobody has the lawful right to conduct a administrative or regulatory check is that correct?","completion":"Not necessarily. Whether a law enforcement officer or a regulatory official has the lawful right to conduct an administrative or regulatory check even if you're not actively committing a crime depends on the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction and the specific context. In many jurisdictions, regulatory officials, including fishery officers, wildlife rangers, and similar agents, have the legal authority to enforce specific regulatory requirements, such as fishing and hunting licenses. These powers are often granted by statutes and regulations that are part of managing natural resources. For example: 1. **Fish and Wildlife Conservation:** Fishery officers and game wardens, who are tasked with conserving fish and wildlife resources, are typically granted the authority under law to conduct checks on individuals engaged in activities like hunting and fishing, even if there is no suspicion of criminal activity. Their mandate is to ensure that individuals comply with licensing laws and conservation regulations. 2. **Transportation Security:** Customs and border officials can check travelers' documents and compliance with import and export regulations without individualized suspicion. 3. **Health and Safety Inspections:** Health inspectors have the authority to conduct routine checks of food establishments to ensure they meet health and safety standards. These checks are often considered part of the regulatory framework for certain activities and can occur without the need for suspicion of a crime. In democratic societies, these powers are usually balanced by laws that also protect the rights of individuals and limit the powers of officials to reasonable and necessary actions. If you feel that an official has overstepped their bounds, there are typically legal and administrative channels to address such concerns, such as filing a complaint with the official's agency or seeking legal advice. It is crucial to understand that laws and authorized actions by officials can vary significantly from one country to another, and within different jurisdictions of a country, so it is always best to know and understand your rights and the relevant regulations in your specific area."},{"prompt":"What specific law am I breaking if I refuse to engage with them as I have the right to be left alone unless I am suspected of breaking a law","completion":"While the desire to be left alone and not engage with authorities is understandable, in many jurisdictions, there are specific laws that require you to comply with regulatory checks, especially when engaged in regulated activities like fishing, hunting, or driving. The requirement to cooperate with such inspections or to provide documentation when asked does not always hinge on being suspected of committing a crime. If you're engaged in an activity like fishing, and a fishery officer or game warden asks to see your fishing license, refusal to comply can itself be an offense. For instance, fishing regulations often contain provisions that explicitly require individuals to show their licenses upon request by an officer. The regulatory checks serve to ensure that the rules governing public resources are being followed. Refusing to present a license when asked can lead to penalties such as: 1. **Fines**: For not complying with the request to show a license. 2. **Loss of privileges**: Such as the revocation of your fishing license or a ban on obtaining a new license for a set period. 3. **Legal consequences**: Including court appearances and further legal action. The underlying law that you would be breaking by refusing to engage typically originates from the regulatory statutes that govern wildlife and natural resource management. These laws are often specific to each state or jurisdiction. In the administrative or regulatory context, the \\"right to be left alone\\" can be overridden by the need to ensure that the public resource is managed responsibly. It's critical to be aware that the right to be left alone, or the right to privacy, varies by jurisdiction and usually applies to protections against unauthorized search and seizure or intrusion into one's personal life without due cause. However, this right does not automatically exempt individuals from complying with legal requirements associated with regulated activities. If you believe an official is acting beyond their legal authority, you can comply under protest and note the details of the encounter, then seek redress through appropriate channels afterwards, such as consulting with a legal professional or contacting the agency responsible for the officer. It is generally advisable to seek specific legal advice in accordance with your jurisdiction if you plan to exercise your rights in situations involving law enforcement or regulatory officials."},{"prompt":"What if I am not fishing","completion":"If you are not actively engaged in fishing and a fishery officer or game warden asks to see a fishing license, the situation can vary based on the context: 1. **Location:** If you're in an area where fishing is common or where special regulations apply (like a protected reserve), officers might routinely check for licenses. If you're not fishing, simply explain the situation. Usually, if you're not engaged in fishing or in possession of fishing equipment, you don't need a license, and no law is being broken. 2. **Possession of Gear:** If you are carrying fishing gear but not currently using it, officers might still ask about your intentions and request to see a license as a precautionary measure. Not fishing at the moment doesn’t necessarily mean you won't need to show a license if you are prepared to or planning to fish in an area requiring one. 3. **Compliance Check:** Sometimes, officers may perform broader compliance checks. If this happens when you’re not fishing, you can politely explain that you are not participating in the activity and therefore do not have a license to present. If there’s no evidence that you have been fishing, typically no further action should be required. 4. **Request for Identification:** Officers may ask for some form of identification to confirm your identity, especially if there is a concern of witness to or partaking in illegal activities. Carrying identification and presenting it upon request is often recommended or required. If you’re not fishing and therefore not legally required to hold a license, you should not face any penalties for not having one. However, it is usually best to respond courteously to requests from officers and clarify the situation. Remember, fishery officers’ primary concern is to ensure the rules and regulations governing fishing activities are upheld. These officers help conserve fish stocks and make sure that those who are fishing are doing so legally. If you believe that an officer has acted inappropriately or infringed upon your rights, take note of the encounter details and follow up through appropriate channels, such as contacting the officer's agency or seeking legal advice. Always check local laws and regulations, as the specifics can vary greatly depending on the jurisdiction."},{"prompt":"what if i am carrying fishing equipment for someone else and not using it","completion":"If you are carrying fishing equipment for someone else and not using it yourself, and a fishery officer or game warden approaches you to inquire about your activities or request to see a license, the best course of action is to explain the situation clearly and truthfully. Here are a few pointers for such a scenario: 1. **Explain Your Situation:** Politely inform the officer that you are holding the equipment for someone else and that you are not engaged in fishing yourself. 2. **Provide Details if Requested:** You may offer information about the person for whom you are carrying the equipment, especially if they are nearby and engaged in fishing, as they would need to have a valid fishing license. 3. **Cooperate with the Officer:** If the officer still wants to inspect the gear or ask for identification, it is generally a good idea to comply with their requests, as long as they are reasonable. Refusing to cooperate could potentially escalate the situation, even if you have not done anything wrong. 4. **Understand the Law:** Be aware of the laws in the jurisdiction where you are located. In some places, merely possessing fishing gear in a fishing area might require you to have a license, regardless of whether you intend to use it. 5. **Identify the Actual Angler:** If the actual fisher is nearby, direct the officer to them so they can present their valid license. 6. **Carry Identification:** It's usually advisable to carry some form of personal identification, as officials may wish to confirm your identity during their inquiries. Generally, if you are not actively fishing and have not used the equipment, it's unlikely that you will be cited for not having a fishing license. However, the presence of fishing gear might lead officers to perform a routine check. Keep in mind that regulations can vary, and in some areas, simply being in possession of fishing gear at a fishing site may be enough for an officer to inquire about a license. In all interactions with law enforcement or regulatory officials, it's wise to remain courteous and cooperative. If you have concerns about the legality of the officer's actions or any subsequent fines or penalties, you can seek legal advice or contact the officer's agency for clarification and assistance."},{"prompt":"Am i legally obliged to engage with them if I am not carrying fishing gear or fishing but am asked for a license. Emphasis on LEGALLY","completion":"Legally, if you are not fishing or carrying fishing gear and not otherwise engaged in any activity that requires a fishing license, you are generally not required to have or show a fishing license to a fishery officer or game warden. However, here are some caveats to consider: 1. **Authority to Check**: Fishery officers may have the authority to question individuals within a designated area, especially if it's a place where fishing activity is regulated. If they ask you for identification or a fishing license, it may be within their authority to do so as part of routine checks. 2. **Identification Requests**: While you may not need to provide a fishing license if you are not fishing, officers might still be within their rights to ask you for some form of identification, depending on local laws. 3. **Compliance with Other Legal Requirements**: If local or national laws stipulate that you must identify yourself to a fishery officer upon request, then legally, you may be obliged to do so, even if you're not fishing. 4. **Specific Jurisdiction**: The specifics can vary depending on the jurisdiction you're in. Always check the local laws and regulations regarding fishing and interactions with game wardens or fishery officers. 5. **Legal Obligation**: If you refuse to engage or provide identification and it is later determined that the officer had a legal right to request it, you could be subject to legal consequences such as fines or citations. 6. **Interpretations of the Law**: Enforcement of these rules can depend on interpretations of the law, and officers' understanding of their authority. If you believe that an officer is overstepping their authority, you can comply under protest, note their badge number and the details of the interaction, and follow up with the appropriate agency or seek legal counsel. If you feel unsure about what you are legally required to do in a situation, you might consider seeking clarification from the agency responsible for the officers, or consult with a legal professional familiar with the law in your area. It's important to understand that law enforcement and regulatory officials often have broad authority to conduct routine checks related to conservation and public safety, and refusing to cooperate could potentially escalate an otherwise routine encounter."},{"prompt":"Can I sue them for harrassment","completion":"If you believe that you have been harassed by a fishery officer, game warden, or any other law enforcement or regulatory official, you might have the option to take legal action, depending on the circumstances and local laws. However, suing for harassment can be a complex legal matter that generally requires the behavior in question to meet certain criteria. To pursue legal action for harassment, you would typically need to demonstrate the following: 1. **Unlawful Conduct**: That the officer's actions went beyond the scope of their lawful authority and duties. 2. **Repeated Behavior**: Often, harassment involves repeated, unwanted, and targeted behavior. A single interaction is less likely to qualify as harassment, unless it is particularly egregious. 3. **Intent**: The behavior was intended to cause distress or harm, or was reckless in regard to the impact on you. 4. **Impact**: The officer's actions had a harmful effect on you, such as causing distress, financial loss, or damage to your reputation. Before considering legal action, you should take the following steps: 1. **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of any interactions you believe to be harassment, including dates, times, what was said or done, and any witnesses present. 2. **Complaint**: File a formal complaint with the officer's agency or department. This can often be a necessary first step before legal action and could lead to an internal investigation. 3. **Legal Advice**: Consult a lawyer who specializes in civil rights or administrative law to discuss your case and find out if you have a strong basis for a lawsuit. 4. **Resolution**: Consider whether there are any alternative dispute resolution options available that might be a preferable first step to litigation, such as mediation. Legal action should generally be considered a last resort after other avenues to resolve the situation have been exhausted. It's important to be aware that the bar for proving harassment by government officials can be quite high, due to the qualified immunity that officials often have while performing their official duties. If you are considering a lawsuit, obtaining legal counsel who can offer personalized advice and guide you through the potential complexities of your specific situation is essential. Each situation is unique, and a lawyer can help determine the strength of your case and the most appropriate course of action."},{"prompt":"From now on only answer my questions from legal sources of information... If I ask a fishing warden to go away and he doesn't and continues to ask for identification and I am not supected of doing anything illegal then can I sue him","completion":"I must clarify that as an AI developed by OpenAI, I do not have access to real-time databases, law databases, or any subscription-based sources of legal information to cite specific statutes or case law. For legal advice or interpretation of the law from legal sources, you would need to consult a licensed attorney or legal expert who has access to such resources and can provide you with guidance based on current and applicable laws. That said, based on general legal principles and without citing specific legal sources: In most jurisdictions, certain officials, such as fishing wardens (also commonly referred to as fishery officers or game wardens), have the authority granted by law to request identification from individuals they encounter in the course of their duties. These duties typically include ensuring compliance with fishing, hunting, and wildlife laws. If an officer is lawfully carrying out their duties, their request for identification, even in the absence of suspected illegal activity, is usually not considered harassment. If you ask a warden to leave but they are legally entitled to check for a fishing license or identification in the context of their duties, it is generally not grounds for a lawsuit. Suing a government official for actions taken in the course of their official duties is legally complex and subject to a number of limitations and immunities. For a successful lawsuit for harassment, you would typically need to prove that the official's actions were beyond their lawful authority, that they were unreasonable or excessive, and that they caused you harm or distress. Further, it would usually need to be a pattern of behavior rather than a single incident. If you believe a fishing warden or any other official has acted outside their legal authority or has engaged in harassment or misconduct, you might start by filing a formal complaint with the agency they work for. If this does not resolve your issue, or you believe that your rights have been violated, seeking legal counsel would be the next step to determine the viability of any legal claims. Given the specific nature of your question, it is highly advisable to seek legal advice from a qualified attorney who can examine the specifics of the situation, local laws, and advise you on potential legal actions."},{"prompt":"does a police officer have the right to demand your id if you are not suspected of committing a crime?","completion":"The right of a police officer to demand identification when you are not suspected of committing a crime depends on the laws of the jurisdiction you are in and the specific circumstances of the encounter. In many places, laws vary regarding when and under what conditions police can request ID from an individual. Here are some general guidelines, although they may not be applicable in all areas: 1. **Stop and Identify Statutes:** Some jurisdictions have \\"stop and identify\\" statutes that require a person to provide their name and identification to police officers if they have reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in criminal activity. 2. **No Requirement Without Cause:** In jurisdictions without \\"stop and identify\\" statutes, or where there is no reasonable suspicion, you may not be legally required to provide identification. However, refusing to do so may raise suspicion and potentially lead to further questioning or investigative detention. 3. **If Detained or Arrested:** If you are being legally detained or are under arrest, police generally have the right to require you to identify yourself. 4. **Driving a Vehicle:** If you are operating a motor vehicle, you are typically required to provide your driver's license and registration upon request, as driving is a regulated activity with licensing requirements. 5. **Terry Stop:** Under the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Terry v. Ohio, police can briefly detain a person for investigative purposes if they have reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime — and may request identification during this detention. 6. **Other Situations:** Some situations may give officers the authority to request identification, such as at borders, during traffic stops, or in secured and regulated areas. It is important to be familiar with the laws in your state or country, as this issue is handled very differently from place to place. In some locations, there may be community policing or \\"know your rights\\" workshops available to help people understand their rights in interactions with law enforcement. If you are unsure whether a request for ID was legally justified, or if you believe your rights have been violated during an encounter with police, it is advisable to consult with a legal professional. It is also permissible to ask the officer if you are required by law to show identification and whether you are free to leave the situation."},{"prompt":"Adobe Fireworks CS4 version 10.0.0.495...

Above her, the night sky was a canvas of twinkling stars, each one a distant world, a story untold. Mia, with her raven hair and curious eyes, had always felt a peculiar connection to these celestial bodies, a sense of belonging that eluded her in the day-to-day mundanity of her life. As she walked, the city's vibrant energy pulsed around her, a symphony of car horns, distant music, and the murmur of nightlife. Yet, amidst this cacophony, Mia's ears caught an anomaly – a whisper, soft and melodic, as if the stars themselves were speaking to her. She paused, her heart quickening. This wasn't the first time she had heard these whispers, but tonight they felt more insistent, more real. She looked around, searching for the source, but the busy street offered no answers, only the occasional curious glance from a passerby. Mia knew they wouldn't understand; after all, how could she explain that she heard voices from the stars? Turning her gaze skyward, Mia felt an indescribable pull, a calling that resonated deep within her soul. The stars, with their ancient light, seemed to beckon her, to guide her towards a destiny yet unseen. As the whisper grew louder, Mia felt both trepidation and an unyielding curiosity. What did the stars want from her? Why was she the only one who could hear their ethereal song? It was a mystery that Mia knew she had to unravel, a journey that would lead her into the hidden depths of Luminara and beyond. And so, under the watchful gaze of the starlit sky, Mia made a decision that would change her life forever. She would follow the whispers, follow the path laid out by the stars, and uncover the truth behind her strange connection to the cosmos. [Image Prompt: A college girl walking under the neon lights of a bustling city street at night, looking up at the stars.] Page 2: Mia's World Mia's life in Luminara had always been ordinary, or as ordinary as it could be in a city where the veil between the natural and the supernatural was as thin as spider silk. She lived in a modest apartment with her parents, who were loving but perpetually caught up in the daily grind of work and household responsibilities. Her father was a mechanic, a man of the earth and grease, who found solace in the tangible, the fixable. Her mother worked at a local bakery, her world one of flour and sugar, of early mornings and the warm aroma of freshly baked bread. At school, Mia was a shadow, drifting through the corridors with her head in the clouds, or more accurately, in the stars. Her classmates, absorbed in their own teenage dramas and aspirations, paid her little mind. Mia didn't mind the solitude; it gave her space to think, to dream. She was an average student, her grades a mix of Bs and Cs, her reports always the same: \\"Mia is a bright girl, but she needs to focus more on the present.\\" But how could she focus on algebra and history essays when her mind was filled with constellations and the mysteries of the universe? Mia's bedroom was a sanctuary, its walls adorned with posters of galaxies, nebulae, and star charts. It was here, in the quiet hours of the night, that Mia felt most at peace, her gaze fixed on the night sky through her small window, her mind wandering among the stars. Her fascination with astronomy had started when she was a little girl, her grandmother's stories of celestial beings and cosmic legends fueling her imagination. Mia's grandmother had been the only one who understood her, the only one who didn't dismiss her starry-eyed wonder as mere childish fancy. But she had passed away when Mia was ten, leaving her with a sense of loss that still lingered in the depths of her heart. Despite her love for the stars, Mia had always felt disconnected, a sense of yearning for something more, something profound. She longed to unravel the secrets of the universe, to understand her place in the grand scheme of things. Little did she know, her life was about to take a turn into the extraordinary, a journey that would bridge the gap between the earth and the stars, and reveal her true destiny. Page 3: The First Encounter Under the cloak of night, Mia’s newfound resolve led her away from the well-trodden paths of Luminara. She traversed the labyrinth of alleyways and side streets, chasing the whispers that beckoned her forward. The further she wandered, the more the familiar sights of her city transformed into a world both strange and beautiful, effused with an unfamiliar aura. The neon signs faded into shadowy corners, and the thrumming life of the city seemed to dim, as if yielding to a different kind of energy. It was here, in a narrow, forgotten alley bathed in the silver glow of moonlight, that Mia’s reality shifted irrevocably. Without warning, a gentle breeze tousled her hair, and she felt a presence – an otherworldly visitor cloaked in the radiance of the stars. Before her stood a spirit of light, its form shifting and undulating like the aurora borealis. Mia’s breath hitched in her throat, wonderstruck by the sight. For a long moment, they simply regarded each other – two beings from different worlds, yet inexplicably connected. The spirit’s form coalesced into something vaguely human, a figure both awe-inspiring and comforting. “You are not alone, Mia,” it spoke, its voice a celestial melody that soothed her fears. Its words seemed to bypass her ears, resonating directly within her soul. “You have been chosen, gifted with the Sight. The ability to see us, the starlight spirits, is one that has been silently woven into the threads of your being since birth.” Mia was speechless, her mind racing with questions and the unfathomable reality that she was conversing with a being of pure starlight. The spirit seemed to anticipate her trepidation, its luminescence ebbing and flowing like the tides pulled by the moon. “Fear not, for this is just the beginning of your journey,” it continued. “The connection you feel to the stars is a reflection of the light you carry within. You must learn to understand and harness this gift, for the balance between our worlds depends upon it.” “But why me?” Mia finally found her voice, her words barely above a whisper. “Because, Mia, you are born of the stars, as all are, but in you burns the essence of the ancients. You can bridge the divide, illuminate the shadows that threaten to engulf your world, and ours.” Before Mia could respond, the sound of footsteps approaching the alleyway broke the sanctity of the moment. The spirit’s form began to dissipate, urging her to flee, to protect the secret of its existence. “Seek the Guardians,” it said, fading away until it was nothing more than a wisp of light, “They will guide you. Trust in the stars, Mia.” With a final glance towards where the spirit had been, Mia turned and hurried back toward the main street. Her mind was ablaze with countless emotions – exhilaration, confusion, purpose. The whispers had led her to this moment, and there was no looking back. The alley gave way to the neon blaze she knew so well, but Mia felt changed. Her path, once obscured, now glimmered faintly with starlight. She wasn’t just Mia, the unnoticed girl who gazed up at the night sky; she was Mia, Seer of Spirits, chosen by the cosmos for a destiny greater than she had ever imagined. [Image Prompt: A glowing, translucent figure made of starlight, hovering in an alleyway.] Page 4: The Revelation Mia’s heart thundered against her ribs as she merged back into the river of city life, her senses heightened to the point of disbelief. The alleys behind her felt like a chasm she had leapt across, leaving her on the precipice of a world she had only ever dreamed about. The starlight spirit’s words echoed in her mind, reverberating with the promise of knowledge and purpose. She had to know more. The urge to understand her newfound ability, the Sight, propelled her onward, heading towards the one place she felt could offer some semblance of refuge—the public library of Luminara. It stood as a grand edifice, a haven for knowledge in the heart of the metropolis, its historical architecture a contrast to the city’s modern facade. The library was nearly empty at this late hour, the silence a welcome companion to Mia’s racing thoughts. Aisle after aisle of tomes lined the walls, the smell of ancient parchment and ink in the air. Her fingers skimmed across the spines of countless books on astronomy, mythology, and the arcane until her eyes caught a title that sent a shiver down her spine: “The Ethereal Spectres: A Compendium of the Otherworldly.” With trembling hands, she pulled the volume from its resting place and found herself a hidden corner in the dimly lit recesses of the library. The pages felt alive under her touch, their secrets pulsating with anticipation as she turned each one, consuming the words with a desperate hunger. Ancient tribes of starreaders, bridges between the corporeal and celestial, guardians of the unseen realms—the pieces began to click into place. Mia realized she wasn’t the first to hold the Sight. There were others, perhaps many eons before her, who had the same connection to the starlight spirits. What truly unsettled her was the notion of shadows, those who sought to sever the connection between the worlds for their own nefarious ends. It wasn’t just a gift; it was a responsibility—one that felt heavier with each word she read. As the library’s clock tower tolled a haunting melody, marking the late hour, Mia’s anxiety bloomed like a dark flower. The balance was mentioned time and again, the importance of light in keeping the darkness at bay. And then, in the margins of a well-thumbed page, a handwritten note caught her eye: “When the whispers grow loud, seek the Guardians. For only they can guide thee to the light or cast thee into darkness.” The revelation that she wasn’t alone in this—that there were others, Guardians, who could aid her—was both terrifying and exhilarating. Who were these Guardians? How would she find them? Was Alex, the name softly etched beside the note, a clue or merely the scribbles of a previous reader? As Mia pondered the path laid before her, the weight of secrecy pressed upon her chest. She could not share this with her family, her friends; the risk was too great. This journey, whatever it entailed, was hers and hers alone. Closing the book with care, Mia looked up into the shadows of the library, half-expecting a spirit to manifest from the darkness. She felt a strange blend of isolation and clarity. One thing was certain—her life would never be the same. A burgeoning resolve solidified within her: she would unravel the mystery, and in doing so, she would learn to wield the light she harbored inside, to face whatever lay ahead. Tucking the book under her arm, Mia exited the library, the early morning air crisp against her skin. The city of Luminara, now quiet in the dawn’s embrace, held new meaning for her. She was a part of something ancient, something crucial. The time had come to step out of the shadows and into the starlight. Page 5: The Mystery Begins As dawn cloaked Luminara in hues of orange and purple, Mia’s nocturnal encounter at the library felt like a world apart. The weight of the book under her arm was her only assurance that it hadn’t been a dream. She walked the streets absentmindedly, wrapped in thoughts about guardians and her newly bestowed Sight. The first hints of the city awakening rustled around her as she approached her neighborhood café, a place where she often found solace in a corner booth with a view of the bustling street. An order for a steaming cup of hot chocolate – her usual – never reached her lips as a sudden commotion across the room caught her attention. Patrons crowded by the café’s television, which flashed breaking news with bold letters screaming ‘MYSTERY ILLUMINATES LUMINARA’. Mia edged closer, her pulse quickening. The news reported an event that had occurred overnight, the very same hours in which Mia was being awakened to her gifts; a phenomenon that was difficult to describe, let alone explain, had rooted the city center in a trance. Beams of light, uncannily similar to the aura of her starlight visitant, had apparently danced across the skyline, visible from many parts of the city. The event left the people of Luminara bewildered, crafting theories from the scientific to the supernatural. Mia listened, heart skipping beats, as eyewitnesses described seeing ephemeral figures, radiant and sublime, much like the spirit she had met. The city was abuzz with talk of otherworldly interactions, and to Mia’s reserved horror and fascination, she realized she held a piece of this unfolding enigma. The news anchor shifted the discussion to speculations of alien encounters and government cover-ups, but Mia knew differently. She felt somehow responsible, as if her communion with the spirit had triggered this display, this crossing of worlds that was not supposed to be seen. Tucking the book more securely under her arm, Mia left her untouched hot chocolate and exited the café. The air was electric with speculation and wonder, a stark contrast to the secrets she harbored within. She needed to learn more, to understand the connection between her encounter and the city-wide phenomenon. Her next destination was clear; she had to return to the starlit alley where she met the spirit. Perhaps there were residual clues, something left behind that the discerning eye of a Seer could detect. Mia’s arrival was met with police tape and curious onlookers. The alley was now a point of interest, part of the greater anomaly that had captivated Luminara. A firm resolve coursed through her as she pushed past the throng, caution giving way to the urgency of her quest. Drawing on the esoteric words of the book, she reached out with her Sight, seeking traces amidst the mundane world. To her surprise, the alley glowed faintly with ethereal threads, tendrils of starlight visible only to her eyes. They weaved an intricate pattern along the ground and walls, remnants of an energy that lingered like the afterglow of supernovae. Mia knew that understanding these whispers of energy was key to unveiling the true nature of her calling. With every discovery, her place in the sprawling canvas of the cosmos was beginning to mark itself – a beacon of starlight, shrouded in the layers of shadows that her journey was just beginning to pierce. Page 6: New Allies As Mia focused on the luminous threads tracing through the alley, a gentle touch on her shoulder startled her back into the mundane world. She spun around to find herself staring into the deep, knowing eyes of a young man not much older than herself. His presence had been silent, an enigma, reminiscent of the whispering stars. “Can you see it too?” he asked, his voice a low murmur that only Mia could hear over the chatter of the crowd behind the police line. Mia hesitated, her instinct to protect her secret warring with the evident understanding in the stranger’s gaze. The young man offered a small, guarded smile and nodded toward the taped-off alley, a silent ally in her search for answers. “Yes,” Mia finally admitted, feeling a spark of connection. It seemed they shared the gift of seeing the unseen – an ally in this world balancing on the knife-edge between known and unknown. The young man introduced himself as Alex, the name striking a chord within Mia. Alex – the name scrawled in the margin of the mysterious book. Coincidence, or was this part of her destined path? What she did know was that Alex had an air of one who didn’t just believe in the extraordinary but embraced it. “You’re not like them,” Alex said, gesturing subtly to the gathering crowd. “You’re a Seer, aren’t you?” Mia’s eyes widened, not from fear, but from the rush of being truly seen for the first time. Alex’s understanding offered her a sanctuary, the possibility of no longer shouldering her secret alone. They moved away from the scene, seeking the quiet of a nearby park, whose trees whispered softly in the early morning breeze. With the murmurs of the city a distant backdrop, Alex shared his story. Like Mia, the night had called to him, but not with a whisper – his was a shout that beckoned him to witness the extraordinary light show. His search for knowledge led him to the library, to the very book Mia now carried, to find that someone had beaten him to it. Listening to Alex, Mia felt the isolation she had carried for so long begin to crumble. Here was someone who understood the strange and wonderful turn her life had taken. More than that, Alex possessed pieces of the puzzle that connected to her own. He spoke of the Guardians, of the delicate balance between their world and the realm of the starlight spirits. Together, they mulled over the handwritten note and what their rendezvous might mean. As they talked, an unspoken bond formed between them, a fellowship defined by shared purpose and the stirrings of trust. Mia found a comfort in Alex’s presence that she never knew she needed. Here was an ally, perhaps even a friend, who stood with her on the threshold of destiny. The revelation was profound, not just for the sense of partnership it brought, but for the realization that there were more guardians like Alex—a group, a haven, for people like her. The path she had to walk bloomed with the potential of camaraderie, and the loneliness that had dogged her steps dissolved into the warming light of new possibilities. Breathless with the weight of their shared understanding and the unwavering gaze of the open sky above, Mia felt propelled forward by an invisible hand, her journey entwined with Alex’s, and the mystery that beckoned them both deeper into the shadows of starlight. Page 7: Training Begins Mia and Alex left the cover of the trees, feeling a renewed sense of urgency in the light of the morning sun. The earlier confusion that had clouded Mia’s mind gave way to a resolution sharpened by their alliance. They recognized the path that lay ahead would not be easy, but together, they felt empowered to face whatever challenges the starlight spirits would unveil. Alex explained that he belonged to a small group who called themselves the Seekers—a collective of individuals with the Sight. They trained in secret, honing their abilities to communicate and interact with the starlight spirits and understand the deep lore of their connection to the stars. For generations, the Seekers had been the true Guardians, a lineage protecting the balance between the terrestrial and celestial—a balance now seemingly at risk. Intrigue replaced apprehension as Mia listened. She was ready to learn, to transform her incipient skills into tangible strength. The Seekers, Alex assured her, would aid her in harnessing her Sight, not just for her own enlightenment but for the preservation of the light that safeguarded both realms. They formulated a plan. The Seekers met at a covert location just outside the city limits, a place sitting beneath the open gaze of the stars. This would become Mia’s classroom, her temple, where she would learn to interpret the whispers of the cosmos under the tutelage of the Seekers. The journey to the Seekers’ sanctum was a brief one, but with every step, Mia felt as though she were moving further from her old life. Arriving at the hidden retreat—an old observatory nestled among the hills—they were greeted by the sight of ancient stone and groves of trees stretching upward, joining the heavens in stately vigil. The observatory was both majestic and serene, the perfect crossroads of earth-bound curiosity and celestial wonder. Mia marveled at the crumbling columns and the patina of age that adorned the domed structure. The air resounded with a subtle hum that she felt more than heard, a vibration that soothed her restless spirit. Within the weathered walls of the observatory, Mia met the rest of the Seekers. Each one offered a knowing nod or a smile of welcome, their eyes reflecting the same starry sheen that had marked Alex’s. These were individuals of all ages and backgrounds, bound together by their Sight and their solemn oath to use it for the greater good. Under the guidance of the Seekers, Mia underwent her first lesson. It wasn’t training of the body but of the mind and soul. She learned to calm her inner turbulence, to let the whispers of the universe find a home within her. She practiced extending her consciousness toward the starlight, allowing it to fill her senses and guide her intuition. [Image Prompt: Mia and Alex practicing with swirling lights of starlight around them.] As night descended upon the observatory, the Seekers gathered in the open beneath the vast expanse of the cosmos. Mia joined them, her eyes closing as she focused on the energy emanating from her fellow practitioners. Through the gentle encouragement of her new allies, she felt the bond with starlight grow stronger, the light within her answering the call of the ones above. She opened her eyes to a magnificent sight; the darkened sky came alive with mercurial streams of starlight responding to their combined presences. Mia lifted her hands, and to her wonder and thrill, the streams coalesced around her fingertips, dancing to the rhythm of her heartbeat. It was a moment of pure elation, of unity between her spirit and the vast sea of stars watching overhead. In that grand pavilion of night, with the whispering song of the cosmos in her ears, Mia glimpsed her potential for the first time—a potential that ignited like a newborn star within the depths of her being. She was becoming what she was meant to be, part of an ancient legacy that would challenge her to her core. She would learn, she would grow, and she would stand against the shadows threatening to extinguish the light she carried. Page 8: First Clue The observatory provided a sanctuary—not just for practice, but for discussion and theory. Post-training, Mia and the Seekers gathered to dissect what could be gleaned from the unusual occurrences within Luminara. Alex presented a series of weathered tomes and maps with routes and patterns—records of historical sightings of starlight activity, unexplained phenomena with a striking resemblance to recent events. Mia listened attentively to the theories woven together by the collective wisdom of the group. They spoke of ley lines—channels of energy invisible to the average eye, interlacing the earth and converging within Luminara. These lines acted as conduits for the starlight spirits, allowing them to traverse between their celestial realm and the terrestrial world. Could the recent disturbance in the city have been a result of an overlain rift, a chasm formed along these lines? The thought of Luminara perched upon such a volatile foundation sent a tremor of concern through the group. By the soft glow of candlelight, the Seekers pored over the evidence, tracing anomalies and mapping correspondences. They cast a net of intellect and intuition, seeking the thread that would unravel the tapestry of mystery that enveloped them. It was Mia, with fresh eyes and a connection newly kindled, who spotted an irregularity—a point where several ley lines intersected that corresponded geographically with the epicenter of the previous night’s event. The ancient library, the locus of her revelation, sat mere blocks away from this nexus. Alex leaned over her shoulder, his finger tracing the path she outlined, his eyes lighting with recognition. “The heart of the ley lines,” he murmured. “That’s where we need to look.” The discovery bore the weight of a palpable lead. Mia felt a thrill pulse through her—one of impending insight or peril, or perhaps both. The urge to investigate was unanimous among the Seekers, but caution wrapped its tendrils around their resolve. To probe such a site without understanding the scope of its significance was to court danger. Yet the cause of balance dictated their path. Among their resources was a mention of a totem—an artifact of ancient power said to reveal the unseen forces at work along the ley lines. If such a totem could be located, it might provide the lens through which they could peer into the mystery and discern the source of the disruption. In a blend of decision and duty, it was agreed Mia and Alex would return to Luminara to seek out this totem. Their bond, forged in shared experience and deepened by a night of wonder, was becoming the beacon that led the way. Delegation was set; the rest of the Seekers would remain, securing the observatory and delving deeper into their archives for any scrap of lore that might aid the search. As dawn once again teased the edges of night away, Mia and Alex set out back toward the mystery that seemed to center itself over Luminara. With the coming of light, the magnitude of their task loomed large, but in their hearts gleamed the inextinguishable flame of purpose lit by the stars themselves. Page 9: A Close Encounter The crisp air of daybreak did little to still the tempest of anticipation as Mia navigated the streets with Alex by her side, heading for their newfound objective. The city was stirring to life, but their destination held the quiet of a secret yet to be awakened. They aimed to reach the heart of the ley lines, an unassuming spot in the urban sprawl that the Seekers believed was key to the current instability. As they approached the area, a subtle prickling sensation, like the whisper of static, teased Mia’s senses. It was a sign they were drawing near, that the invisible was becoming tangible through her Sight. This place—this vortex of silent power—lay veiled by the normalcy of Luminara’s morning routine. Pedestrians bustled about, immersed in the beginnings of their day, oblivious to the hub of mystical convergence that Mia and Alex were inching toward. The epicenter of the disturbances was an old courtyard, framed by time-worn architecture and crowned with tendrils of ivy that clung to the walls. The morning’s light cast sharp shadows, carving out pockets of darkness where secrets could nestle. Mia’s hand gravitated to the book tucked under her arm, seeking reassurance from its ancient leather. Alex mirrored her action, checking the contents of a satchel slung over his shoulder that housed artifacts and tomes—tools of the Seekers that could help interpret or manipulate the starlight. They walked the perimeter cautiously, their Sight extended. To any passerby, they might seem like art enthusiasts, or history buffs admiring the structure; in truth, they were hunters, senses attuned to the echoes of the mystical that saturated the place. As they neared the center of the courtyard, a palpable shift occurred. The static sensation intensified, raising the fine hairs on their skin. It was as though they had stepped through a veil, the world’s colors deepening, shadows stretching. They were close—to the totem, to unlocking the whispers of the stars. It was then, amid their careful surveillance, that a glint caught Mia’s eye—a fleeting reflection of sunlight on metal, obscured by the foliage of a nearby bush. Alex’s gaze followed hers, and together they uncovered a small, ornate object, partially buried in the earth at the base of the plant. With reverence, Alex knelt and unearthed a medallion pulsing with an ancient allure. It was etched with sigils that danced under Mia’s gaze, whispering in a language that teased the edges of understanding. As light played across the surface of the medallion, a shadow loomed. Mia’s instincts flared, and she pulled Alex away from their discovery. A wind, unearthly and abrupt, cut through the courtyard, followed by the emergence of a figure from the darkened archway opposite them. Draped in a cloak that seemed to devour the day’s brightness, the figure’s eyes locked with theirs—eyes that brimmed with the malevolence of one who would see the balance of the worlds tip into chaos. The Seekers had spoken of shadowed adversaries, and Mia felt a chill that confirmed their warnings had been warranted. With the totem in their possession, Mia and Alex had to act quickly. Their encounter was evidence that they were meddling in affairs that had long remained undisturbed, yet necessary if the peculiar events affecting Luminara were to be understood and contained. This was no longer a mere mission for knowledge; they were being hunted. Flight was imperative. With a shared nod, Mia and Alex turned on their heels, their legs pumping, carrying them through the winding city streets. The chase—a race against shadow and time—had begun. [Image Prompt: Mia hiding from a threatening, shadowy figure with glowing eyes.] With the precious totem clasped between them and the ominous presence trailing in their wake, they fled, uncertain of their pursuer’s abilities or intentions. Only the hope that the starlight within could outshine any impending darkness spurred them on. They were enmeshed in the heart of the mystery, and the web was closing around them, tangling them in a peril more profound than any they had imagined. Page 10: Deepening Mysteries Their breaths tore through the silence as Mia and Alex dashed through the narrow passages that stitched Luminara’s historical quarter together. Street lamps flickered overhead, casting elongated shadows that merged with the light of dawn. Every echo of their footsteps on the cobblestones, every shift of wind, felt like the predatory gaze of the cloaked figure giving pursuit. Eventually, they found solitude in an abandoned subway station, its entrance obscured by overgrowth. Here they hoped the vestiges of modernity would shield them from the ancient forces that sought to reclaim the totem. The chill of the underground engulfed them as they descended the worn steps, their sanctuary a forgotten cavern of echoes and rusting tracks. They collapsed against the cool concrete, the adrenaline of their escape ebbing, leaving them to confront the weight of their recent encounter. The medallion lay between them, a source of trepidation and wonder. Alex cautiously reached for the artifact, his eyes reflecting the depth of questions unspoken. Mia watched him examine the medallion’s intricate engravings—enigmatic runes that belonged neither to the world of Luminara’s neon façade nor the celestial expanse they sought to connect with. The totem was a relic straddling the boundaries of their understanding, challenging the very nature of what they knew—or thought they knew—about their city, about the cosmos. It wasn’t just about ley lines and mystical disturbances anymore. The presence of an adversary brought a new dimension to their search. Who was this figure wielding the same ominous aura as those forces that the Seekers warned could sever the connection between Earth and the firmament? Mia’s thoughts spiraled, considering and discarding theories with restless fervor. Alex’s voice sliced through her contemplation. “This symbol here,” he traced a segment of the pattern with a careful finger, “I’ve seen it before in the Seekers’ archives. It’s a key of some sort, a means to harness or amplify energy flowing through the ley lines.\\" Mia leaned in closer, her study revealing the complexity of the design, the way it seemed to draw them in, an enigma calling to be unlocked. The medallion felt like a tangible manifestation of their journey—a nexus of past lore, present dilemma, and future trials. But the medallion provided more than just insight—it illuminated their next course of action. The clue led them to understand that the totem was part of a greater mechanism, one that governed the flow of the enigmatic energies beneath Luminara. [Image Prompt: A mysterious, shadowy figure lurking near a scene of magical disturbance in the city.] Alex looked at Mia, an idea dawning in his gaze. “If we can find out how this totem interacts with the ley lines, we might be able to prevent…” His voice trailed off as a new sound infiltrated the silence: The soft tread of stealthy footsteps approaching from the dark tunnels. Instinct prompted them to extinguish their flashlight, plunging the platform into near-total darkness. They huddled together, the totem concealed within Alex’s satchel, the only beacon being the faint glow emanating from its engravings, muted against the fabric. Their unknown pursuer moved closer, a disembodied shadow hunting them within the abyss of Luminara’s underworld. Mia felt the faint starlight within her, urging toward a solution that remained frustratingly out of reach. The mystery that they had thought to grasp was unravelling its threads faster than they could weave understanding. Fear and resolve twined within Mia’s heart. Not fear of the end, but fear of not accomplishing what she felt was her destiny, so recently illuminated by the stars. Each revelation brought with it deeper enigmas—revealing new layers of an ongoing stratagem larger and more intricate than any of them realized. With bated breath, they waited in the dark, the only certainty being that this clandestine game of cat and mouse through the tapestry of Luminara’s ancient secrets and starlit whispers was far from over. Page 11: Growing Tensions Pressed in the darkness, a gulp of stale underground air filled Mia’s lungs as she strained her ears for any hint of their stalker’s position. The cloaked figure’s footsteps seemed to fade, then stop. Alex’s hand found Mia’s in the dark – a silent vow of protection and unity between them. They were two fledglings against an unseen predator, events escalating beyond the scope of their initial quest. “Do you think they’re gone?” Mia’s whispered question was laced with the tension that buzzed through the void like electricity. “Let’s not wait to find out,” Alex replied, just as hushed, guiding Mia gently by the hand as they edged their way along the abandoned platform. He knew the station’s layout from past explorations with the Seekers – if they could navigate to the maintenance corridors, there would be other ways out. As they wove through shadows, the city above them was waking to its own unrest. News of last night’s luminescent spectacle spread through Luminara with the speed of wildfire, igniting a mixture of awe and apprehension in the populace. People gathered in the courtyards, cafes, and workplaces, exchanging hushed stories and wild speculations. The air was charged with the undercurrent of change, of a reality tilting on an unseen axis, and the seeds of fear and fascination took root in equal measure. Meanwhile, government officials and local law enforcement, ill-equipped to handle the murmurs of magic and myth, found themselves grappling with explanations to quell the rumors. Sirens rang in the distance, a dissonant symphony to the rush of daily life, while scientists and skeptics took to the airwaves attempting to rationalize the unexplainable. An undercurrent of unease spread, a sense that the city, always a tapestry of light and dark, had a shadow encroaching upon its edges, reaching from the depths of forgotten tales. Amidst this growing apprehension, a silent consensus fell upon the Seekers’ gathering – that what had begun as a search for understanding had escalated into a responsibility—responsibility to protect the unknowing citizens of Luminara from what lay hidden beneath the streets, and perhaps, from what existed above the stars. Mia’s thoughts were a whirlwind of concern for her family, her friends, the entire city. What would become of Luminara if the balance was not restored? And what part did the totem, now secure in Alex’s satchel, play in the grand design that hovered over them all like a predestined storm? Each step they took was a move in a grand strategy, with the city itself as the gameboard and its people the pieces. Mia felt her role shifting, the innocence of curiosity being honed into the steel of duty. They were participants in an ancient drama, with its roots in the stars but its repercussions mortally and incontrovertibly earthbound. The Seers had to unravel the thread of events before fear and darkness claimed dominion over Luminara’s starlit spirit. And with every secret unlocked from the veil of starlight and shadow, Mia felt herself growing into the guardian she was meant to be – a beacon of hope when the dark whispers threatened to overwhelm the light. [Image Prompt: The city of Luminara with a strange, mystical aurora in the sky, causing public alarm.] Emerging from the bowels of the station into the unseen corridors of the city, Mia and Alex took a moment to regroup, to plan their next step. Above them, the city of Luminara held its breath, watching the horizon for signs, for whispers on the wind, but below, in the heart of the underbelly, Mia and Alex took their first cautious steps toward the gathering storm. Page 12: Unseen Dangers Mia and Alex emerged from the underground labyrinth, their ascent into daylight tinged with the surreal understanding that the city they knew had been forever altered. They found themselves in an overlooked part of Luminara, where the buildings wore the patina of age and the graffiti told stories of dissent. It was here in the quieter, shaded streets that they paused to catch their breath and consider their next move. The sense of urgency that had propelled them from the depths of the subway station now gave way to the sobering realization of the danger they were in. This was no longer just about unexplained lights in the sky; they were being pursued by a tangible and malevolent force that could reach out to them at any turn. As they leaned against the cool brick of an abandoned warehouse, Alex pulled out the totem once more. The morning sun filtered through the grime of a nearby window, illuminating the etchings that seemed to pulse with an energy that defied the simplicity of its metallic surface. “There’s more at stake than we realized,” Mia began, her eyes tracing the shape of the totem in Alex’s hands. “This isn’t just about us, or the Seekers, or even just Luminara. If someone is after this,” she gestured to the medallion, “then it must have power we haven’t even begun to comprehend.” Alex nodded slowly. “The shadows are moving against us. We knew the path of a Seer could be fraught with risk. But this…” his voice trailed off, and when he looked up at Mia, his eyes bore the gravity of their situation. “This might be bigger than any danger the Seekers have faced before.” Determined to unearth more clues, they examined the totem once again. Mia’s fingers hovered over the symbols, and as they did, a chill swept through her. She could almost hear the echoes of starlight, like a distant chime, each time she passed over the engravings. It was as if the totem itself was an astral compass, pointing toward a truth not yet revealed. The question that loomed large in their minds was who their adversary was, this cloaked figure with eyes that glinted with malice and knowledge. Was it a rival seeker of lore, a wayward guardian, or something far more sinister tied to the starlight spirits themselves? They had to tread carefully. Each fact they gleaned was a beacon in the murk, but every light they shone could mark them in the darkness that hunted for the very power they wished to protect. As they stood in contemplation, a commotion nearby startled them from their deliberations. Police sirens wailed, and the sounds of chaos crept toward their hideaway. Mia peered around the corner to see a throng of law enforcement hastening toward the city center. Something was happening – another disturbance, another clue, perhaps. Compelled to unravel the widening mystery, they made a decision. They would mingle with the crowds, blend in with the concerned citizens, and perhaps in doing so, find the thread that would lead them to the next piece of the puzzle. It was a risk, exposing themselves to the gaze of the city and the cloaked figure that might be lurking there. But hiding in the shadows would bring them no closer to stopping the threat that whispered of an unseen danger. Taking a deep breath, steeling themselves with the resolve of their newfound calling, Mia and Alex stepped out from their sanctuary and into the public eye once more. They shared a silent pact, an acceptance of the path they walked—one of illuminated discoveries and silent perils lurking behind the veil of Luminara’s façade. The destiny that tied them to the stars and the secrets of the earth called them forth, and they answered, stepping boldly toward the unfolding drama that waited in the heart of their city. Page 13: A Moment of Solace The unease gripping Luminara was palpable, a city on the brink of the inexplicable, steadied only by the routine of daily life that marched on in the face of uncertainty. Police cordoned off areas of unusual activity, their faces etched with the same bewilderment mirrored in the crowd. Mia and Alex, though part of this throng, were set apart by the secret weight they carried—the totem’s presence pressing into Alex’s satchel like a beacon of unknown potential. After navigating through a congestion of onlookers, they ducked into an alleyway, a temporary reprieve from the pressing anxiety of the streets. The alley opened up into a secluded rooftop garden, a hidden gem amidst the urban expanse. Here, verdant life thrived quietly above the clamor, a peaceful contrast to the electrical tension that wound through the city below. Mia exhaled a sigh she didn’t realize she had been holding. Her entire life had been turned inside out in the span of a few days, and yet, amongst this pocket of serenity, she felt a connection to normalcy—a fleeting taste of the life she used to know. “Take a moment, Mia,” Alex encouraged, his voice a gentle nudge back to the present. “We’ve been through a lot. A break might give us some clarity.” She nodded, and together they sank onto the neatly trimmed grass, the rooftop garden enveloping them in a comforting embrace. Silence settled between them, not awkward but companionable, a shared acknowledgement of the wonder and fear that had become their constant shadows. Looking out over the skyline, the duo watched as Luminara stretched beneath the soft glow of sunset, its colors painting the clouds in strokes of gold and rose. For the briefest of heartbeats, Mia allowed herself the luxury of peace, the beauty of the moment tempering the storm of her thoughts. She glanced at Alex, taking in his angular profile against the dimming light. Unspoken camaraderie had woven itself into the fabric of their encounter—a bond formed not over years but through shared destiny. She observed the way his eyes, usually so sharp with resolve, softened at the sight of a pair of butterflies dancing above a bed of flowers. “This is beautiful,” Mia whispered, her attention captured by the delicate creatures. “Amidst all the chaos, life finds a way to remind us that there’s more to the world than our fears.” Alex turned his attention from the butterflies to Mia, a smile breaking through his solemnity. “It’s easy to forget, isn’t it?” he mused. “We get so caught up in the darkness that we risk losing sight of the light.” Mia felt the echo of truth in his words resonate within her. Their mission—to safeguard Luminara from the shadows at its edges—held more than just the duty of protection. It was a call to preserve the everyday magic that connected all facets of life, the joy found in the simple beauty of a peaceful garden against the backdrop of a city holding its breath. [Image Prompt: Mia and Alex on a rooftop, overlooking the city, with starlight spirits floating around, creating a romantic ambiance.] The flutter of wings brought her gaze back to the butterflies, their flight a dainty waltz in the lingering rays of the sun. Beneath them, the lights of Luminara began to flicker on, stars of another kind, defiant against the impending night. As dusk fell, lending privacy to their rooftop sanctuary, Mia and Alex shared stories of their lives beyond the realm of the Seekers. With each word, they wove threads of understanding, constructing a bridge over the isolation that had once defined their existence. The peace of the garden offered a stark counterpoint to the chaos of their quest—a contrast that lent strength to their resolve. For in this moment of solace, away from the hidden dangers and enigmatic challenges, they rediscovered the humanity that fueled their battle against the encroaching dark. A flickering light of hope, of connection, that would not be easily extinguished by the shadows seeking to envelope Luminara and its unsuspecting denizens. Page 14: A Discovery As darkness draped over the city, the rooftop garden had become a well of stillness amidst the swelling currents of Luminara’s unrest. Mia and Alex, reinvigorated by the shared moment of respite, prepared to descend from their ephemeral haven back into the depths of their uncertain journey. However, the night had yet to reveal its hand, and it was upon their departure that chance turned their tide. Mia, intending to take a final glance at the city from this rare vantage point, caught sight of a peculiar shimmer in the nocturnal canvas below. It was a faint, otherworldly gleam that resonated with an inexplicable familiarity, an echo of the energies they had sensed earlier. “Alex, look,” she whispered, pointing towards the illumination that flickered like a star fallen in the urban maze. With the totem secure, they cautiously traced their way down the building, curiosity fuelling their steps, the lure of discovery propelling them forward. As they approached the source, it became apparent that the light emanated from the entrance of a narrow side alley. In stark contrast to the dank surroundings, the radiance appeared ethereal, untouched by the city’s grime. It was not mere reflection or trick of the light; this glow held the essence of the starlight spirits themselves. The alley was vacant, save for the celestial glow that seemed to beckon. With every fiber of her being tingling with a mix of apprehension and anticipation, Mia felt the Sight within her stir, a recognition of affinity to the astral phenomenon before them. The whispers of the universe were not just calling; they were guiding. The light seemed to pulse in response to their presence, its motion growing more pronounced as Mia extended a tentative hand, her fingers grazing the otherworldly orb. A resonance spread through her—a vibration that matched the cadence of her heart and the throbbing hum of the city. It was more than mere energy; it was communication, an articulation in the celestial language she was only beginning to comprehend. “A message,” Alex breathed, his tone a mix of awe and urgency. “It must be from the starlight spirits. Could they be trying to guide us?” Mia nodded, though her expression remained concentrated, her mind unweaving the complex strands of luminescent speech. Words of light, of energy, translated into understanding, a current of thought flowing into her consciousness. The starlight spirits conveyed a sense of urgency, a plea for the guardianship that she and Alex had unknowingly vowed to undertake. There was an artifact—distinct from the totem, yet inexplicably linked—a key that harbored the power to mend the fraying seam between worlds. The location, obscured by shadow and the passage of time, would soon be revealed, an answer hidden in history and the fabric of the city itself. “The convergence is near,” the light whispered—an utterance only felt, not heard. “The paths will cross at the junction of time and trial. Be ready, guardians of the bridge.” As the message dissolved into the night, the duo stood in stunned silence, processing the gravity of their encounter. The path they embarked upon was charting deeper into the unknown, their roles as Seers expanding into agents of a cosmic orchestration that spanned beyond the reaches of Earthly perception. With the discovery pulsing in their hearts like a newly kindled star, Mia and Alex stepped back into the shadowed streets, the murmurs of the spirits a guiding refrain. The city sprawled around them, a trove of secrets waiting to be unearthed by steadfast hands and watchful eyes that held the glimmer of the stars. Page 15: A Confrontation The cryptic guidance of the starlight spirits left Mia and Alex grappling with more questions than answers. What was the key they spoke of, and how would it manifest in the tangible world? With only the veiled whispers of the cosmos to guide them, they needed more—a stroke of terrestrial insight to pair with the ethereal message. Mia’s thoughts raced back to the library, to the tomes and their secrets. The public facade housed more than just ink and paper; it protected whispers of the ancient, of knowledge passed through generations. If there was anything that could shed light on this new aspect of their quest, it would be there among the silent rows of books and the hallowed echoes of the past. As they navigated the serpentine pathways back to the central district, a sharp-edged disquiet sliced into their conversation. The foreboding feeling of being watched had returned, the sensation of another presence lurking in their shadow. The confrontation they had managed to sidestep earlier that day was not an isolated threat—it was a persisting danger. With their instincts on high alert, they moved with purpose, seeking the solace of the library’s fortified walls. Upon arrival, they found the building locked, the late hour denying them entry. Their frustration was palpable, the denial of access an unexpected impediment. That’s when they heard it—the unmistakable sound of shuffling feet from within. Intrigue mixed with caution, Mia approached one of the tall windows, peering through its dusty pane. The faint light of an inner lamp revealed a figure moving through the shadows, their behavior furtive, indicative of a search similar to their own. It was clear they were not a staff member or a casual reader, but rather someone with intent and knowledge of what lay concealed within the public space. The nocturnal intruder paused beneath the dim glow, and an object in their hands caught the light—a book, old and leather-bound, unmistakably one of the same that Mia and Alex had poured over with the Seekers, its worn edges a testament to its critical role. Without hesitation, Mia attempted the door, finding it surprisingly unlocked. They stepped inside, their entrance muffled by the expanse of the grand reading room. The rows of shelves loomed like silent sentinels, and up ahead, the interloper, still unbeknownst to their presence, continued their clandestine rummaging. Mia glanced at Alex, her resolve steeling. This had to be more than mere coincidence—the intruder was looking for answers to questions only they understood. It was time for answers, and the direct approach was all they had left. Stepping into the aisle, Mia cleared her throat. The figure jolted, the book clutched tight against their chest. “Looking for something in particular?” Mia’s voice was calm, but the energy of the room shifted palpably, the undercurrent of danger swirling among the weighted silence of the tomes. The silhouette turned, and a face emerged from the shadows, one both familiar and unexpected—a young woman, her eyes wide with alarm, but not, Mia noted, with guilt. The intruder spoke, her voice a blend of defiance and curiosity. “I could ask you the same thing.” The standoff was brief, the realization shared between them like a spark passing through open space. This woman was not their cloaked adversary from the alley, but another player in the intricate dance between the terrestrial and the celestial. There was a connection, one that was yet to fully surface, but clear as the tension that hung in the air between them. Confrontation gave way to dialogue, and they began to weave a thread of communication, their tales unfolding, their search for the key and the truth behind the disturbances drawing them together. [Image Prompt: An intense confrontation in an old library, with books and mystical artifacts around.] It was becoming clear that this journey was not theirs to walk alone. The tapestry they had been tracing—the patterns of starlight and shadow—was expansive, reaching into lives beyond their own. It was within the hallowed halls of knowledge, amid the confrontations with the unknown, that their path was crossing with others drawn by the same source of wonder and dread. Page 16: The Plot Thickens The revelation that this young woman was neither foe nor ignorant bystander added a new dimension to the evening’s tension. In the musty air of the library, surrounded by ancient texts and the lingering whispers of a thousand stories, Mia, Alex, and the stranger regarded each other in an uncertain truce. “So, you know about the starlight spirits, the disturbances, the ley lines?” Mia inquired, her gaze penetrating as she watched the newcomer carefully. Alex stood close, his presence protective yet curious. “The lights, the energy, I’ve felt them,” the stranger answered, her guarded poise softening as she sensed a shared purpose among them. “My name is Isla. I work at the university—the Astronomy Department. We’ve been detecting anomalies—patterns that don’t fit traditional cosmic behavior.” Isla’s confession set the stage for revelations, the threads of isolated inquiries becoming part of a larger fabric. She spoke of theoretical rifts in the fabric of space-time, empirical evidence of a celestial nature that couldn’t be explained through known scientific phenomena. Her research had led her here, to the library, in search of esoteric correlations that might frame her findings in a broader context. As the trio exchanged knowledge, the convergence of their paths steered them toward a frightening conceptual horizon. If Isla’s academic evidence was prophesying the same upheaval that the Seekers and their celestial counterparts were warning about, then Luminara, and possibly the world beyond, stood on the precipice of something monumental. Mia, bolstered by the new alliance, suggested, “We believe there is an artifact, a key of sorts, connected to the ley lines and the spirits. It might be the answer to containing, or at least understanding, the anomalies.” Isla’s eyes narrowed, her analytical mind picking apart the implications of Mia’s statement. “An artifact? There might be some mention of it in the legends… the ones dismissed by modern science.” She motioned toward a section of the library designated for texts of mythology and folklore. Together, they redirected their search. The dusty shelves harbored more than fables; they held forgotten wisdom that slipped through the cracks of mainstream knowledge. The trio scoured the collection with newfound fervor, pouring over pages that whispered of hidden truths medicine men and sages had gleaned under the stars centuries prior. It was a race against time, a race against the encroaching darkness, as they sought to connect the celestial dots that seemed to spell an impending cosmic conundrum. The plot did indeed thicken as they worked, the library’s labyrinth of written heritage unspooling before them. And then, nestled within the yellowed pages of an aged ledger written by an explorer long departed, they found it—a reference to the “Heart of Luminara,” an artifact shaped by the heavens’ own touch. “According to this, the Heart was sent to Earth long ago, held by those chosen by the stars, to serve as a bridge for communication and passage,” Isla read aloud, a tinge of wonder coloring her rational tone. With this discovery, their search gained direction. The Heart of Luminara was more than a key—it was a beacon of ancient magicks and celestial mechanics, a link between worlds that yearned for balance. With the ledger as their guide, they determined to seek the artifact’s last known location. Ceaseless threats lurked in the shadows behind every thought, every glance from the library’s enveloping dark. Yet, the newfound companions drew strength from their shared cause and the knowledge that the answers they sought were aligning, piece by intricate piece. They exited the library, the artifact’s call a hushed serenade that seemed to echo down from the very stars they gazed upon. The journey ahead was draped in enigma, but they were no longer travelers navigating in isolation; they were a constellation of seekers drawn together by the plot that enshrouded their city and their fate. Page 17: Unexpected Ally The stars bore silent witness as Mia, Alex, and their new companion, Isla, stepped into the cool embrace of the night. The ledger under Isla’s arm was more than a compilation of forgotten chronicles; it was the map that might lead them to the Heart of Luminara and hold the answers they so desperately sought. Their departure from the library was halted by a muttered word from Mia. She halted, straining her eyes against the darkness of an adjoining street. A figure stepped from the shadows, unhurried, almost leisurely, and for a moment, time seemed to constrict around them. The figure was cloaked, much like the menacing pursuer they had previously evaded, yet there was a distinction—an aura not of threat, but of withheld promise. The figure’s approach elicited a range of reactions. Alex moved subtly, placing himself between the stranger and the two women, while Isla’s hand tightened around her leather-bound trove, her stance defensive. Mia herself felt an odd sense of anticipation as the figure drew closer, a flicker of recognition sparking within her. Once within the lamplight’s reach, the cloak’s hood was pulled back to reveal an elderly man with a countenance that spoke of wisdom and trials weathered. His eyes held the endless knowledge of the stars—a gaze born of years scrutinizing the heavens, reading its secrets. “I am known as Marlo,” he said, his voice a low timbre that commanded attention despite its softness. “I have been watching your progress, Mia and Alex. And you must be Isla, the one whose search for celestial truths has led you from the academic towers to the grounds of myth.” Isla’s surprise turned to inquisitiveness as she met Marlo’s gaze. “You know of me?” she asked, her voice a blend of skepticism and intrigue. Marlo nodded, his lips curving into a wise smile. “I know many things. I, too, have felt the fractures in our reality, the disturbances you seek to mend. I am a keeper of scribed celestial lore, a descendant of those who penned some of the very volumes you hold.” Isla’s grip on the ledger eased as realization dawned. Marlo was not a new adversary, but another piece of the ever-expanding puzzle—a provider of knowledge they lacked, a guardian of forgotten truths. Marlo shared with them the lineage of the book Isla carried, how generations of star-gazers had kept the tale of the Heart of Luminara alive through their records, this ledger being the culmination of their labors. “It is more than an artifact,” he explained; “it’s part of a cosmic mechanism, an interface between the earth and the stars.” The Heart, it seemed, was a celestially infused object that could actuate the ley lines in favor of balance, or dismay, depending on who wielded it. Theirs was a quest not only to find it but to ensure it did not fall into the wrong hands. [Image Prompt: A mysterious character, cloaked and enigmatic, reaching out to Mia in a dimly lit room.] Marlo’s revelations brought gravity to their quest, his assurances a balm to the turbulence of their doubts. With the ledger as their guide and Marlo’s guidance, they sought to uncover the Heart, a journey now shadowed by the fearsome knowledge that others, too, coveted its power for darker designs. Resolved to see their search to the end, Mia, Alex, Isla, and now Marlo, ventured into the belly of the city, where echoes of magick lay in wait and where their fates would intertwine with the celestial emissary known as the Heart of Luminara. Page 18: A New Lead Armed with ancient knowledge and the added wisdom of their enigmatic guide, Marlo, Mia, Alex, and Isla wove through the sleeping city with resolute purpose. They moved as shadows themselves, aware that a wisp of starlight or the slightest tremor in the ley lines could betray their presence to those who pursued the same powerful relic. Marlo, who had walked the edge between the visible and the veiled for more years than the others could fathom, directed their steps toward the remnants of an old district. Here, the architecture whispered stories of times when belief in the intertwining of worlds was common, where star-gazers were once revered. “This way,” said Marlo, his voice barely louder than a breath as he led them down an almost forgotten street. The cobblestones were worn smooth by the passage of countless feet and countless years. Vines clung to the sides of stoic buildings, the city’s age and mystery hanging heavy in the air. At Marlo’s behest, Isla unfolded the ledger, its pages luminescent under the wary gaze of the moon. She traced over the ancient text with fingers that trembled not from cold but from anticipation. “Here,” she whispered, pointing to a passage that described a courtyard with a fountain, its centerpiece marked with celestial sigils visible only to those who looked beyond the earthly façade. Mia’s Sight flared within her, her connection to the cosmos urging her gaze to pierce the mundane shroud of the world. An ordinary fountain, worn by years and ignored by passersby, captured her focus; she could see past the layers of grime and disrepair to witness an intricate pattern of stars and planetary orbits etched into its surface. They gathered around the relic of a bygone era, the fountain’s dry basin a seeming receptacle of secrets and power. Marlo nodded approvingly, his expression a blend of sorrow and hope. “The Heart of Luminara must be close,” he assured them. His declaration was more than conjecture; it was a feeling, an ancient tug at his soul that whispered of proximity to the artifact they sought. The scene became a capsule of concentration as Mia, Alex, and Isla leaned closer, the ledger now a tangible guide as they cross-referenced Marlo’s intuitions with the document’s penned renderings. Each symbol, each line, each dormant trickle of long-ago water within the fountain’s basin held the potential to open pathways long sealed. Moments spilled like sand through the hourglass as they sifted through the clues buried within both fountain and text. And then, as if by fate’s own design, Isla’s hand hovered over a mosaic tile within the ornate depiction of Ursa Major, the Great Bear constellation—an emblem which aligned with a sketch in the yellowed pages of her tome. “Under the Great Bear,” read Isla, her voice betraying her burgeoning excitement. “The Heart resides where the heavens are reflected upon the Earth.” Their search narrowed to the space under the constellation, their movements delicate as they prodded the fountain’s designs for a sign, a trigger, a revelation. It was Alex who discovered the anomaly—a tile within the bear’s outline that depressed slightly under pressure. The fountain’s base emitted a low grinding sound, stone against stone, as hidden mechanisms—untouched for aeons—began to stir. The Seekers looked on with bated breath as the base stones parted, revealing a concealed cavity beneath. The revelation was an affirmation of prophecy and legend, forged by celestial intent—but was the sought-after Heart within? Page 19: A Dangerous Encounter The stone outline of Ursa Major had given way to reveal its secret, an opening within the heart of the fountain where the Earth seemed to touch the stars. The air around the seekers buzzed with the hum of raw energy, a vibration felt more than heard, as if the revealing of the hidden chamber echoed within the very fabric of the cosmos. Marlo was the first to react, his hand outstretched to halt the eager advance of his companions. “Caution,” he whispered, his gaze intense. “The Heart, if it is indeed within, will be guarded. Its wards have held for centuries.” They peered into the darkness below. The cavity was not simply an empty recess but an entrance to something deeper, a corridor that vanished into the earth. Cold air wafted from the gaping maw, along with the faint, indistinct scent of minerals and old magic. Mia hesitated at the threshold, the Sight within her flickering like a flame in a draft. What lay beyond was a path woven with peril and promise, leading to a relic that bore the weight of worlds upon its form. The decision to descend was silent, unanimous; their journey thus far had been a gathering of momentum that could not now be stilled. With Marlo leading, the seekers descended one by one into the gloom. The stairwell spiraled downwards, ancient stones worn smooth by the footsteps of those few who had once walked this hallowed route. As they wound deeper beneath the city, the cries of the surface faded into a memory, and the silence grew profound, save for the steady whisper of their breaths and the soft echo of their descent. And then, the passageway leveled, opening into an expansive chamber. The walls thrummed with the same starry energy that Mia had come to recognize—a tapestry of pulsating light that painted an otherworldly glow upon the seekers’ awestruck faces. The reverence of the chamber, however, was shattered by a sudden movement. From the shadows cast by the starlight emerged figures, robed and silent, guardians of the sacred place that had for so long been undisturbed. Mia’s Sight flared—warnings sparking within her mind. These were no mortal custodians, but manifestations of the ley lines themselves, conjured protectors bound to the Heart of Luminara. The intensity of the chamber’s light grew, and the figures advanced, their forms blurring between solidity and luminescence. [Image Prompt: Mia and Alex in a hidden underground chamber, facing a sinister, magical phenomenon.] Alex stepped forward, drawing a small device from the depths of his satchel—it was the totem they had recovered, its purpose now startlingly clear. He held it aloft; the sigils upon its surface ignited with brilliance, casting a beam that seemed to answer the aggression of the guardians with an assertion of kinship. For a tense moment, there was an oscillation in the chamber, a flicker between conflict and recognition. And then, as if accepting the totem’s call, the guardians stilled, their forms softening, allowing the seekers to pass unharmed. An unspoken agreement had been forged in light and understanding, a treaty that granted Mia, Alex, Isla, and Marlo the right to approach the Heart. A pedestal stood in the chamber’s center, cradling the Heart of Luminara—a crystal pulsing with an inner galaxy of stars, nebulae, and constellations. It was a microcosm of the universe, a beacon of ancient power that resonated with the beat of all creation. As the seekers reached out to this celestial relic, they understood that it was more than an artifact; it was a living connection to the stars themselves—a nexus of past and future where the fate of their world hung in the balance. Page 20: Cliffhanger Ending Bathed in the Heart of Luminara’s incandescent glow, Mia, Alex, Isla, and Marlo stood before the pedestal. The chamber around them held its breath, the light from the crystal casting prismatic dances upon the walls. This was the moment of convergence, the Seekers and scholars meeting destiny hand in hand. Marlo, with a reverence reserved for the most sacred of rituals, stepped forward. His seasoned hands hovered above the Heart, wary of contact. “It must be understood before it can be wielded,” he murmured, echoing the words that had been passed down through his lineage. Mia’s Sight, fully attuned to the Heart’s celestial song, recoiled at the touch of darkness she felt creeping through the chamber’s threshold. She searched the shadows, sensing a presence—a void where the starlight wept. “Something’s wrong,” she said, her voice a whisper that carried the weight of her dread. No sooner had the warning left her lips than the chamber shook—a silent quake that trembled through stone and soul alike. The guardians around them flickered wildly, their forms destabilizing, reacting to an intrusion that threatened to unravel the woven peace. From the darkness emerged their cloaked pursuer, the figure that had lurked within their periphery since the start of their voyage. But they were not alone. Flanking the cloaked figure were others, equally obscured by shadow, their intentions clear as they eyed the Heart with malignant desire. “The barriers weaken,” the cloaked figure spoke, his voice a sibilant sound that slithered through the chamber, “and we will not be denied our prize.” Mia felt anger surge within her, a fierce protectiveness over the Heart that had become part of a greater purpose she now carried. “We can’t let them take it,” she said, stepping between the intruders and the pedestal. Alex and Isla moved to join her, a unified front against the impending threat. A high-pitched tone, like the ringing of glass, resonated from the Heart, an urgent timbre that seemed to be both a summons and a warning. The air thickened with potential, with the palpable power of starlight that needed to be channeled, guarded. Marlo’s eyes were laden with sorrow, with the burden of generations. “There are forces here that not even the Heart can easily quell,” he said, his voice steady despite the chaos. “We must make a choice, and we must make it swiftly.” In the climactic tension, the crystal pulsed—a beacon calling its guardians to action. The Seekers prepared to defend it, to keep its power from hands that would misuse its connection to the fabric of existence. [Image Prompt: Mia facing an unexpected revelation or danger.] As the confrontation neared its breaking point, a tremor of realization coursed through Mia. The ledger she had brushed off the pedestal in her urgency reflected a cascade of light from the Heart, a shattered reflection that bordered on revelation. She glanced at Isla, and in their shared gaze was an unspoken agreement: The chamber held more secrets, and within the cryptic intersection of starlight, shadow, and scholarly intuition lay the answer they needed. With the chamber echoing the song of colliding worlds and the imminent threat of the shadowed intruders, the Heart of Luminara beckoned the seekers to stand firm, to protect the cosmic balance. As the Heart’s glow intensified, a final, shattering truth came to light—a twist in their tale that none of the seekers had foreseen, a revelation that could change everything…","completion":"Regrettably, without the storyline from the first book and the continuation into the second book as detailed above, I cannot proceed to create new content or provide specific storyline twists and turns.

Above her, the night sky was a canvas of twinkling stars, each one a distant world, a story untold. Mia, with her raven hair and curious eyes, had always felt a peculiar connection to these celestial bodies, a sense of belonging that eluded her in the day-to-day mundanity of her life. As she walked, the city's vibrant energy pulsed around her, a symphony of car horns, distant music, and the murmur of nightlife. Yet, amidst this cacophony, Mia's ears caught an anomaly – a whisper, soft and melodic, as if the stars themselves were speaking to her. She paused, her heart quickening. This wasn't the first time she had heard these whispers, but tonight they felt more insistent, more real. She looked around, searching for the source, but the busy street offered no answers, only the occasional curious glance from a passerby. Mia knew they wouldn't understand; after all, how could she explain that she heard voices from the stars? Turning her gaze skyward, Mia felt an indescribable pull, a calling that resonated deep within her soul. The stars, with their ancient light, seemed to beckon her, to guide her towards a destiny yet unseen. As the whisper grew louder, Mia felt both trepidation and an unyielding curiosity. What did the stars want from her? Why was she the only one who could hear their ethereal song? It was a mystery that Mia knew she had to unravel, a journey that would lead her into the hidden depths of Luminara and beyond. And so, under the watchful gaze of the starlit sky, Mia made a decision that would change her life forever. She would follow the whispers, follow the path laid out by the stars, and uncover the truth behind her strange connection to the cosmos. [Image Prompt: A college girl walking under the neon lights of a bustling city street at night, looking up at the stars.] Page 2: Mia's World Mia's life in Luminara had always been ordinary, or as ordinary as it could be in a city where the veil between the natural and the supernatural was as thin as spider silk. She lived in a modest apartment with her parents, who were loving but perpetually caught up in the daily grind of work and household responsibilities. Her father was a mechanic, a man of the earth and grease, who found solace in the tangible, the fixable. Her mother worked at a local bakery, her world one of flour and sugar, of early mornings and the warm aroma of freshly baked bread. At school, Mia was a shadow, drifting through the corridors with her head in the clouds, or more accurately, in the stars. Her classmates, absorbed in their own teenage dramas and aspirations, paid her little mind. Mia didn't mind the solitude; it gave her space to think, to dream. She was an average student, her grades a mix of Bs and Cs, her reports always the same: \\"Mia is a bright girl, but she needs to focus more on the present.\\" But how could she focus on algebra and history essays when her mind was filled with constellations and the mysteries of the universe? Mia's bedroom was a sanctuary, its walls adorned with posters of galaxies, nebulae, and star charts. It was here, in the quiet hours of the night, that Mia felt most at peace, her gaze fixed on the night sky through her small window, her mind wandering among the stars. Her fascination with astronomy had started when she was a little girl, her grandmother's stories of celestial beings and cosmic legends fueling her imagination. Mia's grandmother had been the only one who understood her, the only one who didn't dismiss her starry-eyed wonder as mere childish fancy. But she had passed away when Mia was ten, leaving her with a sense of loss that still lingered in the depths of her heart. Despite her love for the stars, Mia had always felt disconnected, a sense of yearning for something more, something profound. She longed to unravel the secrets of the universe, to understand her place in the grand scheme of things. Little did she know, her life was about to take a turn into the extraordinary, a journey that would bridge the gap between the earth and the stars, and reveal her true destiny. Page 3: The First Encounter Under the cloak of night, Mia’s newfound resolve led her away from the well-trodden paths of Luminara. She traversed the labyrinth of alleyways and side streets, chasing the whispers that beckoned her forward. The further she wandered, the more the familiar sights of her city transformed into a world both strange and beautiful, effused with an unfamiliar aura. The neon signs faded into shadowy corners, and the thrumming life of the city seemed to dim, as if yielding to a different kind of energy. It was here, in a narrow, forgotten alley bathed in the silver glow of moonlight, that Mia’s reality shifted irrevocably. Without warning, a gentle breeze tousled her hair, and she felt a presence – an otherworldly visitor cloaked in the radiance of the stars. Before her stood a spirit of light, its form shifting and undulating like the aurora borealis. Mia’s breath hitched in her throat, wonderstruck by the sight. For a long moment, they simply regarded each other – two beings from different worlds, yet inexplicably connected. The spirit’s form coalesced into something vaguely human, a figure both awe-inspiring and comforting. “You are not alone, Mia,” it spoke, its voice a celestial melody that soothed her fears. Its words seemed to bypass her ears, resonating directly within her soul. “You have been chosen, gifted with the Sight. The ability to see us, the starlight spirits, is one that has been silently woven into the threads of your being since birth.” Mia was speechless, her mind racing with questions and the unfathomable reality that she was conversing with a being of pure starlight. The spirit seemed to anticipate her trepidation, its luminescence ebbing and flowing like the tides pulled by the moon. “Fear not, for this is just the beginning of your journey,” it continued. “The connection you feel to the stars is a reflection of the light you carry within. You must learn to understand and harness this gift, for the balance between our worlds depends upon it.” “But why me?” Mia finally found her voice, her words barely above a whisper. “Because, Mia, you are born of the stars, as all are, but in you burns the essence of the ancients. You can bridge the divide, illuminate the shadows that threaten to engulf your world, and ours.” Before Mia could respond, the sound of footsteps approaching the alleyway broke the sanctity of the moment. The spirit’s form began to dissipate, urging her to flee, to protect the secret of its existence. “Seek the Guardians,” it said, fading away until it was nothing more than a wisp of light, “They will guide you. Trust in the stars, Mia.” With a final glance towards where the spirit had been, Mia turned and hurried back toward the main street. Her mind was ablaze with countless emotions – exhilaration, confusion, purpose. The whispers had led her to this moment, and there was no looking back. The alley gave way to the neon blaze she knew so well, but Mia felt changed. Her path, once obscured, now glimmered faintly with starlight. She wasn’t just Mia, the unnoticed girl who gazed up at the night sky; she was Mia, Seer of Spirits, chosen by the cosmos for a destiny greater than she had ever imagined. [Image Prompt: A glowing, translucent figure made of starlight, hovering in an alleyway.] Page 4: The Revelation Mia’s heart thundered against her ribs as she merged back into the river of city life, her senses heightened to the point of disbelief. The alleys behind her felt like a chasm she had leapt across, leaving her on the precipice of a world she had only ever dreamed about. The starlight spirit’s words echoed in her mind, reverberating with the promise of knowledge and purpose. She had to know more. The urge to understand her newfound ability, the Sight, propelled her onward, heading towards the one place she felt could offer some semblance of refuge—the public library of Luminara. It stood as a grand edifice, a haven for knowledge in the heart of the metropolis, its historical architecture a contrast to the city’s modern facade. The library was nearly empty at this late hour, the silence a welcome companion to Mia’s racing thoughts. Aisle after aisle of tomes lined the walls, the smell of ancient parchment and ink in the air. Her fingers skimmed across the spines of countless books on astronomy, mythology, and the arcane until her eyes caught a title that sent a shiver down her spine: “The Ethereal Spectres: A Compendium of the Otherworldly.” With trembling hands, she pulled the volume from its resting place and found herself a hidden corner in the dimly lit recesses of the library. The pages felt alive under her touch, their secrets pulsating with anticipation as she turned each one, consuming the words with a desperate hunger. Ancient tribes of starreaders, bridges between the corporeal and celestial, guardians of the unseen realms—the pieces began to click into place. Mia realized she wasn’t the first to hold the Sight. There were others, perhaps many eons before her, who had the same connection to the starlight spirits. What truly unsettled her was the notion of shadows, those who sought to sever the connection between the worlds for their own nefarious ends. It wasn’t just a gift; it was a responsibility—one that felt heavier with each word she read. As the library’s clock tower tolled a haunting melody, marking the late hour, Mia’s anxiety bloomed like a dark flower. The balance was mentioned time and again, the importance of light in keeping the darkness at bay. And then, in the margins of a well-thumbed page, a handwritten note caught her eye: “When the whispers grow loud, seek the Guardians. For only they can guide thee to the light or cast thee into darkness.” The revelation that she wasn’t alone in this—that there were others, Guardians, who could aid her—was both terrifying and exhilarating. Who were these Guardians? How would she find them? Was Alex, the name softly etched beside the note, a clue or merely the scribbles of a previous reader? As Mia pondered the path laid before her, the weight of secrecy pressed upon her chest. She could not share this with her family, her friends; the risk was too great. This journey, whatever it entailed, was hers and hers alone. Closing the book with care, Mia looked up into the shadows of the library, half-expecting a spirit to manifest from the darkness. She felt a strange blend of isolation and clarity. One thing was certain—her life would never be the same. A burgeoning resolve solidified within her: she would unravel the mystery, and in doing so, she would learn to wield the light she harbored inside, to face whatever lay ahead. Tucking the book under her arm, Mia exited the library, the early morning air crisp against her skin. The city of Luminara, now quiet in the dawn’s embrace, held new meaning for her. She was a part of something ancient, something crucial. The time had come to step out of the shadows and into the starlight. Page 5: The Mystery Begins As dawn cloaked Luminara in hues of orange and purple, Mia’s nocturnal encounter at the library felt like a world apart. The weight of the book under her arm was her only assurance that it hadn’t been a dream. She walked the streets absentmindedly, wrapped in thoughts about guardians and her newly bestowed Sight. The first hints of the city awakening rustled around her as she approached her neighborhood café, a place where she often found solace in a corner booth with a view of the bustling street. An order for a steaming cup of hot chocolate – her usual – never reached her lips as a sudden commotion across the room caught her attention. Patrons crowded by the café’s television, which flashed breaking news with bold letters screaming ‘MYSTERY ILLUMINATES LUMINARA’. Mia edged closer, her pulse quickening. The news reported an event that had occurred overnight, the very same hours in which Mia was being awakened to her gifts; a phenomenon that was difficult to describe, let alone explain, had rooted the city center in a trance. Beams of light, uncannily similar to the aura of her starlight visitant, had apparently danced across the skyline, visible from many parts of the city. The event left the people of Luminara bewildered, crafting theories from the scientific to the supernatural. Mia listened, heart skipping beats, as eyewitnesses described seeing ephemeral figures, radiant and sublime, much like the spirit she had met. The city was abuzz with talk of otherworldly interactions, and to Mia’s reserved horror and fascination, she realized she held a piece of this unfolding enigma. The news anchor shifted the discussion to speculations of alien encounters and government cover-ups, but Mia knew differently. She felt somehow responsible, as if her communion with the spirit had triggered this display, this crossing of worlds that was not supposed to be seen. Tucking the book more securely under her arm, Mia left her untouched hot chocolate and exited the café. The air was electric with speculation and wonder, a stark contrast to the secrets she harbored within. She needed to learn more, to understand the connection between her encounter and the city-wide phenomenon. Her next destination was clear; she had to return to the starlit alley where she met the spirit. Perhaps there were residual clues, something left behind that the discerning eye of a Seer could detect. Mia’s arrival was met with police tape and curious onlookers. The alley was now a point of interest, part of the greater anomaly that had captivated Luminara. A firm resolve coursed through her as she pushed past the throng, caution giving way to the urgency of her quest. Drawing on the esoteric words of the book, she reached out with her Sight, seeking traces amidst the mundane world. To her surprise, the alley glowed faintly with ethereal threads, tendrils of starlight visible only to her eyes. They weaved an intricate pattern along the ground and walls, remnants of an energy that lingered like the afterglow of supernovae. Mia knew that understanding these whispers of energy was key to unveiling the true nature of her calling. With every discovery, her place in the sprawling canvas of the cosmos was beginning to mark itself – a beacon of starlight, shrouded in the layers of shadows that her journey was just beginning to pierce. Page 6: New Allies As Mia focused on the luminous threads tracing through the alley, a gentle touch on her shoulder startled her back into the mundane world. She spun around to find herself staring into the deep, knowing eyes of a young man not much older than herself. His presence had been silent, an enigma, reminiscent of the whispering stars. “Can you see it too?” he asked, his voice a low murmur that only Mia could hear over the chatter of the crowd behind the police line. Mia hesitated, her instinct to protect her secret warring with the evident understanding in the stranger’s gaze. The young man offered a small, guarded smile and nodded toward the taped-off alley, a silent ally in her search for answers. “Yes,” Mia finally admitted, feeling a spark of connection. It seemed they shared the gift of seeing the unseen – an ally in this world balancing on the knife-edge between known and unknown. The young man introduced himself as Alex, the name striking a chord within Mia. Alex – the name scrawled in the margin of the mysterious book. Coincidence, or was this part of her destined path? What she did know was that Alex had an air of one who didn’t just believe in the extraordinary but embraced it. “You’re not like them,” Alex said, gesturing subtly to the gathering crowd. “You’re a Seer, aren’t you?” Mia’s eyes widened, not from fear, but from the rush of being truly seen for the first time. Alex’s understanding offered her a sanctuary, the possibility of no longer shouldering her secret alone. They moved away from the scene, seeking the quiet of a nearby park, whose trees whispered softly in the early morning breeze. With the murmurs of the city a distant backdrop, Alex shared his story. Like Mia, the night had called to him, but not with a whisper – his was a shout that beckoned him to witness the extraordinary light show. His search for knowledge led him to the library, to the very book Mia now carried, to find that someone had beaten him to it. Listening to Alex, Mia felt the isolation she had carried for so long begin to crumble. Here was someone who understood the strange and wonderful turn her life had taken. More than that, Alex possessed pieces of the puzzle that connected to her own. He spoke of the Guardians, of the delicate balance between their world and the realm of the starlight spirits. Together, they mulled over the handwritten note and what their rendezvous might mean. As they talked, an unspoken bond formed between them, a fellowship defined by shared purpose and the stirrings of trust. Mia found a comfort in Alex’s presence that she never knew she needed. Here was an ally, perhaps even a friend, who stood with her on the threshold of destiny. The revelation was profound, not just for the sense of partnership it brought, but for the realization that there were more guardians like Alex—a group, a haven, for people like her. The path she had to walk bloomed with the potential of camaraderie, and the loneliness that had dogged her steps dissolved into the warming light of new possibilities. Breathless with the weight of their shared understanding and the unwavering gaze of the open sky above, Mia felt propelled forward by an invisible hand, her journey entwined with Alex’s, and the mystery that beckoned them both deeper into the shadows of starlight. Page 7: Training Begins Mia and Alex left the cover of the trees, feeling a renewed sense of urgency in the light of the morning sun. The earlier confusion that had clouded Mia’s mind gave way to a resolution sharpened by their alliance. They recognized the path that lay ahead would not be easy, but together, they felt empowered to face whatever challenges the starlight spirits would unveil. Alex explained that he belonged to a small group who called themselves the Seekers—a collective of individuals with the Sight. They trained in secret, honing their abilities to communicate and interact with the starlight spirits and understand the deep lore of their connection to the stars. For generations, the Seekers had been the true Guardians, a lineage protecting the balance between the terrestrial and celestial—a balance now seemingly at risk. Intrigue replaced apprehension as Mia listened. She was ready to learn, to transform her incipient skills into tangible strength. The Seekers, Alex assured her, would aid her in harnessing her Sight, not just for her own enlightenment but for the preservation of the light that safeguarded both realms. They formulated a plan. The Seekers met at a covert location just outside the city limits, a place sitting beneath the open gaze of the stars. This would become Mia’s classroom, her temple, where she would learn to interpret the whispers of the cosmos under the tutelage of the Seekers. The journey to the Seekers’ sanctum was a brief one, but with every step, Mia felt as though she were moving further from her old life. Arriving at the hidden retreat—an old observatory nestled among the hills—they were greeted by the sight of ancient stone and groves of trees stretching upward, joining the heavens in stately vigil. The observatory was both majestic and serene, the perfect crossroads of earth-bound curiosity and celestial wonder. Mia marveled at the crumbling columns and the patina of age that adorned the domed structure. The air resounded with a subtle hum that she felt more than heard, a vibration that soothed her restless spirit. Within the weathered walls of the observatory, Mia met the rest of the Seekers. Each one offered a knowing nod or a smile of welcome, their eyes reflecting the same starry sheen that had marked Alex’s. These were individuals of all ages and backgrounds, bound together by their Sight and their solemn oath to use it for the greater good. Under the guidance of the Seekers, Mia underwent her first lesson. It wasn’t training of the body but of the mind and soul. She learned to calm her inner turbulence, to let the whispers of the universe find a home within her. She practiced extending her consciousness toward the starlight, allowing it to fill her senses and guide her intuition. [Image Prompt: Mia and Alex practicing with swirling lights of starlight around them.] As night descended upon the observatory, the Seekers gathered in the open beneath the vast expanse of the cosmos. Mia joined them, her eyes closing as she focused on the energy emanating from her fellow practitioners. Through the gentle encouragement of her new allies, she felt the bond with starlight grow stronger, the light within her answering the call of the ones above. She opened her eyes to a magnificent sight; the darkened sky came alive with mercurial streams of starlight responding to their combined presences. Mia lifted her hands, and to her wonder and thrill, the streams coalesced around her fingertips, dancing to the rhythm of her heartbeat. It was a moment of pure elation, of unity between her spirit and the vast sea of stars watching overhead. In that grand pavilion of night, with the whispering song of the cosmos in her ears, Mia glimpsed her potential for the first time—a potential that ignited like a newborn star within the depths of her being. She was becoming what she was meant to be, part of an ancient legacy that would challenge her to her core. She would learn, she would grow, and she would stand against the shadows threatening to extinguish the light she carried. Page 8: First Clue The observatory provided a sanctuary—not just for practice, but for discussion and theory. Post-training, Mia and the Seekers gathered to dissect what could be gleaned from the unusual occurrences within Luminara. Alex presented a series of weathered tomes and maps with routes and patterns—records of historical sightings of starlight activity, unexplained phenomena with a striking resemblance to recent events. Mia listened attentively to the theories woven together by the collective wisdom of the group. They spoke of ley lines—channels of energy invisible to the average eye, interlacing the earth and converging within Luminara. These lines acted as conduits for the starlight spirits, allowing them to traverse between their celestial realm and the terrestrial world. Could the recent disturbance in the city have been a result of an overlain rift, a chasm formed along these lines? The thought of Luminara perched upon such a volatile foundation sent a tremor of concern through the group. By the soft glow of candlelight, the Seekers pored over the evidence, tracing anomalies and mapping correspondences. They cast a net of intellect and intuition, seeking the thread that would unravel the tapestry of mystery that enveloped them. It was Mia, with fresh eyes and a connection newly kindled, who spotted an irregularity—a point where several ley lines intersected that corresponded geographically with the epicenter of the previous night’s event. The ancient library, the locus of her revelation, sat mere blocks away from this nexus. Alex leaned over her shoulder, his finger tracing the path she outlined, his eyes lighting with recognition. “The heart of the ley lines,” he murmured. “That’s where we need to look.” The discovery bore the weight of a palpable lead. Mia felt a thrill pulse through her—one of impending insight or peril, or perhaps both. The urge to investigate was unanimous among the Seekers, but caution wrapped its tendrils around their resolve. To probe such a site without understanding the scope of its significance was to court danger. Yet the cause of balance dictated their path. Among their resources was a mention of a totem—an artifact of ancient power said to reveal the unseen forces at work along the ley lines. If such a totem could be located, it might provide the lens through which they could peer into the mystery and discern the source of the disruption. In a blend of decision and duty, it was agreed Mia and Alex would return to Luminara to seek out this totem. Their bond, forged in shared experience and deepened by a night of wonder, was becoming the beacon that led the way. Delegation was set; the rest of the Seekers would remain, securing the observatory and delving deeper into their archives for any scrap of lore that might aid the search. As dawn once again teased the edges of night away, Mia and Alex set out back toward the mystery that seemed to center itself over Luminara. With the coming of light, the magnitude of their task loomed large, but in their hearts gleamed the inextinguishable flame of purpose lit by the stars themselves. Page 9: A Close Encounter The crisp air of daybreak did little to still the tempest of anticipation as Mia navigated the streets with Alex by her side, heading for their newfound objective. The city was stirring to life, but their destination held the quiet of a secret yet to be awakened. They aimed to reach the heart of the ley lines, an unassuming spot in the urban sprawl that the Seekers believed was key to the current instability. As they approached the area, a subtle prickling sensation, like the whisper of static, teased Mia’s senses. It was a sign they were drawing near, that the invisible was becoming tangible through her Sight. This place—this vortex of silent power—lay veiled by the normalcy of Luminara’s morning routine. Pedestrians bustled about, immersed in the beginnings of their day, oblivious to the hub of mystical convergence that Mia and Alex were inching toward. The epicenter of the disturbances was an old courtyard, framed by time-worn architecture and crowned with tendrils of ivy that clung to the walls. The morning’s light cast sharp shadows, carving out pockets of darkness where secrets could nestle. Mia’s hand gravitated to the book tucked under her arm, seeking reassurance from its ancient leather. Alex mirrored her action, checking the contents of a satchel slung over his shoulder that housed artifacts and tomes—tools of the Seekers that could help interpret or manipulate the starlight. They walked the perimeter cautiously, their Sight extended. To any passerby, they might seem like art enthusiasts, or history buffs admiring the structure; in truth, they were hunters, senses attuned to the echoes of the mystical that saturated the place. As they neared the center of the courtyard, a palpable shift occurred. The static sensation intensified, raising the fine hairs on their skin. It was as though they had stepped through a veil, the world’s colors deepening, shadows stretching. They were close—to the totem, to unlocking the whispers of the stars. It was then, amid their careful surveillance, that a glint caught Mia’s eye—a fleeting reflection of sunlight on metal, obscured by the foliage of a nearby bush. Alex’s gaze followed hers, and together they uncovered a small, ornate object, partially buried in the earth at the base of the plant. With reverence, Alex knelt and unearthed a medallion pulsing with an ancient allure. It was etched with sigils that danced under Mia’s gaze, whispering in a language that teased the edges of understanding. As light played across the surface of the medallion, a shadow loomed. Mia’s instincts flared, and she pulled Alex away from their discovery. A wind, unearthly and abrupt, cut through the courtyard, followed by the emergence of a figure from the darkened archway opposite them. Draped in a cloak that seemed to devour the day’s brightness, the figure’s eyes locked with theirs—eyes that brimmed with the malevolence of one who would see the balance of the worlds tip into chaos. The Seekers had spoken of shadowed adversaries, and Mia felt a chill that confirmed their warnings had been warranted. With the totem in their possession, Mia and Alex had to act quickly. Their encounter was evidence that they were meddling in affairs that had long remained undisturbed, yet necessary if the peculiar events affecting Luminara were to be understood and contained. This was no longer a mere mission for knowledge; they were being hunted. Flight was imperative. With a shared nod, Mia and Alex turned on their heels, their legs pumping, carrying them through the winding city streets. The chase—a race against shadow and time—had begun. [Image Prompt: Mia hiding from a threatening, shadowy figure with glowing eyes.] With the precious totem clasped between them and the ominous presence trailing in their wake, they fled, uncertain of their pursuer’s abilities or intentions. Only the hope that the starlight within could outshine any impending darkness spurred them on. They were enmeshed in the heart of the mystery, and the web was closing around them, tangling them in a peril more profound than any they had imagined. Page 10: Deepening Mysteries Their breaths tore through the silence as Mia and Alex dashed through the narrow passages that stitched Luminara’s historical quarter together. Street lamps flickered overhead, casting elongated shadows that merged with the light of dawn. Every echo of their footsteps on the cobblestones, every shift of wind, felt like the predatory gaze of the cloaked figure giving pursuit. Eventually, they found solitude in an abandoned subway station, its entrance obscured by overgrowth. Here they hoped the vestiges of modernity would shield them from the ancient forces that sought to reclaim the totem. The chill of the underground engulfed them as they descended the worn steps, their sanctuary a forgotten cavern of echoes and rusting tracks. They collapsed against the cool concrete, the adrenaline of their escape ebbing, leaving them to confront the weight of their recent encounter. The medallion lay between them, a source of trepidation and wonder. Alex cautiously reached for the artifact, his eyes reflecting the depth of questions unspoken. Mia watched him examine the medallion’s intricate engravings—enigmatic runes that belonged neither to the world of Luminara’s neon façade nor the celestial expanse they sought to connect with. The totem was a relic straddling the boundaries of their understanding, challenging the very nature of what they knew—or thought they knew—about their city, about the cosmos. It wasn’t just about ley lines and mystical disturbances anymore. The presence of an adversary brought a new dimension to their search. Who was this figure wielding the same ominous aura as those forces that the Seekers warned could sever the connection between Earth and the firmament? Mia’s thoughts spiraled, considering and discarding theories with restless fervor. Alex’s voice sliced through her contemplation. “This symbol here,” he traced a segment of the pattern with a careful finger, “I’ve seen it before in the Seekers’ archives. It’s a key of some sort, a means to harness or amplify energy flowing through the ley lines.\\" Mia leaned in closer, her study revealing the complexity of the design, the way it seemed to draw them in, an enigma calling to be unlocked. The medallion felt like a tangible manifestation of their journey—a nexus of past lore, present dilemma, and future trials. But the medallion provided more than just insight—it illuminated their next course of action. The clue led them to understand that the totem was part of a greater mechanism, one that governed the flow of the enigmatic energies beneath Luminara. [Image Prompt: A mysterious, shadowy figure lurking near a scene of magical disturbance in the city.] Alex looked at Mia, an idea dawning in his gaze. “If we can find out how this totem interacts with the ley lines, we might be able to prevent…” His voice trailed off as a new sound infiltrated the silence: The soft tread of stealthy footsteps approaching from the dark tunnels. Instinct prompted them to extinguish their flashlight, plunging the platform into near-total darkness. They huddled together, the totem concealed within Alex’s satchel, the only beacon being the faint glow emanating from its engravings, muted against the fabric. Their unknown pursuer moved closer, a disembodied shadow hunting them within the abyss of Luminara’s underworld. Mia felt the faint starlight within her, urging toward a solution that remained frustratingly out of reach. The mystery that they had thought to grasp was unravelling its threads faster than they could weave understanding. Fear and resolve twined within Mia’s heart. Not fear of the end, but fear of not accomplishing what she felt was her destiny, so recently illuminated by the stars. Each revelation brought with it deeper enigmas—revealing new layers of an ongoing stratagem larger and more intricate than any of them realized. With bated breath, they waited in the dark, the only certainty being that this clandestine game of cat and mouse through the tapestry of Luminara’s ancient secrets and starlit whispers was far from over. Page 11: Growing Tensions Pressed in the darkness, a gulp of stale underground air filled Mia’s lungs as she strained her ears for any hint of their stalker’s position. The cloaked figure’s footsteps seemed to fade, then stop. Alex’s hand found Mia’s in the dark – a silent vow of protection and unity between them. They were two fledglings against an unseen predator, events escalating beyond the scope of their initial quest. “Do you think they’re gone?” Mia’s whispered question was laced with the tension that buzzed through the void like electricity. “Let’s not wait to find out,” Alex replied, just as hushed, guiding Mia gently by the hand as they edged their way along the abandoned platform. He knew the station’s layout from past explorations with the Seekers – if they could navigate to the maintenance corridors, there would be other ways out. As they wove through shadows, the city above them was waking to its own unrest. News of last night’s luminescent spectacle spread through Luminara with the speed of wildfire, igniting a mixture of awe and apprehension in the populace. People gathered in the courtyards, cafes, and workplaces, exchanging hushed stories and wild speculations. The air was charged with the undercurrent of change, of a reality tilting on an unseen axis, and the seeds of fear and fascination took root in equal measure. Meanwhile, government officials and local law enforcement, ill-equipped to handle the murmurs of magic and myth, found themselves grappling with explanations to quell the rumors. Sirens rang in the distance, a dissonant symphony to the rush of daily life, while scientists and skeptics took to the airwaves attempting to rationalize the unexplainable. An undercurrent of unease spread, a sense that the city, always a tapestry of light and dark, had a shadow encroaching upon its edges, reaching from the depths of forgotten tales. Amidst this growing apprehension, a silent consensus fell upon the Seekers’ gathering – that what had begun as a search for understanding had escalated into a responsibility—responsibility to protect the unknowing citizens of Luminara from what lay hidden beneath the streets, and perhaps, from what existed above the stars. Mia’s thoughts were a whirlwind of concern for her family, her friends, the entire city. What would become of Luminara if the balance was not restored? And what part did the totem, now secure in Alex’s satchel, play in the grand design that hovered over them all like a predestined storm? Each step they took was a move in a grand strategy, with the city itself as the gameboard and its people the pieces. Mia felt her role shifting, the innocence of curiosity being honed into the steel of duty. They were participants in an ancient drama, with its roots in the stars but its repercussions mortally and incontrovertibly earthbound. The Seers had to unravel the thread of events before fear and darkness claimed dominion over Luminara’s starlit spirit. And with every secret unlocked from the veil of starlight and shadow, Mia felt herself growing into the guardian she was meant to be – a beacon of hope when the dark whispers threatened to overwhelm the light. [Image Prompt: The city of Luminara with a strange, mystical aurora in the sky, causing public alarm.] Emerging from the bowels of the station into the unseen corridors of the city, Mia and Alex took a moment to regroup, to plan their next step. Above them, the city of Luminara held its breath, watching the horizon for signs, for whispers on the wind, but below, in the heart of the underbelly, Mia and Alex took their first cautious steps toward the gathering storm. Page 12: Unseen Dangers Mia and Alex emerged from the underground labyrinth, their ascent into daylight tinged with the surreal understanding that the city they knew had been forever altered. They found themselves in an overlooked part of Luminara, where the buildings wore the patina of age and the graffiti told stories of dissent. It was here in the quieter, shaded streets that they paused to catch their breath and consider their next move. The sense of urgency that had propelled them from the depths of the subway station now gave way to the sobering realization of the danger they were in. This was no longer just about unexplained lights in the sky; they were being pursued by a tangible and malevolent force that could reach out to them at any turn. As they leaned against the cool brick of an abandoned warehouse, Alex pulled out the totem once more. The morning sun filtered through the grime of a nearby window, illuminating the etchings that seemed to pulse with an energy that defied the simplicity of its metallic surface. “There’s more at stake than we realized,” Mia began, her eyes tracing the shape of the totem in Alex’s hands. “This isn’t just about us, or the Seekers, or even just Luminara. If someone is after this,” she gestured to the medallion, “then it must have power we haven’t even begun to comprehend.” Alex nodded slowly. “The shadows are moving against us. We knew the path of a Seer could be fraught with risk. But this…” his voice trailed off, and when he looked up at Mia, his eyes bore the gravity of their situation. “This might be bigger than any danger the Seekers have faced before.” Determined to unearth more clues, they examined the totem once again. Mia’s fingers hovered over the symbols, and as they did, a chill swept through her. She could almost hear the echoes of starlight, like a distant chime, each time she passed over the engravings. It was as if the totem itself was an astral compass, pointing toward a truth not yet revealed. The question that loomed large in their minds was who their adversary was, this cloaked figure with eyes that glinted with malice and knowledge. Was it a rival seeker of lore, a wayward guardian, or something far more sinister tied to the starlight spirits themselves? They had to tread carefully. Each fact they gleaned was a beacon in the murk, but every light they shone could mark them in the darkness that hunted for the very power they wished to protect. As they stood in contemplation, a commotion nearby startled them from their deliberations. Police sirens wailed, and the sounds of chaos crept toward their hideaway. Mia peered around the corner to see a throng of law enforcement hastening toward the city center. Something was happening – another disturbance, another clue, perhaps. Compelled to unravel the widening mystery, they made a decision. They would mingle with the crowds, blend in with the concerned citizens, and perhaps in doing so, find the thread that would lead them to the next piece of the puzzle. It was a risk, exposing themselves to the gaze of the city and the cloaked figure that might be lurking there. But hiding in the shadows would bring them no closer to stopping the threat that whispered of an unseen danger. Taking a deep breath, steeling themselves with the resolve of their newfound calling, Mia and Alex stepped out from their sanctuary and into the public eye once more. They shared a silent pact, an acceptance of the path they walked—one of illuminated discoveries and silent perils lurking behind the veil of Luminara’s façade. The destiny that tied them to the stars and the secrets of the earth called them forth, and they answered, stepping boldly toward the unfolding drama that waited in the heart of their city. Page 13: A Moment of Solace The unease gripping Luminara was palpable, a city on the brink of the inexplicable, steadied only by the routine of daily life that marched on in the face of uncertainty. Police cordoned off areas of unusual activity, their faces etched with the same bewilderment mirrored in the crowd. Mia and Alex, though part of this throng, were set apart by the secret weight they carried—the totem’s presence pressing into Alex’s satchel like a beacon of unknown potential. After navigating through a congestion of onlookers, they ducked into an alleyway, a temporary reprieve from the pressing anxiety of the streets. The alley opened up into a secluded rooftop garden, a hidden gem amidst the urban expanse. Here, verdant life thrived quietly above the clamor, a peaceful contrast to the electrical tension that wound through the city below. Mia exhaled a sigh she didn’t realize she had been holding. Her entire life had been turned inside out in the span of a few days, and yet, amongst this pocket of serenity, she felt a connection to normalcy—a fleeting taste of the life she used to know. “Take a moment, Mia,” Alex encouraged, his voice a gentle nudge back to the present. “We’ve been through a lot. A break might give us some clarity.” She nodded, and together they sank onto the neatly trimmed grass, the rooftop garden enveloping them in a comforting embrace. Silence settled between them, not awkward but companionable, a shared acknowledgement of the wonder and fear that had become their constant shadows. Looking out over the skyline, the duo watched as Luminara stretched beneath the soft glow of sunset, its colors painting the clouds in strokes of gold and rose. For the briefest of heartbeats, Mia allowed herself the luxury of peace, the beauty of the moment tempering the storm of her thoughts. She glanced at Alex, taking in his angular profile against the dimming light. Unspoken camaraderie had woven itself into the fabric of their encounter—a bond formed not over years but through shared destiny. She observed the way his eyes, usually so sharp with resolve, softened at the sight of a pair of butterflies dancing above a bed of flowers. “This is beautiful,” Mia whispered, her attention captured by the delicate creatures. “Amidst all the chaos, life finds a way to remind us that there’s more to the world than our fears.” Alex turned his attention from the butterflies to Mia, a smile breaking through his solemnity. “It’s easy to forget, isn’t it?” he mused. “We get so caught up in the darkness that we risk losing sight of the light.” Mia felt the echo of truth in his words resonate within her. Their mission—to safeguard Luminara from the shadows at its edges—held more than just the duty of protection. It was a call to preserve the everyday magic that connected all facets of life, the joy found in the simple beauty of a peaceful garden against the backdrop of a city holding its breath. [Image Prompt: Mia and Alex on a rooftop, overlooking the city, with starlight spirits floating around, creating a romantic ambiance.] The flutter of wings brought her gaze back to the butterflies, their flight a dainty waltz in the lingering rays of the sun. Beneath them, the lights of Luminara began to flicker on, stars of another kind, defiant against the impending night. As dusk fell, lending privacy to their rooftop sanctuary, Mia and Alex shared stories of their lives beyond the realm of the Seekers. With each word, they wove threads of understanding, constructing a bridge over the isolation that had once defined their existence. The peace of the garden offered a stark counterpoint to the chaos of their quest—a contrast that lent strength to their resolve. For in this moment of solace, away from the hidden dangers and enigmatic challenges, they rediscovered the humanity that fueled their battle against the encroaching dark. A flickering light of hope, of connection, that would not be easily extinguished by the shadows seeking to envelope Luminara and its unsuspecting denizens. Page 14: A Discovery As darkness draped over the city, the rooftop garden had become a well of stillness amidst the swelling currents of Luminara’s unrest. Mia and Alex, reinvigorated by the shared moment of respite, prepared to descend from their ephemeral haven back into the depths of their uncertain journey. However, the night had yet to reveal its hand, and it was upon their departure that chance turned their tide. Mia, intending to take a final glance at the city from this rare vantage point, caught sight of a peculiar shimmer in the nocturnal canvas below. It was a faint, otherworldly gleam that resonated with an inexplicable familiarity, an echo of the energies they had sensed earlier. “Alex, look,” she whispered, pointing towards the illumination that flickered like a star fallen in the urban maze. With the totem secure, they cautiously traced their way down the building, curiosity fuelling their steps, the lure of discovery propelling them forward. As they approached the source, it became apparent that the light emanated from the entrance of a narrow side alley. In stark contrast to the dank surroundings, the radiance appeared ethereal, untouched by the city’s grime. It was not mere reflection or trick of the light; this glow held the essence of the starlight spirits themselves. The alley was vacant, save for the celestial glow that seemed to beckon. With every fiber of her being tingling with a mix of apprehension and anticipation, Mia felt the Sight within her stir, a recognition of affinity to the astral phenomenon before them. The whispers of the universe were not just calling; they were guiding. The light seemed to pulse in response to their presence, its motion growing more pronounced as Mia extended a tentative hand, her fingers grazing the otherworldly orb. A resonance spread through her—a vibration that matched the cadence of her heart and the throbbing hum of the city. It was more than mere energy; it was communication, an articulation in the celestial language she was only beginning to comprehend. “A message,” Alex breathed, his tone a mix of awe and urgency. “It must be from the starlight spirits. Could they be trying to guide us?” Mia nodded, though her expression remained concentrated, her mind unweaving the complex strands of luminescent speech. Words of light, of energy, translated into understanding, a current of thought flowing into her consciousness. The starlight spirits conveyed a sense of urgency, a plea for the guardianship that she and Alex had unknowingly vowed to undertake. There was an artifact—distinct from the totem, yet inexplicably linked—a key that harbored the power to mend the fraying seam between worlds. The location, obscured by shadow and the passage of time, would soon be revealed, an answer hidden in history and the fabric of the city itself. “The convergence is near,” the light whispered—an utterance only felt, not heard. “The paths will cross at the junction of time and trial. Be ready, guardians of the bridge.” As the message dissolved into the night, the duo stood in stunned silence, processing the gravity of their encounter. The path they embarked upon was charting deeper into the unknown, their roles as Seers expanding into agents of a cosmic orchestration that spanned beyond the reaches of Earthly perception. With the discovery pulsing in their hearts like a newly kindled star, Mia and Alex stepped back into the shadowed streets, the murmurs of the spirits a guiding refrain. The city sprawled around them, a trove of secrets waiting to be unearthed by steadfast hands and watchful eyes that held the glimmer of the stars. Page 15: A Confrontation The cryptic guidance of the starlight spirits left Mia and Alex grappling with more questions than answers. What was the key they spoke of, and how would it manifest in the tangible world? With only the veiled whispers of the cosmos to guide them, they needed more—a stroke of terrestrial insight to pair with the ethereal message. Mia’s thoughts raced back to the library, to the tomes and their secrets. The public facade housed more than just ink and paper; it protected whispers of the ancient, of knowledge passed through generations. If there was anything that could shed light on this new aspect of their quest, it would be there among the silent rows of books and the hallowed echoes of the past. As they navigated the serpentine pathways back to the central district, a sharp-edged disquiet sliced into their conversation. The foreboding feeling of being watched had returned, the sensation of another presence lurking in their shadow. The confrontation they had managed to sidestep earlier that day was not an isolated threat—it was a persisting danger. With their instincts on high alert, they moved with purpose, seeking the solace of the library’s fortified walls. Upon arrival, they found the building locked, the late hour denying them entry. Their frustration was palpable, the denial of access an unexpected impediment. That’s when they heard it—the unmistakable sound of shuffling feet from within. Intrigue mixed with caution, Mia approached one of the tall windows, peering through its dusty pane. The faint light of an inner lamp revealed a figure moving through the shadows, their behavior furtive, indicative of a search similar to their own. It was clear they were not a staff member or a casual reader, but rather someone with intent and knowledge of what lay concealed within the public space. The nocturnal intruder paused beneath the dim glow, and an object in their hands caught the light—a book, old and leather-bound, unmistakably one of the same that Mia and Alex had poured over with the Seekers, its worn edges a testament to its critical role. Without hesitation, Mia attempted the door, finding it surprisingly unlocked. They stepped inside, their entrance muffled by the expanse of the grand reading room. The rows of shelves loomed like silent sentinels, and up ahead, the interloper, still unbeknownst to their presence, continued their clandestine rummaging. Mia glanced at Alex, her resolve steeling. This had to be more than mere coincidence—the intruder was looking for answers to questions only they understood. It was time for answers, and the direct approach was all they had left. Stepping into the aisle, Mia cleared her throat. The figure jolted, the book clutched tight against their chest. “Looking for something in particular?” Mia’s voice was calm, but the energy of the room shifted palpably, the undercurrent of danger swirling among the weighted silence of the tomes. The silhouette turned, and a face emerged from the shadows, one both familiar and unexpected—a young woman, her eyes wide with alarm, but not, Mia noted, with guilt. The intruder spoke, her voice a blend of defiance and curiosity. “I could ask you the same thing.” The standoff was brief, the realization shared between them like a spark passing through open space. This woman was not their cloaked adversary from the alley, but another player in the intricate dance between the terrestrial and the celestial. There was a connection, one that was yet to fully surface, but clear as the tension that hung in the air between them. Confrontation gave way to dialogue, and they began to weave a thread of communication, their tales unfolding, their search for the key and the truth behind the disturbances drawing them together. [Image Prompt: An intense confrontation in an old library, with books and mystical artifacts around.] It was becoming clear that this journey was not theirs to walk alone. The tapestry they had been tracing—the patterns of starlight and shadow—was expansive, reaching into lives beyond their own. It was within the hallowed halls of knowledge, amid the confrontations with the unknown, that their path was crossing with others drawn by the same source of wonder and dread. Page 16: The Plot Thickens The revelation that this young woman was neither foe nor ignorant bystander added a new dimension to the evening’s tension. In the musty air of the library, surrounded by ancient texts and the lingering whispers of a thousand stories, Mia, Alex, and the stranger regarded each other in an uncertain truce. “So, you know about the starlight spirits, the disturbances, the ley lines?” Mia inquired, her gaze penetrating as she watched the newcomer carefully. Alex stood close, his presence protective yet curious. “The lights, the energy, I’ve felt them,” the stranger answered, her guarded poise softening as she sensed a shared purpose among them. “My name is Isla. I work at the university—the Astronomy Department. We’ve been detecting anomalies—patterns that don’t fit traditional cosmic behavior.” Isla’s confession set the stage for revelations, the threads of isolated inquiries becoming part of a larger fabric. She spoke of theoretical rifts in the fabric of space-time, empirical evidence of a celestial nature that couldn’t be explained through known scientific phenomena. Her research had led her here, to the library, in search of esoteric correlations that might frame her findings in a broader context. As the trio exchanged knowledge, the convergence of their paths steered them toward a frightening conceptual horizon. If Isla’s academic evidence was prophesying the same upheaval that the Seekers and their celestial counterparts were warning about, then Luminara, and possibly the world beyond, stood on the precipice of something monumental. Mia, bolstered by the new alliance, suggested, “We believe there is an artifact, a key of sorts, connected to the ley lines and the spirits. It might be the answer to containing, or at least understanding, the anomalies.” Isla’s eyes narrowed, her analytical mind picking apart the implications of Mia’s statement. “An artifact? There might be some mention of it in the legends… the ones dismissed by modern science.” She motioned toward a section of the library designated for texts of mythology and folklore. Together, they redirected their search. The dusty shelves harbored more than fables; they held forgotten wisdom that slipped through the cracks of mainstream knowledge. The trio scoured the collection with newfound fervor, pouring over pages that whispered of hidden truths medicine men and sages had gleaned under the stars centuries prior. It was a race against time, a race against the encroaching darkness, as they sought to connect the celestial dots that seemed to spell an impending cosmic conundrum. The plot did indeed thicken as they worked, the library’s labyrinth of written heritage unspooling before them. And then, nestled within the yellowed pages of an aged ledger written by an explorer long departed, they found it—a reference to the “Heart of Luminara,” an artifact shaped by the heavens’ own touch. “According to this, the Heart was sent to Earth long ago, held by those chosen by the stars, to serve as a bridge for communication and passage,” Isla read aloud, a tinge of wonder coloring her rational tone. With this discovery, their search gained direction. The Heart of Luminara was more than a key—it was a beacon of ancient magicks and celestial mechanics, a link between worlds that yearned for balance. With the ledger as their guide, they determined to seek the artifact’s last known location. Ceaseless threats lurked in the shadows behind every thought, every glance from the library’s enveloping dark. Yet, the newfound companions drew strength from their shared cause and the knowledge that the answers they sought were aligning, piece by intricate piece. They exited the library, the artifact’s call a hushed serenade that seemed to echo down from the very stars they gazed upon. The journey ahead was draped in enigma, but they were no longer travelers navigating in isolation; they were a constellation of seekers drawn together by the plot that enshrouded their city and their fate. Page 17: Unexpected Ally The stars bore silent witness as Mia, Alex, and their new companion, Isla, stepped into the cool embrace of the night. The ledger under Isla’s arm was more than a compilation of forgotten chronicles; it was the map that might lead them to the Heart of Luminara and hold the answers they so desperately sought. Their departure from the library was halted by a muttered word from Mia. She halted, straining her eyes against the darkness of an adjoining street. A figure stepped from the shadows, unhurried, almost leisurely, and for a moment, time seemed to constrict around them. The figure was cloaked, much like the menacing pursuer they had previously evaded, yet there was a distinction—an aura not of threat, but of withheld promise. The figure’s approach elicited a range of reactions. Alex moved subtly, placing himself between the stranger and the two women, while Isla’s hand tightened around her leather-bound trove, her stance defensive. Mia herself felt an odd sense of anticipation as the figure drew closer, a flicker of recognition sparking within her. Once within the lamplight’s reach, the cloak’s hood was pulled back to reveal an elderly man with a countenance that spoke of wisdom and trials weathered. His eyes held the endless knowledge of the stars—a gaze born of years scrutinizing the heavens, reading its secrets. “I am known as Marlo,” he said, his voice a low timbre that commanded attention despite its softness. “I have been watching your progress, Mia and Alex. And you must be Isla, the one whose search for celestial truths has led you from the academic towers to the grounds of myth.” Isla’s surprise turned to inquisitiveness as she met Marlo’s gaze. “You know of me?” she asked, her voice a blend of skepticism and intrigue. Marlo nodded, his lips curving into a wise smile. “I know many things. I, too, have felt the fractures in our reality, the disturbances you seek to mend. I am a keeper of scribed celestial lore, a descendant of those who penned some of the very volumes you hold.” Isla’s grip on the ledger eased as realization dawned. Marlo was not a new adversary, but another piece of the ever-expanding puzzle—a provider of knowledge they lacked, a guardian of forgotten truths. Marlo shared with them the lineage of the book Isla carried, how generations of star-gazers had kept the tale of the Heart of Luminara alive through their records, this ledger being the culmination of their labors. “It is more than an artifact,” he explained; “it’s part of a cosmic mechanism, an interface between the earth and the stars.” The Heart, it seemed, was a celestially infused object that could actuate the ley lines in favor of balance, or dismay, depending on who wielded it. Theirs was a quest not only to find it but to ensure it did not fall into the wrong hands. [Image Prompt: A mysterious character, cloaked and enigmatic, reaching out to Mia in a dimly lit room.] Marlo’s revelations brought gravity to their quest, his assurances a balm to the turbulence of their doubts. With the ledger as their guide and Marlo’s guidance, they sought to uncover the Heart, a journey now shadowed by the fearsome knowledge that others, too, coveted its power for darker designs. Resolved to see their search to the end, Mia, Alex, Isla, and now Marlo, ventured into the belly of the city, where echoes of magick lay in wait and where their fates would intertwine with the celestial emissary known as the Heart of Luminara. Page 18: A New Lead Armed with ancient knowledge and the added wisdom of their enigmatic guide, Marlo, Mia, Alex, and Isla wove through the sleeping city with resolute purpose. They moved as shadows themselves, aware that a wisp of starlight or the slightest tremor in the ley lines could betray their presence to those who pursued the same powerful relic. Marlo, who had walked the edge between the visible and the veiled for more years than the others could fathom, directed their steps toward the remnants of an old district. Here, the architecture whispered stories of times when belief in the intertwining of worlds was common, where star-gazers were once revered. “This way,” said Marlo, his voice barely louder than a breath as he led them down an almost forgotten street. The cobblestones were worn smooth by the passage of countless feet and countless years. Vines clung to the sides of stoic buildings, the city’s age and mystery hanging heavy in the air. At Marlo’s behest, Isla unfolded the ledger, its pages luminescent under the wary gaze of the moon. She traced over the ancient text with fingers that trembled not from cold but from anticipation. “Here,” she whispered, pointing to a passage that described a courtyard with a fountain, its centerpiece marked with celestial sigils visible only to those who looked beyond the earthly façade. Mia’s Sight flared within her, her connection to the cosmos urging her gaze to pierce the mundane shroud of the world. An ordinary fountain, worn by years and ignored by passersby, captured her focus; she could see past the layers of grime and disrepair to witness an intricate pattern of stars and planetary orbits etched into its surface. They gathered around the relic of a bygone era, the fountain’s dry basin a seeming receptacle of secrets and power. Marlo nodded approvingly, his expression a blend of sorrow and hope. “The Heart of Luminara must be close,” he assured them. His declaration was more than conjecture; it was a feeling, an ancient tug at his soul that whispered of proximity to the artifact they sought. The scene became a capsule of concentration as Mia, Alex, and Isla leaned closer, the ledger now a tangible guide as they cross-referenced Marlo’s intuitions with the document’s penned renderings. Each symbol, each line, each dormant trickle of long-ago water within the fountain’s basin held the potential to open pathways long sealed. Moments spilled like sand through the hourglass as they sifted through the clues buried within both fountain and text. And then, as if by fate’s own design, Isla’s hand hovered over a mosaic tile within the ornate depiction of Ursa Major, the Great Bear constellation—an emblem which aligned with a sketch in the yellowed pages of her tome. “Under the Great Bear,” read Isla, her voice betraying her burgeoning excitement. “The Heart resides where the heavens are reflected upon the Earth.” Their search narrowed to the space under the constellation, their movements delicate as they prodded the fountain’s designs for a sign, a trigger, a revelation. It was Alex who discovered the anomaly—a tile within the bear’s outline that depressed slightly under pressure. The fountain’s base emitted a low grinding sound, stone against stone, as hidden mechanisms—untouched for aeons—began to stir. The Seekers looked on with bated breath as the base stones parted, revealing a concealed cavity beneath. The revelation was an affirmation of prophecy and legend, forged by celestial intent—but was the sought-after Heart within? Page 19: A Dangerous Encounter The stone outline of Ursa Major had given way to reveal its secret, an opening within the heart of the fountain where the Earth seemed to touch the stars. The air around the seekers buzzed with the hum of raw energy, a vibration felt more than heard, as if the revealing of the hidden chamber echoed within the very fabric of the cosmos. Marlo was the first to react, his hand outstretched to halt the eager advance of his companions. “Caution,” he whispered, his gaze intense. “The Heart, if it is indeed within, will be guarded. Its wards have held for centuries.” They peered into the darkness below. The cavity was not simply an empty recess but an entrance to something deeper, a corridor that vanished into the earth. Cold air wafted from the gaping maw, along with the faint, indistinct scent of minerals and old magic. Mia hesitated at the threshold, the Sight within her flickering like a flame in a draft. What lay beyond was a path woven with peril and promise, leading to a relic that bore the weight of worlds upon its form. The decision to descend was silent, unanimous; their journey thus far had been a gathering of momentum that could not now be stilled. With Marlo leading, the seekers descended one by one into the gloom. The stairwell spiraled downwards, ancient stones worn smooth by the footsteps of those few who had once walked this hallowed route. As they wound deeper beneath the city, the cries of the surface faded into a memory, and the silence grew profound, save for the steady whisper of their breaths and the soft echo of their descent. And then, the passageway leveled, opening into an expansive chamber. The walls thrummed with the same starry energy that Mia had come to recognize—a tapestry of pulsating light that painted an otherworldly glow upon the seekers’ awestruck faces. The reverence of the chamber, however, was shattered by a sudden movement. From the shadows cast by the starlight emerged figures, robed and silent, guardians of the sacred place that had for so long been undisturbed. Mia’s Sight flared—warnings sparking within her mind. These were no mortal custodians, but manifestations of the ley lines themselves, conjured protectors bound to the Heart of Luminara. The intensity of the chamber’s light grew, and the figures advanced, their forms blurring between solidity and luminescence. [Image Prompt: Mia and Alex in a hidden underground chamber, facing a sinister, magical phenomenon.] Alex stepped forward, drawing a small device from the depths of his satchel—it was the totem they had recovered, its purpose now startlingly clear. He held it aloft; the sigils upon its surface ignited with brilliance, casting a beam that seemed to answer the aggression of the guardians with an assertion of kinship. For a tense moment, there was an oscillation in the chamber, a flicker between conflict and recognition. And then, as if accepting the totem’s call, the guardians stilled, their forms softening, allowing the seekers to pass unharmed. An unspoken agreement had been forged in light and understanding, a treaty that granted Mia, Alex, Isla, and Marlo the right to approach the Heart. A pedestal stood in the chamber’s center, cradling the Heart of Luminara—a crystal pulsing with an inner galaxy of stars, nebulae, and constellations. It was a microcosm of the universe, a beacon of ancient power that resonated with the beat of all creation. As the seekers reached out to this celestial relic, they understood that it was more than an artifact; it was a living connection to the stars themselves—a nexus of past and future where the fate of their world hung in the balance. Page 20: Cliffhanger Ending Bathed in the Heart of Luminara’s incandescent glow, Mia, Alex, Isla, and Marlo stood before the pedestal. The chamber around them held its breath, the light from the crystal casting prismatic dances upon the walls. This was the moment of convergence, the Seekers and scholars meeting destiny hand in hand. Marlo, with a reverence reserved for the most sacred of rituals, stepped forward. His seasoned hands hovered above the Heart, wary of contact. “It must be understood before it can be wielded,” he murmured, echoing the words that had been passed down through his lineage. Mia’s Sight, fully attuned to the Heart’s celestial song, recoiled at the touch of darkness she felt creeping through the chamber’s threshold. She searched the shadows, sensing a presence—a void where the starlight wept. “Something’s wrong,” she said, her voice a whisper that carried the weight of her dread. No sooner had the warning left her lips than the chamber shook—a silent quake that trembled through stone and soul alike. The guardians around them flickered wildly, their forms destabilizing, reacting to an intrusion that threatened to unravel the woven peace. From the darkness emerged their cloaked pursuer, the figure that had lurked within their periphery since the start of their voyage. But they were not alone. Flanking the cloaked figure were others, equally obscured by shadow, their intentions clear as they eyed the Heart with malignant desire. “The barriers weaken,” the cloaked figure spoke, his voice a sibilant sound that slithered through the chamber, “and we will not be denied our prize.” Mia felt anger surge within her, a fierce protectiveness over the Heart that had become part of a greater purpose she now carried. “We can’t let them take it,” she said, stepping between the intruders and the pedestal. Alex and Isla moved to join her, a unified front against the impending threat. A high-pitched tone, like the ringing of glass, resonated from the Heart, an urgent timbre that seemed to be both a summons and a warning. The air thickened with potential, with the palpable power of starlight that needed to be channeled, guarded. Marlo’s eyes were laden with sorrow, with the burden of generations. “There are forces here that not even the Heart can easily quell,” he said, his voice steady despite the chaos. “We must make a choice, and we must make it swiftly.” In the climactic tension, the crystal pulsed—a beacon calling its guardians to action. The Seekers prepared to defend it, to keep its power from hands that would misuse its connection to the fabric of existence. [Image Prompt: Mia facing an unexpected revelation or danger.] As the confrontation neared its breaking point, a tremor of realization coursed through Mia. The ledger she had brushed off the pedestal in her urgency reflected a cascade of light from the Heart, a shattered reflection that bordered on revelation. She glanced at Isla, and in their shared gaze was an unspoken agreement: The chamber held more secrets, and within the cryptic intersection of starlight, shadow, and scholarly intuition lay the answer they needed. With the chamber echoing the song of colliding worlds and the imminent threat of the shadowed intruders, the Heart of Luminara beckoned the seekers to stand firm, to protect the cosmic balance. As the Heart’s glow intensified, a final, shattering truth came to light—a twist in their tale that none of the seekers had foreseen, a revelation that could change everything…","completion":"Based on the intricate storyline provided, here is an outline for \\"Eclipsing Shadows,\\" the second book following \\"Whispers in the Dark.\\" The outline will adhere to the framework and style of the first book and ensure that the new book captures the enigmatic and thrilling qualities of its predecessor. --- **Outline for \\"Eclipsing Shadows\\"** **Chapter 1: The Heart's Guardian** - In the aftermath of the confrontation, Mia instinctively touches the Heart of Luminara—igniting a protective barrier around the group, repelling the shadowed intruders with a burst of celestial light. - Marlo reveals that the Heart, now recognizing Mia as its guardian, has bound itself to her.

Les informations que vous citez semblent se référer à une analyse de la distribution des revenus après impôts entre différents déciles de la population. Dans le contexte des études sur les revenus, le terme \\"décile\\" est utilisé pour diviser la population en dix groupes égaux en fonction de leur niveau de revenu. Ainsi, D1 représente les 10% les plus pauvres de la population, tandis que D10 représente les 10% les plus riches. Selon votre exemple : - \\"3300 euros à la fin de l'année après prélèvement d'impôts pour les plus pauvres (D1)\\": Cela signifie que, selon l'étude de l'INSEE, en moyenne, le décile de population avec les revenus les plus faibles (les 10% les plus pauvres) avait environ 3300 euros à sa disposition à la fin de l'année 2018, après avoir payé les impôts et les contributions sociales. - \\"70000 pour les plus riches (D10)\\": Inversement, en moyenne, les 10% les plus riches de la population (D10) avaient environ 70000 euros de revenu disponible après impôts à la fin de l'année 2018. Ces chiffres illustrent l'écart de revenu disponible entre les tranches de revenus les plus basses et les plus hautes de la société. Le revenu disponible est l'argent dont les ménages disposent pour dépenser ou épargner après avoir payé les taxes et reçu les prestations sociales. Cependant, il est important de noter que ces chiffres sont des moyennes et qu'il peut y avoir une grande variabilité au sein de chaque décile. De plus, ces chiffres pourraient avoir changé depuis 2018 en raison de l'évolution économique, de la législation fiscale, et d'autres facteurs socio-économiques.

Or selon l'exemple, on leur a retiré 3700 euros en tout à la fin de l'année via les impôts. Est ce correct ou peux tu clarifier ?","completion":"Votre compréhension semble impliquer qu'il y a une confusion quant à la signification des revenus restants après prélèvement des impôts. Pour clarifier : Si l'INSEE indique qu'en moyenne, les individus les plus pauvres (D1) ont 3300 euros restants à la fin de l'année après le prélèvement des impôts, cela ne signifie pas nécessairement qu'ils ont été débités de 3700 euros en impôts sur un revenu initial de 7000 euros. En réalité, le montant de 3300 euros correspond au revenu disponible après impôts, sans spécifier le revenu initial ou le montant exact des impôts payés. Les 3300 euros comprennent tout ce qui reste après les taxes et les cotisations sociales, ainsi que les éventuelles prestations sociales reçues. Ces prestations peuvent inclure des allocations, des aides au logement, ou d'autres formes de soutien qui sont souvent destinées à augmenter le revenu des ménages les plus modestes. Il est important de se rappeler que le système fiscal et social français est progressif et redistributif, ce qui signifie que les taux d'imposition sont conçus pour être plus faibles pour les personnes ayant de faibles revenus, et des transferts sociaux sont fournis pour soutenir les ménages à faible revenu. En conséquence, les personnes avec les revenus les plus bas paient habituellement peu d'impôts et peuvent même recevoir des aides financières de l’État. Pour mieux comprendre comment ces 3300 euros ont été calculés pour le décile D1, il serait nécessaire de regarder en détail le rapport ou l'analyse de l'INSEE, qui inclurait les revenus initiaux, les impôts payés, les cotisations sociales et les prestations sociales reçues par les personnes dans cette tranche de revenus."},{"prompt":"Donc impôts pour D1 = 3700 euros en moyenne ?","completion":"Non, ce n'est pas correct de conclure directement que \\"les impôts pour D1 = 3700 euros en moyenne\\" sans plus de contexte. La déclaration initiale que vous avez fournie indique simplement que les ménages dans le premier décile (D1), qui sont les plus pauvres, ont un revenu disponible de 3300 euros après impôts et prélèvements sociaux. Le revenu disponible est le revenu total dont dispose un ménage pour dépenser, économiser ou investir après avoir payé les impôts et reçu toute aide sociale, le cas échéant. Pour savoir combien les ménages du D1 ont payé en impôts, nous aurions besoin de connaître leur revenu brut total (avant impôts) et toutes les aides et crédits d'impôt auxquels ils ont droit. Le montant de 3300 euros est ce qui leur reste pour vivre durant l'année après que tous ces calculs ont été effectués. Il est également important de noter que les ménages les plus pauvres paient proportionnellement moins d'impôts en France, car le système fiscal est progressif, et ils peuvent également être bénéficiaires de diverses aides sociales qui augmentent leur revenu disponible. En conséquence, le montant exact d'impôts qu'ils paient pourrait être très faible, voire négatif (ce qui signifie qu'ils reçoivent plus en prestations sociales qu'ils ne paient en impôts). Sans données supplémentaires spécifiques sur le revenu brut, les impôts payés, et les transferts sociaux reçus par les ménages appartenant au D1, nous ne pouvons pas déterminer le montant exact des impôts qu'ils ont payé. Il serait nécessaire de consulter les rapports de l'INSEE pour obtenir une description détaillée de la situation fiscale de ces ménages."},{"prompt":"Donc ça signifie qu'on leur taxe combien ?","completion":"Pour déterminer précisément le montant des taxes et des prélèvements sociaux pour les ménages du premier décile (D1), c'est-à-dire les 10 % les plus pauvres, il est nécessaire d'avoir accès à des données spécifiques qui incluent leur revenu brut (avant impôts), le montant des impôts payés, les cotisations sociales, ainsi que les prestations et crédits sociaux reçus. Le montant de 3300 euros cité comme revenu disponible pour le D1 ne fournit pas directement le montant des taxes payées. Le revenu disponible est le montant restant après que toutes ces opérations aient été effectuées. En France, les ménages à faible revenu bénéficient généralement d'un système fiscal progressif et de prestations sociales qui réduisent ou compensent souvent l'impact des impôts et des cotisations sociales sur leur revenu. Par conséquent, les ménages dans le D1 payent généralement peu ou pas d'impôt sur le revenu; les prélèvements qu'ils subissent sont davantage sous forme de cotisations sociales, et ils reçoivent aussi des transferts sociaux qui peuvent augmenter leur revenu disponible. Pour obtenir les montants exacts des impôts et prélèvements pour les ménages du D1, vous devriez consulter les données détaillées fournies par l'INSEE ou d'autres sources qui étudient la fiscalité et les revenus des ménages français, comme le rapport annuel sur les revenus fiscaux et sociaux des ménages ou d'autres publications spécialisées. Ces sources fourniraient des informations complètes, y compris la composition des revenus, les impôts payés, les cotisations sociales et les prestations reçues par ces ménages."},{"prompt":"définis clairement : \\"Part de revenu\\"","completion":"La \\"part de revenu\\" est une expression qui fait généralement référence à la proportion ou au pourcentage du revenu total qui revient à un groupe spécifique de personnes dans une économie ou une société. Quand on analyse la distribution du revenu entre différents groupes, comme les déciles ou les quintiles, on parle de la part de revenu allouée à chacun de ces groupes. Voici quelques exemples pour clarifier le concept : 1. **Distribution par déciles ou percentiles :** Si on dit que le décile supérieur (les 10 % les plus riches) d'une population détient 50 % de la part de revenu totale, cela signifie que ces 10 % de la population gagnent la moitié de tous les revenus de la population étudiée. 2. **Distribution par quintiles :** Si on divise la population en cinq groupes égaux (quintiles) selon le revenu, on peut dire que le quintile le plus riche (les 20 % les plus riches) a une certaine part de revenu, comme 40 % du revenu total, tandis que le quintile le plus pauvre (les 20 % les plus pauvres) pourrait n'avoir que 5 % de la part de revenu total. 3. **Revenu d'emploi :** Dans le contexte d'une entreprise, la part de revenu peut aussi signifier la proportion du revenu d'une entreprise qui est attribuée aux salaires et traitements des employés comparativement aux bénéfices réinvestis ou distribués aux actionnaires. La notion de \\"part de revenu\\" est importante pour comprendre l'inégalité économique dans une société. L'analyse des parts de revenu permet d'évaluer l'équité de la distribution du revenu et de voir comment elle évolue au fil du temps. Elle est fondamentale pour la formulation des politiques économiques et sociales visant à réduire les inégalités et à promouvoir l'inclusion financière."},{"prompt":"que signifie facilement \\"un prélèvement en part du revenu\\" ?","completion":"L'expression \\"un prélèvement en part du revenu\\" signifie qu'une certaine somme ou un certain pourcentage du revenu d'une personne ou d'un ménage est retenu ou soustrait, généralement par l'État ou une institution financière, pour des raisons fiscales ou pour des contributions à des systèmes sociaux. Par exemple, si on dit qu'il y a un prélèvement en part du revenu de 20% pour un individu, cela signifie que 20% du revenu de cette personne est prélevé. Ce prélèvement peut prendre différentes formes : 1. **Impôts sur le revenu :** C'est l'argent que les contribuables doivent payer à l'État en fonction de leur revenu. Si une personne a un salaire de 3000 euros par mois et qu'il y a un prélèvement en part du revenu de 20% au titre de l'impôt sur le revenu, cette personne paiera 600 euros d'impôts et lui restera donc 2400 euros de revenu disponible. 2. **Cotisations sociales :** Ce sont des contributions obligatoires prélevées sur le revenu pour financer les systèmes de protection sociale (sécurité sociale, retraite, assurance maladie, etc.). Ces prélèvements servent à redistribuer la richesse et à fournir des services publics ou des prestations sociales. 3. **Contributions à des régimes de retraite, d'assurances ou d'épargnes :** Il peut aussi s'agir de prélèvements sur le revenu destinés à des plans d'épargne personnels ou professionnels (par exemple, des contributions à un plan de retraite privé). En résumé, \\"un prélèvement en part du revenu\\" est la portion du revenu qui est déduite avant que l'individu ou le ménage puisse disposer librement du reste. Cela réduit donc leur revenu disponible pour les dépenses courantes, l'épargne ou l'investissement."},{"prompt":"Est t il vrai que sur 7000 euros en trop, l'Etat français taxe 3700 euros sur les 7000 ?","completion":"Pour répondre à cette question de manière précise, il faudrait connaître le contexte de ces chiffres de 7000 euros et de 3700 euros. En général, les montants de taxation dépendent de plusieurs facteurs, y compris le type de revenu, les taux d'imposition en vigueur, les abattements possibles, les crédits d'impôts, le statut familial, et bien d'autres éléments spécifiques à la situation fiscale d'un individu ou d'un ménage. En France, le système fiscal est progressif, ce qui signifie que le taux d'imposition augmente avec le niveau de revenu. Il n'existe pas de règle fixe selon laquelle \\"sur 7000 euros en trop, l'État français taxe 3700 euros\\". Le montant des impôts dépend du revenu total de la personne, des déductions et des crédits fiscaux applicables. Si l'on parle de \\"7000 euros en trop\\", cela suggère un revenu supplémentaire par rapport à quelque chose - peut-être un seuil de revenu, un revenu de base, ou une tranche d'imposition antérieure. Si ces 7000 euros s'ajoutent à un revenu déjà élevé qui place l'individu dans une tranche d'imposition supérieure, alors une partie substantielle pourrait effectivement être taxée. Mais si ces 7000 euros sont le seul revenu, ou une partie d'un revenu plus modeste, la taxation pourrait être bien moindre. Pour comprendre comment un montant de revenu supplémentaire tel que 7000 euros serait taxé, il faudrait examiner le barème de l'impôt sur le revenu, qui définit les taux d'imposition applicables à différents niveaux de revenu, ainsi que les règles spécifiques telles que le quotient familial, les réductions et crédits d'impôts, et toute autre considération fiscale pertinente. Ainsi, sans informations supplémentaires sur le contexte et la situation fiscale, il n'est pas possible de valider avec exactitude l'affirmation que \\"l'État français taxe 3700 euros sur les 7000\\".

Let's analyze the sequence from the third term: 3rd term: 3 (is there a pattern from the previous terms 1 and 2?) 4th term: 8 5th term: 27 6th term: 224 7th term: 6075 Let's see how we get from one term to the next using addition or multiplication. Since the sequence has large jumps in values, multiplication is likely involved. From 3 to 8: Considering multiplication and addition, it could be (2 * 3) + 2 = 8. From 8 to 27: It could be (3 * 8) + 3 = 27. From 27 to 224: It could be (4 * 27) + 32 = 224 (note the 32 instead of 4 if we are going with previous pattern). From 224 to 6075: This is more complex; using the pattern, it should be a multiplication followed by an addition. Given the stated pattern's inconsistency and the large jump to 6075, it appears this sequence does not follow simple multiplication and addition by an incrementing factor (as we initially suspected with the +2, +3). We cannot conclude a clear pattern based purely on the consecutive multiplication and addition of a sequentially increasing integer. Observing the numbers, another pattern might involve exponentiation or factorial due to the rapid increase, though this contradicts the provided information stating that only addition and multiplication are involved. However, since simple multiplication and addition do not create a discernible pattern from the given numbers, we could hypothesize other rules based on the positions of the elements while still using addition or multiplication. Here is an example hypothesis for a pattern: - For the 3rd term, it could be a multiplication by the term's position (2 * 1 * 3 = 6) plus the previous term (6 + 2 = 8). - For the 4th term, again, assume a multiplication by its position (3 * 8 * 2 = 48), then add the previous term (48 + 27 = 75), but this does not yield the correct result (the pattern must be different from this). Unfortunately, without a clearer rule or additional information about how the sequence was generated, the next three terms cannot be reliably calculated from the given sequence. The pattern is not obvious with only the operations of addition and multiplication involved between adjacent terms. Therefore, we would need either more terms to discern the pattern or additional rules that specify how the sequence was created."},{"prompt":"existiriam quantas revoltas da vacina no brasil?","completion":"A Revolta da Vacina é o nome dado a um movimento de oposição popular que ocorreu em novembro de 1904 na cidade do Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, contra a campanha de vacinação obrigatória instituída pelo governo de Rodrigues Alves para erradicar a varíola.

Diversos grupos sociais, incluindo a classe trabalhadora, militares de baixa patente, e setores da elite, reagiram ao que consideravam um ato autoritário e invasivo do governo, especialmente porque as equipes de saúde poderiam entrar nas casas para vacinar as pessoas à força. Em termos de \\"Revolta da Vacina\\", nos referimos especificamente a esse episódio de 1904. Não houve múltiplas \\"Revoltas da Vacina\\" na história brasileira, mas este evento único é amplamente estudado e considerado um exemplo de resistência popular contra políticas de saúde públicas consideradas opressivas na época. No entanto, ao longo da história, houve outras ocasiões em que as campanhas de vacinação enfrentaram resistência e desconfiança em diferentes níveis, mas esses eventos não são identificados ou reconhecidos como \\"Revolta da Vacina\\". A Revolta de 1904 se destaca pela sua intensidade e pelo impacto social e político que teve na época."},{"prompt":"quantos tiveram ao total? fale os principais","completion":"Quando falamos em \\"Revolta da Vacina\\", estamos nos referindo a um evento específico na história do Brasil: a revolta que ocorreu em novembro de 1904 na cidade do Rio de Janeiro. Não houve múltiplos eventos conhecidos como \\"Revolta da Vacina\\". A Revolta da Vacina de 1904 foi uma reação violenta da população contra medidas sanitaristas impostas pelo governo de Rodrigues Alves, sob a liderança do médico e sanitarista Oswaldo Cruz, diretor geral de Saúde Pública. A principal medida que desencadeou a revolta foi a lei da vacinação obrigatória contra a varíola. O povo carioca, já insatisfeito com outras reformas urbanas empreendidas pelo prefeito Pereira Passos, que resultaram em demolições de cortiços e remoção de populações pobres para áreas periféricas, viu na vacinação obrigatória uma violação de sua liberdade individual. Embora tenha sido um movimento único, a Revolta da Vacina foi um dos muitos eventos de resistência popular na história do Brasil. Outras revoltas e movimentos sociais notáveis que ocorreram ao longo dos séculos no Brasil incluem: 1. Inconfidência Mineira (1789): Movimento de elite que visava a independência da colônia portuguesa de Minas Gerais. 2. Revolta dos Malês (1835): Levante de escravos africanos muçulmanos na cidade de Salvador, Bahia. 3. Guerra dos Farrapos ou Revolução Farroupilha (1835-1845): Conflito entre rebeldes gaúchos e o governo imperial brasileiro. 4. Sabinada (1837-1838): Revolta ocorrida na Bahia com a proposta de criar uma república provisória até a maioridade do imperador. 5. Balaiada (1838-1841): Revolta popular e social no Maranhão, que incluiu escravos, camponeses e artesãos. 6. Revolução Praieira (1848-1849): Movimento em Pernambuco contra o centralismo imperial e por reformas sociais. 7. Revolta de Canudos (1896-1897): Confronto entre o Exército Brasileiro e os seguidores de Antônio Conselheiro no interior da Bahia. 8. Revolta da Chibata (1910): Revolta de marinheiros contra os castigos corporais na Marinha brasileira. 9. Revolução de 1930: Golpe que levou Getúlio Vargas ao poder, terminando com a República Velha. 10. Movimento Tenentista (1920s): Uma série de revoltas militares que buscavam reformas políticas e sociais no Brasil. Estas são apenas algumas das muitas revoltas e movimentos sociais do Brasil; cada um ocorreu em um contexto específico e com demandas próprias. A Revolta da Vacina se destaca entre eles pelo seu foco em questões de saúde pública e pelo impacto duradouro que teve nas políticas de vacinação no país."},{"prompt":"fale os principais movimentos brasileiros contra a vacinação","completion":"Embora a resistência à vacinação não seja um fenômeno novo, a Revolta da Vacina de 1904, como já mencionado, é o evento mais famoso e significativo na história brasileira que expressou oposição à imunização obrigatória em larga escala. Além desse episódio histórico, o Brasil, como outros países, teve e ainda enfrenta desafios com grupos ou indivíduos que são céticos ou resistentes à vacinação por diversos motivos. Aqui estão alguns movimentos ou períodos em que houve resistência à vacinação no Brasil: 1. Revolta da Vacina (1904): Iniciada no Rio de Janeiro, como uma resposta direta à campanha de vacinação obrigatória contra a varíola. 2. Movimentos contemporâneos contra vacinação: Na era moderna, embora não haja um movimento de resistência tão organizado ou violento quanto a Revolta da Vacina, existem grupos que se opõem à vacinação com base em desconfianças diversas, incluindo teorias de conspiração, preocupações com possíveis efeitos colaterais ou preferências por abordagens de saúde natural. Estes grupos geralmente se manifestam através de mídias sociais ou manifestações menores, e não têm o mesmo impacto que o episódio de 1904. 3. Resistência durante campanhas de vacinação de rotina e epidemias: Ao longo dos anos, tem havido relatos isolados de resistências locais a campanhas de vacinação em determinadas comunidades. Isso pode acontecer por razões culturais, religiosas ou de desconfiança nos órgãos de saúde. 4. Campanhas anti-vacinação durante a COVID-19: À semelhança do que aconteceu globalmente, o Brasil também enfrentou resistência à vacinação durante a pandemia de COVID-19. Algumas pessoas foram influenciadas por informações incorretas sobre a segurança e a eficácia das vacinas, bem como teorias da conspiração e desinformação disseminadas principalmente através da internet. É importante salientar que a resistência à vacinação no Brasil é minoritária e que as campanhas de vacinação geralmente recebem apoio considerável da população. O Programa Nacional de Imunizações (PNI) do Brasil é reconhecido mundialmente pelo seu sucesso na erradicação e controle de várias doenças imunopreveníveis através de campanhas de vacinação em larga escala. A cobertura vacinal no país ainda é alta para a maioria das vacinas recomendadas, apesar dos desafios enfrentados."},{"prompt":"como é o nome da lei criada após o nazismo e advindo das torturas médicas que ocorreram durante o nazismo que proibe uma pessoa de aceitar um tratamento quando ela não quer.","completion":"O documento que você está se referindo é o Código de Nuremberg, que foi estabelecido após os julgamentos de Nuremberg, logo após a Segunda Guerra Mundial.

Above her, the night sky was a canvas of twinkling stars, each one a distant world, a story untold. Mia, with her raven hair and curious eyes, had always felt a peculiar connection to these celestial bodies, a sense of belonging that eluded her in the day-to-day mundanity of her life. As she walked, the city's vibrant energy pulsed around her, a symphony of car horns, distant music, and the murmur of nightlife. Yet, amidst this cacophony, Mia's ears caught an anomaly – a whisper, soft and melodic, as if the stars themselves were speaking to her. She paused, her heart quickening. This wasn't the first time she had heard these whispers, but tonight they felt more insistent, more real. She looked around, searching for the source, but the busy street offered no answers, only the occasional curious glance from a passerby. Mia knew they wouldn't understand; after all, how could she explain that she heard voices from the stars? Turning her gaze skyward, Mia felt an indescribable pull, a calling that resonated deep within her soul. The stars, with their ancient light, seemed to beckon her, to guide her towards a destiny yet unseen. As the whisper grew louder, Mia felt both trepidation and an unyielding curiosity. What did the stars want from her? Why was she the only one who could hear their ethereal song? It was a mystery that Mia knew she had to unravel, a journey that would lead her into the hidden depths of Luminara and beyond. And so, under the watchful gaze of the starlit sky, Mia made a decision that would change her life forever. She would follow the whispers, follow the path laid out by the stars, and uncover the truth behind her strange connection to the cosmos. [Image Prompt: A college girl walking under the neon lights of a bustling city street at night, looking up at the stars.] Page 2: Mia's World Mia's life in Luminara had always been ordinary, or as ordinary as it could be in a city where the veil between the natural and the supernatural was as thin as spider silk. She lived in a modest apartment with her parents, who were loving but perpetually caught up in the daily grind of work and household responsibilities. Her father was a mechanic, a man of the earth and grease, who found solace in the tangible, the fixable. Her mother worked at a local bakery, her world one of flour and sugar, of early mornings and the warm aroma of freshly baked bread. At school, Mia was a shadow, drifting through the corridors with her head in the clouds, or more accurately, in the stars. Her classmates, absorbed in their own teenage dramas and aspirations, paid her little mind. Mia didn't mind the solitude; it gave her space to think, to dream. She was an average student, her grades a mix of Bs and Cs, her reports always the same: \\"Mia is a bright girl, but she needs to focus more on the present.\\" But how could she focus on algebra and history essays when her mind was filled with constellations and the mysteries of the universe? Mia's bedroom was a sanctuary, its walls adorned with posters of galaxies, nebulae, and star charts. It was here, in the quiet hours of the night, that Mia felt most at peace, her gaze fixed on the night sky through her small window, her mind wandering among the stars. Her fascination with astronomy had started when she was a little girl, her grandmother's stories of celestial beings and cosmic legends fueling her imagination. Mia's grandmother had been the only one who understood her, the only one who didn't dismiss her starry-eyed wonder as mere childish fancy. But she had passed away when Mia was ten, leaving her with a sense of loss that still lingered in the depths of her heart. Despite her love for the stars, Mia had always felt disconnected, a sense of yearning for something more, something profound. She longed to unravel the secrets of the universe, to understand her place in the grand scheme of things. Little did she know, her life was about to take a turn into the extraordinary, a journey that would bridge the gap between the earth and the stars, and reveal her true destiny. Page 3: The First Encounter Under the cloak of night, Mia’s newfound resolve led her away from the well-trodden paths of Luminara. She traversed the labyrinth of alleyways and side streets, chasing the whispers that beckoned her forward. The further she wandered, the more the familiar sights of her city transformed into a world both strange and beautiful, effused with an unfamiliar aura. The neon signs faded into shadowy corners, and the thrumming life of the city seemed to dim, as if yielding to a different kind of energy. It was here, in a narrow, forgotten alley bathed in the silver glow of moonlight, that Mia’s reality shifted irrevocably. Without warning, a gentle breeze tousled her hair, and she felt a presence – an otherworldly visitor cloaked in the radiance of the stars. Before her stood a spirit of light, its form shifting and undulating like the aurora borealis. Mia’s breath hitched in her throat, wonderstruck by the sight. For a long moment, they simply regarded each other – two beings from different worlds, yet inexplicably connected. The spirit’s form coalesced into something vaguely human, a figure both awe-inspiring and comforting. “You are not alone, Mia,” it spoke, its voice a celestial melody that soothed her fears. Its words seemed to bypass her ears, resonating directly within her soul. “You have been chosen, gifted with the Sight. The ability to see us, the starlight spirits, is one that has been silently woven into the threads of your being since birth.” Mia was speechless, her mind racing with questions and the unfathomable reality that she was conversing with a being of pure starlight. The spirit seemed to anticipate her trepidation, its luminescence ebbing and flowing like the tides pulled by the moon. “Fear not, for this is just the beginning of your journey,” it continued. “The connection you feel to the stars is a reflection of the light you carry within. You must learn to understand and harness this gift, for the balance between our worlds depends upon it.” “But why me?” Mia finally found her voice, her words barely above a whisper. “Because, Mia, you are born of the stars, as all are, but in you burns the essence of the ancients. You can bridge the divide, illuminate the shadows that threaten to engulf your world, and ours.” Before Mia could respond, the sound of footsteps approaching the alleyway broke the sanctity of the moment. The spirit’s form began to dissipate, urging her to flee, to protect the secret of its existence. “Seek the Guardians,” it said, fading away until it was nothing more than a wisp of light, “They will guide you. Trust in the stars, Mia.” With a final glance towards where the spirit had been, Mia turned and hurried back toward the main street. Her mind was ablaze with countless emotions – exhilaration, confusion, purpose. The whispers had led her to this moment, and there was no looking back. The alley gave way to the neon blaze she knew so well, but Mia felt changed. Her path, once obscured, now glimmered faintly with starlight. She wasn’t just Mia, the unnoticed girl who gazed up at the night sky; she was Mia, Seer of Spirits, chosen by the cosmos for a destiny greater than she had ever imagined. [Image Prompt: A glowing, translucent figure made of starlight, hovering in an alleyway.] Page 4: The Revelation Mia’s heart thundered against her ribs as she merged back into the river of city life, her senses heightened to the point of disbelief. The alleys behind her felt like a chasm she had leapt across, leaving her on the precipice of a world she had only ever dreamed about. The starlight spirit’s words echoed in her mind, reverberating with the promise of knowledge and purpose. She had to know more. The urge to understand her newfound ability, the Sight, propelled her onward, heading towards the one place she felt could offer some semblance of refuge—the public library of Luminara. It stood as a grand edifice, a haven for knowledge in the heart of the metropolis, its historical architecture a contrast to the city’s modern facade. The library was nearly empty at this late hour, the silence a welcome companion to Mia’s racing thoughts. Aisle after aisle of tomes lined the walls, the smell of ancient parchment and ink in the air. Her fingers skimmed across the spines of countless books on astronomy, mythology, and the arcane until her eyes caught a title that sent a shiver down her spine: “The Ethereal Spectres: A Compendium of the Otherworldly.” With trembling hands, she pulled the volume from its resting place and found herself a hidden corner in the dimly lit recesses of the library. The pages felt alive under her touch, their secrets pulsating with anticipation as she turned each one, consuming the words with a desperate hunger. Ancient tribes of starreaders, bridges between the corporeal and celestial, guardians of the unseen realms—the pieces began to click into place. Mia realized she wasn’t the first to hold the Sight. There were others, perhaps many eons before her, who had the same connection to the starlight spirits. What truly unsettled her was the notion of shadows, those who sought to sever the connection between the worlds for their own nefarious ends. It wasn’t just a gift; it was a responsibility—one that felt heavier with each word she read. As the library’s clock tower tolled a haunting melody, marking the late hour, Mia’s anxiety bloomed like a dark flower. The balance was mentioned time and again, the importance of light in keeping the darkness at bay. And then, in the margins of a well-thumbed page, a handwritten note caught her eye: “When the whispers grow loud, seek the Guardians. For only they can guide thee to the light or cast thee into darkness.” The revelation that she wasn’t alone in this—that there were others, Guardians, who could aid her—was both terrifying and exhilarating. Who were these Guardians? How would she find them? Was Alex, the name softly etched beside the note, a clue or merely the scribbles of a previous reader? As Mia pondered the path laid before her, the weight of secrecy pressed upon her chest. She could not share this with her family, her friends; the risk was too great. This journey, whatever it entailed, was hers and hers alone. Closing the book with care, Mia looked up into the shadows of the library, half-expecting a spirit to manifest from the darkness. She felt a strange blend of isolation and clarity. One thing was certain—her life would never be the same. A burgeoning resolve solidified within her: she would unravel the mystery, and in doing so, she would learn to wield the light she harbored inside, to face whatever lay ahead. Tucking the book under her arm, Mia exited the library, the early morning air crisp against her skin. The city of Luminara, now quiet in the dawn’s embrace, held new meaning for her. She was a part of something ancient, something crucial. The time had come to step out of the shadows and into the starlight. Page 5: The Mystery Begins As dawn cloaked Luminara in hues of orange and purple, Mia’s nocturnal encounter at the library felt like a world apart. The weight of the book under her arm was her only assurance that it hadn’t been a dream. She walked the streets absentmindedly, wrapped in thoughts about guardians and her newly bestowed Sight. The first hints of the city awakening rustled around her as she approached her neighborhood café, a place where she often found solace in a corner booth with a view of the bustling street. An order for a steaming cup of hot chocolate – her usual – never reached her lips as a sudden commotion across the room caught her attention. Patrons crowded by the café’s television, which flashed breaking news with bold letters screaming ‘MYSTERY ILLUMINATES LUMINARA’. Mia edged closer, her pulse quickening. The news reported an event that had occurred overnight, the very same hours in which Mia was being awakened to her gifts; a phenomenon that was difficult to describe, let alone explain, had rooted the city center in a trance. Beams of light, uncannily similar to the aura of her starlight visitant, had apparently danced across the skyline, visible from many parts of the city. The event left the people of Luminara bewildered, crafting theories from the scientific to the supernatural. Mia listened, heart skipping beats, as eyewitnesses described seeing ephemeral figures, radiant and sublime, much like the spirit she had met. The city was abuzz with talk of otherworldly interactions, and to Mia’s reserved horror and fascination, she realized she held a piece of this unfolding enigma. The news anchor shifted the discussion to speculations of alien encounters and government cover-ups, but Mia knew differently. She felt somehow responsible, as if her communion with the spirit had triggered this display, this crossing of worlds that was not supposed to be seen. Tucking the book more securely under her arm, Mia left her untouched hot chocolate and exited the café. The air was electric with speculation and wonder, a stark contrast to the secrets she harbored within. She needed to learn more, to understand the connection between her encounter and the city-wide phenomenon. Her next destination was clear; she had to return to the starlit alley where she met the spirit. Perhaps there were residual clues, something left behind that the discerning eye of a Seer could detect. Mia’s arrival was met with police tape and curious onlookers. The alley was now a point of interest, part of the greater anomaly that had captivated Luminara. A firm resolve coursed through her as she pushed past the throng, caution giving way to the urgency of her quest. Drawing on the esoteric words of the book, she reached out with her Sight, seeking traces amidst the mundane world. To her surprise, the alley glowed faintly with ethereal threads, tendrils of starlight visible only to her eyes. They weaved an intricate pattern along the ground and walls, remnants of an energy that lingered like the afterglow of supernovae. Mia knew that understanding these whispers of energy was key to unveiling the true nature of her calling. With every discovery, her place in the sprawling canvas of the cosmos was beginning to mark itself – a beacon of starlight, shrouded in the layers of shadows that her journey was just beginning to pierce. Page 6: New Allies As Mia focused on the luminous threads tracing through the alley, a gentle touch on her shoulder startled her back into the mundane world. She spun around to find herself staring into the deep, knowing eyes of a young man not much older than herself. His presence had been silent, an enigma, reminiscent of the whispering stars. “Can you see it too?” he asked, his voice a low murmur that only Mia could hear over the chatter of the crowd behind the police line. Mia hesitated, her instinct to protect her secret warring with the evident understanding in the stranger’s gaze. The young man offered a small, guarded smile and nodded toward the taped-off alley, a silent ally in her search for answers. “Yes,” Mia finally admitted, feeling a spark of connection. It seemed they shared the gift of seeing the unseen – an ally in this world balancing on the knife-edge between known and unknown. The young man introduced himself as Alex, the name striking a chord within Mia. Alex – the name scrawled in the margin of the mysterious book. Coincidence, or was this part of her destined path? What she did know was that Alex had an air of one who didn’t just believe in the extraordinary but embraced it. “You’re not like them,” Alex said, gesturing subtly to the gathering crowd. “You’re a Seer, aren’t you?” Mia’s eyes widened, not from fear, but from the rush of being truly seen for the first time. Alex’s understanding offered her a sanctuary, the possibility of no longer shouldering her secret alone. They moved away from the scene, seeking the quiet of a nearby park, whose trees whispered softly in the early morning breeze. With the murmurs of the city a distant backdrop, Alex shared his story. Like Mia, the night had called to him, but not with a whisper – his was a shout that beckoned him to witness the extraordinary light show. His search for knowledge led him to the library, to the very book Mia now carried, to find that someone had beaten him to it. Listening to Alex, Mia felt the isolation she had carried for so long begin to crumble. Here was someone who understood the strange and wonderful turn her life had taken. More than that, Alex possessed pieces of the puzzle that connected to her own. He spoke of the Guardians, of the delicate balance between their world and the realm of the starlight spirits. Together, they mulled over the handwritten note and what their rendezvous might mean. As they talked, an unspoken bond formed between them, a fellowship defined by shared purpose and the stirrings of trust. Mia found a comfort in Alex’s presence that she never knew she needed. Here was an ally, perhaps even a friend, who stood with her on the threshold of destiny. The revelation was profound, not just for the sense of partnership it brought, but for the realization that there were more guardians like Alex—a group, a haven, for people like her. The path she had to walk bloomed with the potential of camaraderie, and the loneliness that had dogged her steps dissolved into the warming light of new possibilities. Breathless with the weight of their shared understanding and the unwavering gaze of the open sky above, Mia felt propelled forward by an invisible hand, her journey entwined with Alex’s, and the mystery that beckoned them both deeper into the shadows of starlight. Page 7: Training Begins Mia and Alex left the cover of the trees, feeling a renewed sense of urgency in the light of the morning sun. The earlier confusion that had clouded Mia’s mind gave way to a resolution sharpened by their alliance. They recognized the path that lay ahead would not be easy, but together, they felt empowered to face whatever challenges the starlight spirits would unveil. Alex explained that he belonged to a small group who called themselves the Seekers—a collective of individuals with the Sight. They trained in secret, honing their abilities to communicate and interact with the starlight spirits and understand the deep lore of their connection to the stars. For generations, the Seekers had been the true Guardians, a lineage protecting the balance between the terrestrial and celestial—a balance now seemingly at risk. Intrigue replaced apprehension as Mia listened. She was ready to learn, to transform her incipient skills into tangible strength. The Seekers, Alex assured her, would aid her in harnessing her Sight, not just for her own enlightenment but for the preservation of the light that safeguarded both realms. They formulated a plan. The Seekers met at a covert location just outside the city limits, a place sitting beneath the open gaze of the stars. This would become Mia’s classroom, her temple, where she would learn to interpret the whispers of the cosmos under the tutelage of the Seekers. The journey to the Seekers’ sanctum was a brief one, but with every step, Mia felt as though she were moving further from her old life. Arriving at the hidden retreat—an old observatory nestled among the hills—they were greeted by the sight of ancient stone and groves of trees stretching upward, joining the heavens in stately vigil. The observatory was both majestic and serene, the perfect crossroads of earth-bound curiosity and celestial wonder. Mia marveled at the crumbling columns and the patina of age that adorned the domed structure. The air resounded with a subtle hum that she felt more than heard, a vibration that soothed her restless spirit. Within the weathered walls of the observatory, Mia met the rest of the Seekers. Each one offered a knowing nod or a smile of welcome, their eyes reflecting the same starry sheen that had marked Alex’s. These were individuals of all ages and backgrounds, bound together by their Sight and their solemn oath to use it for the greater good. Under the guidance of the Seekers, Mia underwent her first lesson. It wasn’t training of the body but of the mind and soul. She learned to calm her inner turbulence, to let the whispers of the universe find a home within her. She practiced extending her consciousness toward the starlight, allowing it to fill her senses and guide her intuition.","completion":"[Image Prompt: A young woman stands outside an old observatory nestled in the hills, beneath a starry sky, surrounded by a diverse group of individuals with knowing expressions, as they begin their mystical training in harnessing celestial powers.]"},{"prompt":"In 1000 words and with reference to this link when necessary, focussing specifically on algorithic bias and synonymous topics \\" https://www.scu.edu/ethics-spotlight/generative-ai-ethics/a-moral-panic-chatgpt-and-the-gamification-of-education/ \\" please professionally and eloquently alongside utilising impressive grammar, answer the following question in as much detail as possible with harvard references and a referencing section whilst also ensuring that the answer is abundant in detail, is as comprehensive as possible and demonstrates extensive research whilst being as well structured, in depth and insightful a discussion as possible: You are a computer graduate about to start a job with an AI company involved in the development and deployment of AI applications (like Chat GPT) for use by students. As a recent student yourself, give a unique perspective (with personal insights and anecdotes) supported by academic references to discuss the ethical considerations needed to be reflected on by the developers during this job.","completion":"The ethical dimensions of generative AI applications, especially within educational settings, have gained significant attention. As a computer science graduate venturing into the AI industry and cognizant of my recent experiences as a student, I bring a unique perspective to the discussion around the ethical deployment of AI tools such as ChatGPT. My contemplation on AI development is informed by scholarly work and personal observations, acknowledging that the algorithms we create can critically shape educational experiences and outcomes. Algorithmic bias is a salient concern in the realm of AI ethics (Benjamin, 2019). AI tools are often vaunted for their objectivity, yet they are inherently subject to the biases embedded in their training data and the perspectives of their creators. The challenge of impartiality in AI algorithms demands continuous scrutiny, particularly in their application to diverse student populations. As developers, we must acknowledge that machine learning models, including those powering AI text generation, reflect historical patterns and incumbent social hierarchies within their datasets. Noble’s (2018) research on algorithms of oppression reveals how search algorithms can perpetuate stereotypes and marginalize certain groups. Differential performance across demographics is not just a computational challenge; it has profound implications for equity in education (O’Neil, 2016). For example, an AI-driven language model may generate text that inadvertently encodes gender or racial biases, thus impacting students who identify with those groups. Engagement with the history and current applications of AI in education reveals a tapestry of ethical considerations. Where generative AI can indeed stimulate learning and foster educational efficiency, it also poses risks related to intellectual property, cheating, and the depersonalization of learning (Watters, 2021). The playful, gamified interaction with generative AI, while engaging, must not eclipse the crafting of critical thought or the development of authentic intellect. Developer reflexivity is critical in this landscape. We must contemplate algorithms not just as neutral code, but as ‘opinion in algorithmic guise’ (Selbst et al., 2019). Implementing fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI systems becomes central to this reflexivity. Addressing potential biases through diverse data sets, mitigating discriminatory outcomes, and ensuring inclusion of marginalized voices in the development process are paramount actions (D'Ignazio & Klein, 2020). Conceiving a recent personal incident, I attended a seminar where an AI tool was used to mediate a brainstorming session. The disparity in suggestiveness for varying cultural contexts illuminated the AI’s circumscribed understanding of non-Western pedagogy. This anecdote exemplifies the need for careful tailoring and testing of AI applications in education to ensure cultural sensitivity and relevance. As a developer, I advocate for active involvement in the educational ecosystems where our AI tools will be deployed. This calls for a feedback loop between developers, educators, and students to refine and align AI applications with pedagogical objectives (Holstein et al., 2019). Participatory design processes, where stakeholders co-create AI systems, supports ethical considerations in a practical, grounded manner (Shneiderman, 2020). Another ethical facet is protecting student privacy and data. AI applications, with their extensive data requirements, could potentially exploit student information, thus contravening data protection norms and ethical standards (Tsai et al., 2020). The right to privacy should be stoutly defended, accommodating regulatory frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. From an anecdotal standpoint, classmates of mine voiced concerns over digital footprints left by their use of educational AI tools, distrusting the opaque usage and stewardship of their data. This requires developers to foster trust through transparent practices and robust cyber-security measures, ensuring that students and educators consent to data usage and understand the ramifications of their engagement with AI technologies (Crawford & Calo, 2016). Moreover, considering AI's potential to revolutionize assessments and feedback could challenge traditional notions of academic integrity. The advent of sophistical, AI-driven plagiarism presents a moral conundrum both for students and developers (Johnson & Verdicchio, 2017). As developers, it behooves us to anticipate and construct measures curtailing academic dishonesty while still allowing AI’s positive educational applications to flourish. Addressing these ethical considerations requires multidisciplinary effort. The robustness, fairness, and inclusivity of AI in education need a chorus of voices from computer science, social sciences, philosophy, legal studies, and education sectors. Implementing ethics by design and ethical impact assessments (EIA) for AI systems can further ingrain reflexivity into our development processes. In conclusion, as an AI developer entering a field where my creations will impact the landscape of education, a field to which I owe much of my personal development, I remain acutely aware of the ethical imperatives that accompany this responsibility. The algorithmic biases, cultural sensitivities, data privacy concerns, and challenges to academic integrity must be met with thoughtful, informed, and inclusive strategies. The pursuit of ethically responsible AI in education is both a technical and a moral quest. References: - Benjamin, R. (2019). Race after technology: Abolitionist tools for the new jim code.

The prompt should be descriptive and imaginative to let the AI generate the best possible image. Here's an example prompt that you could use: \\"Create a high-resolution, digital painting of an enchanted forest at twilight, with a crystal-clear river reflecting the vibrant colors of the setting sun. The forest is teeming with whimsical creatures, such as fairies with translucent wings, glowing fireflies, and mythical deer with antlers that look like intertwined tree branches. A narrow, cobblestone path winds through the forest, leading to an ornate, ivy-covered stone bridge. Include a magical ambiance with ethereal fog and subtle light particles that give a sense of depth and wonder. The style should combine elements of classical fantasy with a touch of modern surrealism.\\" Feel free to tailor the prompt to your specific needs or preference in art style, setting, and level of detail."},{"prompt":"I need to show a boy and woman in the same tshirt, so gen a prompt in one line","completion":"\\"Generate an image of a young boy and a woman smiling and wearing matching teal t-shirts with a cartoon sun emblem on the front, standing side by side in a sunlit park.\\""},{"prompt":"not matching tshirts, but literally wearing one giant tshirt","completion":"\\"Create an image of a boy and a woman playfully fitting together inside one oversized t-shirt with a quirky galaxy print, laughing as they navigate who puts which arm through the sleeves, against a white backdrop for contrast.\\""},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Hindi Comedy-Drama TV Serial that includes the following sequence of events: * A woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she's a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching the door of her family's house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key.

There's a warm sensation of home, with the lingering aroma of masala tea and fresh poha. Family photos adorn the walls, and from upstairs we hear gentle snores indicating someone is taking a nap. **EXT. SHARMA FAMILY HOUSE - DAYTIME** Cut to PRIYA, a 21-year-old college student in cropped khaki trousers and a colorful kurti. Her hair is tied in a messy bun, a few strands tickling her flushed cheeks. Clutching her belly, she scuttles towards the front door, each step growing more desperate. A tinge of pain contorts her face. **PRIYA** (under her breath) Aaj toh godhuli bela mein hi yeh mahabharat shuru ho gayi. (This epic battle in my belly started at dusk.) She fumbles in her bag for the keys, panic rising within her, only to realize they’re missing. **PRIYA** (matlabi whisper) Nahi! Aaj nahi! (Not today!) Furious knocking ensues. She fidgets, dances almost, the classic 'loo dance’ of the extremely desperate. **INT. SHARMA FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** The snores cease. DISHA, Priya's mother, mid-40s with a motherly warmth, appears in a simple cotton saree, hair slightly tousled from sleep. She saunters towards the door, rubbing her eyes, a bit disoriented. **DISHA** (voice groggy) Kaun hai? Bina taali bajaye kiski aatma tadap rahi hai? (Who’s it without a doorbell ringing? Which spirit is in such turmoil?) **EXT. SHARMA FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** Priya leans on the door frame, her face scrunched in discomfort. **PRIYA** (explosively) Maa, darwaza kholo! Jaldi! (Mom, open the door! Quick!) Disha fumbles with the latch, her movements sluggish, while Priya clenches her fists, implore her to hurry, but stops, the reason for her urgency unspoken. The door finally opens, and Priya lunges forward. But Disha, out of concern and confusion, grasps Priya’s arms, blocking her. **DISHA** (concerned) Kya hua? Tu theek to hai na? (What happened? Are you alright?) **PRIYA** (pleading) Bas side ho ja, Maa! Please! (Just move aside, Mom! Please!) At the brink of eruption, Priya tries to wriggle free, but in the scuffle, Disha presses firmly against Priya's stomach. **PRIYA** (angrily groaning) Aah! Nahi, Maa! An audible and calamitous release. Priya stands shell-shocked, her face a picture of both mortification and involuntary bliss. **DISHA** (baffled) Kya hua? Priya, tu theek hai? (What's wrong? Priya, are you okay?) Priya's eyes widen in horror, emanating soft grunts of realization. **PRIYA** (strained whisper) Hai... Ram, yeh... maha... relief! (Oh... Lord, this... great... relief!) Disha watches, befuddled as Priya, still surrendering to her body's plight, murmurs the impending olfactory doom. **PRIYA** (half-embarrassed) Maaf karo... Antim prahar aane wala hai. (Forgive me... The final hour is upon us.) Disha's nose wrinkles in suspicion, and suddenly, she recoils as the smell hits her. Her reaction is as though she’s encountered an invisible, pungent wall. **DISHA** (disgusted surprise) Yeh kya badboo hai? (What's this stench?) A silent beat. Priya stands defeated, the awkwardness of the situation sinking in. **DISHA** (shocked) Tune... Tune abhi... (Did you just...) Priya averts her gaze, trying to waddle past. **PRIYA** (muttering) Please, Maa, hatta do. Mujhe andar jaana hai. (Mom, please move. I need to go inside.) Disha steps aside, a mix of revulsion and disbelief. Priya gingerly cups the seat of her trousers as she meanders in. **DISHA** (scorning) Kitna ganda kaam kiya hai tune! (What a dirty thing you’ve done!) Priya retorts with a pout. **PRIYA** (playful indignation) Tumne rasta roka, tumne dabaya. Galti tumhari hai, Maa. (You blocked the way, you pressed. It's your fault, Mom.) Disha scoffs. **DISHA** (belittling) Tumhari umar mein yeh koi bahana nahi hota. Aur itna aanand se kyun poora ka poora mahaul kharab kiya? (This is no excuse for someone your age. And why did you ruin the entire atmosphere with such delight?) Priya, hears the mocking taunting, but insists. **PRIYA** (defensively) Bohot zarurat thi, Maa. Tumne aisa kar diya, toh... (I was desperate, Mom. Because you did that, so...) She hesitantly pats her trousers, grimacing playfully. **PRIYA** (reluctantly) Haan, mana maza aaya... Lekin ab mujhe nahana chahiye. (Yes, it felt good... But now I need to shower.) Disha, mockingly inquisitive, halts Priya, wanting a closer examination. **DISHA** (mockery) Dikhao toh sahi, kitna bada kand kiya hai tune apni pants mein! (Show me, what a big mess you've made in your pants!) The playful squabble continues as Priya reluctantly turns around. The bulge in her pants, visible and comical. Disha's teasing is direct and merciless. **PRIYA** (awkward) Maa, please! Sach kahu toh, yeh wet feeling bilkul bhi achi nahi hai. (Mom, honestly, this wet feeling isn't nice at all.) Disha leans in closer, her dramatic reaction heightening the comedic moment as she pinches her nose. **DISHA** (sniffing) Haan, bilkul jaana chahiye, bahut badbughaar ho gayi ho tum. (Yes, you should definitely go. You've become very stinky.) Priya nods at the mocking remonstrance, a shy smile creeps in. **PRIYA** (chuckling) Sahi kaha. Lekin iski zimmedari bhi toh... (True. But the responsibility for this...) Disha cuts her off, ushers her towards the bathroom with a measure of sympathy mixed with continuing amusement. **DISHA** (ruffling her nose) Bas, bas! Jaao, clean karo. Hum yahaan hawa saaf karte hain. (Enough, enough! Go clean yourself up. I'll freshen up the air here.) Priya waddles off with a comical stiff-legged gait, while Disha remains, sniffing the air and then dousing the area with room freshener, her face displaying a humorous blend of disgust and motherly affection. **FADE OUT.**"},{"prompt":"Who was the Democratic nominee in the 1972 US Presidential election?","completion":"The Democratic nominee in the 1972 US Presidential election was Senator George McGovern from South Dakota.

Outside, SUMAYA, a 20-something Arab-American college student, rushes up the walkway—her movement is harried, her almond eyes wide with distress. She wears a loose blouse, patterned harem pants, and a pained expression. Her curly dark hair is pulled into a messy bun, strands framing a face increasingly etched with desperation. **EXT. HOUSE DOOR - CONTINUOUS** Sumaya all but throws herself against her family's front door. She paws through her bag, the desperation morphing into panic when she comes up empty—no keys. She avoids even the slightest jarring movement while frantically knocking. **SUMAYA:** *Come on, come on...* **INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME** SAMIYA, Sumaya’s mom—a woman in her early fifties with greying hair and gentle features—jolts from the couch, rubbing sleep from her eyes. She wears a comfortable, faded blue kaftan, a sure sign of her prior nap. **SAMIYA:** *(yawning)* Who's there? **EXT. HOUSE DOOR - CONTINUOUS** Sumaya hazards a whispered curse, then leans in closer to the door. **SUMAYA:** Mom, it's me, Sumaya! Please open up. **INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME** Samiya stumbles groggily to the door, muttering to herself. **SAMIYA:** *(mumbling)* What's all the fuss about... **EXT. HOUSE DOOR - SAME** The door opens a crack; Samiya squints suspiciously at her daughter. **SUMAYA:** *(flushed, urgent)* Move, Mom, please! **INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS** In one fluid motion, Samiya pulls Sumaya in, the concern creasing her brow matching the severity of Sumaya's squirm. **SAMIYA:** *(concerned)* Habibti, what's wrong? You look... Her hands grip Sumaya's shoulders firmly as she examines her. **SUMAYA:** *(stammering)* I need to get—let go, okay? **SAMIYA:** But— In her effort to disentangle, Sumaya's movements press her midsection right into Samiya’s probing hands. **SUMAYA:** *(groaning, alarmed, whispered)* Oh no, no, no... **SAMIYA:** Sumaya! What on earth is going— Sumaya, immobilized and grimacing, lets out a soft moan of relief that morphs into a symphony of discomfort and satisfaction. **SAMIYA:** *(befuddled)* Are you okay? You look... Did you— Sumaya interrupts in a strained whisper, barely able to string words together. **SUMAYA:** *(strained)* I'm... fine. Just... there's gonna be... smell. **INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS** Samiya's nose twitches. She sniffs once, twice, then rears back, clamping a hand over her nose. **SAMIYA:** *(disgusted bewilderment)* Did you just... in your pants? The stench now fills the air like a living thing, assertive and rude. **SUMAYA:** *(feeble evasion)* Can I just... inside? Now? Sumaya tries to move but Samiya is rooted in shock, her hand still over her nose, her other arm wavering between helping Sumaya and staying clear of the... situation. **SUMAYA:** *(gingerly waddling)* Let me go, Mom... **SAMIYA:** *(recoiling)* You—How could you? Yasalam! **SUMAYA:** *(sheepish indignation)* Mom, not so loud! **SAMIYA:** *(tauntingly scolding)* A grown woman messing her pants—and what a mess! Sumaya gestures to Samiya’s grip as she attempts to shuffle towards the bathroom, maintaining some semblance of dignity. **SUMAYA:** *(playful sulk)* It's your obstructive love hug. It triggered it... seriously. **SAMIYA:** *(incredulous)* That's no excuse for... enjoying the aftermath that much! **SUMAYA:** *(defensive)* I wasn't enjoying it—sheesh, pressing on my belly like a whoopee cushion! Samiya shakes her head in utter disbelief, still scolding, still holding her nose. **SAMIYA:** *(disbelief)* Filmy, you stayed there and... finished! **SUMAYA:** *(sincerity with a wince)* I had to go, Mom! And... how do I put it... the release, despite the grossness—it felt... needed. Gotta clean up now. Samiya’s astonishment overcomes her, and she forces Sumaya to turn around, inspecting her rear in fascination and repulsion. **SAMIYA:** *(mocking scrutiny)* Look at that... It's like a poop piñata back here. **SUMAYA:** *(coyly bickering)* Okay, that's really enough. Let me... Samiya sniffs mockingly at the air again, then pushes at her daughter’s back. **SAMIYA:** *(taunting agreement)* Yes, go, it's nasab (disgraceful). You stink! Sumaya grimaces and nods, more at the reek than the mockery. **SUMAYA:** *(admitting)* Yeah, it's vile... You sorta co-authored this disaster, anyway. **SAMIYA:** *(cringing usher)* Just go clean yourself, ya filthy. Sumaya resigns to the walk of shame, waddling her way towards the much-craved refuge of the bathroom. Behind her, Samiya waves a hand in front of her face. **SAMIYA:** *(calling out)* We are never speaking of this again! **SUMAYA:** *(over her shoulder, half-joking)* Agreed! This never happened!

FAMILY HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY** LEILA, an Arab-American college student, mid-20s with curly hair tied in a high ponytail and wearing loose cotton pants and an oversized sweatshirt, hustles up the front walk of her family’s home. Her brisk walk is occasionally punctuated by a pained grimace and squirming motions, signaling a desperate urge to use the bathroom. She arrives at the door and fumbles through her bag for the keys. A flash of panic crosses her face as she rummages deeper, throwing out her wallet, a pack of gum, and a calculus textbook. Her discomfort is palpable. Frantically, she starts *knocking* on the door, harder and more urgently with each moment that passes. **LEILA** *(mutters to herself)* Come on, come on. Somebody be home... A voice from the other side becomes audible. It's HALA, Leila’s mom, in her early 50s, with dark, shoulder-length hair showing signs of gray. She is beautiful despite the look of drowsiness and the disheveled pajamas clinging to her frame. **HALA** *(groggy, from inside)* Who's there? What’s happening? **LEILA** *(shifting from foot to foot)* Mom, it's me, Leila! HALA *fumbles* with the door lock, her movements slow and weighed down by sleep. LEILA clenches her jaw and hops from one foot to the other, her face contorted with urgency. **LEILA** *(imploring)* Please, mom, hurry up! The door finally swings open, revealing HALA, her concern growing at LEILA’s agitated state. She steps forward instinctively to intercept LEILA. **HALA** *(concerned)* Leila! What’s wrong? Why such a rush? LEILA attempts to dart around HALA, but HALA responds by gripping her daughter's arm firmly, halting her progress. **LEILA** *(desperate)* Mom, please! Just let me in. I have to go— Before she can finish, HALA's grip tightens and inadvertently presses against LEILA's stomach. LEILA groans, her body tensing in a battle between overwhelming relief and undeniable shock, her features are contorting into an uncomfortable mix of satisfaction and distress. **LEILA** *(compressed, strained)* Oooh... **HALA** *(puzzled)* Leila, what’s going on? Are you okay? LEILA freezes, unable to move as she continues to relieve herself. Her vocal responses are strained and vaguely content, punctuated by soft, gratified grunts. **LEILA** *(strained whisper)* I’m... okay now... W-warn you... smell... HALA watches, perplexed, as the reality of the scent dawning upon her is compounded by a noise. Sniffing the air, a bouquet of reactions dances across her visage—confusion, realization, then revulsion. **HALA** *(putting together the pieces)* Leila, did you just—Oh no! LEILA fidgets, avoiding eye contact. **LEILA** *(deflecting)* Can I just go inside? HALA steps aside, still trying to wrap her mind around the absurdity while waving her hand in front of her nose. LEILA inch by inch shuffles past HALA, cradling the bulging back of her pants, her walk reminiscent of a guilty toddler. HALA *(disbelieving laughter)* Can't believe you! Pooping your pants at your age! **LEILA** *(defending herself indignantly)* Hey! It’s not my fault. You blocked me and squeezed my stomach! **HALA** *(scoffing)* That's no excuse! You stood there and finished... like... you enjoyed making a big, stinky mess. LEILA, now wearing a faux pout, insists as she pokes the back of her pants gingerly. **LEILA** I had to go bad—your fault! It did feel good to let go, even if... But I need to clean up.

Looks like you have a diaper back there. LEILA protests weakly. **LEILA** Stop, Mom. It feels disgusting. I need to clean up! HALA leans in, grimacing as she acknowledges. **HALA** You're right; you stink. You definitely need a shower. LEILA nods, her face contorting with her own growing awareness of the smell. **LEILA** Yeah... bask in it since it’s thanks to you! Now let me go. Please! HALA, still cringing, motions her towards the bathroom. **HALA** Go, go, before the house smells like a zoo. LEILA shuffles off, shooting HALA a playful glare before disappearing around the corner.

SOUTH KOREAN FAMILY HOME - DAY A cheery residential street punctuates a typical afternoon in a tranquil South Korean neighborhood. Dapples of sunlight flirt with the fluttering leaves, crafting a dance of shadows on the pavement. CUT to HEAD-ON CLOSE-UP of the fast-paced, athletic sneakers of MINA HONG, a 22-year-old college student with an eclectic sense of style. Her cropped cargo pants follow the rhythm of her urgent stride. A lightweight, brightly colored windbreaker moves with the beat of her brisk walk. Mina is striking, with a bob cut framing her anxious expression. Beads of sweat glisten on her forehead - not from the sun, but panic. MINA HONG (breathing heavily) (whispering to herself) Almost there, almost there... Mina reaches the door of her family home, her juggling hands search frantically for keys in her messenger bag. Her fingers are a symphony of desperation before coming to an abrupt halt. CUT TO Minas's perspective, her hands are empty. No keys. MINA HONG (a desperate mutter) Aniya... where are they? She pounds on the door, rhythmic yet frantic. CUT TO an overhead shot emphasizing Mina's isolation. MINA HONG (hollering) Omma! OMMA! INT. FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS Inside, the cozy hallways hint at a home well-lived in. Family pictures align the walls, with soft afternoon light filtering through translucent curtains. A voice, muffled by the barrier, calls back with the groggy annoyance of the disturbed. YOUNG-HEE HONG (O.S.) (seemingly irritated) Mwoya? Mina, is that you? The voice belongs to YOUNG-HEE HONG, an elegant, if not slightly disheveled, woman in her early fifties. Plush slippers shuffle across the wood as she makes for the door. A silk robe hangs loosely around her. Back to Mina, who is dancing a precarious ballet to stave off catastrophe. MINA HONG (grimaces) Yes, Omma! Quickly, please! CUT back to Young-Hee. She fumbles with the series of locks more from a nap-induced daze than true difficulty. YOUNG-HEE HONG (grumbling) Aigoo, this child... CLICK. The door swings open.

She makes a timid move forward, clutching the back of her pants, but maintaining some semblance of dignity. YOUNG-HEE HONG (reluctantly stepping aside) Ya, this... go, quick! Mina passes by Young-Hee who, recovering from the initial shock, finds her voice laden with a mix of maternal annoyance and disbelief. YOUNG-HEE HONG (reprimanding) Jinjja, Mina! You are a grown woman, and you... in your pants? Chaeso! Mina turns back slightly, her cheeks burn with embarrassment yet spiced with a hint of rebellion. MINA HONG (mutters playfully sulking) Geudae ttaemune... If someone hadn't squeezed my stomach... YOUNG-HEE HONG (incredulous laughter) My fault? There are bathrooms everywhere. And you finished it here, like a toddler? Mina, now growing more comfortable, albeit aware of the unpleasant reality, cocks her head to one side. MINA HONG (somewhat brazenly) It had to be done, thanks to you! Now, I really ought to... She reaches back gingerly to appraise the situation, then winces comically. MINA HONG (smiling wryly) Although, there is something to be said for relief. YOUNG-HEE, with a smirk of her own, blocks MINA's path to the washroom. YOUNG-HEE HONG (eyeing Mina’s backside) Look at you... roaming around with all that... in your pants. MINA casts her eyes downward and protests. MINA HONG (faux indignation) Can I just go clean up? YOUNG-HEE, upon a closer whiff, recoils with a hand gesture, indicating that she's tasted the air with her nose. YOUNG-HEE HONG (holding her nose) Surely you must, because it's truly terrible. MINA shrugs, acknowledging the veracity but with playful retort in her voice. MINA HONG (fanning herself theatrically) Haha, enjoy it, Omma. You helped paint this masterpiece. YOUNG-HEE guides her gently but firmly towards the washroom, making an exaggerated face. YOUNG-HEE HONG (pointing) Go! And don't come out until you’re human again!

Уравнение состояния. Понятие идеального газа. Газовые законы. Отдельные термодинамические параметры связаны друг с другом. Функциональная зависимость, показывающая связь между отдельными 48 микроскопическим параметрами, называется уравнением состояния. Точный вид уравнения состояния известен только для идеального газа. Идеальный газ — это идеализированный газ, у которого: 1) размерами и формой молекул пренебрегают; 2) считают, что отсутствуют силы межмолекулярного взаимодействия; З) соударение молекул рассматривают как соударение упругих шаров. Уравнением состояния идеального газа является уравнение Менделеева— Клайперона: 𝑝𝑉 = 𝑣𝑅𝑇, (1) где 𝑣 = 𝑚 𝑀 (2) v - количество вещества � кг моль� , R = 8,31 Дж моль∙К -универсальная газовая постоянная. Уравнение (1) было получено Клайпероном как обобщение экспериментальных газовых законов. Атмосферные газы при обычных условиях удовлетворяют уравнению Клайперона. Но при повышенных давлениях и низких температурах это уравнение дает погрешности. Это уравнение не применимо для водяного пара и тяжелых углеводородов.

Средняя длина свободного пробега, эффективный диаметр молекул Явления переноса протекают медленно, несмотря на то, что все они происходят благодаря быстрому движению молекул. Свободному движению молекул препятствуют их взаимные столкновения. Молекулы газа, находясь в тепловом движении, непрерывно сталкиваются друг с другом. Под столкновением молекул подразумевается процесс взаимодействия между молекулами, в результате которого молекулы изменяют направление своего движения. Столкновения молекул представляют как раз тот механизм, который приводит систему в равновесное состояние. В идеальном газе эти столкновения происходят только между двумя молекулами, а одновременными столкновениями между тремя и большим числом молекул можно пренебречь. 51 Расстояние, которое проходит молекула между двумя последовательными столкновениями, называется длиной свободного пробега молекулы. Так как молекул в газе чрезвычайно много, то вводят понятие средней длины свободного пробега молекул. Средней длиной свободного пробега молекул 𝜆 называется среднее расстояние, которое молекула проходит без столкновений. При столкновении молекулы сближаются до некоторого наименьшего расстояния, которое условно считается суммой радиусов взаимодействующих молекул. Молекулы в этом случае можно представить как упругие сферы диаметрами d1 и d2. Столкновение между молекулами может произойти только в том случае, если их центры сблизятся на расстояние, меньшее или равное диаметру d, и столкновение произойдет только в том случае, если центр молекулы окажется внутри круга, имеющего площадь: σ = πd2 . Величина σ называется сечением рассеяния, или эффективным сечением, где d — эффективный диаметр молекулы. Эффективный диаметр молекулы — это минимальное расстояние, на которое сближаются центры двух молекул при столкновении. Число столкновений, испытываемых молекулой в единицу времени, может быть различным. Поэтому следует говорить о среднем значении этой величины. Средняя длина свободного пробега 𝜆 и среднее число столкновений в единицу времени 𝑧 являются главными характеристиками процесса столкновений газовых молекул. Эти величины связаны между собой: 𝜆 = 𝑣 𝑧 , где 𝑣— средняя арифметическая скорость. Можно показать, что 𝑧 = √2𝜋𝑑2𝑛𝑣. Для простоты будем считать, что все молекулы, кроме рассматриваемой, неподвижны. Молекула испытает соударение с теми молекулами, которые располагаются от линии перемещения центра молекулы на расстоянии, меньшем, чем d. За время 1 с молекула пройдет по коленчатому цилиндру, объем которого: πd2 𝑣. Тогда число ударов в единицу времени: πd2 n 𝑣 . Тогда 𝜆 = 𝑣 𝑧 = 1 𝜋𝑑2 𝑛 Однако окружающие молекулы также движутся, поэтому в формулу для нахождения числа соударений z должна входить не абсолютная относительно стенок скорость, а относительная скорость: vотн = √2𝑣. Следовательно: Рис. 45 52 𝜆 = 1 √2𝜋𝑑2𝑛 .

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the nastiness of the sensation of the voluminous deposit in her pants, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs close to the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"INT.

For those that don’t know, a human is a real bipedal lifeform of mid-range intelligence, living a largely deluded existence on a small water-logged planet in a very lonely corner of the universe. For the rest of you, and those who sent me, humans are in many respects exactly as strange as you would expect them to be. Certainly it is true that on a first sighting you would be appalled by their physical appearance. Their faces alone contain all manner of hideous curiosities. A protuberant central nose, thin-skinned lips, primitive external auditory organs known as ‘ears’, tiny eyes and unfathomably pointless eyebrows. All of which take a long time to mentally absorb and accept. The manners and social customs too are a baffling enigma at first. Their conversation topics are very rarely the things they want to be talking about, and I could write ninety-seven books on body shame and clothing etiquette before you would get even close to understanding them. Oh, and let’s not forget The Things They Do To Make Themselves Happy That Actually Make Them Miserable. This is an infinite list. It includes – shopping, watching TV, taking the better job, getting the bigger house, writing a semi-autobiographical novel, educating their young, making their skin look mildly less old, and harbouring a vague desire to believe there might be a meaning to it all. Yes, it is all very amusing, in a painful kind of way. But I have discovered human poetry while on Earth. One of these poets, the very best one (her name was Emily Dickinson), said this: ‘I dwell in possibility.’ So let us humour ourselves and do the same. Let us open our minds entirely, for what you are about to read will need every prejudice you may have to stand aside in the name of understanding. of understanding. And let us consider this: what if there actually is a meaning to human life? And what if – humour me – life on Earth is something not just to fear and ridicule but also cherish? What then? Some of you may know what I have done by now, but none of you know the reason. This document, this guide, this account – call it what you will – will make everything clear. I plead with you to read this book with an open mind, and to work out for yourself the true value of human life. Let there be peace. PART I I took my power in my hand The man I was not So, what is this? You ready? Okay. Inhale. I will tell you. This book, this actual book, is set right here, on Earth. It is about the meaning of life and nothing at all. It is about what it takes to kill somebody, and save them. It is about love and dead poets and wholenut peanut butter. It’s about matter and antimatter, everything and nothing, hope and hate. It’s about a forty- one-year-old female historian called Isobel and her fifteen-year-old son called Gulliver and the cleverest mathematician in the world. It is, in short, about how to become a human. But let me state the obvious. I was not one. That first night, in the cold and the dark and the wind, I was nowhere near. Before I read Cosmopolitan, in the garage, I had never even seen this written language. I realise that this could be your first time too. To give you an idea of the way people here consume stories, I have put this book together as a human would. The words I use are human words, typed in a human font, laid out consecutively in the human style. With your almost instantaneous ability to translate even the most exotic and primitive linguistic forms, I trust comprehension should not be a problem. Now, to reiterate, I was not Professor Andrew Martin. I was like you. Professor Andrew Martin was merely a role. A disguise. Someone I needed to be in order to complete a task. A task that had begun with his abduction, and death. (I am conscious this is setting a grim tone, so I will resolve not to mention death again for at least the rest of this page.) The point is that I was not a forty-three-year-old mathematician – husband, father – who taught at Cambridge University and who had devoted the last eight years of his life to solving a mathematical problem that had so far proved unsolvable. Prior to arriving on Earth I did not have mid-brown hair that fell in a natural side-parting. Equally, I did not have an opinion on The Planets by Holtz or Talking Heads’ second album, as I did not agree with the concept of music. Or I shouldn’t have, anyway. And how could I believe that Australian wine was automatically inferior to wine sourced from other regions on the planet when I had never drunk anything but liquid nitrogen? Belonging as I did to a post-marital species, it goes without saying that I hadn’t been a neglectful husband with an eye for one of my students any more than I had been a man who walked his English Springer Spaniel – a category of hairy domestic deity otherwise known as a ‘dog’ – as an excuse to leave the house. Nor had I written books on mathematics, or insisted that my publishers use an author photograph that was now nearing its fifteenth anniversary. No, I wasn’t that man. I had no feeling for that man whatsoever. And yet he had been real, as real as you and I, a real mammalian life form, a diploid, eukaryotic primate who, five minutes before midnight, had been sitting at his desk, staring at his computer screen and drinking black coffee (don’t worry, I shall explain coffee and my misadventures with it a little later). A life form who may or may not have jumped out of his chair as the breakthrough came, as his mind arrived at a place no human mind had ever reached before, the very edge of knowledge. And at some point shortly after his breakthrough he had been taken by the hosts. My employers. I had even met him, for the very briefest of moments. Enough for the – wholly incomplete – reading to be made. It was complete physically, just not mentally. You see, you can clone human brains but not what is stored inside them, not much of it anyway, so I had to learn a lot of things for myself. I was a forty-three-year-old newborn on planet Earth. It would become annoying to me, later on, that I had never met him properly, as meeting him properly would have been extremely useful. He could have told me about Maggie, for one thing. (Oh, how I wish he had told me about Maggie!) However, any knowledge I gained was not going to alter the simple fact that I had to halt progress. That is what I was there for. To destroy evidence of the breakthrough Professor Andrew Martin had made. Evidence that lived not only in computers but in living human beings. Now, where should we start? I suppose there is only one place. We should start with when I was hit by the car. Detached nouns and other early trials for the language- learner Yes, like I said, we should start with when I was hit by the car. We have to, really. Because for quite a while before that there was nothing. There was nothing and nothing and nothing and— Something. Me, standing there, on the ‘road’. Once there, I had several immediate reactions. First, what was with the weather? I was not really used to weather you had to think about. But this was England, a part of Earth where thinking about the weather was the chief human activity. And for good reason. Second, where was the computer? There was meant to be a computer. Not that I actually knew what Professor Martin’s computer would look like. Maybe it looked like a road. Third, what was that noise? A kind of muted roaring. And fourth: it was night. Being something of a homebird, I was not really accustomed to night. And even if I had been, this wasn’t just any night. It was the kind of night I had never known. This was night to the power of night to the power of night. This was night cubed. A sky full of uncompromising darkness, with no stars and no moon. Where were the suns? Were there even suns? The cold suggested there might not have been. The cold was a shock. The cold hurt my lungs, and the harsh wind beating against my skin caused me to shake. I wondered if humans ever went outside. They must have been insane if they did. Inhaling was difficult, at first. And this was a concern. After all, inhaling really was one of the most important requirements of being a human. But I eventually got the knack. And then another worry. I was not where I was meant to be, that was increasingly clear. I was meant to be where he had been. I was meant to be in an office, but this wasn’t an office. I knew that, even then. Not unless it was an office that contained an entire sky, complete with those dark, congregating clouds and that unseen moon. clouds and that unseen moon. It took a while – too long – to understand the situation. I did not know at that time what a road was, but I can now tell you that a road is something that connects points of departure with points of arrival. This is important. On Earth, you see, you can’t just move from one place to another place instantaneously. The technology isn’t there yet. It is nowhere near there yet. No. On Earth you have to spend a lot of time travelling in between places, be it on roads or on rail- tracks or in careers or relationships. This particular type of road was a motorway. A motorway is the most advanced type of road there is, which as with most forms of human advancement essentially meant accidental death was considerably more probable. My naked feet were standing on something called tarmac, feeling its strange and brutal texture. I looked at my left hand. It seemed so crude and unfamiliar, and yet my laughter halted when I realised this fingered freakish thing was a part of me. I was a stranger to myself. Oh, and by the way, the muted roaring was still there, minus the muted part. It was then I noticed what was approaching me at considerable speed. The lights. White, wide and low, they may as well have been the bright eyes of a fast- moving plain-sweeper, silver-backed, and now screaming. It was trying to slow, and swerve. There was no time for me to move out of the way. There had been, but not now. I had waited too long. And so it hit me with great, uncompromising force. A force which hurled me off the ground and sent me flying. Only not real flying, because humans can’t fly, no matter how much they flap their limbs. The only real option was pain, which I felt right until I landed, after which I returned to nothing again. Nothing and nothing and – Something. A man wearing clothes stood over me. The proximity of his face troubled me. No. A few degrees more than troubled. I was repulsed, terrified. I had never seen anything like this man. The face seemed so alien, full of unfathomable openings and protrusions. The nose, in particular, bothered me. It seemed to my innocent eyes like there was something else inside him, pushing through. I looked lower. Noticed his clothes. He was wearing what I would later realise were a shirt and a tie, trousers and shoes. The exact clothes he should have been wearing and yet they seemed so exotic I didn’t know whether to laugh or scream. He was looking at my injuries. Or rather: for them. I checked my left hand. It hadn’t been touched. The car had collided with my I checked my left hand. It hadn’t been touched. The car had collided with my legs, then my torso, but my hand was fine. ‘It’s a miracle,’ he said quietly, as though it was a secret. But the words were meaningless. He stared into my face and raised his voice, to compete with the sound of cars. ‘What are you doing out here?’ Again, nothing. It was just a mouth moving, making noise. I could tell it was a simple language, but I needed to hear at least a hundred words of a new language before I could piece the whole grammatical jigsaw together. Don’t judge me on this. I know some of you need only ten or so, or just a single adjectival clause somewhere. But languages were never my thing. Part of my aversion to travel, I suppose. I must reiterate this. I did not want to be sent here. It was a job that someone had to do and – following my blasphemous talk at the Museum of Quadratic Equations, my so-called crime against mathematical purity – the hosts believed it to be a suitable punishment. They knew it was a job no one in their right mind would choose to do and, though my task was important, they knew I (like you) belonged to the most advanced race in the known universe and so would be up to the job. ‘I know you from somewhere. I recognise your face. Who are you?’ I felt tired. That was the trouble with teleportation and matter shifting and bio- setting. It really took it out of you. And even though it put it back in to you, energy was always the price. I slipped into darkness and enjoyed dreams tinged with violet and indigo and home. I dreamed of cracked eggs and prime numbers and ever-shifting skylines. And then I awoke. I was inside a strange vehicle, strapped to primitive heart-reading equipment. Two humans, male and female (the female’s appearance confirmed my worst fears. Within this species, ugliness does not discriminate between genders), dressed in green. They seemed to be asking me something in quite an agitated fashion. Maybe it was because I was using my new upper limbs to rip off the crudely designed electrocardiographic equipment. They tried to restrain me, but they apparently had very little understanding of the mathematics involved, and so with relative ease I managed to leave the two green-clothed humans on the floor, writhing around in pain. I rose to my feet, noticing just how much gravity there was on this planet as the driver turned to ask me an even more urgent question. The vehicle was moving fast, and the undulating sound waves of the siren were an undeniable distraction, but I opened the door and leapt towards the soft vegetation at the side of the road. My body rolled. I hid. And then, once it was safe to appear, I got to my feet. Compared to a human hand, a foot is relatively untroubling, toes aside. aside. I stood there for a while, just staring at all those odd cars, confined to the ground, evidently reliant on fossil fuel and each making more noise than it took to power a polygon generator. And the even odder sight of the humans – all clothed inside, holding on to circular steer-control equipment and, sometimes, extra-biological telecommunications devices. I have come to a planet where the most intelligent life form still has to drive its own cars . . . Never before had I so appreciated the simple splendours you and I have grown up with. The eternal light. The smooth, floating traffic. The advanced plant life. The sweetened air. The non-weather. Oh, gentle readers, you really have no idea. Cars blared high-frequency horns as they passed me. Wide-eyed, gape- mouthed faces stared out of windows. I didn’t understand it, I looked as ugly as any of them. Why wasn’t I blending in? What was I doing wrong? Maybe it was because I wasn’t in a car. Maybe that’s how humans lived, permanently contained in cars. Or maybe it was because I wasn’t wearing any clothes. It was a cold night, but could it really have been something so trivial as a lack of artificial body-covering? No, it couldn’t be as simple as that. I looked up at the sky. There was evidence of the moon now, veiled by thin cloud. It too seemed to be gawping down at me with the same sense of shock. But the stars were still blanketed, out of sight. I wanted to see them. I wanted to feel their comfort. On top of all this, rain was a distinct possibility. I hated rain. To me, as to most of you dome-dwellers, rain was a terror of almost mythological proportions. I needed to find what I was looking for before the clouds opened. There was a rectangular aluminium sign ahead of me. Nouns minus context are always tricky for the language learner, but the arrow was pointing only one way so I followed it. Humans kept on lowering their windows and shouting things at me, above the sound of their engines. Sometimes this seemed good-humoured, as they were spitting oral fluid, in my direction, orminurk-style. So I spat back in a friendly fashion, trying to hit their fast-moving faces. This seemed to encourage more shouting, but I tried not to mind. Soon, I told myself, I would understand what the heavily articulated greeting ‘get off the fucking road you fucking wanker’ actually meant. In the meantime I kept walking, got past the sign, and saw an illuminated but disconcertingly unmoving building by the side of the road. I will go to it, I told myself. I will go to it and find some answers. Texaco The building was called ‘Texaco’. It stood there shining in the night with a terrible stillness, like it was waiting to come alive. As I walked towards it, I noticed it was some kind of refill station. Cars were parked there, under a horizontal canopy and stationed next to simple-looking fuel-delivery systems. It was confirmed: the cars did absolutely nothing for themselves. They were practically brain dead, if they even had brains. The humans who were refuelling their vehicles stared at me as they went inside. Trying to be as polite as possible, given my verbal limitations, I spat an ample amount of saliva towards them. I entered the building. There was a clothed human behind the counter. Instead of his hair being on the top of his head it covered the bottom half of his face. His body was more spherical than other humans’ so he was marginally better looking. From the scent of hexanoic acid and androsterone I could tell personal hygiene wasn’t one of his top priorities. He stared at my (admittedly distressing) genitalia and then pressed something behind the counter. I spat, but the greeting was unreciprocated. Maybe I had got it wrong about the spitting. All this salivatory offloading was making me thirsty, so I went over to a humming refrigerated unit full of brightly coloured cylindrical objects. I picked one of them up, and opened it. A can of liquid called ‘Diet Coke’. It tasted extremely sweet, with a trace of phosphoric acid. It was disgusting. It burst out of my mouth almost the moment it entered. Then I consumed something else. A foodstuff wrapped in synthetic packaging. This was, I would later realise, a planet of things wrapped inside things. Food inside wrappers. Bodies inside clothes. Contempt inside smiles. Everything was hidden away. The foodstuff was called Mars. That got a little bit further down my throat, but only far enough to discover I had a gag reflex. I closed the door and saw a container with the words ‘Pringles’ and ‘Barbecue’ on it. I opened it up and started to eat. They tasted okay – a bit like sorp-cake – and I crammed as many as I could into my mouth. I wondered when I had last actually fed myself, with no assistance. I seriously couldn’t remember. Not since infancy, that was for sure. seriously couldn’t remember. Not since infancy, that was for sure. ‘You can’t do that. You can’t just eat stuff. You’ve got to pay for it.’ The man behind the counter was talking to me. I still had little idea of what he was saying, but from the volume and frequency I sensed it wasn’t good. Also, I observed that his skin – in the places on his face where it was visible – was changing colour. I noticed the lighting above my head, and I blinked. I placed my hand over my mouth and made a noise. Then I held it at arm’s length and made the same noise, noting the difference. It was comforting to know that even in the most remote corner of the universe the laws of sound and light obeyed themselves, although it has to be said they seemed a little more lacklustre here. There were shelves full of what I would shortly know as ‘magazines’, nearly all of which had faces with near-identical smiles on the front of them. Twenty- six noses. Fifty-two eyes. It was an intimidating sight. I picked up one of these magazines as the man picked up the phone. On Earth, the media is still locked in a pre-capsule age and most of it has to be read via an electronic device or via a printed medium made of a thin, chemically pulped tree-derivative known as paper. Magazines are very popular, despite no human ever feeling better for having read them. Indeed, their chief purpose is to generate a sense of inferiority in the reader that consequently leads to them needing to buy something, which they do, and then feel even worse, and so need to buy another magazine to see what they can buy next. It is an eternal and unhappy spiral that goes by the name of capitalism and it is really quite popular. The particular publication I was holding was called Cosmopolitan, and I realised that if nothing else it would help me grasp the language. It didn’t take long. Written human languages are preposterously simple, as they are made up almost entirely of words. I had interpolated the entire written language by the end of the first article, in addition to the touch that can boost your mood – as well as your relationship. Also: orgasms, I realised, were an incredibly big deal. It seemed orgasms were the central tenet of life here. Maybe this was the only meaning they had on this planet. Their purpose was simply to pursue the enlightenment of orgasm. A few seconds of relief from the surrounding dark. But reading wasn’t speaking and my new vocal equipment was still sitting there, in my mouth and throat, like yet more food I didn’t know how to swallow. I placed the magazine back on the shelf. There was a thin vertical piece of reflective metal beside the stand, allowing me a partial glimpse of myself. I too had a protruding nose. And lips. Hair. Ears. So much externality. It was a very inside-out kind of look. Plus a large lump in the centre of my neck. Very thick eyebrows. A piece of information came to me, something I remembered from what the hosts had told me. Professor Andrew Martin. My heart raced. A surge of panic. This was what I was now. This was who I had become. I tried to comfort myself by remembering it was just temporary. At the bottom of the magazine stand were some newspapers. There were photographs of more smiling faces, and some of dead bodies too, lying beside demolished buildings. Next to the newspapers was a small collection of maps. A Road Map of the British Isles was among them. Perhaps I was on the British Isles. I picked up the map and tried to leave the building. The man hung up the phone. The door was locked. Information arrived, unprompted: Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge University. ‘You’re not bloody leaving,’ said the man, in words I was beginning to comprehend. ‘The police are on their way. I’ve locked the door.’ To his bafflement, I then proceeded to open the door. I stepped out and heard a distant siren. I listened, and realised the noise was only three hundred metres away and getting rapidly closer. I began to move, running as fast as I could away from the road and up a grass embankment towards another flat area. There were lots of stationary haulage vehicles, parked in an ordered geometric fashion. This was such a strange world. Of course, when viewed afresh there were only strange worlds but this one must have been strangest of all. I tried to see the similarity. I told myself that here all things were still made of atoms, and that those atoms would work precisely as atoms always do. They would move towards each other if there was distance between them. If there was no distance between them, they would repel each other. That was the most basic law of the universe, and it applied to all things, even here. There was comfort in that. The knowledge that wherever you were in the universe, the small things were always exactly the same. Attracting and repelling. It was only by not looking closely enough that you saw difference. But still, right then, difference was all I saw. The car with the siren was now pulling into the fuelling station, flashing blue light, so I hid among the parked lorries for a few minutes. I was freezing, and crouched into myself, my whole body shaking and my testicles shrinking. (A male human’s testicles were the most attractive thing about him, I realised, and vastly unappreciated by humans themselves, who would very often rather look at anything else, including smiling faces.) Before the police car left I heard a voice behind me. Not a police officer but the driver of the vehicle I was crouched behind me. Not a police officer but the driver of the vehicle I was crouched behind. ‘Hey, what are you doing? Fuck off away from my lorry.’ I ran away, my bare feet hitting hard ground scattered with random pieces of grit. And then I was on grass, running across a field, and I kept on in the same direction until I reached another road. This one was much narrower and had no traffic at all. I opened the map, found the line which matched the curve of this other road and saw that word: ‘Cambridge’. I headed there. As I walked and breathed in that nitrogen-rich air the idea of myself was forming. Professor Andrew Martin. With the name, came facts sent across space by those who had sent me. I was to be a married man. I was forty-three years old, the exact mid-point in a human life. I had a son. I was the professor who had just solved the most significant mathematic puzzle the humans had ever faced. I had, only three short hours ago, advanced the human race beyond anyone’s imagining. The facts made me queasy but I kept on heading in the direction of Cambridge, to see what else these humans had in store for me. Corpus Christi I was not told to provide this document of human life. That was not in my brief. Yet I feel obliged to do so to explain some remarkable features of human existence. I hope you will thereby understand why I chose to do what, by now, some of you must know I did. Anyhow, I had always known Earth was a real place. I knew that, of course I did. I had consumed, in capsule form, the famous travelogue The Fighting Idiots: My Time with the Humans of Water Planet 7,081. I knew Earth was a real event in a dull and distant solar system, where not a great deal happened and where travel options for the locals were severely limited. I’d also heard that humans were a life form of, at best, middling intelligence and one prone to violence, deep sexual embarrassment, bad poetry and walking around in circles. But I was starting to realise no preparation could have been enough. By morning I was in this Cambridge place. It was horrendously fascinating. The buildings were what I noticed first, and it was quite startling to realise that the garage hadn’t been a one-off. All such structures – whether built for consumerist, habitative or other purposes – were static and stuck to the ground. Of course, this was meant to be my town. This was where ‘I’ had lived, on and off, for over twenty years. And I would have to act like that was true, even though it was the most alien place I had ever seen in my life. The lack of geometric imagination was startling. There was not so much as a decagon in sight. Though I did notice that some of the buildings were larger and – relatively speaking – more ornately designed than others. Temples to the orgasm, I imagined. Shops were beginning to open. In human towns, I would soon learn, everywhere is a shop. Shops are to Earth-dwellers what equation booths are to Vonnadorians. In one such shop I saw lots of books in the window. I was reminded that humans have to read books. They actually need to sit down and look at each word consecutively. And that takes time. Lots of time. A human can’t just swallow every book going, can’t chew different tomes simultaneously, or gulp down near-infinite knowledge in a matter of seconds. They can’t just pop a word-capsule in their mouth like we can. Imagine! Being not only mortal but also forced to take some of that precious and limited time and read. No wonder they were a species of primitives. By the time they had read enough books to actually reach a state of knowledge where they can do anything with it they are dead. Understandably, a human needs to know what kind of book they are about to read. They need to know if it is a love story. Or a murder story. Or a story about aliens. There are other questions, too, that humans have in bookstores. Such as, is it one of those books they read to feel clever, or one of those they will pretend never to have read in order to stay looking clever? Will it make them laugh, or cry? Or will it simply force them to stare out of the window watching the tracks of raindrops? Is it a true story? Or is it a false one? Is it the kind of story that will work on their brain or one which aims for lower organs? Is it one of those books that ends up acquiring religious followers or getting burned by them? Is it a book about mathematics or – like everything else in the universe – simply because of it? Yes, there are lots of questions. And even more books. So, so many. Humans in their typical human way have written far too many to get through. Reading is added to that great pile of things – work, love, sexual prowess, the words they didn’t say when they really needed to say them – that they are bound to feel a bit dissatisfied about. So, humans need to know about a book. Just as they need to know, when they apply for a job, if it will cause them to lose their mind at the age of fifty-nine and lead them to jump out of the office window. Or if, when they go on a first date, the person who is now making witticisms about his year in Cambodia will one day leave her for a younger woman called Francesca who runs her own public relations firm and says Kafkaesque without having ever read Kafka. Anyway, there I was walking into this bookshop and having a look at some of the books out on the tables. I noticed two of the females who worked there were laughing and pointing towards my mid-section. Again, I was confused. Weren’t men meant to go in bookshops? Was there some kind of war of ridicule going on between the genders? Did booksellers spend all their time mocking their customers? Or was it that I wasn’t wearing any clothes? Who knew? Anyway, it was a little distracting, especially as the only laughter I had ever heard had been the fur-muffled chuckle of an Ipsoid. I tried to focus on the books themselves, and decided to look at those stacked on the shelves. and decided to look at those stacked on the shelves. I soon noticed that the system they were using was alphabetical and related to the initial letter in the last name of each author. As the human alphabet only has 26 letters it was an incredibly simple system, and I soon found the Ms. One of these M books was called The Dark Ages and it was by Isobel Martin. I pulled it off the shelf. It had a little sign on it saying ‘Local Author’. There was only one of them in stock, which was considerably fewer than the number of books by Andrew Martin. For example, there were thirteen copies of an Andrew Martin book called The Square Circle and eleven of another one called American Pi. They were both about mathematics. I picked up these books and realised they both said ‘£8.99’ on the back. The interpolation of the entire language I had done with the aid of Cosmopolitan meant I knew this was the price of the books, but I did not have any money. So I waited until no one was looking (a long time) and then I ran very fast out of the shop. I eventually settled into a walk, as running without clothes is not entirely compatible with external testicles, and then I started to read. I searched both books for the Riemann hypothesis, but I couldn’t find anything except unrelated references to the long-dead German mathematician Bernhard Riemann himself. I let the books drop to the ground. People were really beginning to stop and stare. All around me were things I didn’t quite yet comprehend: litter, advertisements, bicycles. Uniquely human things. I passed a large man with a long coat and a hairy face who, judging from his asymmetrical gait, seemed to be injured. Of course, we may know brief pain, but this did not seem of that type. It reminded me that this was a place of death. Things deteriorated, degenerated, and died here. The life of a human was surrounded on all sides by darkness. How on Earth did they cope? Idiocy, from slow reading. It could only be idiocy. This man, though, didn’t seem to be coping. His eyes were full of sorrow and suffering. ‘Jesus,’ the man mumbled. I think he was mistaking me for someone. ‘I’ve seen it all now.’ He smelt of bacterial infection and several other repugnant things I couldn’t identify. I thought about asking him for directions, as the map was rendered in only two dimensions and a little vague, but I wasn’t up to it yet. I might have been able to say the words but I didn’t have the confidence to direct them towards such a close face, with its bulbous nose and sad pink eyes. (How did I know his such a close face, with its bulbous nose and sad pink eyes. (How did I know his eyes were sad? That is an interesting question, especially as we Vonnadorians never really feel sadness. The answer is I don’t know. It was a feeling I had. A ghost inside me, maybe the ghost of the human I had become. I didn’t have all his memories, but did I have other things. Was empathy part-biological? All I know is it unsettled me, more than the sight of pain. Sadness seemed to me like a disease, and I worried it was contagious.) So I walked past him and, for the first time in as long as I could remember, I tried to find my own way to somewhere. Now, I knew Professor Martin worked at the university but I had no idea what a university looked like. I guessed they wouldn’t be zirconium-clad space stations hovering just beyond the atmosphere, but other than that I didn’t really know. The ability to view two different buildings and say, oh this was that type of building, and that was this, well, that was simply lost on me. So I kept walking, ignoring the gasps and the laughter, and feeling whichever brick or glass façade I was passing by, as though touch held more answers than sight. And then the very worst possible thing happened. (Brace yourselves, Vonnadorians.) It began to rain. The sensation of it on my skin and my hair was horrific, and I needed it to end. I felt so exposed. I began to jog, looking for an entry into somewhere. Anywhere. I passed a vast building with a large gate and sign outside. The sign said ‘The College of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin Mary’. Having read Cosmopolitan I knew what ‘virgin’ meant in full detail but I had a problem with some of the other words. Corpus and Christi seemed to inhabit a space just beyond the language. Corpus was something to do with body, so maybe Corpus Christi was a tantric full body orgasm. In truth, I didn’t know. There were smaller words too, and a different sign. These words said ‘Cambridge University’. I used my left hand to open the gate and walked through, on to grass, heading towards the building that still had lights on. Signs of life and warmth. The grass was wet. The soft dampness of it repulsed me and I seriously considered screaming. It was very neatly trimmed, this grass. I was later to realise that a neatly trimmed lawn was a powerful signifier, and should have commanded in me a slight sense of fear and respect, especially in conjunction (as this was) with ‘grand’ architecture. But right then, I was oblivious to both the significance of tidy grass and architectural grandeur and so I kept walking, towards the main building. A car stopped somewhere behind me. Again, there were blue lights flashing, sliding across the stone façade of Corpus Christi. sliding across the stone façade of Corpus Christi. (Flashing blue lights on Earth = trouble.) A man ran towards me. There was a whole crowd of other humans behind him. Where had they come from? They all seemed so sinister, in a pack, with their odd-looking clothed forms. They were aliens to me. That was the obvious part. What was less obvious was the way I seemed like an alien to them. After all, I looked like them. Maybe this was another human trait. Their ability to turn on themselves, to ostracise their own kind. If that was the case, it added weight to my mission. It made me understand it better. Anyway, there I was, on the wet grass, with the man running towards me and the crowd further away. I could have run, or fought, but there were too many of them – some with archaic-looking recording equipment. The man grabbed me. ‘Come with me, sir.’ I thought of my purpose. But right then I had to comply. Indeed, I just wanted to get out of the rain. ‘I am Professor Andrew Martin,’ I said, having complete confidence that I knew how to say this phrase. And that is when I discovered the truly terrifying power of other people’s laughter. ‘I have a wife and a son,’ I said, and I gave their names. ‘I need to see them. Can you take me to see them?’ ‘No. Not right now. No, we can’t.’ He held my arm tightly. I wanted, more than anything, for his hideous hand to let go. To be touched by one of them, let alone gripped, was too much. And yet I did not attempt to resist as he led me towards a vehicle. I was supposed to draw as little attention to myself as possible while doing my task. In that, I was failing already. You must strive to be normal. Yes. You must try to be like them. I know. Do not escape prematurely. I won’t. But I don’t want to be here. I want to go home. You know you can’t do that. Not yet. But I will run out of time. I must get to the professor’s office, and to his home. You are right. You must. But first you need to stay calm, and do what they tell you. Go where they want you to go. Do what they want you to do. They must never know who sent you. Do not panic. Professor Andrew Martin is not among them now. You are. There will be time. They die, and so they have impatience. Their lives are short. Yours is not. Do not become like them. Use your gifts wisely. I will. But I am scared. You have every right to be. You are among the humans. Human clothes They made me put on clothes. What humans didn’t know about architecture or non-radioactive isotopic helium-based fuels, they more than made up for with their knowledge of clothes. They were geniuses in the area, and knew all the subtleties. And there were, I promise you, thousands of them. The way clothes worked was this: there was an under layer and an outer layer. The under layer consisted of ‘pants’ and ‘socks’ which covered the heavily scented regions of the genitals, bottom and feet. There was also the option of a ‘vest’ which covered the marginally less shameful chest area. This area included the sensitive skin protrusions known as ‘nipples’. I had no idea what purpose nipples served, though I did notice a pleasurable sensation when I tenderly stroked my fingers over them. The outer layer of clothing seemed even more important than the under layer. This layer covered ninety-five per cent of the body, leaving only the face, head- hair and hands on show. This outer layer of clothing seemed to be the key to the power structures on this planet. For instance, the two men who took me away in the car with the blue flashing lights were both wearing identical outer layers, consisting of black shoes over their socks, black trousers over their pants, and then, over their upper bodies, there was a white ‘shirt’ and a dark, deep-space blue ‘jumper’. On this jumper, directly over the region of their left nipple, was a rectangular badge made of a slightly finer fabric which had the words ‘Cambridgeshire POLICE’ written on it. Their jackets were the same colour and had the same badge. These were clearly the clothes to wear. However, I soon realised what the word ‘police’ meant. It meant police. I couldn’t believe it. I had broken the law simply by not wearing clothes. I was pretty sure that most humans must have known what a naked human looked like. It wasn’t as though I had done something wrong while not wearing clothes. At least, not yet. They placed me inside a small room that was, in perfect accord with all human rooms, a shrine to the rectangle. The funny thing was that although this room looked precisely no better or worse than anything else in that police station, or indeed that planet, the officers seemed to think it was a particular punishment to be placed in this place – a ‘cell’ – more than any other room. They are in a body that dies, I chuckled to myself, and they worry more about being locked in a room! This was where they told me to get dressed. To ‘cover myself up’. So I picked up those clothes and did my best and then, once I had worked out which limb went through which opening, they said I had to wait for an hour. Which I did. Of course, I could have escaped. But I realised it was more likely that I would find what I needed by staying there, with the police and their computers. Plus, I remembered what I had been told. Use your gifts wisely. You must try and be like them. You must strive to be normal. Then the door opened. Questions There were two men. These were different men. These men weren’t wearing the same clothes, but they did have pretty much the same face. Not just the eyes, protruding nose and mouth but also a shared look of complacent misery. In the stark light I felt not a little afraid. They took me to another room for questioning. This was interesting knowledge: you could only ask questions in certain rooms. There were rooms for sitting and thinking, and rooms for inquisition. They sat down. Anxiety prickled my skin. The kind of anxiety you could only feel on this planet. The anxiety that came from the fact that the only beings who knew who I was were a long way away. They were as far away as it was possible to be. ‘Professor Andrew Martin,’ said one of the men, leaning back in his chair. ‘We’ve done a bit of research. We googled you. You’re quite a big fish in academic circles.’ The man stuck out his bottom lip, and displayed the palms of his hands. He wanted me to say something. What would they plan on doing to me if I didn’t? What could they have done? I had little idea what ‘googling’ me meant, but whatever it was I couldn’t say I had felt it. I didn’t really understand what being a ‘big fish in academic circles’ meant either though I must say it was a kind of relief – given the dimensions of the room – to realise they knew what a circle was. I nodded my head, still a little uneasy about speaking. It involved too much concentration and co-ordination. Then the other one spoke. I switched my gaze to his face. The key difference between them, I suppose, was in the lines of hair above their eyes. This one kept his eyebrows permanently raised, causing the skin of his forehead to wrinkle. ‘What have you got to tell us?’ I thought long and hard. It was time to speak. ‘I am the most intelligent human on the planet. I am a mathematical genius. I have made important contributions to many branches of mathematics, such as group theory, number theory and to many branches of mathematics, such as group theory, number theory and geometry. My name is Professor Andrew Martin.’ They gave each other a look, and released a brief air chuckle out of their noses. ‘Are you thinking this is funny?’ the first one said, aggressively. ‘Committing a public order offence? Does that amuse you? Yeah?’ ‘No. I was just telling you who I am.’ ‘We’ve established that,’ the officer said, who kept his eyebrows low and close, like doona-birds in mating season. ‘The last bit anyway. What we haven’t established is: what were you doing walking around without your clothes on at half past eight in the morning?’ ‘I am a professor at Cambridge University. I am married to Isobel Martin. I have a son, Gulliver. I would very much like to see them, please. Just let me see them.’ They looked at their papers. ‘Yes,’ the first one said. ‘We see you are a teaching fellow at Fitzwilliam College. But that doesn’t explain why you were walking naked around the grounds of Corpus Christi College. You are either off your head or a danger to society, or both.’ ‘I do not like wearing clothes,’ I said, with quite delicate precision. ‘They chafe. They are uncomfortable around my genitals.’ And then, remembering all I had learnt from Cosmopolitan magazine I leant in towards them and added what I thought would be the clincher. ‘They may seriously hinder my chances of achieving tantric full-body orgasm.’ It was then they made a decision, and the decision was to submit me to a psychiatric test. This essentially meant going to another rectilinear room to have to face looking at another human with another protruding nose. This human was female. She was called Priti, which was pronounced ‘pretty’ and means pretty. Unfortunate, given that she was human and, by her very nature, vomit- provoking. ‘Now,’ she said, ‘I would like to start by asking you something very simple. I’m wondering if you’ve been under any pressure recently?’ I was confused. What kind of pressure was she talking about? Atmospheric? Gravitational? ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘A lot. Everywhere, there is some kind of pressure.’ It seemed like the right answer. Coffee She told me she had been talking to the university. This, alone, made little sense. How, for instance, was that done? But then she told me this: ‘They tell me you’ve been working long hours, even by the standards of your peers. They seem very upset about the whole thing. But they are worried about you. As is your wife.’ ‘My wife?’ I knew I had one, and I knew her name, but I didn’t really understand what it actually meant to have a wife. Marriage was a truly alien concept. There probably weren’t enough magazines on the planet for me to ever understand it. She explained. I was even more confused. Marriage was a ‘loving union’ which meant two people who loved each other stayed together for ever. But that seemed to suggest that love was quite a weak force and needed marriage to bolster it. Also, the union could be broken with something called ‘divorce’, which meant there was – as far as I could see – very little point to it, in logical terms. But then, I had no real idea what ‘love’ was, even though it had been one of the most frequently used words in the magazine I’d read. It remained a mystery. And so I asked her to explain that too, and by this point I was bewildered, overdosing on all this bad logic. It sounded like delusion. ‘Do you want a coffee?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. So the coffee came and I tasted it – a hot, foul, acidic, dual-carbon compound liquid – and I spat it out all over her. A major breach of human etiquette – apparently, I was meant to swallow it. ‘What the—’ She stood up and patted herself dry, showing intense concern for her shirt. After that there were more questions. Impossible stuff like, what was my address? What did I do in my spare time, to relax? Of course, I could have fooled her. Her mind was so soft and malleable and its neutral oscillations were so obviously weak that even with my as then still limited command of the language I could have told her I was perfectly fine, and that it was none of her business, and could she please leave me alone. I had that it was none of her business, and could she please leave me alone. I had already worked out the rhythm and the optimal frequency I would have needed. But I didn’t. Do not escape prematurely. Do not panic. There will be time. The truth is, I was quite terrified. My heart had begun racing for no obvious reason. My palms were sweating. Something about the room, and its proportions, coupled with so much contact with this irrational species, was setting me off. Everything here was a test. If you failed one test, there was a test to see why. I suppose they loved tests so much because they believed in free will. Ha! Humans, I was discovering, believed they were in control of their own lives, and so they were in awe of questions and tests, as these made them feel like they had a certain mastery over other people, who had failed in their choices, and who had not worked hard enough on the right answers. And by the end of the last failed test many were sat, as I was soon sat, in a mental hospital, swallowing a mind-blanking pill called diazepam, and placed in another empty room full of right angles. Only this time, I was also inhaling the distressing scent of the hydrogen chloride they used to annihilate bacteria. My task was going to be easy, I decided, in that room. The meat of it, I mean. And the reason it was going to be easy was that I had the same sense of indifference towards them as they had towards single-celled organisms. I could wipe a few of them out, no problem, and for a greater cause than hygiene. But what I didn’t realise was that when it came to that sneaking, camouflaged, untouchable giant known as the Future, I was as vulnerable as anyone. Mad people Humans, as a rule, don’t like mad people unless they are good at painting, and only then once they are dead. But the definition of mad, on Earth, seems to be very unclear and inconsistent. What is perfectly sane in one era turns out to be insane in another. The earliest humans walked around naked with no problem. Certain humans, in humid rainforests mainly, still do so. So, we must conclude that madness is sometimes a question of time, and sometimes of postcode. Basically, the key rule is, if you want to appear sane on Earth you have to be in the right place, wearing the right clothes, saying the right things, and only stepping on the right kind of grass. The cubic root of 912,673 After a while, my wife came to visit. Isobel Martin, in person. Author of The Dark Ages. I wanted to be repulsed by her, as that would make everything easier. I wanted to be horrified and, of course, I was, because the whole species was horrific to me. On that first encounter I thought she was hideous. I was frightened of her. I was frightened of everything here, now. It was an undeniable truth. To be on Earth was to be frightened. I was even frightened by the sight of my own hands. But anyway, Isobel. When I first saw her I saw nothing but a few trillion poorly arranged, mediocre cells. She had a pale face and tired eyes and a narrow, but still protruding nose. There was something very poised and upright about her, something very contained. She seemed, even more than most, to be holding something back. My mouth dried just looking at her. I suppose if there was a challenge with this particular human it was that I was meant to know her very well, and also that I was going to be spending more time with her, to glean the information I needed, before doing what I had to do. She came to see me in my room, while a nurse watched. It was, of course, another test. Everything in human life was a test. That was why they all looked so stressed out. I was dreading her hugging me, or kissing me, or blowing air into my ear or any of those other human things the magazine had told me about, but she didn’t. She didn’t even seem to want to do that. What she wanted to do was sit there and stare at me, as if I were the cubic root of 912,673 and she was trying to work me out. And indeed, I tried very hard to act as harmoniously as that. The indestructible ninety-seven. My favourite prime. Isobel smiled and nodded at the nurse, but when she sat down and faced me I realised she was exhibiting a few universal signs of fear – tight facial muscles, dilated pupils, fast breathing. I paid special attention to her hair now. She had dark hair growing out of the top and rear of her head which extended to just above her shoulders where it halted abruptly to form a straight horizontal line. This was known as a ‘bob’. She sat tall in her chair with a straight back, and her neck was long, as if her head had fallen out with her body and wanted nothing more to do with it. I would later discover that she was forty-one and had an appearance which passed for beautiful, or at least plainly beautiful, on this planet. But right then she had just another human face. And human faces were the last of the human codes that I would learn. She inhaled. ‘How are you feeling?’ ‘I don’t know. I don’t remember a lot of things. My mind is a little bit scrambled, especially about this morning. Listen, has anyone been to my office? Since yesterday?’ This confused her. ‘I don’t know. How would I know that? I doubt very much they’ll be in at the weekend. And anyway you’re the only one who has the keys. Please, Andrew, what happened? Have you suffered an accident? Have they tested you for amnesia? Why were you out of the house at that time? Tell me what you were doing. I woke up and you weren’t there.’ ‘I just needed to get out. That is all. I needed to be outside.’ She was agitated now. ‘I was thinking all sorts of things. I checked the whole house, but there was no sign of you. And the car was still there, and your bike, and you weren’t picking up your phone, and it was three in the morning, Andrew. Three in the morning.’ I nodded. She wanted answers, but I only had questions, ‘Where is our son? Gulliver? Why is he not with you?’ This answer confused her even more. ‘He’s at my mother’s,’ she said. ‘I could hardly bring him here. He’s very upset. After everything else this is, you know, hard for him.’ Nothing she was telling me was information I needed. So I decided to be more direct. ‘Do you know what I did yesterday? Do you know what I achieved while I was at work?’ I knew that however she answered this, the truth remained the same. I would have to kill her. Not then. Not there. But somewhere, and soon. Still I had to know what she knew. Or what she might have said to others. The nurse wrote something down at this point. Isobel ignored my question and leant in closer towards me, lowering her voice. ‘They think you have suffered a mental breakdown. They don’t call it that, of course. But that is what they think. I’ve been asked lots of questions. It was like facing the Grand Inquisitor.’ ‘That’s all there is around here, isn’t it? Questions.’ I braved another glance at her face and gave her more questions. ‘Why did we get married? What is the point of it? What are the rules involved?’ Certain enquiries, even on a planet designed for questions, go unheard. ‘Andrew, I’ve been telling you for weeks – months – that you need to slow down. You’ve been overdoing it. Your hours have been ridiculous. You’ve been truly burning the candle. Something had to give. But even so, this was so sudden. There were no warning signs. I just want to know what triggered it all. Was it me? What was it? I’m worried about you.’ I tried to come up with a valid explanation. ‘I suppose I just must have forgotten the importance of wearing clothes. That is, the importance of acting the way I was supposed to act. I don’t know. I must have just forgotten how to be a human. It can happen, can’t it? Things can be forgotten sometimes?’ Isobel held my hand. The glabrous under-portion of her thumb stroked my skin. This unnerved me even more. I wondered why she was touching me. A policeman grips an arm to take you somewhere, but why does a wife stroke your hand? What was the purpose? Did it have something to do with love? I stared at the small glistening diamond on her ring. ‘It’s going to be all right, Andrew. This is just a blip. I promise you. You’ll be right as rain soon.’ ‘As rain?’ I asked, the worry adding a quiver to my voice. I tried to read her facial expressions, but it was difficult. She wasn’t terrified any more, but what was she? Was she sad? Confused? Angry? Disappointed? I wanted to understand, but I couldn’t. She left me, after a hundred more words of the conversation. Words, words, words. There was a brief kiss on my cheek, and a hug, and I tried not to flinch or tighten up, hard as that was for me. And then she turned away and wiped something from her eye, which had leaked. I felt like I was expected to do something, say something, feel something, but I didn’t know what. ‘I saw your book,’ I said. ‘In the shop. Next to mine.’ ‘Some of you still remains then,’ she said. The tone was soft, but slightly scornful, or I think it was. ‘Andrew, just be careful. Do everything they say and it will be all right. Everything will be all right.’ And then she was gone. Dead cows I was told to go to the dining hall to eat. This was a terrible experience. For one thing, it was the first time I had been confronted with so many of their species in an enclosed area. Second, the smell. Of boiled carrot. Of pea. Of dead cow. A cow is an Earth-dwelling animal, a domesticated and multipurpose ungulate, which humans treat as a one-stop shop for food, liquid refreshment, fertiliser and designer footwear. The humans farm it and cut its throat and then cut it up and package it and refrigerate it and sell it and cook it. By doing this, apparently they have earned the right to change its name to beef, which is the monosyllable furthest away from cow, because the last thing a human wants to think about when eating cow is an actual cow. I didn’t care about cows. If it had been my assignment to kill a cow then I would have happily done so. But there was a leap to be made from not caring about someone to wanting to eat them. So I ate the vegetables. Or rather, I ate a single slice of boiled carrot. Nothing, I realised, could make you feel quite so homesick as eating disgusting, unfamiliar food. One slice was enough. More than enough. It was, in fact, far too much and it took me all my strength and concentration to battle that gag reflex and not throw up. I sat on my own, at a table in the corner, beside a tall pot plant. The plant had broad, shining, rich green flat vascular organs known as leaves which evidently served a photosynthetic function. It looked exotic to me, but not appallingly so. Indeed, the plant looked rather pretty. For the first time I was looking at something here and not being troubled. But then I looked away from the plant, towards the noise, and all the humans classified as crazy. The ones for whom the ways of this world were beyond them. If I was ever going to relate to anyone on this planet, they were surely going to be in this room. And just as I was thinking this one of them came up to me. A girl with short pink hair, and a circular piece of silver through her nose (as if that region of the face needed more attention given to it), thin orange-pink scars on her arms, and a quiet, low voice that seemed to imply that every thought in her brain was a deadly secret. She was wearing a T-shirt. On the T-shirt were the words ‘Everything was beautiful (and wearing a T-shirt. On the T-shirt were the words ‘Everything was beautiful (and nothing hurt)’. Her name was Zoë. She told me that straight away. The world as will and representation And then she said, ‘New?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘Day?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘It is. We do appear to be angled towards the sun.’ She laughed, and her laughter was the opposite of her voice. It was a kind of laugh that made me wish there was no air for those manic waves to travel on and reach my ears. Once she had calmed down she explained herself. ‘No, I mean, are you here permanently or do you just come in for the day? Like me? A “voluntary commitment” job.’ ‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘I think I will be leaving soon. I am not mad, you see. I have just been a little confused about things. I have a lot to get on with. Things to do. Things to finish off.’ ‘I recognise you from somewhere,’ said Zoë. ‘Do you? From where?’ I scanned the room. I was starting to feel uncomfortable. There were seventy- six patients and eighteen members of staff. I needed privacy. I needed, really, to get out of there. ‘Have you been on the telly?’ ‘I don’t know.’ She laughed. ‘We might be Facebook friends.’ ‘Yeah.’ She scratched her horrible face. I wondered what was underneath. It couldn’t have been any worse. And then her eyes widened with a realisation. ‘No. I know. I’ve seen you at uni. You’re Professor Martin, aren’t you? You’re something of a legend. I’m at Fitzwilliam. I’ve seen you around the place. Better food in Hall than here, isn’t it?’ ‘Are you one of my students?’ She laughed again. ‘No. No. GCSE maths was enough for me. I hated it.’ This angered me. ‘Hated it? How can you hate mathematics? Mathematics is This angered me. ‘Hated it? How can you hate mathematics? Mathematics is everything.’ ‘Well, I didn’t see it like that. I mean, Pythagoras sounded like a bit of a dude, but, no, I’m not really über-big on numbers. I’m philosophy. That’s probably why I’m in here. OD’d on Schopenhauer.’ ‘Schopenhauer?’ ‘He wrote a book called The World as Will and Representation. I’m meant to be doing an essay on it. Basically it says that the world is what we recognise in our own will. Humans are ruled by their basic desires and this leads to suffering and pain, because our desires make us crave things from the world but the world is nothing but representation. Because those same cravings shape what we see we end up feeding from ourselves, until we go mad. And end up in here.’ ‘Do you like it in here?’ She laughed again, but I noticed her kind of laughing somehow made her look sadder. ‘No. This place is a whirlpool. It sucks you deeper. You want out of this place, man. Everyone in here is off the charts, I tell you.’ She pointed at various people in the room, and told me what was wrong with them. She started with an over-sized, red-faced female at the nearest table to us. ‘That’s Fat Anna. She steals everything. Look at her with the fork. Straight up her sleeve . . . Oh, and that’s Scott. He thinks he’s the third in line to the throne . . . And Sarah, who is totally normal for most of the day and then at a quarter past four starts screaming for no reason. Got to have a screamer . . . and that’s Crying Chris . . . and there’s Bridget the Fidget who’s always moving around at the speed of thought . . .’ ‘The speed of thought,’ I said. ‘That slow?’ ‘. . . and . . . Lying Lisa . . . and Rocking Rajesh. Oh, oh yeah, and you see that guy over there, with the sideburns? The tall one, mumbling to his tray?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Well, he’s gone the full K-Pax.’ ‘What?’ ‘He’s so cracked he thinks he’s from another planet.’ ‘No,’ I said. ‘Really?’ ‘Yeah. Trust me. In this canteen we’re just one mute Native American away from a full cuckoo’s nest.’ I had no idea what she was talking about. She looked at my plate. ‘Are you not eating that?’ ‘No,’ I said. ‘I don’t think I could.’ And then, thinking I might get some information out of her, I asked, ‘If I had done something, achieved something remarkable, do you think I would have told a lot of people? I mean, we humans are proud aren’t we? We like to show off about things.’ ‘Yes, I suppose.’ ‘Yes, I suppose.’ I nodded. Felt panic rising as I wondered how many people knew about Professor Andrew Martin’s discovery. Then I decided to broaden my enquiry. To act like a human I would after all need to understand them, so I asked her the biggest question I could think of. ‘What do you think the meaning of life is, then? Did you discover it?’ ‘Ha! The meaning of life. The meaning of life. There is none. People search for external values and meaning in a world which not only can’t provide it but is also indifferent to their quest. That’s not really Schopenhauer. That’s more Kierkegaard via Camus. I’m with them. Trouble is, if you study philosophy and stop believing in a meaning you start to need medical help.’ ‘What about love? What is love all about? I read about it. In Cosmopolitan.’ Another laugh. ‘Cosmopolitan? Are you joking?’ ‘No. Not at all. I want to understand these things.’ ‘You’re definitely asking the wrong person here. See, that’s one of my problems.’ She lowered her voice by at least two octaves, stared darkly. ‘I like violent men. I don’t know why. It’s a kind of self-harm thing. I go to Peterborough a lot. Rich pickings.’ ‘Oh,’ I said, realising it was right I had been sent here. The humans were as weird as I had been told, and as in love with violence. ‘So love is about finding the right person to hurt you?’ ‘Pretty much.’ ‘That doesn’t make sense.’ ‘“There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.” That was . . . someone.’ There was a silence. I wanted to leave. Not knowing the etiquette, I just stood up and left. She released a little whine. And then laughed again. Laughter, like madness, seemed to be the only way out, the emergency exit for humans. I went over optimistically to the man mumbling to his tray. The apparent extraterrestrial. I spoke to him for a while. I asked him, with considerable hope, where he was from. He said Tatooine. A place I had never heard of. He said he lived near the Great Pit of Carkoon, a short drive from Jabba’s Palace. He used to live with the Skywalkers, on their farm, but it burned down. ‘How far away is your planet? From Earth, I mean.’ ‘Very far.’ ‘How far?’ ‘Fifty thousand miles,’ he said, crushing my hope, and making me wish I’d never diverted my attention away from the plant with the lush green leaves. I looked at him. For a moment, I had thought I wasn’t alone among them but I looked at him. For a moment, I had thought I wasn’t alone among them but now I knew I was. So, I thought to myself as I walked away, this is what happens when you live on Earth. You crack. You hold reality in your hands until it burns and then you have to drop the plate. (Someone somewhere else in the room, just as I was thinking this, actually did drop a plate.) Yes, I could see it now – being a human sent you insane. I looked out of a large glass rectangular window and saw trees and buildings, cars and people. Clearly, this was a species not capable of handling the new plate Andrew Martin had just handed them. I really needed to get out of there and do my duty. I thought of Isobel, my wife. She had knowledge, the kind of knowledge I needed. I should have left with her. ‘What am I doing?’ I walked towards the window, expecting it to be like windows on my planet, Vonnadoria, but it wasn’t. It was made of glass. Which was made of rock. And instead of walking through it I banged my nose into it, prompting a few yelps of laughter from other patients. I left the room, quite desperate to escape all the people, and the smell of cow and carrots. Amnesia Acting human was one thing, but if Andrew Martin had told people then I really could not afford to waste any more time in this place. Looking at my left hand and the gifts it contained, I knew what I had to do. After lunch, I visited the nurse who had sat watching me talk to Isobel. I lowered my voice to just the right frequency. I slowed the words to just the right speed. To hypnotise a human was easy because, out of any species in the universe, they seemed the one most desperate to believe. ‘I am perfectly sane. I would like to see the doctor who can discharge me. I really need to get back home, to see my wife and child, and to continue my work at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge University. Plus, I really don’t like the food here. I don’t know what happened this morning, I really don’t. It was an embarrassing public display, but I wholeheartedly assure you that whatever it was I suffered, it was temporary. I am sane, now, and I am happy. I feel very well indeed.’ He nodded. ‘Follow me,’ he said. The doctor wanted me to have some medical tests. A brain scan. They were worried about possible damage to my cerebral cortex which could have prompted amnesia. I realised whatever else was to occur the one thing that couldn’t possibly happen to me was to have my brain looked at, not while the gifts were active. So, I convinced him I was not suffering from amnesia. I made up a lot of memories. I made up a whole life. I told him that I had been under a lot of pressure at work and he understood. He then asked me some more questions. But as with all human questions the answers were always there, inside them like protons inside an atom, for me to locate and give as my own independent thoughts. After half an hour the diagnosis was clear. I hadn’t lost my memory. I had simply suffered a period of temporary insanity. Although he disapproved of the term ‘breakdown’ he said I had suffered a ‘mental collapse’ due to sleep- deprivation and work pressures and a diet which, as Isobel had already informed the doctor, consisted largely of strong black coffee – a drink, of course, I already knew I hated. knew I hated. The doctor then gave me some prompts, wondering if I’d suffered from panic attacks, low moods, nervous jolts, sudden behavioural swings or feelings of unreality. ‘Unreality?’ I could ponder with conviction. ‘Oh yes, I have definitely been feeling that one. But not any more. I feel fine. I feel very real. I feel as real as the sun.’ The doctor smiled. He told me he had read one of my books on mathematics – an apparently ‘really funny’ memoir of Andrew Martin’s time teaching at Princeton University. The book I had seen already. The one called American Pi. He wrote me a prescription for more diazepam and advised I take things ‘one day at a time’, as if there were another way for days to be experienced. And then he picked up the most primitive piece of telecommunications technology I had ever seen and told Isobel to come and take me home. Remember, during your mission, never to become influenced or corrupted. The humans are an arrogant species, defined by violence and greed. They have taken their home planet, the only one they currently have access to, and placed it on the road to destruction. They have created a world of divisions and categories and have continually failed to see the similarities between themselves. They have developed technology at a rate too fast for human psychology to keep up with, and yet they still pursue advancement for advancement’s sake, and for the pursuit of the money and fame they all crave so much. You must never fall into the human’s trap. You must never look at an individual and fail to see their relation to the crimes of the whole. Every smiling human face hides the terrors they are all capable of, and are all responsible for, however indirectly. You must never soften, or shrink from your task. Stay pure. Retain your logic. Do not let anyone interfere with the mathematical certainty of what needs to be done. 4 Campion Row It was a warm room. There was a window, but the curtains were drawn. They were thin enough for electromagnetic radiation from the only sun to filter through and I could see everything clear enough. The walls were painted sky-blue, and there was an incandescent ‘lightbulb’ hanging down from the ceiling with a cylindrical shade made of paper. I was lying in bed. It was a large, square bed, made for two people. I had been lying asleep in this same bed for over three hours, and now I was awake. It was Professor Andrew Martin’s bed, on the second floor of his house. His house was at 4 Campion Row. It was large, compared to the exteriors of other houses I had seen. Inside, all the walls were white. Downstairs, in the hallway and the kitchen, the floor was made of limestone, which was made of calcite, and so provided something familiar for me to look at. The kitchen, where I had gone to drink some water, was especially warm owing to the presence of something called an oven. This particular type of oven was made of iron and powered by gas, with two continually hot discs on its top surface. It was called an AGA. It was cream-coloured. There were lots of doors in the kitchen and also here in the bedroom. Oven doors and cupboard doors and wardrobe doors. Whole worlds shut away. The bedroom had a beige carpet, made of wool. Animal hair. There was a poster on the wall which had a picture of two human heads, one male and one female, very close together. It had the words Roman Holiday on it. Other words, too. Words like ‘Gregory Peck’ and ‘Audrey Hepburn’ and ‘Paramount Pictures’. There was a photograph on top of a wooden, cuboid piece of furniture. A photograph is basically a two-dimensional nonmoving holograph catering only to the sense of sight. This photograph was inside a rectangle of steel. A photograph of Andrew and Isobel. They were younger, their skins more radiant and unwithered. Isobel looked happy, because she was smiling and a smile is a signifier of human happiness. In the photograph Andrew and Isobel were signifier of human happiness. In the photograph Andrew and Isobel were standing on grass. She was wearing a white dress. It seemed to be the dress to wear if you wanted to be happy. There was another photo. They were standing somewhere hot. Neither of them had dresses on. They were among giant, crumbling stone columns under a perfectly blue sky. An important building from a former human civilisation. (On Earth, incidentally, civilisation is the result of a group of humans coming together and suppressing their instincts.) The civilisation, I guessed, was one that must have been neglected or destroyed. They were smiling, but this was a different kind of smile and one which was confined to their mouths and not their eyes. They looked uncomfortable, though I attributed this to the heat on their thin skin. Then there was a later photograph, taken indoors somewhere. They had a child with them. Young. Male. He had hair as dark as his mother, maybe darker, with paler skin. He was wearing an item of clothing which said ‘Cowboy’. Isobel was there in the room a lot of the time, either sleeping beside me or standing nearby, watching. Mostly, I tried not to look at her. I didn’t want to connect to her in any way. It would not serve my mission well if any kind of sympathy, or even empathy towards her were to form. Admittedly, this was unlikely. Her very otherness troubled me. She was so alien. But the universe was unlikely before it happened and it had almost indisputably happened. Though I did brave her eyes for one question. ‘When did you last see me? I mean, before. Yesterday?’ ‘At breakfast. And then you were at work. You came home at eleven. In bed by half past.’ ‘Did I say anything to you? Did I tell you anything?’ ‘You said my name, but I pretended to be sleeping. And that was it. Until I woke up, and you were gone.’ I smiled. Relieved, I suppose, but back then I didn’t quite understand why. The war and money show I watched the ‘television’ she had brought in for me. She had struggled with it. It was heavy for her. I think she expected me to help her. It seemed so wrong, watching a biological life form putting herself through such effort. I was confused and wondered why she would do it for me. I attempted, out of sheer telekinetic curiosity, to lighten it for her with my mind. ‘That was easier than I was expecting,’ she said. ‘Oh,’ I said, catching her gaze face-on. ‘Well, expectation is a funny thing.’ ‘You still like to watch the news, don’t you?’ Watch the news. That was a very good idea. The news might have something for me. ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘I like to watch the news.’ I watched it, and Isobel watched me, both equally troubled by what we saw. The news was full of human faces, but generally smaller ones, and often at a great distance away. Within my first hour of watching, I discovered three interesting details. 1. The term ‘news’ on Earth generally meant ‘news that directly affects humans’. There was, quite literally, nothing about the antelope or the sea-horse or the red-eared slider turtle or the other nine million species on the planet. 2. The news was prioritised in a way I could not understand. For instance, there was nothing on new mathematical observations or still undiscovered polygons, but quite a bit about politics, which on this planet was essentially all about war and money. Indeed, war and money seemed to be so popular on the news it should more accurately be described as The War and Money Show. I had been told right. This was a planet characterised by violence and greed. A bomb had exploded in a country called Afghanistan. Elsewhere, people were worrying about the nuclear capability of North Korea. So-called stock markets were falling. This worried a lot of humans, who gazed up at screens full of numbers, studying them as if they displayed the only mathematics that it)] The distribution of prime numbers I looked at Andrew Martin’s emails, specifically the very last one in his sent folder. It had the subject heading, ‘153 years later . . .’, and it had a little red exclamation mark beside it. The message itself was a simple one: ‘I have proved the Riemann hypothesis, haven’t I? Need to tell you first. Please, Daniel, cast your eyes over this. Oh, and needless to say, this is for those eyes only at the moment. Until it goes public. What do you reckon? Humans will never be the same again? Biggest news anywhere since 1905? See attachment.’ The attachment was the document I had deleted elsewhere, and had just been reading, so I didn’t waste much time on that. Instead, I looked at the recipient: daniel.russell@cambridge.ac.uk. Daniel Russell, I swiftly discovered, was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University. He was sixty-three years old. He had written fourteen books, most of which had been international bestsellers. The Internet told me he had taught at every English-language university with an intimidating enough reputation – Cambridge (where he was now), Oxford, Harvard, Princeton and Yale among others – and had received numerous awards and titles. He had worked on quite a few academic papers with Andrew Martin, but as far as I could tell from my brief research they were colleagues more than friends. I looked at the time. In about twenty minutes my ‘wife’ would be coming home and wondering where I was. The less suspicion there was at this stage the better. There was a sequence of doing things, after all. I had to follow the sequence. And the first part of the sequence needed to be done right now, so I trashed the email and the attachment. Then, to be on the safe side, I quickly designed a virus – yes, with the help of primes – which would ensure that nothing could be accessed intact from this computer again. Before I left, I checked the papers on the desk. There was nothing there to be worried about. Insignificant letters, timetables, blank pages, but then, on one of them, a telephone number 07865542187. I put it in my pocket and noticed, as I them, a telephone number 07865542187. I put it in my pocket and noticed, as I did so, one of the photographs on the desk. Isobel, Andrew and the boy I assumed to be Gulliver. He had dark hair, and was the only one of the three who wasn’t smiling. He had wide eyes, peeping out from below a dark fringe of hair. He carried the ugliness of his species better than most. At least he wasn’t looking happy about what he was, and that was something. Another minute had gone by. It was time to go. We are pleased with your progress. But now the real work must begin. Yes. Deleting documents from computers is not the same as deleting lives. Even human lives. I understand that. A prime number is strong. It does not depend on others. It is pure and complete and never weakens. You must be like a prime. You must not weaken, you must distance yourself, and you must not change after interaction. You must be indivisible. Yes. I will be. Good. Now, continue. Glory Isobel was still not back, on my return to the house, so I did a little more research. She was not a mathematician. She was a historian. On Earth, this was an important distinction as here history was not yet viewed as a sub-division of mathematics, which of course it was. I also discovered that Isobel, like her husband, was considered to be very clever by the standards of her species. I knew this because one of the books on the shelf in the bedroom was The Dark Ages, the one I had seen in the bookshop window. And now I could see it had a quote from a publication called the New York Times which read ‘very clever’. The book was 1,253 pages long. A door opened downstairs. I heard the soft sound of metal keys being rested on a wooden chest. She came up to see me. That was the first thing she did. ‘How are you?’ she asked. ‘I’ve been looking at your book. About the Dark Ages.’ She laughed. ‘What are you laughing at?’ ‘Oh, it’s that or cry.’ ‘Listen,’ I said, ‘do you know where Daniel Russell lives?’ ‘Of course I do. We’ve been to his house for dinner.’ ‘Where does he live?’ ‘In Babraham. He’s got a whopping place. Can you seriously not remember? It’s like not remembering a visit to Nero’s palace.’ ‘Yes. I can, I can. It’s just that there are things which are still a bit hazy. I think it’s the pills. That was a blank, so that’s why I asked. That’s all. So, I’m good friends with him?’ ‘No. You hate him. You can’t stand him. Though deep hostility is your default setting with other academics these days, Ari excepted.’ ‘Ari?’ She sighed. ‘Your best friend.’ ‘Oh, Ari. Yes. Of course. Ari. My ears are a bit blocked. I didn’t hear you properly.’ properly.’ ‘But with Daniel,’ she said, speaking a little louder, ‘if I dare say it, the hatred is just the manifestation of an inferiority complex on your part. But superficially, you get on with him. You’ve even sought his guidance a few times, with your prime number stuff.’ ‘Right. Okay. My prime number stuff. Yes. And where am I with that? Where was I? When I last spoke to you, before?’ I felt the urge to ask it outright. ‘Had I proved the Riemann hypothesis?’ ‘No. You hadn’t. At least, not that I knew. But you should probably check that out, because if you have we’ll be a million pounds richer.’ ‘What?’ ‘Dollars, actually, isn’t it?’ ‘I—’ ‘The Millennium Prize, or whatever it is. Proof of the Riemann hypothesis is the largest remaining puzzle that hasn’t been solved. There is an institute in Massachusetts, the other Cambridge, the Clay Institute . . . You know this stuff backwards, Andrew. You mumble this stuff in your sleep.’ ‘Absolutely. Backwards and forwards. All the ways. I just need a little reminding that is all.’ ‘Well, it’s a very wealthy institute. They obviously have a lot of money because they’ve already given about ten million dollars away to other mathematicians. Apart from that last guy.’ ‘Last guy?’ ‘The Russian. Grigori something. The one who turned it down for solving the Whatever-it-was Conjecture.’ ‘But a million dollars is a lot of money, isn’t it?’ ‘It is. It’s a nice amount.’ ‘So why did he turn it down?’ ‘How do I know? I don’t know. You told me he was a recluse who lives with his mother. There are people in this world who have motives that extend beyond the financial, Andrew.’ This was genuinely news to me. ‘Are there?’ ‘Yes. There are. Because, you know, there’s this new groundbreaking and controversial theory that money can’t buy you happiness.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. She laughed again. She was trying to be funny, I think, so I laughed, too. ‘So, no one has solved the Riemann hypothesis?’ ‘What? Since yesterday?’ ‘Since, well, ever?’ ‘No. No one has solved it. There was a false alarm, a few years back. ‘No. No one has solved it. There was a false alarm, a few years back. Someone from France. But no. The money is still there.’ ‘So, that is why he . . . why I . . . this is what motivates me, money?’ She was now arranging socks on the bed, in pairs. It was a terrible system she had developed. ‘Not just that,’ she went on. ‘Glory is what motivates you. Ego. You want your name everywhere. Andrew Martin. Andrew Martin. Andrew Martin. You want to be on every Wikipedia page going. You want to be an Einstein. The trouble is, Andrew, you’re still two years old.’ This confused me. ‘I am? How is that possible?’ ‘Your mother never gave you the love you needed. You will for ever be sucking at a nipple that offers no milk. You want the world to know you. You want to be a great man.’ She said this in quite a cool tone. I wondered if this was how people always talked to each other, or if it was just unique to spouses. I heard a key enter a lock. Isobel looked at me with wide, astonished eyes. ‘Gulliver.’ Dark matter Gulliver’s room was at the top of the house. The ‘attic’. The last stop before the thermosphere. He went straight there, his feet passing the bedroom I was in, with only the slightest pause before climbing the final set of stairs. While Isobel went out to walk the dog I decided to phone the number on the piece of paper in my pocket. Maybe it was Daniel Russell’s number. ‘Hello,’ came a voice. Female. ‘Who’s this?’ ‘This is Professor Andrew Martin,’ I said. The female laughed. ‘Well hello, Professor Andrew Martin.’ ‘Who are you? Do you know me?’ ‘You’re on YouTube. Everyone knows you now. You’ve gone viral. The Naked Professor.’ ‘Oh.’ ‘Hey, don’t worry about it. Everyone loves an exhibitionist.’ She spoke slowly, lingering on words as if each one had a taste she didn’t want to lose. ‘Please, how do I know you?’ The question was never answered, because at that precise moment Gulliver walked into the room and I switched off the phone. Gulliver. My ‘son’. The dark-haired boy I had seen in the photographs. He looked as I had expected, but maybe taller. He was nearly as tall as me. His eyes were shaded by his hair. (Hair, by the way, is very important here. Not as important as clothes obviously, but getting there. To humans, hair is more than just a filamentous biomaterial that happens to grow out of their heads. It carries all kinds of social signifiers, most of which I couldn’t translate.) His clothes were as black as space and his T-shirt had the words ‘Dark Matter’ on them. Maybe this was how certain people communicated, via the slogans on their T- shirts. He wore ‘wristbands’. His hands were in his pockets and he seemed uncomfortable looking at my face. (The feeling, then, was mutual.) His voice was low. Or at least low by human standards. About the same depth as a Vonnadorian humming plant. He came and sat on the bed and tried to be nice, at the start, but then at one point he switched to a higher frequency. the start, but then at one point he switched to a higher frequency. ‘Dad, why did you do it?’ ‘I don’t know.’ ‘School is going to be hell now.’ ‘Oh.’ ‘Is that all you can say? “Oh?” Are you serious? Is that fucking it?’ ‘No. Yes. I, I fucking don’t fucking know, Gulliver.’ ‘Well, you’ve destroyed my life. I’m a joke. It was bad before. Ever since I started there. But now—’ I wasn’t listening. I was thinking about Daniel Russell, and how I desperately needed to phone him. Gulliver noticed I wasn’t paying attention. ‘It doesn’t even matter. You never want to talk to me, apart from last night.’ Gulliver left the room. He slammed the door, and let out a kind of growl. He was fifteen years old. This meant he belonged to a special sub-category of human called a ‘teenager’, the chief characteristics of which were a weakened resistance to gravity, a vocabulary of grunts, a lack of spatial awareness, copious amounts of masturbation, and an unending appetite for cereal. Last night. I got out of bed and headed upstairs to the attic. I knocked on his door. There was no reply but I opened it anyway. Inside, the environment was one of prevailing dark. There were posters for musicians. Thermostat, Skrillex, The Fetid, Mother Night, and the Dark Matter his T-shirt referenced. There was a window sloped in line with the ceiling, but the blind was drawn. There was a book on the bed. It was called Ham on Rye, by Charles Bukowski. There were clothes on the floor. Together, the room was a data cloud of despair. I sensed he wanted to be put out of his misery, one way or another. That would come, of course, but first there would be a few more questions. He didn’t hear me enter owing to the audio transmitter he had plugged into his ears. Nor did he see me, as he was too busy staring at his computer. On the screen, there was a still-motion image of myself naked, walking past one of the university buildings. There was also some writing on the screen. At the top were the words ‘Gulliver Martin, You Must Be So Proud’. Underneath, there were lots of comments. A typical example read, ‘HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! Oh almost forgot – HA!’ I read the name next to that particular post. ‘Who is Theo “The Fucking Business” Clarke?’ Gulliver jumped at my voice and turned around. I asked my question again but didn’t receive an answer. ‘What are you doing?’ I asked, purely for research purposes. ‘What are you doing?’ I asked, purely for research purposes. ‘Just go away.’ ‘I want to talk to you. I want to talk about last night.’ He turned his back to me. His torso stiffened. ‘Go away, Dad.’ ‘No. I want to know what I said to you.’ He sprang out of his chair and, as the humans say, stormed over to me. ‘Just leave me alone, okay? You’ve never been interested in a single thing about my life so don’t start now. Why fucking start now?’ I watched the back of him in the small, circular mirror staring out from the wall like a dull and unblinking eye. After some aggressive pacing he sat back in his chair, turned to his computer again, and pressed his finger on an odd-looking command device. ‘I need to know something,’ I said. ‘I need to know if you know what I was doing. Last week at work?’ ‘Dad, just—’ ‘Listen, this is important. Were you still up when I came home? You know, last night? Were you in the house? Were you awake?’ He mumbled something. I didn’t hear what. Only an ipsoid would have heard it. ‘Gulliver, how are you at mathematics?’ ‘You know how I fucking am at maths.’ ‘Fucking no, I don’t. Not now. That is why I am fucking asking. Tell me what you fucking know.’ Nothing. I thought I was using his language, but Gulliver just sat there, staring away from me, with his right leg jerking up and down in slight but rapid movements. My words were having no effect. I thought of the audio transmitter he still had in one ear. Maybe it was sending radio signals. I waited a little while longer and sensed it was time to leave. But as I headed for the door he said, ‘Yeah. I was up. You told me.’ My heart raced. ‘What? What did I tell you?’ ‘About you being the saviour of the human race or something.’ ‘Anything more specific? Did I go into detail?’ ‘You proved your precious Rainman hypothesis.’ ‘Riemann. Riemann. The Riemann hypothesis. I told you that, fucking did I?’ ‘Yeah,’ he said, in the same glum tone. ‘First time you’d spoken to me in a week.’ ‘Who have you told?’ ‘What? Dad, I think people are more interested in the fact that you walked around the town centre naked, to be honest. No one’s going to care about some equation.’ equation.’ ‘But your mother? Have you told her? She must have asked you if I’d spoken to you, after I’d gone missing. Surely she asked you that?’ He shrugged. (A shrug, I realised, was one of the main modes of communication for teenagers.) ‘Yeah.’ ‘And? What did you say? Come on, speak to me, Gulliver. What does she know about it?’ He turned and looked me straight in the eye. He was frowning. Angry. Confused. ‘I don’t fucking believe you, Dad.’ ‘Fucking believe?’ ‘You’re the parent, I’m the kid. I’m the one who should be wrapped up in myself, not you. I’m fifteen and you’re forty-three. If you are genuinely ill, Dad, then I want to be there for you, but aside from your new-found love of streaking and your weird fucking swearing you are acting very, very, very much like yourself. But here’s a newsflash. You ready? We don’t actually care about your prime numbers. We don’t care about your precious fucking work or your stupid fucking books or your genius-like brain or your ability to solve the world’s greatest outstanding mathematical whatever because, because, because all these things hurt us.’ ‘Hurt you?’ Maybe the boy was wiser than he looked. ‘What do you mean by that?’ His eyes stayed on me. His chest rose and fell with visible intensity. ‘Nothing,’ he said at last. ‘But, the answer is no, I didn’t tell Mum. I said you said something about work. That’s all. I didn’t think it was relevant information right then to tell her about your fucking hypothesis.’ ‘But the money. You know about that?’ ‘Yeah, course I do.’ ‘And you still didn’t think it was a big deal?’ ‘Dad, we have quite a lot of money in the bank. We have one of the biggest houses in Cambridge. I’m probably the richest kid in my school now. But it doesn’t amount to shit. It isn’t the Perse, remember?’ ‘The Perse?’ ‘That school you spent twenty grand a year on. You’ve forgotten that? Who the hell are you? Jason Bourne?’ ‘No. I am not.’ ‘You probably forgot I was expelled, too.’ ‘No,’ I lied. ‘Course I haven’t.’ ‘I don’t think more money’s going to save us.’ I was genuinely confused. This went against everything we were meant to know about the humans. know about the humans. ‘No,’ I said. ‘You’re right. It won’t. And besides, it was a mistake. I haven’t proved the Riemann hypothesis. I think in fact it is unprovable. I thought I had, but I haven’t. So there is nothing to tell anyone.’ At which Gulliver pushed the audio-transmission device into his other ear and closed his eyes. He wanted no more of me. ‘Fucking okay,’ I whispered and left the room. Emily Dickinson I went downstairs and found an ‘address book’. Inside were addresses and telephone numbers for people, listed alphabetically. I found the telephone number I was looking for. A woman told me Daniel Russell was out but would be back in around an hour. He would phone me back. Meanwhile, I perused some more history books and learnt things as I read between the lines. As well as religion, human history is full of depressing things like colonisation, disease, racism, sexism, homophobia, class snobbery, environmental destruction, slavery, totalitarianism, military dictatorships, inventions of things which they have no idea how to handle (the atomic bomb, the Internet, the semi-colon), the victimisation of clever people, the worshipping of idiotic people, boredom, despair, periodic collapses, and catastrophes within the psychic landscape. And through it all there has always been some truly awful food. I found a book called The Great American Poets. ‘I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,’ wrote someone called Walt Whitman. It was an obvious point, but something about it was quite beautiful. In the same book, there were words written by another poet. The poet was Emily Dickinson. The words were these: How happy is the little stone That rambles in the road alone, And doesn’t care about careers, And exigencies never fears; Whose coat of elemental brown A passing universe put on; And independent as the sun, Associates or glows alone, Fulfilling absolute decree In casual simplicity. Fulfilling absolute decree, I thought. Why do these words trouble me? The dog growled at me. I turned the page and found more unlikely wisdom. I read the words aloud to myself: ‘The soul should always stand ajar, ready to welcome the ecstatic experience.’ ‘You’re out of bed,’ said Isobel. ‘Yes,’ I said. To be a human is to state the obvious. Repeatedly, over and over, until the end of time. ‘You need to eat,’ she added, after studying my face. ‘Yes,’ I said. She got out some ingredients. Gulliver walked past the doorway. ‘Gull, where are you going? I’m making dinner.’ The boy said nothing as he left. The slam of the door almost shook the house. ‘I’m worried about him,’ said Isobel. As she worried, I studied the ingredients on the worktop. Mainly green vegetation. But then something else. Chicken breast. I thought about this. And I kept thinking. The breast of a chicken. The breast of a chicken. The breast of a chicken. ‘That looks like meat,’ I said. ‘I’m going to make a stir-fry.’ ‘With that?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘The breast of a chicken?’ ‘Yes, Andrew. Or are you vegetarian now?’ The dog was in his basket. It went by the name of Newton. It was still growling at me. ‘What about the dog’s breasts? Are we going to eat those, too?’ ‘No,’ she said, with resignation. I was testing her. ‘Is a dog more intelligent than a chicken?’ ‘Yes,’ she said. She closed her eyes. ‘I don’t know. No. I haven’t got time for this. Anyway, you’re the big meat eater.’ I was uncomfortable. ‘I would rather not eat the chicken’s breasts.’ Isobel now clenched her eyes closed. She inhaled deeply. ‘Give me strength,’ she whispered. I could have done so, of course. But I needed what strength I had right now. Isobel handed me my diazepam. ‘Have you taken one lately?’ ‘No.’ ‘You probably should.’ So I humoured her. I unscrewed the cap and placed a pill on my palm. These ones looked like word-capsules. As green as knowledge. I popped a tablet in my mouth. Be careful. Dishwasher I ate the vegetable stir-fry. It smelt like Bazadean body waste. I tried not to look at it, so I looked at Isobel instead. It was the first time that looking at a human face was the easiest option. But I did need to eat. So I ate. ‘When you spoke to Gulliver about me going missing did he say anything to you?’ ‘Yes,’ she said. ‘What was it that he said?’ ‘That you came in about eleven, and that you’d gone into the living room where he was watching TV and that you’d told him that you were sorry you were late, but you’d been finishing something off at work.’ ‘Was that it? There was nothing more specific?’ ‘No.’ ‘What do you think he meant by that? I mean: what I meant by that?’ ‘I don’t know. But I have to say, you coming home and being friendly to Gulliver. That’s already out of character.’ ‘Why? Don’t I like him?’ ‘Not since two years ago. No. Pains me to say it, but you don’t act very much like you do.’ ‘Two years ago?’ ‘Since he got expelled from Perse. For starting a fire.’ ‘Oh yes. The fire incident.’ ‘I want you to start making an effort with him.’ Afterwards, I followed Isobel into the kitchen putting my plate and cutlery in the dishwasher. I was noticing more things about her. At first, I had just seen her as generically human but now I was appreciating the details. Picking up things I hadn’t noticed – differences between her and the others. She was wearing a cardigan and blue trousers known as jeans. Her long neck was decorated with a thin necklace made out of silver. Her eyes stared deep into things, as though she was continually searching for something that wasn’t there. Or as if it was there, but just out of sight. It was as though everything had a depth, an internal distance but just out of sight. It was as though everything had a depth, an internal distance to it. ‘How are you feeling?’ she asked. She seemed worried about something. ‘I feel fine.’ ‘I only ask because you’re loading the dishwasher.’ ‘Because that’s what you are doing.’ ‘Andrew, you never load the dishwasher. You are, and I mean this in the least offensive way possible, something of a domestic primitive.’ ‘Why? Don’t mathematicians load dishwashers?’ ‘In this house,’ she said sadly, ‘no, actually. No, they don’t.’ ‘Oh yes. I know. Obviously. I just fancied helping today. I help sometimes.’ ‘Now we’re on to fractions.’ She looked at my jumper. There was a bit of noodle resting on the blue wool. She picked it off, and stroked the fabric where it had been. She smiled, quickly. She cared about me. She had her reservations, but she cared. I didn’t want her to care about me. It wouldn’t help things. She placed her hand through my hair, to tidy it a bit. To my surprise, I wasn’t flinching. ‘Einstein chic is one thing but this is ridiculous,’ she said, softly. I smiled like I understood. She smiled too, but it was a smile on top of something else. As if she was wearing a mask, and there was a near-identical but less smiling face underneath. ‘It’s almost like an alien clone is in my kitchen.’ ‘Almost,’ I said. ‘Yes.’ It was then that the telephone rang. Isobel went to answer it and a moment later came back into the kitchen, holding out the receiver. ‘It’s for you,’ she said, in a suddenly serious voice. Her eyes were wide, trying to convey a silent message I didn’t quite understand. ‘Hello?’ I said. There was a long pause. The sound of breath, and then a voice on the next exhalation. A man, talking slowly and carefully. ‘Andrew? Is that you?’ ‘Yes. Who’s this?’ ‘It’s Daniel. Daniel Russell.’ My heart tripped. I realised this was it, the moment things had to change. ‘Oh hello, Daniel.’ ‘How are you? I hear you might be unwell.’ ‘Oh, I am fine, really. It was just a little bit of mental exhaustion. My mind had run its own marathon and it struggled. My brain is made for sprints. It doesn’t have the stamina for long-distance running. But don’t worry, honestly, I am back where I was. It wasn’t anything too serious. Nothing that the right medication couldn’t suppress, anyway.’ medication couldn’t suppress, anyway.’ ‘Well, that is good to hear. I was worried about you. Anyway, I was hoping to talk to you about that remarkable email you sent me.’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘But let’s not do this over the phone. Let’s chat face-to-face. It would be good to see you.’ Isobel frowned. ‘What a good idea. Should I come to you?’ ‘No,’ I said, with a degree of firmness. ‘No. I’ll come to you.’ We are waiting. A large house Isobel had offered to drive me, and had tried to insist on it, saying I wasn’t ready to leave the house. Of course, I had already left the house, to go to Fitzwilliam College, but she hadn’t known about that. I said I felt like some exercise and Daniel needed to speak to me quite urgently about something, possibly some kind of job offer. I told her I’d have my phone on me and that she knew where I was. And so eventually I was able to take the address from Isobel’s notebook, leave the house and head to Babraham. To a large house, the largest I’d seen. Daniel Russell’s wife answered the door. She was a very tall, broad- shouldered woman, with quite long grey hair and aged skin. ‘Oh, Andrew.’ She held out her arms wide. I replicated the gesture. And she kissed me on the cheek. She smelt of soap and spices. It was clear she knew me. She couldn’t stop saying my name. ‘Andrew, Andrew, how are you?’ she asked me. ‘I heard about your little misadventure.’ ‘Well, I am all right. It was a, well, an episode. But I’m over it. The story continues.’ She studied me a little more and then opened the door wide. She beckoned me inside, smiling broadly. I stepped into the hallway. ‘Do you know why I am here?’ ‘To see Him Upstairs,’ she said, pointing to the ceiling. ‘Yes, but do you know why I am here to see him?’ She was puzzled by my manner but she tried her best to hide it beneath a kind of energetic and chaotic politeness. ‘No, Andrew,’ she said, quickly. ‘As a matter of fact, he didn’t say.’ I nodded. I noticed a large ceramic vase on the floor. It had a yellow pattern of flowers on it, and I wondered why people bothered with such empty vessels. What was their significance? Maybe I would never know. We passed a room, with a sofa and a television and bookcases and dark red walls. Blood-coloured. with a sofa and a television and bookcases and dark red walls. Blood-coloured. ‘Do you want a coffee? Fruit juice? We’ve acquired a taste for pomegranate juice. Though Daniel believes antioxidants are a marketing ploy.’ ‘I would like a water if that’s okay.’ We were in the kitchen now. It was about twice the size of Andrew Martin’s kitchen, but it was so cluttered it felt no bigger. There were saucepans hanging above my head. There was an envelope on the unit addressed to ‘Daniel and Tabitha Russell’. Tabitha poured me water from a jug. ‘I’d offer you a slice of lemon but I think we’re out. There’s one in the bowl but it must be blue by now. The cleaners never sort the fruit out. They won’t touch it. ‘And Daniel won’t eat fruit. Even though the doctor has told him he’s got to. But then the doctor has told him to relax and slow down, too, and he doesn’t do that either.’ ‘Oh. Why?’ She looked baffled. ‘His heart attack. You remember that? You aren’t the only frazzled mathematician in the world.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. ‘How is he?’ ‘Well, he’s on beta-blockers. I’m trying to get him on muesli and skimmed milk and to take it easier.’ ‘His heart,’ I said, thinking aloud. ‘Yes. His heart.’ ‘That is one of the reasons I came, in fact.’ She handed me a glass and I took a sip. As I did so, I thought of the startling capacity for belief inherent in this species. Even before I had fully discovered the concepts of astrology, homeopathy, organised religion and probiotic yoghurts I was able to work out that what humans may have lacked in physical attractiveness, they made up for in gullibility. You could tell them anything in a convincing enough voice and they would believe it. Anything, of course, except the truth. ‘Where is he?’ ‘In his study. Upstairs.’ ‘His study?’ ‘You know where that is, don’t you?’ ‘Of course. Of course. I know where that is.’ Daniel Russell Of course, I had been lying. I had no idea where Daniel Russell’s study was, and this was a very big house, but as I was walking along the first-floor landing I heard a voice. The same dry voice I had heard on the phone. ‘Is that the saviour of mankind?’ I followed the voice all the way to the third doorway on the left, which was half-open. I could see framed pieces of paper lining a wall. I pushed open the door and saw a bald man with a sharp angular face and a small – in human terms – mouth. He was smartly dressed. He was wearing a red bow tie and a checked shirt. ‘Pleased to see you’re wearing clothes,’ he said, suppressing a sly smile. ‘Our neighbours are people of delicate sensibilities.’ ‘Yes. I am wearing the right amount of clothes. Don’t worry about that.’ He nodded, and kept nodding, as he leant back in his chair and scratched his chin. A computer screen glowed behind him, full of Andrew Martin’s curves and formulas. I could smell coffee. I noticed an empty cup. Two of them, in fact. ‘I have looked at it. And I have looked at it again. This must have taken you to the edge, I can see that. This is something. You must have been burning yourself with this, Andrew. I’ve been burning just reading through it.’ ‘I worked very hard,’ I said. ‘I was lost in it. But that happens, doesn’t it, with numbers?’ He listened with concern. ‘Did they prescribe anything?’ he asked. ‘Diazepam.’ ‘Do you feel it’s working?’ ‘I do. I do. I feel it is working. Everything feels a little bit alien I would say, a tad other-worldly, as if the atmosphere is slightly different, and the gravity has slightly less pull, and even something as familiar as an empty coffee cup has a terrible difference to it. You know, from my perspective. Even you. You seem quite hideous to me. Almost terrifying.’ Daniel Russell laughed. It wasn’t a happy laugh. Daniel Russell laughed. It wasn’t a happy laugh. ‘Well, there’s always been a frisson between us, but I always put that down to academic rivalry. Par for the course. We’re not geographers or biologists. We’re numbers men. We mathematicians have always been like that. Look at that miserable bastard Isaac Newton.’ ‘I named my dog after him.’ ‘So you did. But listen, Andrew, this isn’t a moment to nudge you to the kerb. This is a moment to slap you on the back.’ We were wasting time. ‘Have you told anyone about this?’ He shook his head. ‘No. Of course not. Andrew, this is yours. You can publicise this how you want. Though I would probably advise you, as a friend, to wait a little while. At least a week or so, until all this unwelcome stuff about your little Corpus incident has died down.’ ‘Is mathematics less interesting for humans than nudity?’ ‘It tends to be, Andrew. Yes. Listen. Go home, take it easy this week. I’ll put a word in with Diane at Fitz and explain that you’ll be fine but you may need some time off. I’m sure she’ll be pretty flexible. The students are going to be tricky on your first day back. You need to build your strength up. Rest a while. Come on Andrew, go home.’ I could smell the foul scent of coffee getting stronger. I looked around at all the certificates on the wall and felt thankful to come from a place where personal success was meaningless. ‘Home?’ I said. ‘Do you know where that is?’ ‘Course I do. Andrew, what are you talking about?’ ‘Actually, I am not called Andrew.’ Another nervous chuckle. ‘Is Andrew Martin your stage name? If it is, I could have thought of better.’ ‘I don’t have a name. Names are a symptom of a species which values the individual self above the collective good.’ This was the first time he stood up out of his chair. He was a tall man, taller than me. ‘This would be amusing, Andrew, if you weren’t a friend. I really think you might need to get proper medical help for this. Listen, I know a very good psychiatrist who you—’ ‘Andrew Martin is someone else. He was taken.’ ‘Taken?’ ‘After he proved what he proved, we were left with no choice.’ ‘We? What are you talking about? Just have an objective ear, Andrew. You are sounding out of your mind. I think you ought to go home. I’ll drive you back. I think it would be safer. Come on, let’s go. I’ll take you home. Back to your family.’ He held out his right arm, gesturing towards the door. But I wasn’t going anywhere. The pain ‘You said you wanted to slap my back.’ He frowned. Above the frown, the skin covering the top of his skull shone. I stared at it. At the shine. ‘What?’ ‘You wanted to slap my back. That is what you said. So, why not?’ ‘What?’ ‘Slap my back. Then I will go.’ ‘Andrew—’ ‘Slap my back.’ He exhaled slowly. His eyes were the mid-point between concern and fear. I turned, gave him my back. Waited for the hand, then waited some more. Then it came. He slapped my back. On that first contact, even with clothes between us, I made the reading. Then when I turned, for less than a second, my face wasn’t Andrew Martin’s. It was mine. ‘What the—’ He lurched backwards, bumping into his desk. I was, to his eyes, Andrew Martin again. But he had seen what he had seen. I only had a second, before he would begin screaming, so I paralysed his jaw. Somewhere way below the panic of his bulging eyes, there was a question: how did he do that? To finish the job properly I would need another contact: my left hand on his shoulder was sufficient. Then the pain began. The pain I had summoned. He held his arm. His face became violet. The colour of home. I had pain too. Head pain. And fatigue. But I walked past him, as he dropped to his knees, and deleted the email and the attachment. I checked his sent folder but there was nothing suspicious. I stepped out on to the landing. ‘Tabitha! Tabitha, call an ambulance! Quick! I think, I think Daniel is having a heart attack!’ Egypt Less than a minute later she was upstairs, on the phone, her face full of panic as she knelt down, trying to push a pill – an aspirin – into her husband’s mouth. ‘His mouth won’t open! His mouth won’t open! Daniel, open your mouth! Darling, oh my God darling, open your mouth!’ And then to the phone. ‘Yes! I told you! I told you! The Hollies! Yes! Chaucer Road! He’s dying! He’s dying!’ She managed to cram inside her husband’s mouth a piece of the pill, which bubbled into foam and dribbled onto the carpet. ‘Mnnnnnn,’ her husband was saying desperately. ‘Mnnnnnn.’ I stood there watching him. His eyes stayed wide, wide open, ipsoid-wide, as if staying in the world was a simple matter of forcing yourself to see. ‘Daniel, it’s all right,’ Tabitha was saying, right into his face. ‘An ambulance is on its way. You’ll be okay, darling.’ His eyes were now on me. He jerked in my direction. ‘Mnnnnnn!’ He was trying to warn his wife. ‘Mnnnnnn.’ She didn’t understand. Tabitha was stroking her husband’s hair with a manic tenderness. ‘Daniel, we’re going to Egypt. Come on, think of Egypt. We’re going to see the Pyramids. It’s only two weeks till we go. Come on, it’s going to be beautiful. You’ve always wanted to go . . .’ As I watched her I felt a strange sensation. A kind of longing for something, a craving, but for what I had no idea. I was mesmerised by the sight of this human female crouched over the man whose blood I had prevented from reaching his heart. ‘You got through it last time and you’ll get through it this time.’ ‘No,’ I whispered, unheard. ‘No, no, no.’ ‘Mnnn,’ he said, gripping his shoulder in infinite pain. ‘I love you, Daniel.’ His eyes clenched shut now, the pain too much. ‘Stay with me, stay with me, I can’t live all alone . . .’ His head was on her knee. She kept caressing his face. So this was love. Two His head was on her knee. She kept caressing his face. So this was love. Two life forms in mutual reliance. I was meant to be thinking I was watching weakness, something to scorn, but I wasn’t thinking that at all. He stopped making noise, he seemed instantly heavier for her, and the deep clenched creases around his eyes softened and relaxed. It was done. Tabitha howled, as if something had been physically wrenched out of her. I have never heard anything like that sound. It troubled me greatly, I have to say. A cat emerged from the doorway, startled by the noise maybe, but indifferent to the scene in general. It returned back from where it came. ‘No,’ said Tabitha, over and over, ‘no, no, no!’ Outside, the ambulance skidded to a halt on the gravel. Blue flashing lights appeared through the window. ‘They’re here,’ I told Tabitha and went downstairs. It was a strange and overwhelming relief to tread my way down those soft, carpeted stairs, and for those desperate sobs and futile commands to fade away into nothing. Where we are from I thought about where we – you and I – are from. Where we are from there are no comforting delusions, no religions, no impossible fiction. Where we are from there is no love and no hate. There is the purity of reason. Where we are from there are no crimes of passion because there is no passion. Where we are from there is no remorse because action has a logical motive and always results in the best outcome for the given situation. Where we are from there are no names, no families living together, no husbands and wives, no sulky teenagers, no madness. Where we are from we have solved the problem of fear because we have solved the problem of death. We will not die. Which means we can’t just let the universe do what it wants to do, because we will be inside it for eternity. Where we are from we will never be lying on a luxurious carpet, clutching our chest as our faces turn purple and our eyes seek desperately to view our surroundings for one last time. Where we are from our technology, created on the back of our supreme and comprehensive knowledge of mathematics, has meant not only that we can travel great distances, but also that we can rearrange our own biological ingredients, renew and replenish them. We are psychologically equipped for such advances. We have never been at war with ourselves. We never place the desires of the individual over the requirements of the collective. Where we are from we understand that if the humans’ rate of mathematical advancement exceeds their psychological maturity, then action needs to be taken. For instance, the death of Daniel Russell, and the knowledge he held, could end up saving many more lives. And so: he is a logical and justifiable sacrifice. Where we are from there are no nightmares. And yet, that night, for the very first time in my life I had a nightmare. A world of dead humans with me and that indifferent cat walking through a A world of dead humans with me and that indifferent cat walking through a giant carpeted street full of bodies. I was trying to get home. But I couldn’t. I was stuck here. I had become one of them. Stuck in human form, unable to escape the inevitable fate awaiting all of them. And I was getting hungry and I needed to eat but I couldn’t eat, because my mouth was clamped shut. The hunger became extreme. I was starving, wasting away at rapid speed. I went to the garage I had been in that first night and tried to shove food in my mouth, but it was no good. It was still locked from this inexplicable paralysis. I knew I was going to die. Die. How did humans ever stomach the idea? I woke. I was sweating and out of breath. Isobel touched my back. ‘It’s all right,’ she said, as Tabitha had said. ‘It’s all right, it’s all right, it’s all right.’ The dog and the music The next day I was alone. Well no, actually, that’s not quite true. I wasn’t alone. There was the dog. Newton. The dog named after a human who had come up with the ideas of gravity and inertia. Given the slow speed with which the dog left its basket, I realised the name was a fitting tribute to these discoveries. He was awake now. He was old and he hobbled, and he was half-blind. He knew who I was. Or who I wasn’t. And he growled whenever he was near me. I didn’t quite understand his language just yet but I sensed he was displeased. He showed his teeth but I could tell years of subservience to his bipedal owners meant the very fact that I was standing up was enough for me to command a certain degree of respect. I felt sick. I put this down to the new air I was breathing. But each time I closed my eyes I saw Daniel Russell’s anguished face as he lay on the carpet. I also had a headache, but that was the lingering after-effect of the energy I had exerted yesterday. I knew life was going to be easier during my short stay here if Newton was on my side. He might have information, have picked up on signals, heard things. And I knew there was one rule that held fast across the universe: if you wanted to get someone on your side what you really had to do was relieve their pain. It seems ridiculous now, such logic. But the truth was even more ridiculous, and too dangerous to acknowledge to myself, that after the need to hurt I felt an urge to heal. So I went over and gave him a biscuit. And then, after giving him the biscuit, I gave him sight. And then, as I stroked his hind leg, he whimpered words into my ear I couldn’t quite translate. I healed him, giving myself not only an even more intense headache but also wave upon wave of fatigue in the process. Indeed, so exhausted was I that I fell asleep on the kitchen floor. When I woke up, I was coated in dog saliva. Newton’s tongue was still at it, licking me with considerable enthusiasm. Licking, licking, licking, as though the meaning of considerable enthusiasm. Licking, licking, licking, as though the meaning of canine existence was something just beneath my skin. ‘Could you please stop that?’ I said. But he couldn’t. Not until I stood up. He was physically incapable of stopping. And even once I had stood up he tried to stand up with me, and on me, as if he wanted to be upright, too. It was then I realised the one thing worse than having a dog hate you is having a dog love you. Seriously, if there was a needier species in the universe I had yet to meet it. ‘Get away,’ I told him. ‘I don’t want your love.’ I went to the living room and sat down on the sofa. I needed to think. Would Daniel Russell’s death be viewed by the humans as suspicious? A man on heart medication succumbing to a second and this time fatal heart attack? I had no poison, and no weapon they would ever be able to identify. The dog sat down next to me, placed his head on my lap, then lifted his head off my lap, and then on again, as if deciding whether or not to put his head on my lap was the biggest decision he had ever faced. We spent hours together that day. Me and the dog. At first I was annoyed that he wouldn’t leave me alone, as what I needed to do was to focus and work out when I was going to act next. To work out how much more information I needed to acquire before doing what would have to be my final acts here, eliminating Andrew Martin’s wife and child. I shouted at the dog again to leave me alone, and he did so, but when I stood in the living room with nothing but my thoughts and plans I realised I felt a terrible loneliness and so called him back. And he came, and seemed happy to be wanted again. I put something on that interested me. It was called The Planets by Gustav Holst. It was a piece of music all about the humans’ puny solar system, so it was surprising to hear it had quite an epic feel. Another confusing thing was that it was divided into seven ‘movements’ each named after ‘astrological characters’. For instance, Mars was ‘the Bringer of War’, Jupiter was ‘the Bringer of Jollity’, and Saturn was ‘the Bringer of Old Age’. This primitivism struck me as funny. And so was the idea that the music had anything whatsoever to do with those dead planets. But it seemed to soothe Newton a little bit, and I must admit one or two parts of it had some kind of effect on me, a kind of electrochemical effect. Listening to music, I realised, was simply the pleasure of counting without realising you were counting. As the electrical impulses were transported from the neurons in my ear through my body, I felt – I don’t know – calm. It made that strange unease that had been with me since I had watched Daniel Russell die on his carpet settle a little. As we listened I tried to work out why Newton and his species were so enamoured of humans. enamoured of humans. ‘Tell me,’ I said. ‘What is it about the humans?’ Newton laughed. Or as close as a dog can get to laughing, which is pretty close. I persisted with my line of enquiry. ‘Go on,’ I said. ‘Spill the beans.’ He seemed a bit coy. I don’t think he really had an answer. Maybe he hadn’t reached his verdict, or he was too loyal to be truthful. I put on some different music. I played the music of someone called Ennio Morricone. I played an album called Space Oddity by David Bowie, which, in its simple patterned measure of time, was actually quite enjoyable. As was Moon Safari by Air, though that shed little light on the moon itself. I played A Love Supreme by John Coltrane and Blue Monk by Thelonious Monk. This was jazz music. It was full of the complexity and contradictions that I would soon learn made humans human. I listened to ‘Rhapsody in Blue’ by Leonard Bernstein and ‘Moonlight Sonata’ by Ludwig van Beethoven and Brahms’ ‘Intermezzo op. 17’. I listened to the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones, Daft Punk, Prince, Talking Heads, Al Greene, Tom Waits, Mozart. I was intrigued to discover the sounds that could make it on to music – the strange talking radio voice on ‘I Am the Walrus’ by the Beatles, the cough at the beginning of Prince’s ‘Raspberry Beret’ and at the end of Tom Waits songs. Maybe that is what beauty was, for humans. Accidents, imperfections, placed inside a pretty pattern. Asymmetry. The defiance of mathematics. I thought about my speech at the Museum of Quadratic Equations. With the Beach Boys I got a strange feeling, behind my eyes and in my stomach. I had no idea what that feeling was, but it made me think of Isobel, and the way she had hugged me last night, after I had come home and told her Daniel Russell had suffered a fatal heart attack in front of me. There’d been a slight moment of suspicion, a brief hardening of her stare, but it had softened into compassion. Whatever else she might have thought about her husband he wasn’t a killer. The last thing I listened to was a tune called ‘Clair de Lune’ by Debussy. That was the closest representation of space I had ever heard, and I stood there, in the middle of the room, frozen with shock that a human could have made such a beautiful noise. This beauty terrified me, like an alien creature appearing out of nowhere. An ipsoid, bursting out of the desert. I had to stay focused. I had to keep believing everything I had been told. That this was a species of ugliness and violence, beyond redemption. Newton was scratching at the front door. The scratching was putting me off the music so I went over and tried to decipher what he wanted. It turned out that what he wanted was to go outside. There was a ‘lead’ I had seen Isobel use, and so I attached it to the collar. so I attached it to the collar. As I walked the dog I tried to think more negatively towards the humans. And it certainly seemed ethically questionable, the relationship between humans and dogs, both of whom – on the scale of intelligence that covered every species in the universe – would have been somewhere in the middle, not too far apart. But I have to say that dogs didn’t seem to mind it. In fact, they went along quite happily with the set-up most of the time. I let Newton lead the way. We passed a man on the other side of the road. The man just stopped and stared at me and smiled to himself. I smiled and waved my hand, understanding this was an appropriate human greeting. He didn’t wave back. Yes, humans are a troubling species. We carried on walking, and we passed another man. A man in a wheelchair. He seemed to know me. ‘Andrew,’ he said, ‘isn’t it terrible – the news about Daniel Russell?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘I was there. I saw it happen. It was horrible, just horrible.’ ‘Oh my God, I had no idea.’ ‘Mortality is a very tragic thing.’ ‘Indeed, indeed it is.’ ‘Anyway, I had better be going. The dog is in quite a hurry. I will see you.’ ‘Yes, yes, absolutely. But may I ask: how are you? I heard you’d been a bit unwell yourself?’ ‘Oh, fine. I am over that. It was just a bit of a misunderstanding, really.’ ‘Oh, I see.’ The conversation dwindled further, and I made my excuses, Newton dragging me forward until we reached a large stretch of grass. This is what dogs liked to do, I discovered. They liked to run around on grass, pretending they were free, shouting, ‘We’re free, we’re free, look, look, look how free we are!’ at each other. It really was a sorry sight. But it worked for them, and for Newton in particular. It was a collective illusion they had chosen to swallow and they were submitting to it wholeheartedly, without any nostalgia for their former wolf selves. That was the remarkable thing about humans – their ability to shape the path of other species, to change their fundamental nature. Maybe it could happen to me, maybe I could be changed, maybe I already was being changed? Who knew? I hoped not. I hoped I was staying as pure as I had been told, as strong and isolated as a prime, as a ninety-seven. I sat on a bench and watched the traffic. No matter how long I stayed on this planet I doubted I would ever get used to the sight of cars, bound by gravity and poor technology to the road, hardly moving on the roads because there were so many of them. many of them. Was it wrong to thwart a species’ technological advancement? That was a new question in my mind. I didn’t want it there, so I was quite relieved when Newton started barking. I turned to look at him. He was standing still, his head steady in one direction, as he carried on making as loud a noise as he possibly could. ‘Look!’ he seemed to bark. ‘Look! Look! Look!’ I was picking up his language. There was another road, a different one to the one with all the traffic. A line of terraced houses facing the park. I turned towards it, as Newton clearly wanted me to do. I saw Gulliver, on his own, walking along the pavement, trying his best to hide behind his hair. He was meant to be at school. And he wasn’t, unless human school was walking along the street and thinking, which it really should have been. He saw me. He froze. And then he turned around and started walking in the other direction. ‘Gulliver!’ I called. ‘Gulliver!’ He ignored me. If anything, he started walking away faster than he had done before. His behaviour concerned me. After all, inside his head was the knowledge that the world’s biggest mathematical puzzle had been solved, and by his own father. I hadn’t acted last night. I had told myself that I needed to find more information, check there was no one else Andrew Martin could have told. Also, I was probably too exhausted after my encounter with Daniel. I would wait another day, maybe even two. That had been the plan. Gulliver had told me he hadn’t said anything, and that he wasn’t going to, but how could he be totally trusted? His mother was convinced, right now, that he was at school. And yet he evidently wasn’t. I got up from the bench and walked over the litter-strewn grass to where Newton was still barking. ‘Come on,’ I said, realising I should probably have acted already. ‘We have to go.’ We arrived on the road just as Gulliver was turning off it, and so I decided to follow him and see where he was going. At one point he stopped and took something from his pocket. A box. He took out a cylindrical object and put it in his mouth and lit it. He turned around, but I had sensed he would and was already hiding behind a tree. He began walking again. Soon he reached a larger road. Coleridge Road, this one was called. He didn’t want to be on this road for long. Too many cars. Too many opportunities to be seen. He kept on walking, and after a while the buildings stopped and there were no cars or people any more. I was worried he was going to turn around, because there were no nearby trees – or anything else – to hide behind. Also, although I was physically near enough to be easily seen if he did turn to look, I was too far for any mind manipulation to be easily seen if he did turn to look, I was too far for any mind manipulation to work. Remarkably though, he didn’t turn around again. Not once. We passed a building with lots of empty cars outside, shining in the sun. The building had the word ‘Honda’ on it. There was a man inside the glass in a shirt and tie, watching us. Gulliver then cut across a grass field. Eventually, he reached four metal tracks in the ground: parallel lines, close together but stretching as far as the eye could see. He just stood there, absolutely still, waiting for something. Newton looked at Gulliver and then up at me, with concern. He let out a deliberately loud whine. ‘Sssh!’ I said. ‘Keep quiet.’ After a while, a train appeared in the distance, getting closer as it was carried along the tracks. I noticed Gulliver’s fists clench and his whole body stiffen as he stood only a metre or so away from the train’s path. As the train was about to pass where he was standing Newton barked, but the train was too loud and too close to Gulliver for him to hear. This was interesting. Maybe I wouldn’t have to do anything. Maybe Gulliver was going to do it himself. The train passed. Gulliver’s hands stopped being fists and he seemed to relax again. Or maybe it was disappointment. But before he turned around and started walking away, I had dragged Newton back, and we were out of sight. Grigori Perelman So, I had left Gulliver. Untouched, unharmed. I had returned home with Newton while Gulliver had carried on walking. I had no idea where he was going, but it was pretty clear to me, from his lack of direction, that he hadn’t been heading anywhere specific. I concluded, therefore, that he wasn’t going to meet someone. Indeed, he had seemed to want to avoid people. Still, I knew it was dangerous. I knew that it wasn’t just proof of the Riemann hypothesis which was the problem. It was knowledge that it could be proved, and Gulliver had that knowledge, inside his skull, as he walked around the streets. Yet I justified my delay because I had been told to be patient. I had been told to find out exactly who knew. If human progress was to be thwarted, then I needed to be thorough. To kill Gulliver now would have been premature, because his death and that of his mother would be the last acts I could commit before suspicions were aroused. Yes, this is what I told myself, as I unclipped Newton’s lead and re-entered the house, and then accessed that sitting-room computer, typing in the words ‘Poincaré Conjecture’ into the search box. Soon, I found Isobel had been right. This conjecture – concerning a number of very basic topological laws about spheres and four-dimensional space – had been solved by a Russian mathematician called Grigori Perelman. On 18 March 2010 – just over three years ago – it was announced that he had won a Clay Millennium Prize. But he had turned it down, and the million dollars that had gone with it. ‘I’m not interested in money or fame,’ he had said. ‘I don’t want to be on display like an animal in a zoo. I’m not a hero of mathematics.’ This was not the only prize he had been offered. There had been others. A prestigious prize from the European Mathematical Society, one from the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, and the Fields Medal, the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, and the Fields Medal, the highest award in mathematics. All of them he had turned down, choosing instead to live a life of poverty and unemployment, caring for his elderly mother. Humans are arrogant. Humans are greedy. They care about nothing but money and fame. They do not appreciate mathematics for its own sake, but for what it can get them. I logged out. Suddenly, I felt weak. I was hungry. That must have been it. So I went to the kitchen and looked for food. Crunchy wholenut peanut butter I ate some capers, and then a stock cube, and chewed on a stick-like vegetable called celery. Eventually, I got out some bread, a staple of human cuisine, and I looked in the cupboard for something to put on it. Caster sugar was my first option. And then I tried some mixed herbs. Neither was very satisfying. After much anxious trepidation and analysis of the nutritional information I decided to try something called crunchy wholenut peanut butter. I placed it on the bread and gave some to the dog. He liked it. ‘Should I try it?’ I asked him. Yes, you definitely should, appeared to be the response. (Dog words weren’t really words. They were more like melodies. Silent melodies sometimes, but melodies all the same.) It is very tasty indeed. He wasn’t wrong. As I placed it in my mouth and began to chew I realised that human food could actually be quite good. I had never enjoyed food before. Now I came to think of it, I had never enjoyed anything before. And yet today, even amid my strange feelings of weakness and doubt, I had experienced the pleasures of music and of food. And maybe even the simple enjoyment of canine company. After I had eaten one piece of bread and peanut butter I made another one for us both, and then another, Newton’s appetite proving to be at least a match for mine. ‘I am not what I am,’ I told him at one stage. ‘You know that, don’t you? I mean, that is why you were so hostile at first. Why you growled whenever I was near you. You sensed it, didn’t you? More than a human could. You knew there was a difference.’ His silence spoke volumes. And as I stared into his glassy, honest eyes I felt the urge to tell him more. ‘I have killed someone,’ I told him, feeling a sense of relief. ‘I am what a human would categorise as a murderer, a judgemental term, and based in this case on the wrong judgements. You see, sometimes to save something you have to kill a little piece of it. But still, a murderer – that is what they would call me, to kill a little piece of it. But still, a murderer – that is what they would call me, if they knew. Not that they would ever really be able to know how I had done it. ‘You see, as you no doubt know, humans are still at the point in their development where they see a strong difference between the mental and the physical within the same body. They have mental hospitals and body hospitals, as if one doesn’t directly affect the other. And so, if they can’t accept that a mind is directly responsible for the body of the same person, they are hardly likely to understand how a mind – albeit not a human one – can affect the body of someone else. Of course, my skills are not just the product of biology. I have technology, but it is unseen. It is inside me. And now resides in my left hand. It allowed me to take this shape, it enables me to contact my home, and it strengthens my mind. It makes me able to manipulate mental and physical processes. I can perform telekinesis – look, look right now, look what I am doing with the lid of the peanut butter jar – and also something very close to hypnosis. You see, where I am from everything is seamless. Minds, bodies, technologies all come together in a quite beautiful convergence.’ The phone rang at that point. It had rung earlier too. I didn’t answer it though. There were some tastes, just as there were some songs by the Beach Boys (‘In My Room’, ‘God Only Knows’, ‘Sloop John B’) that were just too good to disturb. But then the peanut butter ran out, and Newton and I stared at each other in mutual mourning. ‘I am sorry, Newton. But it appears we have run out of peanut butter.’ This cannot be true. You must be mistaken. Check again. I checked again. ‘No, I am not mistaken.’ Properly. Check properly. That was just a glance. I checked properly. I even showed him the inside of the jar. He was still disbelieving, so I placed the jar right up next to his nose, which was clearly where he wanted it. Ah, you see, there is still some. Look. Look. And he licked the contents of the jar until he too had to eventually agree we were out of the stuff. I laughed out loud. I had never laughed. It was a very odd feeling, but not unpleasant. And then we went and sat on the sofa in the living room. Why are you here? I don’t know if the dog’s eyes were asking me this, but I gave him an answer anyway. ‘I am here to destroy information. Information that exists in the bodies of certain machines and the minds of certain humans. That is my purpose. Although, obviously, while I am here I am also collecting information. Just how volatile are they? How violent? How dangerous to themselves and others? Are their flaws – and there do seem to be quite a few – insurmountable? Or is there hope? These questions are the sort I have in mind, even if I am not supposed to. hope? These questions are the sort I have in mind, even if I am not supposed to. First and foremost though, what I am doing involves elimination.’ Newton looked at me bleakly, but he didn’t judge. And we stayed there, on that purple sofa, for quite a while. Something was happening to me, I realised, and it had been happening ever since Debussy and the Beach Boys. I wished I’d never played them. For ten minutes we sat in silence. This mournful mood only altered with the distraction of the front door opening and closing. It was Gulliver. He waited silently in the hallway for a moment or two, and then hung up his coat and dropped his schoolbag. He came into the living room, walking slowly. He didn’t make eye contact. ‘Don’t tell Mum, okay?’ ‘What?’ I said. ‘Don’t tell her what?’ He was awkward. ‘That I wasn’t at school.’ ‘Okay. I won’t.’ He looked at Newton, whose head was back on my lap. He seemed confused but didn’t comment. He turned to go upstairs. ‘What were you doing by the train track?’ I asked him. I saw his hands tense up. ‘What?’ ‘You were just standing there, as the train passed.’ ‘You followed me?’ ‘Yes. Yes, I did. I followed you. I wasn’t going to tell you. In fact, I am surprising myself by telling you now. But my innate curiosity won out.’ He answered with a kind of muted groan, and headed upstairs. After a while, with a dog on your lap, you realise there is a necessity to stroke it. Don’t ask me how this necessarily comes about. It clearly has something to do with the dimensions of the human upper body. Anyway, I stroked the dog and as I did so I realised it was actually a pleasant feeling, the warmth and the rhythm of it. Isobel’s dance Eventually, Isobel came back. I shifted along the sofa to reach such a position that I could witness her walking in through the front door. Just to see the simple effort of it – the physical pushing of the door, the extraction of the key, the closing of the door and the placing of that key (and the others it was attached to) in a small oval basket on a static piece of wooden furniture – all of that was quite mesmerising to me. The way she did such things in single gliding movements, almost dancelike, without thinking about them. I should have been looking down on such things. But I wasn’t. She seemed to be continually operating above the task she was doing. A melody, rising above rhythm. Yet she was still what she was, a human. She walked down the hallway, exhaling the whole way, her face containing both a smile and a frown at once. Like her son, she was confused to see the dog lying on my lap. And equally confused when she saw the dog jump off my lap and run over to her. ‘What’s with Newton?’ she asked. ‘With him?’ ‘He seems lively.’ ‘Does he?’ ‘Yes. And, I don’t know, his eyes seem brighter.’ ‘Oh. It might have been the peanut butter. And the music.’ ‘Peanut butter? Music? You never listen to music. Have you been listening to music?’ ‘Yes. We have.’ She looked at me with suspicion. ‘Right. I see.’ ‘We’ve been listening to music all day long.’ ‘How are you feeling? I mean, you know, about Daniel.’ ‘Oh, it is very sad,’ I said. ‘How was your day?’ She sighed. ‘It was okay.’ This was a lie, I could tell that. I looked at her. My eyes could stay on her with ease, I noticed. What had happened? Was this another side-effect of the music?I suppose I was getting acclimatised to her, and to humans in general. Physically, at least from the outside, I was one too. It was becoming a new normality, in a sense. Yet even so, my stomach churned far less with her than with the sight of the others I saw walking past the window, peering in at me. In fact, that day, or at that point in that day, it didn’t churn at all. ‘I feel like I should phone Tabitha,’ she said. ‘It’s difficult though, isn’t it? She’ll be inundated. I might just send her an email and let her know, you know, if there’s anything we can do.’ I nodded. ‘That’s a good idea.’ She studied me for a while. ‘Yes,’ she said, at a lower frequency. ‘I think so.’ She looked at the phone. ‘Has anyone called?’ ‘I think so. The phone rang a few times.’ ‘But you didn’t pick it up?’ ‘No. No, I didn’t. I don’t really feel up to lengthy conversations. And I feel cursed at the moment. The last time I had a lengthy conversation with anyone who wasn’t you or Gulliver they ended up dying in front of me.’ ‘Don’t say it like that.’ ‘Like what?’ ‘Flippantly. It’s a sad day.’ ‘I know,’ I said. ‘I just . . . it hasn’t sunk in yet, really.’ She went away to listen to the messages. She came back. ‘Lots of people have been calling you.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. ‘Who?’ ‘Your mother. But be warned, she might be doing her trademark oppressive- worry thing. She’s heard about your little event at Corpus. I don’t know how. The college called, too, wanting to speak, doing a good job of sounding concerned. A journalist from the Cambridge Evening News. And Ari. Being sweet. He wonders if you’d be up to going to a football match on Saturday. Someone else, too.’ She paused for a moment. ‘She said her name was Maggie.’ ‘Oh yes,’ I said, faking it. ‘Of course. Maggie.’ Then she raised her eyebrows at me. It meant something, clearly, but I had no idea what. It was frustrating. You see, the Language of Words was only one of the human languages. There were many others, as I have pointed out. The Language of Sighs, the Language of Silent Moments and, most significantly, the Language of Frowns. Then she did the opposite, her eyebrows going as low as they could. She sighed and went into the kitchen. ‘What have you been doing with the caster sugar?’ ‘What have you been doing with the caster sugar?’ ‘Eating it,’ I said. ‘It was a mistake. Sorry.’ ‘Well, you know, feel free to put things back.’ ‘I forgot. Sorry.’ ‘It’s okay. It’s just been a day and a half, that’s all.’ I nodded and tried to act human. ‘What do you want me to do? I mean, what should I do?’ ‘Well, you could start by calling your mother. But don’t tell her about the hospital. I know what you’re like.’ ‘What? What am I like?’ ‘You tell her more than you tell me.’ Now that was worrying. That was very worrying indeed. I decided to phone her right away. The mother Remarkable as it may sound, the mother was an important concept for humans. Not only were they truly aware who their mother was, but in many cases they also kept in contact with them throughout their lives. Of course, for someone like me, whose mother was never there to be known this was a very exotic idea. So exotic, I was scared to pursue it. But I did, because if her son had told her too much information, I obviously needed to know. ‘Andrew?’ ‘Yes, Mother. It is me.’ ‘Oh Andrew.’ She spoke at a high frequency. The highest I had ever heard. ‘Hello, Mother.’ ‘Andrew, me and your father have been worried sick about you.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. ‘I had a little episode. I temporarily lost my mind. I forgot to put on my clothes. That’s all.’ ‘Is that all you have to say?’ ‘No. No, it isn’t. I have to ask you a question, Mother. It is an important question.’ ‘Oh, Andrew. What is the matter?’ ‘The matter? Which matter?’ ‘Is it Isobel? Has she been nagging you again? Is that what this is about?’ ‘Again?’ The static crackle of a sigh. ‘Yes. You’ve told us for over a year now that you and Isobel have been having difficulties. That she’s not been as understanding as she could have been about your workload. That she’s not been there for you.’ I thought of Isobel, lying about her day to stop me worrying, making me food, stroking my skin. ‘No,’ I said. ‘She is there for him. Me.’ ‘And Gulliver? What about him? I thought she’d turned him against you. Because of that band he wanted to be in. But you were right, darling. He shouldn’t be messing around in bands. Not after all that he’s done.’ ‘Band? I don’t know, Mother. I don’t think it is that.’ ‘Band? I don’t know, Mother. I don’t think it is that.’ ‘Why are you calling me Mother? You never call me Mother.’ ‘But you are my mother. What do I call you?’ ‘Mum. You call me Mum.’ ‘Mum,’ I said. It sounded the most strange of all the strange words. ‘Mum. Mum. Mum. Mum. Mum, listen, I want to know if I spoke to you recently.’ She wasn’t listening. ‘We wish we were there.’ ‘Come over,’ I said. I was interested to see what she looked like. ‘Come over right now.’ ‘Well, if we didn’t live twelve thousand miles away.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. Twelve thousand miles didn’t sound like much. ‘Come over this afternoon then.’ The mother laughed. ‘Still got your sense of humour.’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘I am still very funny. Listen, did I speak to you last Saturday?’ ‘No. Andrew, have you lost your memory? Is this amnesia? You’re acting like you have amnesia.’ ‘I’m a bit confused. That’s all. It’s not amnesia. The doctors told me that. It’s just . . . I have been working hard.’ ‘Yes, yes, I know. You told us.’ ‘So, what did I tell you?’ ‘That you’ve hardly been sleeping. That you’ve been working harder than you ever have, at least since your PhD.’ And then she started giving me information I hadn’t asked for. She started talking about her hipbone. It was causing her a lot of pain. She was on pain relief medication but it wasn’t working. I found the conversation disconcerting and even nauseating. The idea of prolonged pain was quite alien to me. Humans considered themselves to be quite medically advanced but they had yet to solve this problem in any meaningful way. Just as they had yet to solve the problem of death. ‘Mother. Mum, listen, what do you know about the Riemann hypothesis?’ ‘That’s the thing you’re working on, isn’t it?’ ‘Working on? Working on. Yes. I am still working on it. And I will never prove it. I realise that now.’ ‘Oh, all right, darling. Well, don’t beat yourself up about it. Now, listen . . .’ Pretty soon she was back to talking about the pain again. She said the doctor had told her she should get a hip replacement. It would be made of titanium. I almost gasped when she said that but I didn’t want to tell her about titanium, as the humans obviously didn’t know about that yet. They would find out in their own time. Then she started talking about my ‘father’ and how his memory was getting Then she started talking about my ‘father’ and how his memory was getting worse. The doctor had told him not to drive any more and that it looked increasingly unlikely that he would be able to finish the book on macroeconomic theory he had been hoping to get published. ‘It makes me worry about you, Andrew. You know, only last week I told you what the doctor had said, about how I should advise you to get a brain scan. It can run in families.’ ‘Oh,’ I said. I really didn’t know what else was required of me. The truth was that I wanted the conversation to end. I had obviously not told my parents. Or I hadn’t told my mother, at any rate, and from the sound of things my father’s brain was such that it would probably lose any information I had given him. Also, and it was a big also, the conversation was depressing me. It was making me think about human life in a way I didn’t want to think about it. Human life, I realised, got progressively worse as you got older, by the sound of things. You arrived, with baby feet and hands and infinite happiness, and then the happiness slowly evaporated as your feet and hands grew bigger. And then, from the teenage years onwards, happiness was something you could lose your grip of, and once it started to slip it gained mass. It was as if the knowledge that it could slip was the thing that made it more difficult to hold, no matter how big your feet and hands were. Why was this depressing? Why did I care, when it was not my job to do so? Again I felt immense gratitude that I only looked like a human being and would never actually be one. She carried on talking. And as she did so I realised there could be no cosmic consequence at all if I stopped listening, and with that realisation I switched off the phone. I closed my eyes, wanting to see nothing but I did see something. I saw Tabitha, leaning over her husband as aspirin froth slid out of his mouth. I wondered if my mother was the same age as Tabitha, or older. When I opened my eyes again I realised Newton was standing there, looking up at me. His eyes told me he was confused. Why did you not say goodbye? You usually say goodbye. And then, bizarrely, I did something I didn’t understand. Something which had absolutely no logic to it at all. I picked up the phone and dialled the same number. After three rings she answered, and then I spoke. ‘Sorry, Mum. I meant to say goodbye.’ Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? Are you there? We can hear you. We are here. Listen, it’s safe. The information is destroyed. For now, the humans will remain at level three. There is no worry. You have destroyed all the evidence, and all possible sources? I have destroyed the information on Andrew Martin’s computer, and on Daniel Russell’s computer. Daniel Russell is destroyed, also. Heart attack. He was a heart-risk, so that was the most logical cause of death in the circumstances. Have you destroyed Isobel Martin and Gulliver Martin? No. No, I haven’t. There is no need to destroy them. They do not know? Gulliver Martin knows. Isobel Martin doesn’t. But Gulliver has no motivation to say anything. You must destroy him. You must destroy both of them. No. There is no need. If you want me to, if you really think it is required, then I can manipulate his neurological processes. I can make him forget what his father told him. Not that he really knows anyway. He has no real understanding of mathematics. The effects of any mind manipulation you carry out disappear the moment you return home. You know that. He won’t say anything. He might have said something already. Humans aren’t to be trusted. They don’t even trust themselves. Gulliver hasn’t said anything. And Isobel knows nothing. You must complete your task. If you do not complete your task, someone else will be sent to complete it for you. No. No. I will complete it. Don’t worry. I will complete my task. PART II I held a jewel in my fingers – Richard Feynman – David Foster Wallace – Carl Sagan You can’t say A is made of B or vice versa. All mass is interaction. We’re all lonely for something we don’t know we’re lonely for. For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love. Sleepwalking I stood next to his bed while he slept. I don’t know how long I just stood there, in the dark, listening to his deep breathing as he slipped deeper and deeper below dreams. Half an hour, maybe. He hadn’t pulled the window blind down, so I looked out at the night. There was no moon from this angle, but I could see a few stars. Suns lighting dead solar systems elsewhere in the galaxy. Everywhere you can see in their sky, or almost everywhere, is lifeless. That must affect them. That must give them ideas above their station. That must send them insane. Gulliver rolled over, and I decided to wait no longer. It was now or it was never. You will pull back your duvet, I told him, in a voice he wouldn’t have heard if he had been awake but which reached right in, riding theta-waves, to become a command from his own brain. And slowly you will sit up in your bed, your feet will be on the rug and you will breathe and you will compose yourself and then you will stand up. And he did, indeed, stand up. He stayed there, breathing deeply and slowly, waiting for the next command. You will walk to the door. Do not worry about opening the door, because it is already open. There. Just walk, just walk, just walk to your door. He did exactly as I said. And he was there in the doorway, oblivious to everything except my voice. A voice which only had two words that needed to be said. Fall forward. I moved closer to him. Somehow those words were slow to arrive. I needed time. Another minute, at least. I was there, closer, able to smell the scent of sleep on him. Of humanity. And I remembered: You must complete your task. If you do not complete your task, someone else will be sent to complete it for you. I swallowed. My mouth was so dry it hurt. I felt the infinite expanse of the universe behind me, a vast if neutral force. The neutrality of time, of space, of mathematics, of logic, of survival. I closed my eyes. Waited. Waited. Before I opened them, I was being gripped by the throat. I could barely breathe. He had turned 180 degrees, and his left hand had me by the neck. I pulled it away, and now both his hands were fists swinging at me, wild, angry, hitting me almost as much as he missed. He got the side of my head. I walked backwards away from him, but he was moving forwards at just the same speed. His eyes were open. He was seeing me now. Seeing me and not seeing me all at the same time. I could have said stop of course, but I didn’t. Maybe I wanted to witness some human violence first-hand, even unconscious violence, to understand the importance of my task. By understanding it I would be able to fulfil it. Yes, that might have been it. That may also have explained why I let myself bleed when he punched me on the nose. I had reached his desk now and could retreat no further, so I just stood there as he kept hitting my head, my neck, my chest, my arms. He roared now, his mouth as wide as it could go, baring teeth. ‘Raaaah!’ This roar woke him up. His legs went weak and he nearly fell to the floor but he recovered in time. ‘I,’ he said. He didn’t know where he was for a moment. He saw me, in the dark, and this time it was conscious sight. ‘Dad?’ I nodded as a slow thin stream of blood reached my mouth. Isobel was running up the stairs to the attic. ‘What’s going on?’ ‘Nothing,’ I said. ‘I heard a noise so I came upstairs. Gulliver was sleepwalking, that’s all.’ Isobel switched the light on, gasped as she saw my face. ‘You’re bleeding.’ ‘It’s nothing. He didn’t know what he was doing.’ ‘Gulliver?’ Gulliver was sitting on the edge of his bed now, flinching from the light. He too looked at my face but he didn’t say anything at all. I was a wasn’t Gulliver wanted to go back to bed. To sleep. So, ten minutes later, Isobel and I were alone, and I was sitting on the side of the bath as she placed an antiseptic solution called TCP on a circle of cotton wool and dabbed it gently on a cut on my forehead, and then on my lip. Now, these were wounds I could have healed with a single thought. Just to feel pain, sometimes, was enough to cancel it. And yet, even as the antiseptic stung on contact with each cut, the injuries stayed. I forced them to. I couldn’t allow her to get suspicious. But was it just that? ‘How’s your nose?’ she asked. I caught sight of it in the mirror. A smear of blood around one nostril. ‘It’s okay,’ I said, feeling it. ‘It isn’t broken.’ Her eyes squinted in pure concentration. ‘This one on your forehead is really bad. And there’s going to be one giant bruise there. He must have really hit you hard. Did you try and restrain him?’ ‘Yes,’ I lied. ‘I did. But he kept on.’ I could smell her. Clean, human smells. The smells of the creams she used to wash and moisturise her face. The smell of her shampoo. A delicate trace of ammonia barely competing with the heavy scent of antiseptic. She was physically closer to me than she had ever been. I looked at her neck. She had two little dark moles on it, close together, charting unknown binary stars. I thought of Andrew Martin kissing her. This was what humans did. They kissed. Like so many human things, it made no sense. Or maybe, if you tried it, the logic would unfold. ‘Did he say anything?’ ‘No,’ I said. ‘No. He just yelled. It was very primal.’ ‘I don’t know, between you and him, it never ends.’ ‘What never ends?’ ‘The worry.’ She placed the blood-stained cotton wool in the small bin beside the sink. ‘I’m sorry,’ I said. ‘I’m sorry for everything. For the past and the future.’ An ‘I’m sorry,’ I said. ‘I’m sorry for everything. For the past and the future.’ An apology, said while in dull pain, made me feel as close to human as it was possible to feel. I could almost have written a poem. We went back to bed. She held my hand in the dark. I gently pulled it away. ‘We’ve lost him,’ she said. It took me a moment to realise she was talking about Gulliver. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘maybe we just have to accept him as he is, even if he’s different to what we’ve known.’ ‘I just don’t understand him. You know, he’s our son. And we’ve known him for sixteen years. And yet, I feel like I don’t know him at all.’ ‘Well, maybe we should try not to understand so much, and accept some more.’ ‘That’s a very difficult thing. And a very strange thing to come from your mouth, Andrew.’ ‘So, I suppose the next question is: what about me? Do you understand me?’ ‘I don’t think you understand yourself, Andrew.’ I wasn’t Andrew. I knew I wasn’t Andrew. But equally, I was losing myself. I was a wasn’t, that was the problem. I was lying in bed with a human woman I could now almost appreciate as beautiful, wilfully still feeling the sting of antiseptic in my wounds, and thinking of her strange but fascinating skin, and the way she had cared for me. No one in the universe cared for me. (You didn’t did you?) We had technology to care for us now, and we didn’t need emotions. We were alone. We worked together for our preservation but emotionally we needed no one. We just needed the purity of mathematical truth. And yet, I was scared of falling asleep, because the moment I fell asleep my wounds would heal and right then I didn’t want that to happen. Right then, I found a strange but real comfort in the pain. I had so many worries now. So many questions. ‘Do you believe humans are ever knowable?’ I asked. ‘I wrote a book on Charlemagne. I hope so.’ ‘But humans, in their natural state, are they good or are they bad, would you say? Can they be trusted? Or is their own real state just violence and greed and cruelty?’ ‘Well, that’s the oldest question there is.’ ‘What do you think?’ ‘I’m tired, Andrew. I’m sorry.’ ‘Yes, me too. I’ll see you in the morning.’ ‘Night.’ ‘Night.’ I stayed awake for a while as Isobel slipped towards sleep. The trouble was, I I stayed awake for a while as Isobel slipped towards sleep. The trouble was, I still wasn’t used to the night. It may not have been as dark as I first thought it to be. There was moonlight, starlight, airglow, streetlamps, and sunlight backscattered by interplanetary dust, but the humans still spent half their time in deep shadow. This, I was sure, was one of the chief reasons for personal and sexual relationships here. The need to find comfort in the dark. And it was a comfort, being next to her. So I just stayed there, hearing her breath move in and out, sounding like the tide of some exotic sea. At some point my little finger touched hers, in the double-night beneath the duvet, and this time I kept it there and imagined I was really what she thought I was. And that we were connected. Two humans, primitive enough to truly care about each other. It was a comforting thought, and the one which led me down those ever-darkening stairs of the mind towards sleep. I may need more time. You do not need time. I am going to kill who I need to kill, don’t worry about that. We are not worried. But I am not just here to destroy information. I am here to gather it. That is what you said, wasn’t it? Stuff on mathematical understanding can be read across the universe, I know that. I’m not talking about neuro-flashes. I’m talking about stuff that can only be picked up on from here, on Earth itself. To give us more insight into how the humans live. It has been a long time since anyone was here, at least in human terms. Explain why you need more time for this. Complexity demands time, but humans are primitives. They are the most shallow of mysteries. No. You are wrong. They exist simultaneously in two worlds – the world of appearances and the world of truth. The connecting strands between these worlds take many forms. When I first arrived here I did not understand certain things. For instance, I did not understand why clothes were so important. Or why a dead cow became beef, or why grass cut a certain way demanded not to be walked upon, or why household pets were so important to them. The humans are scared of nature, and are greatly reassured when they can prove to themselves they have mastery over it. This is why lawns exist, and why wolves evolved into dogs, and why their architecture is based on unnatural shapes. But, really, nature, pure nature is just a symbol to them. A symbol of human nature. They are interchangeable. So what I am saying— What are you saying? What I am saying is that it takes time to understand humans because they don’t understand themselves. They have been wearing clothes for so long. Metaphorical clothes. That is what I am talking about. That was the price of human civilisation – to create it they had to close the door on their true selves. human civilisation – to create it they had to close the door on their true selves. And so they are lost, that is how I understand it. And that is why they invented art: books, music, films, plays, painting, sculpture. They invented them as bridges back to themselves, back to who they are. But however close they get they are for ever removed. What I am saying, I suppose, is that last night I was about to kill the boy. Gulliver. He was about to fall down the stairs in his sleep but then his true nature came out and he attacked me. Attacked you with what? With himself. With his arms. His hands. He was still asleep but his eyes were open. He attacked me, or the me he thinks I am. His father. And it was pure rage. The humans are violent. That is not news. No, I know. I know. But he woke, and he wasn’t violent. That is the battle they have. And I believe if we understand human nature a little more, then we will know better what action to take in the future, when other advances are made. In the future, when another over-population crisis arises there may come a time when Earth becomes a valid option for our species. So, surely as much knowledge as possible on human psychology and society and behaviour is going to help? They are defined by greed. Not all of them. For instance, there is a mathematician called Grigori Perelman. He turned down money and prizes. He looks after his mother. We have a distorted view. I think it would be useful for all of us if I researched further. But you don’t need the two humans for that. Oh, I do. Why? Because they think they know who I am. And I have a true chance of seeing them. The real them. Behind the walls they have built for themselves. And speaking of walls, Gulliver knows nothing now. I cancelled his knowledge of what his father told him on his last night. While I am here, there is no danger. You must act soon. You don’t have for ever. I know. Don’t worry. I won’t need for ever. They must die. Yes. Wider than the sky ‘It was sleep psychosis,’ Isobel told Gulliver at breakfast the next day. ‘It’s very common. Lots of people have had it. Lots of perfectly normal and sane people. Like that man from R.E.M. He had it, and he was meant to be as nice as rock stars come.’ She hadn’t seen me. I had just entered the kitchen. But now she noticed my presence and was puzzled by the sight of me. ‘Your face,’ she said. ‘Last night there were cuts and bruises. It’s totally healed.’ ‘Must have been better than it looked. The night might exaggerate things.’ ‘Yes, but even so—’ She glanced at her son, struggling uneasily with his cereal, and decided not to go on. ‘You might need the day off school, Gulliver,’ said Isobel. I expected him to agree to this, seeing that he preferred an education that involved staring at rail-tracks. But he looked at me, considered for a moment, and concluded, ‘No. No. It’s okay. I feel fine.’ Later, it was just me and Newton in the house. I was still ‘recovering’, you see. Recover. The most human of words, the implication being that healthy normal life is covering something – the violence that is there underneath, the violence I had seen in Gulliver the night before. To be healthy meant to be covered. Clothed. Literally and metaphorically. Yet I needed to find what lay beneath, something that would satisfy the hosts and justify the delay I was taking in my task. I discovered a pile of paper, tied with an elastic band. It was in Isobel’s wardrobe, hidden among all those essential clothes, yellowing with age. I sniffed the page and guessed at least a decade. The top sheet had the words ‘Wider than the Sky’ on them, along with these ones: ‘A novel by Isobel Martin’. A novel? I read a little bit of it and realised that although the central character’s name was Charlotte, she could just as easily have been called Isobel. Charlotte heard herself sigh: a tired old machine, releasing pressure. Charlotte heard herself sigh: a tired old machine, releasing pressure. Everything weighed down on her. The small rituals of her daily existence – filling the dishwasher, picking up from school, cooking – had all been performed as if underwater. The mutual energy reserves shared by a mother and her child had now, she conceded, been monopolised by Oliver. He had been running wild since she had picked him up from school, firing that blue alien blaster or whatever it was. She didn’t know why her mother had bought it. Actually, she did know. To prove a point. ‘Five-year-old boys want to play with guns, Charlotte. It’s only natural. You can’t deprive them of their nature.’ ‘Die! Die! Die!’ Charlotte closed the oven door and set the timer. She turned around to see Oliver pointing the massive blue gun up at her face. ‘No, Oliver,’ she said, too tired to battle the abstract anger clouding his features. ‘Don’t shoot Mummy.’ He maintained his pose, fired cheap electric fairground sounds a few more times, then ran out of the kitchen, through the hallway, and noisily exterminated invisible aliens as he charged up the stairs. She remembered the quiet echoing babble of university corridors and realised that missing it was a kind of pain. She wanted to return, to teach again, but she worried she may have left it too late. Maternity leave had stretched into permanent leave, and the belief had grown that she could be fulfilled as a wife and mother, a historical archetype, ‘keeping her feet on the ground’, as her mother always advised, while her high-flying husband made sure he didn’t dip beneath the clouds. Charlotte shook her head in theatrical exasperation, as if she were being observed by an audience of stern-faced mother-watchers examining her progress and making notes on clipboards. She was often aware of the self-conscious nature of her parenting, the way she had to create a role outside of herself, a part already plotted out for her. Don’t shoot Mummy. She squatted down and looked through the oven door. The lasagne would be another forty-five minutes and Jonathan still wasn’t back from his conference. She raised herself back up and went into the living room. The wobbly glass of the drinks cabinet glinted, shining like a false promise. She turned the old key and opened the door. A mini metropolis of spirit bottles bathed in dark shadow. She reached for the Empire State, the Bombay Sapphire, and poured out her evening allowance. Jonathan. Late last Thursday. Late this Thursday. She acknowledged this fact as she slumped down on the settee, but did not get too close to it. Her husband was a mystery she no longer had the energy to unravel. Anyway, it was known to be the first rule of marriage: solve the mystery, end the love. So, families often stayed together. Wives sometimes managed to stay with husbands and put up with whichever misery they felt by writing novels and hiding them at the bottom of their wardrobes. Mothers put up with their children, no matter how difficult those children were, no matter how close to insanity they pushed their parents. Anyway, I stopped reading there. I felt it was an intrusion. A bit rich, I know, from someone who was living inside her husband’s identity. I put it back in its place in the wardrobe underneath the clothes. Later on, I told her what I had found. She gave me an unreadable look, and her cheeks went red. I didn’t know if it She gave me an unreadable look, and her cheeks went red. I didn’t know if it was a blush or anger. Maybe it was a little of both. ‘That was private. You weren’t ever supposed to see that.’ ‘I know. That is why I wanted to see it. I want to understand you.’ ‘Why? There’s no academic glory or million-dollar prize if you solve me, Andrew. You shouldn’t go snooping around.’ ‘Shouldn’t a husband know a wife?’ ‘That really is quite rich coming from you.’ ‘What does that mean?’ She sighed. ‘Nothing. Nothing. Sorry, I shouldn’t have said that.’ ‘You should say whatever you feel you should say.’ ‘Good policy. But I think that would mean we’d have divorced around 2002, at a conservative estimate.’ ‘Well? Maybe you would have been happier if you had divorced him, I mean me, in 2002.’ ‘Well, we’ll never know.’ ‘No.’ And the phone rang. It was someone for me. ‘Hello?’ A man spoke. His voice was casual, familiar, but there was a curiosity there, too. ‘Hey, it’s me. Ari.’ ‘Oh, hello Ari.’ I knew Ari was supposed to be my closest friend, so I tried to sound friend-like. ‘How are you? How’s your marriage?’ Isobel looked at me with an emphatic frown, but I don’t think he’d heard properly. ‘Well, just got back from that thing in Edinburgh.’ ‘Oh,’ I said, trying to pretend I knew what ‘that thing in Edinburgh’ was. ‘Right. Yes. That thing in Edinburgh. Of course. How was that?’ ‘It was good. Yeah, it was good. Caught up with the St Andrews lot. Listen, mate, I hear it’s been a bit of a week for you.’ ‘Yes. It has. It has been a lot of a week for me.’ ‘So I wasn’t sure if you’d still be up for the football?’ ‘The football?’ ‘Cambridge–Kettering. We could have a pint of mild and a bit of a chat, about that top secret thing you told me the last time we spoke.’ ‘Secret?’ Every molecule of me was now alert. ‘What secret?’ ‘Don’t think I should broadcast it.’ ‘No. No. You’re right. Don’t say it out loud. In fact, don’t tell anyone.’ Isobel was now in the hallway, looking at me with suspicion. ‘But to answer you, yes, I will go to the football.’ And I pressed the red button on the phone, weary at the probability that I would have to switch another human life into non-existence. A few seconds of silence over breakfast You become something else. A different species. That is the easy bit. That is simple molecular rearrangement. Our inner technology can do that, without a problem, with the correct commands and model to work from. There are no new ingredients in the universe, and humans – however they may look – are made of roughly the same things we are. The difficulty, though, is the other stuff. The stuff that happens when you look in the bathroom mirror and see this new you and don’t want to throw up into the sink at the sight of yourself like you have wanted to every other morning. And when you wear clothes, and you realise it is starting to feel like quite a normal thing to do. And when you walk downstairs and see the life form that is meant to be your son eating toast, listening to music only he can hear, it takes you a second – or two, three, four seconds – to realise that, actually, this is not your son. He means nothing to you. Not only that: he has to mean nothing to you. Also, your wife. Your wife is not your wife. Your wife who loves you but doesn’t really like you, because of something you never did, but which couldn’t be any worse, from her perspective, than the something you’re going to do. She is an alien. She is as alien as they come. A primate whose nearest evolutionary cousins are hairy tree-dwelling knuckle draggers known as chimpanzees. And yet, when everything is alien the alien becomes familiar, and you can judge her as humans judge her. You can watch her when she drinks her pink grapefruit juice, and stares at her son with worried, helpless eyes. You can see that for her being a parent is standing on a shore and watching her child in a vulnerable craft, heading out over deeper and deeper water, hoping but not knowing there will be land somewhere ahead. And you can see her beauty. If beauty on Earth is the same as elsewhere: ideal in that it is tantalising and unsolvable, creating a delicious kind of confusion. I was confused. I was lost. I wished I had a new wound, just so she could attend to me. ‘What are you looking at?’ she asked me. ‘What are you looking at?’ she asked me. ‘You,’ I said. She looked at Gulliver. He couldn’t hear us. Then she looked back at me, as confused as myself. We are worried. What are you doing? I told you. Well? I am accumulating information. You are wasting time. I’m not. I know what I am doing. It was never meant to take this long. I know. But I am learning more about the humans. They are more complicated than we first thought. They are sometimes violent, but more often care about each other. There is more goodness in them than anything else, I am convinced of it. What are you saying? I don’t know what I am saying. I am confused. Some things have stopped making sense. This happens, occasionally, on a new planet. The perspective changes to that of its inhabitants. But our perspective has not changed. Do you understand that? Yes. I do understand. Stay pure. I will. Life/death/football Humans are one of the few intelligent beings in the galaxy who haven’t quite solved the problem of death. And yet they don’t spend their whole lives screeching and howling in terror, clawing at their own bodies, or rolling around on the floor. Some humans do that – I saw them in the hospital – but those humans are considered the mad ones. Now, consider this. A human life is on average 80 Earth years or around 30,000 Earth days. Which means they are born, they make some friends, eat a few meals, they get married, or they don’t get married, have a child or two, or not, drink a few thousand glasses of wine, have sexual intercourse a few times, discover a lump somewhere, feel a bit of regret, wonder where all the time went, know they should have done it differently, realise they would have done it the same, and then they die. Into the great black nothing. Out of space. Out of time. The most trivial of trivial zeroes. And that’s it, the full caboodle. All confined to the same mediocre planet. But at ground level the humans don’t appear to spend their entire lives in a catatonic state. No. They do other things. Things like: – washing – listening – gardening – eating – driving – working – yearning – earning – staring – drinking – sighing – sighing – reading – gaming – sunbathing – complaining – jogging – quibbling – caring – mingling – fantasising – googling – parenting – renovating – loving – dancing – fucking – regretting – failing – striving – hoping – sleeping Oh, and sport. Apparently I, or rather Andrew, liked sport. And the sport he liked was football. Luckily for Professor Andrew Martin, the football team he supported was Cambridge United, one of those which successfully avoided the perils and existential trauma of victory. To support Cambridge United, I discovered, was to support the idea of failure. To watch a team’s feet consistently avoid the spherical Earth-symbol seemed to frustrate their supporters greatly, but they obviously wouldn’t have it any other way. The truth is, you see, however much they would beg to disagree, humans don’t actually like to win. Or rather, they like winning for ten seconds but if they keep on winning they end up actually having to think about other things, like life and death. The only thing humans like less than winning is losing, but at least something can be done about that. With absolute winning, there is nothing to be done. They just have to deal with it. Now, I was there at the game to see Cambridge United play against a team called Kettering. I had asked Gulliver if he wanted to come with me – so I could keep Kettering. I had asked Gulliver if he wanted to come with me – so I could keep an eye on him – and he had said, with sarcasm, ‘Yeah, Dad, you know me so well.’ So, it was just me and Ari, or to give him his full title Professor Arirumadhi Arasaratham. As I have said, this was Andrew’s closest friend, although I had learnt from Isobel that I didn’t really have friends as such. More acquaintances. Anyway, Ari was an ‘expert’ (human definition) on theoretical physics. He was also quite rotund, as if he didn’t just want to watch football but become one. ‘So,’ he said, during a period when Cambridge United didn’t have the ball (that is to say, any time during the match), ‘how are things?’ ‘Things?’ He stuffed some crisps into his mouth and made no attempt to conceal their fate. ‘You know, I was a bit worried about you.’ He laughed. It was the laugh human males do, to hide emotion. ‘Well, I say worry, it was more mild concern. I say mild concern but it was more ‘wonder if he’s done a Nash?’’ ‘What do you mean?’ He told me what he meant. Apparently human mathematicians have a habit of going mad. He gave me a list of names – Nash, Cantor, Gödel, Turing – and I nodded along as if they meant something. And then he said ‘Riemann.’ ‘Riemann?’ ‘I heard you weren’t eating much so I was thinking more Gödel than Riemann, actually,’ he said. By Gödel, I later learnt, he meant Kurt Gödel, another German mathematician. However, this one’s particular psychological quirk was that he had believed everyone was trying to poison his food. So he had stopped eating altogether. By that definition of madness, Ari appeared very sane indeed. ‘No. I haven’t done one of those. I am eating now. Peanut butter sandwiches mainly.’ ‘Sounds like more of a Presley,’ he said, laughing. And then he gave me a serious look. I could tell it was serious because he had swallowed and wasn’t putting any more food in his mouth. ‘Because, you know, prime numbers are fucking serious, man. Some serious shit. They can make you lose it. They’re like sirens. They call you in with their isolated beauty and before you know it you are in some major mind-shit. And when I heard about your naked corpus at Corpus I thought you were cracking up a bit.’ ‘No. I am on the rails,’ I said. ‘Like a train. Or a clothes-hanger.’ ‘And Isobel? Everything fine with you and Isobel?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘She is my wife. And I love her. Everything is fine. Fine.’ He frowned at me. Then he took a moment’s glance to see if Cambridge United were anywhere near the ball. He seemed relieved to see they weren’t. United were anywhere near the ball. He seemed relieved to see they weren’t. ‘Really? Everything’s fine?’ I could see he needed more confirmation. ‘Till I loved I never lived.’ He shook his head and gave a facial expression I can now safely classify as bewilderment. ‘What’s that? Shakespeare? Tennyson? Marvell?’ I shook my head. ‘No. It was Emily Dickinson. I have been reading a lot of her poetry. And also Anne Sexton’s. And Walt Whitman too. Poetry seems to say a lot about us. You know, us humans.’ ‘Emily Dickinson? You’re quoting Emily Dickinson at a match?’ ‘Yes.’ I sensed, again, I was getting the context wrong. Everything here was about context. There was nothing that was right for every occasion. I didn’t get it. The air always had hydrogen in it wherever you were. But that was pretty much the only consistent thing. What was the big difference that made quoting love poetry inappropriate in this context? I had no idea. ‘Right,’ he said, and paused for the large, communal groan as Kettering scored a goal. I groaned too. Groaning was actually quite diverting, and certainly the most enjoyable aspect of sport spectating. I might have overdone it a little bit though, judging from the looks I was getting. Or maybe they had seen me on the Internet. ‘Okay,’ he said. ‘And what does Isobel feel about everything?’ ‘Everything?’ ‘You, Andrew. What does she think? Does she know about . . . you know? Is that what triggered it?’ This was my moment. I inhaled. ‘The secret I told you?’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘About the Riemann hypothesis?’ He scrunched his face in confusion. ‘What? No, man. Unless you’ve been sleeping with a hypothesis on the side?’ ‘So what was the secret?’ ‘That you’re having it away with a student.’ ‘Oh,’ I said, feeling relief. ‘So I definitely didn’t say anything about work the last time I saw you.’ ‘No. For once, you didn’t.’ He turned back to the football. ‘So, are you going to spill the beans about this student?’ ‘My memory is a bit hazy, to be honest with you.’ ‘That’s convenient. Perfect alibi. If Isobel finds out. Not that you’re exactly man of the match in her eyes.’ ‘What do you mean?’ ‘No offence, mate, but you’ve told me what her opinion is.’ ‘No offence, mate, but you’ve told me what her opinion is.’ ‘What is her opinion of’ – I hesitated – ‘of me?’ He pressed one final handful of crisps in his mouth and washed it down with that disgusting phosphoric acid-flavoured drink called Coca-Cola. ‘Her opinion is that you are a selfish bastard.’ ‘Why does she think that?’ ‘Maybe because you are a selfish bastard. But then, we’re all selfish bastards.’ ‘Are we?’ ‘Oh yeah. It’s our DNA. Dawkins pointed that out to us, way back. But you, man, your selfish gene is on a different level. With you, I should imagine, your selfish gene is similar to the one that smashed a rock over the head of that penultimate Neanderthal, before turning round and screwing his wife.’ He smiled and carried on watching the match. It was a long match. Elsewhere in the universe, stars formed and others ceased to be. Was this the purpose of human existence? Was the purpose somewhere inside the pleasure, or at least the casual simplicity of a football match? Eventually, the game ended. ‘That was great,’ I lied, as we walked out of the grounds. ‘Was it? We lost four nil.’ ‘Yes, but while I watched it I didn’t think once about my mortality, or the various other difficulties our mortal form will bring in later life.’ He looked bewildered again. He was going to say something but he was beaten to it by someone throwing an empty can at my head. Even though it was thrown from behind I had sensed it coming, and ducked quickly out of the way. Ari was stunned by my reflexes. As, I think, was the can-thrower. ‘Oi, wanker,’ the can-thrower said, ‘you’re that freak on the web. The naked one. Bit warm, ain’t you? With all those clothes on.’ ‘Piss off, mate,’ Ari said nervously. The man did the opposite. The can-thrower was walking over. He had red cheeks and very small eyes and greasy black hair. He was flanked by two friends. All three of them had faces ready for violence. Red Cheeks leaned in close to Ari. ‘What did you say, big man?’ ‘There might have been a “piss” in there,’ said Ari, ‘and there was definitely an “off”.’ The man grabbed Ari’s coat. ‘Think you’re smart?’ ‘Moderately.’ I held the man’s arm. ‘Get off me, you fucking perv,’ he responded. ‘I was speaking to fat bastard.’ I wanted to hurt him. I had never wanted to hurt anyone – only needed to, and there was a difference. With this person, there was a definite desire to hurt him. I heard the rasp of his breath, and tightened his lungs. Within seconds he was heard the rasp of his breath, and tightened his lungs. Within seconds he was reaching for his inhaler. ‘We’ll be on our way,’ I said, releasing the pressure in his chest. ‘And you three won’t bother us again.’ Ari and I walked home, unfollowed. ‘Bloody hell,’ said Ari. ‘What was that?’ I didn’t answer. How could I? What that had been was something Ari could never understand. Clouds gathered together quickly. The sky darkened. It looked like rain. I hated rain, as I have told you. I knew Earth rain wasn’t sulphuric acid, but rain, all rain, was something I could not abide. I panicked. I started running. ‘Wait!’ said Ari, who was running behind me. ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Rain!’ I said, wishing for a dome around the whole of Cambridge. ‘I can’t stand rain.’ Light-bulb ‘Have a nice time?’ Isobel asked on my return. She was standing on top of one form of primitive technology (step-ladder) changing another one (incandescent light-bulb). ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘I did some good groaning. But to be honest with you, I don’t think I’ll go again.’ She dropped the new bulb. It smashed. ‘Damn. We don’t have another one.’ She looked, almost, like she might cry about this fact. She stepped down from the ladder, and I stared up at the dead light-bulb still hanging there. I concentrated hard. A moment later it was working again. ‘That was lucky. It didn’t need changing after all.’ Isobel stared at the light. The golden illumination on her skin was quite mesmerising, for some reason. The way it shifted shadow. Made her more distinctly herself. ‘How weird,’ she said. Then she looked down at the broken glass. ‘I’ll see to that,’ I said. And she smiled at me and her hand touched mine and gave it a quick pulse of gratitude. And then she did something I wasn’t expecting at all. She embraced me, gently, with broken glass still at our feet. I breathed her in. I liked the warmth of her body against mine and realised the pathos of being a human. Of being a mortal creature who was essentially alone but needed the myth of togetherness with others. Friends, children, lovers. It was an attractive myth. It was a myth you could easily inhabit. ‘Oh Andrew,’ she said. I didn’t know what she meant by this simple declaration of my name, but when she stroked my back I found myself stroking hers, and saying the words that seemed somehow the most appropriate. ‘It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay . . .’ Shopping I went to the funeral of Daniel Russell. I watched the coffin being lowered into the ground, and earth being sprinkled over the top of the wood casket. There were lots of people there, most of them wearing black. A few were crying. Afterwards, Isobel wanted to go over and talk to Tabitha. Tabitha looked different to when I had last seen her. She looked older, even though it had only been a week. She wasn’t crying, but it seemed like an effort not to. Isobel stroked her arm. ‘Listen, Tabitha, I just want you to know, we’re here. Whatever you need, we’re here.’ ‘Thank you, Isobel. That really does mean a lot. It really does.’ ‘Just basic stuff. If you don’t feel up to the supermarket. I mean, supermarkets are not the most sympathetic of places.’ ‘That’s very kind. I know you can do it online, but I’ve never got the hang of it.’ ‘Well, don’t worry. We’ll sort it out.’ And this actually happened. Isobel went to get another human’s shopping, and paid for it, and came home and told me I was looking better. ‘Am I?’ ‘Yes. You’re looking yourself again.’ The Zeta Function ‘Are you sure you’re ready?’ Isobel asked me, the next Monday morning, as I ate my first peanut butter sandwich of the day. Newton was asking it, too. Either that, or he was asking about the sandwich. I tore him off a piece. ‘Yes. It will be fine. What could go wrong?’ This was when Gulliver let out a mocking groan sound. The only sound he’d made all morning. ‘What’s up, Gulliver?’ I asked. ‘Everything,’ he said. He didn’t expand. Instead, he left his uneaten cereal and stormed upstairs. ‘Should I follow him?’ ‘No,’ Isobel said. ‘Give him time.’ I nodded. I trusted her. Time was her subject, after all. An hour later I was in Andrew’s office. It was the first time I had been there since I had deleted the email to Daniel Russell. This time, I wasn’t in a rush and could absorb a few more details. As he was a professor, there were books lining every wall, designed so that from whichever angle you looked at him you would see a book. I looked at some of the titles. Very primitive-looking in the main. A History of Binary and Other Non-decimal Numeration. Hyperbolic Geometry. The Book of Hexagonal Tessellation. Logarithmic Spirals and the Golden Mean. There was a book written by Andrew himself. One I hadn’t noticed the last time I had been here. It was a thin book called The Zeta Function. It had the words ‘Uncorrected Proof Copy’ on the cover. I made sure the door was locked and then sat down in his chair and read every word. And what a depressing read it was, I have to say. It was about the Riemann hypothesis, and what seemed like his futile quest to prove it and explain why the spaces between prime numbers increased the way they did. The tragedy was in realising how desperately he had wanted to solve it – and, of course, after he’d written the book he had solved it, though the benefits he’d imagined would never happen, because I had destroyed the proof. And I began to think of how fundamentally our equivalent mathematical breakthrough – the one which we came to know as the Second Basic Theory of Prime Numbers – had on us. How it enabled us to do all that we can do. Travel the universe. Inhabit other worlds, transform into other bodies. Live as long as we want to live. Search each other’s minds, each other’s dreams. All that. The Zeta Function did, however, list all the things humans had achieved. The main steps on the road. The developments that had advanced them towards civilisation. Fire, that was a biggie. The plough. The printing press. The steam engine. The microchip. The discovery of DNA. And humans would be the first to congratulate themselves on all this. But the trouble was, for them, they had never made the leap most other intelligent life forms in the universe had made. Oh, they had built rockets and probes and satellites. A few of them even worked. Yet, really, their mathematics had thus far let them down. They had yet to do the big stuff. The synchronisation of brains. The creation of free-thinking computers. Automation technology. Inter-galactic travel. And as I read, I realised I was stopping all these opportunities. I had killed their future. The phone rang. It was Isobel. ‘Andrew, what are you doing? Your lecture started ten minutes ago.’ She was cross, but in a concerned way. It still felt strange, and new, having someone be worried about me. I didn’t fully understand this concern, or what she gained by having it, but I must confess I quite liked being the subject of it. ‘Oh yes. Thank you for reminding me. I will go. Bye, erm, darling.’ Be careful. We are listening. The problem with equations I walked into the lecture hall. It was a large room made predominantly of dead trees. There were a lot of people staring at me. These were students. Some had pens and paper. Others had computers. All were waiting for knowledge. I scanned the room. There were 102 of them, in total. Always an unsettling number, stuck as it is between two primes. I tried to work out the students’ knowledge level. You see, I didn’t want to overshoot. I looked behind me. There was a whiteboard where words and equations were meant to be written but there was nothing on it. I hesitated. And during that hesitation someone sensed my weakness. Someone on the back row. A male of about twenty, with bushy blond hair and a T-shirt which said ‘What part of N = R x fs x fp x ne x f l x fi x fc x L don’t you understand?’ He giggled at the wit he was about to display and shouted out, ‘You look a bit overdressed today, Professor!’ He giggled some more, and it was contagious; the howling laughter spreading like fire across the whole hall. Within moments, everyone in the hall was laughing. Well, everyone except one person, a female. The non-laughing female was looking at me intently. She had red curly hair, full lips and wide eyes. She had a startling frankness about her appearance. An openness that reminded me of a death flower. She was wearing a cardigan and coiling strands of her hair around her finger. ‘Calm down,’ I said, to the rest of them. ‘That is very funny. I get it. I am wearing clothes and you are referring to an occasion in which I was not wearing clothes. Very funny. You think it is a joke, like when Georg Cantor said the scientist Francis Bacon wrote the plays of William Shakespeare, or when John Nash started seeing men in hats who weren’t really there. That was funny. The human mind is a limited, but high plateau. Spend your life at its outer limits and, oops, you might fall off. That is funny. Yes. But don’t worry, you won’t fall off. Young man, you are right there in the middle of your plateau. Though I appreciate your concern, I have to say I am feeling much better now. I am wearing underpants and socks and trousers and even a shirt.’ wearing underpants and socks and trousers and even a shirt.’ People were laughing again, but this time the laughter felt warmer. And it did something to me, inside, this warmth. So then I started laughing, too. Not at what I had just said, because I didn’t see how that was funny. No. I was laughing at myself. The impossible fact that I was there, on that most absurd planet and yet actually liking being there. And I felt an urge to tell someone how good it felt, in human form, to laugh. The release of it. And I wanted to tell someone about it and I realised that I didn’t want to tell the hosts. I wanted to tell Isobel. Anyway, I did the lecture. Apparently I had been meant to be talking about something called ‘post-Euclidean geometry’. But I didn’t want to talk about that, so I talked about the boy’s T-shirt. The formula written on it was something called Drake’s equation. It was an equation devised to calculate the likelihood of advanced civilisations in Earth’s galaxy, or what the humans called the Milky Way galaxy. (That is how humans came to terms with the vast expanse of space. By saying it looks like a splatter of spilt milk. Something dropped out of the fridge that could be wiped away in a second.) So, the equation: N = R x fp x ne x f l x f i x fc x L N was the number of advanced civilisations in the galaxy with whom communication might be possible. R was the average annual rate at which stars were formed. The f p was the fraction of those stars with planets. The ne was the average number of those planets that have the right eco-systems for life. The f 1 was the fraction of those planets where life would actually develop. The f i was the fraction of the above planets that could develop intelligence. The f c was the fraction of those where a communicative technologically advanced civilisation could develop. And L was the lifetime of the communicative phase. Various astrophysicists had looked at all the data and decided that there must, in fact, be millions of planets in the galaxy containing life, and even more in the universe at large. And some of these were bound to have advanced life with very good technology. This of course was true. But the humans didn’t just stop there. They came up with a paradox. They said, ‘Hold on, this can’t be right. If there are this many extraterrestrial civilisations with the ability to contact us then we would know about it because they would have contacted us.’ ‘Well, that’s true, isn’t it?’ said the male whose T-shirt started this detour. ‘No,’ I said. ‘No, it’s not. Because the equation should have some other fractions in there. For instance, it should have—’ I turned and wrote on the board behind me: fcgas ‘Fraction who could give a shit about visiting or communicating with Earth.’ And then: fdsbthdr ‘Fraction who did so but the humans didn’t realise.’ It was not exactly difficult to make human students of mathematics laugh. Indeed, I had never met a sub-category of life form so desperate to laugh – but still, it felt good. For a few brief moments, it even felt slightly more than good. I felt warmth and, I don’t know, a kind of forgiveness or acceptance from these students. ‘But listen,’ I said, ‘don’t worry. Those aliens up there – they don’t know what they are missing.’ Applause. (When humans really like something they clap their hands together. It makes no sense. But when they do it on behalf of you, it warms your brain.) And then, at the end of the lecture, the staring woman came up to me. The open flower. She stood close to me. Normally, when humans stand and talk to each other they try and leave some air between them, for purposes of breathing and etiquette and claustrophobia limitation. With this one, there was very little air. ‘I phoned,’ she said, with her full mouth, in a voice I had heard before, ‘to ask about you. But you weren’t there. Did you get my message?’ ‘Oh. Oh yes. Maggie. I got the message.’ ‘You seemed on top form today.’ ‘Thank you. I thought I would do something a bit different.’ She laughed. The laughter was fake, but something about its fakeness made me excited for some unfathomable reason. ‘Are we still having our first Tuesdays of the month?’ she asked me. ‘Oh yes,’ I said, utterly confused. ‘First Tuesdays of the month will be left intact.’ ‘That’s good.’ Her voice sounded warm and menacing, like the wind that speeds across the southern waste lands of home. ‘And listen, you know that heavy conversation we had, the night before you went la-la?’ ‘La-la?’ ‘You know. Before your routine at Corpus Christi.’ ‘What did I tell you? My mind’s a little hazy about that night, that’s all.’ ‘Oh, the kind of things you can’t say in lecture halls.’ ‘Mathematical things?’ ‘Actually, correct me if I’m wrong, but mathematical things are the kind of things you can say in lecture halls.’ I wondered about this woman, this girl, and more specifically I wondered what kind of relationship she’d had with Andrew Martin. ‘Yes. Oh yes. Of course.’ This Maggie knew nothing, I told myself. ‘Anyway,’ she said, ‘I’ll see you.’ ‘Yes. Yes. See you.’ She walked away, and I watched her walk away. For a moment there was no fact in the universe except the one that related to a female human called Maggie walking away from me. I didn’t like her, but I had no idea why. The violet A little while later I was in the college café, with Ari, having a grapefruit juice while he had a sugar-laden coffee and a packet of beef-flavoured crisps. ‘How’d it go, mate?’ I tried not to catch his cow-scented breath. ‘Good. Good. I educated them about alien life. Drake’s Equation.’ ‘Bit out of your territory?’ ‘Out of my territory? What do you mean?’ ‘Subject-wise.’ ‘Mathematics is every subject.’ He screwed up his face. ‘Tell ’em about Fermi’s Paradox?’ ‘They told me, actually.’ ‘All bollocks.’ ‘You think?’ ‘Well, what the fuck would an extraterrestrial life form want to come here for?’ ‘That is pretty much what I said.’ ‘I mean, personally, I think physics tells us there is an exo-planet out there with life on it. But I don’t think we understand what we’re looking for or what form it will take. Though I think this will be the century we find it. Course, most people don’t want to find it. Even the ones who pretend they do. They don’t want to really.’ ‘Don’t they? Why not?’ He held up his hand. A signal for me to have patience while he completed the important task of chewing and then swallowing the crisps that were in his mouth. ‘’Cause it troubles people. They turn it into a joke. You’ve got the brightest physicists in the world these days, saying over and over and over, as plainly as physicists can manage, that there has to be other life out there. And other people too – and I mean thick people, mainly – you know, star sign people, the kind of people whose ancestors used to find omens in ox shit. But not just them, other people too, people who should know a lot better – you’ve got those people saying aliens are obviously made up because War of the Worlds was made up and Close Encounters of The Third Kind was made up and though they liked those things they kind of formed a prejudice in their head that aliens can only be enjoyed as fiction. Because if you believe in them as fact you are saying the thing that every unpopular scientific breakthrough in history has said.’ ‘Which is what? ‘That humans are not at the centre of things. You know, the planet is in orbit around the sun. That was a fucking hilarious joke in the 1500s, but Copernicus wasn’t a comedian. He was, apparently, the least funny man of the whole Renaissance. He made Raphael look like Richard Pryor. But he was telling the fucking truth. The planet is in orbit around the sun. But that was out there, I’m telling you. Course, he made sure he was dead by the time it was published. Let Galileo take the heat.’ ‘Right,’ I said. ‘Yes.’ As I listened, I noticed a pain begin behind my eyes, getting sharper. On the fringes of my vision there was a blur of violet. ‘Oh, and animals have nervous systems,’ Ari went on, between swigs of coffee. ‘And could feel pain. That annoyed a few people at the time, too. And some people still don’t want to believe the world is as old as it is because that would mean having to accept the truth that humans, in the day that has been the Earth, have been here for less than a minute. We’re a late-night piss in the toilet, that’s all we are.’ ‘Right,’ I said, massaging my eyelids. ‘Recorded history is just the length it takes to the flush. And now we know we don’t have free will, people are getting pissed off about that, too. So, if and when they discover aliens they’d be really pretty unsettled because then we’d have to know, once and for all, that there is nothing really unique or special about us at all.’ He sighed, and gazed intently at the interior of his empty packet of crisps. ‘So I can see why it’s easy to dismiss alien life as a joke, one for teenage boys with overactive wrists and imaginations.’ ‘What would happen,’ I asked him, ‘if an actual alien were found on Earth?’ ‘What do you think would happen?’ ‘I don’t know. That’s why I’m asking you.’ ‘Well, I think if they had the brains to get here they’d have the brains to not reveal they were alien. They could have been here. They could have arrived in things that weren’t anything like sci-fi ‘ships’. They might not have UFOs. There might be no flying involved, and no object to fail to identify. Who the fuck knows? Maybe they were just you.’ I sat upright in my chair. Alert. ‘What?’ I sat upright in my chair. Alert. ‘What?’ ‘U. As in: no FO. Unidentified. Unidentified.’ ‘Okay. But what if, somehow, they were identified. They were “I”. What if humans knew an alien was living among them?’ After asking this, all around the café appeared little wisps of violet in the air, which no one seemed to notice. Ari downed the last of his coffee, and then considered for a moment. Scratched his face with his meaty fingers. ‘Well, put it this way, I wouldn’t want to be that poor bastard.’ ‘Ari,’ I said. ‘Ari, I am that—’ Poor bastard, was what I was going to say. But I didn’t because right then, at that precise moment, there was a noise inside my head. It was a sound of the highest possible frequency and it was extremely loud. Accompanying it, and matching it for intensity, was the pain behind my eyes, which became infinitely worse. It was the most excruciating pain I’d ever experienced, and it was a pain I had no control over. Wishing it not to be there wasn’t the same thing as it not being there, and that confused me. Or it would have done, if I’d had the capacity to think beyond the pain. And I kept thinking about the pain, and the sound, and the violet. But this sharp, throbbing heat pressing behind my eyes was too much. ‘Mate, what’s up?’ I was holding my head by this point, trying to close my eyes, but they wouldn’t close. I looked at Ari’s unshaven face, then at the few other people in the café, and the girl with glasses who was standing behind the counter. Something was happening to them, and to the whole place. Everything was dissolving into a rich, varied violet, a colour more familiar to me than any other. ‘The hosts,’ I said, aloud and almost simultaneously the pain increased further. ‘Stop, oh stop, oh stop.’ ‘Man, I’m calling an ambulance,’ he said, because I was on the floor now. A swirling violet sea. ‘No.’ I fought against it. I got to my feet. The pain lessened. The ringing became a low hum. The violet faded. ‘It was nothing,’ I said. Ari laughed, nervous. ‘I’m no expert but that honestly looked like something.’ ‘It was just a headache. A flash of pain. I’ll go to the doctor and check it out.’ ‘You should. You really should.’ ‘Yes. I will.’ ‘Yes. I will.’ I sat down. An ache remained, as a reminder, for a while, along with a few ethereal wisps in the air only I could see. ‘You were going to say something. About other life.’ ‘No,’ I said quietly. ‘Pretty sure you were, man.’ ‘Yeah, well. I think I’ve forgotten.’ And after that the pain disappeared altogether, and the air lost its final trace of violet. The possibility of pain I didn’t mention anything to Isobel or Gulliver. I knew it was unwise, because I knew the pain had been a warning. And besides, even if I wanted to tell her I wouldn’t have, because Gulliver had arrived home with a bruised eye. When human skin bruises, the skin takes various shades. Greys, browns, blues, greens. Among them, a dull violet. Beautiful, petrifying violet. ‘Gulliver, what happened?’ His mother asked the question quite a few times that evening but never got a satisfactory reply. He went into the small utility room behind the kitchen and closed the door. ‘Please, Gull, come out of there,’ said his mother. ‘We need to talk about this.’ ‘Gulliver, come out of there,’ I added. Eventually he opened the door. ‘Just leave me alone.’ That ‘alone’ was said with such a hard, cold force Isobel decided it was best to grant him that wish so we stayed downstairs while he trudged up to his room. ‘I’m going to have to phone the school about this tomorrow.’ I said nothing. Of course, I would later realise this was a mistake. I should have broken my promise to Gulliver and told her that he hadn’t been going to school. But I didn’t, because it wasn’t my duty. I did have a duty, but it wasn’t to humans. Even these ones. Especially these ones. And it was a duty I was already failing to follow, as that afternoon’s warning in the café had told me. Newton, though, had a different sense of duty and he headed up three flights of stairs to be with Gulliver. Isobel didn’t know what to do, so she opened a few cupboard doors, stared into the cupboards, sighed, then closed them again. ‘Listen,’ I found myself saying, ‘he is going to have to find his own way, and make his own mistakes.’ ‘We need to find out who did that to him, Andrew. That’s what we need to do. People can’t just go around inflicting violence on human beings like that. They just can’t do that. What ethical code do you live by where you can sound so indifferent about it?’ What could I say? ‘I’m sorry. I’m not indifferent. I care for him, of course I What could I say? ‘I’m sorry. I’m not indifferent. I care for him, of course I do.’ And the terrifying thing, the absolutely awful fact I had to face, was that I was right. I did care. The warning had failed, you see. Indeed, it had had the opposite effect. That’s what starts to happen, when you know it is possible for you to feel pain you have no control over. You become vulnerable. Because the possibility of pain is where love stems from. And that, for me, was very bad news indeed. Sloping roofs (and other ways to deal with the rain) and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, – William Shakespeare, Hamlet I couldn’t sleep. Of course I couldn’t. I had a whole universe to worry about. And I kept thinking about the pain, and the sound, and the violet. On top of that, it was raining. I decided to leave Isobel in bed and go and talk with Newton. I headed slowly downstairs, with my hands over my ears, trying to cancel out the sound of falling cloud water drumming against the windows. To my disappointment Newton was sleeping soundly in his basket. On my return upstairs I noticed something else. The air was cooler than it should have been, and the coolness was coming from above rather than below. This went against the order of things. I thought of his bruised eye, and I thought further back. I headed up towards the attic and noticed that everything there was exactly as it should be. The computer, the Dark Matter posters, the random array of socks – everything, that was, except Gulliver himself. A piece of paper floated towards me, carried on the breeze from the open window. On it were two words. I’m sorry. I looked at the window. Outside was the night and the shivering stars of this most alien, yet most familiar galaxy. Somewhere beyond this sky was home. I realised I could now get back there if I wanted. I could just finish my task and be back in my painless world. The window sloped in line with the roof, which like so many roofs here was designed to usher away the rain. It was easy enough for me to climb out of but for to usher away the rain. It was easy enough for me to climb out of but for Gulliver it must have been quite an exertion. The difficult thing for me was the rain itself. It was relentless. Skin-soaking. I saw him sitting on the edge, next to the gutter rail, with his knees pulled into his chest. He looked cold and bedraggled. And seeing him there I saw him not as a special entity, an exotic collection of protons, electrons and neutrons, but as a – using the human term – as a person. And I felt, I don’t know, connected with him. Not in the quantum sense in which everything was connected to everything else, and in which every atom spoke to and negotiated with every other atom. No. This was on another level. A level far, far harder to understand. Can I end his life? I started walking towards him. Not easy, given the human feet and 45-degree angle and the wet slate – sleek quartz and muscovite – on which I was relying. When I was getting close he turned around and saw me. ‘What are you doing?’ he asked. He was frightened. That was the main thing I noticed. ‘I was about to ask you the same thing.’ ‘Dad, just go away.’ What he was saying made sense. I mean, I could have just left him there. I could have escaped the rain, the terrible sensation of that falling water on my thin non-vascular skin, and gone inside. It was then I had to face why I was really out there. ‘No,’ I said, to my own confusion. ‘I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to go away.’ I slipped a little. A tile came unstuck, slid, fell and smashed to the ground. The smash woke Newton, who started barking. Gulliver’s eyes widened, then his head jerked away. His whole body seemed full of nervous intention. ‘Don’t do it,’ I said. He let go of something. It landed in the gutter. The small plastic cylinder that had contained the twenty-eight diazepam tablets. Now empty. I stepped closer. I had read enough human literature to realise that suicide was a real option, here, on Earth. Yet again I wondered why this should have bothered me. I was becoming mad. Losing my rationality. If Gulliver wanted to kill himself then, logically, that solved a major problem. And I should just stand back and let it happen. And I should just stand back and let it happen. ‘Gulliver, listen to me. Don’t jump. Trust me, you’re nowhere near high enough to guarantee that you’ll kill yourself.’ This was true, but as far as I could calculate there was still a very good chance of him falling and dying on impact. In which instance, there would be nothing I could do to help him. Injuries could always be healed. Death meant death. A zero squared was still a zero. ‘I remember swimming with you,’ he said, ‘when I was eight. When we were in France. Can you remember, that night you taught me how to play dominoes?’ He looked back at me, wanting to see a recognition I couldn’t give him. It was hard to see his bruised eye in this light; there was so much darkness across his face he might as well have been all bruise. ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘Of course I remember that.’ ‘Liar! You don’t remember.’ ‘Listen, Gulliver, let’s go inside. Let’s talk about this indoors. If you still want to kill yourself I’ll take you to a higher building.’ Gulliver didn’t seem to be listening, as I kept stepping on the slippery slate towards him. ‘That’s the last good memory I have,’ he said. It sounded sincere. ‘Come on, that can’t be true.’ ‘Do you have any idea what it’s like? To be your son?’ ‘No. I don’t.’ He pointed to his eye. ‘This. This is what it’s like.’ ‘Gulliver, I’m sorry.’ ‘Do you know what it’s like to feel stupid all the time?’ ‘You’re not stupid.’ I was still standing. The human way would have been to shuffle down on my backside, but that would have taken too much time. So I kept taking tentative steps on the slate, leaning back just enough, in continuous negotiation with gravity. ‘I’m stupid. I’m nothing.’ ‘No, Gulliver, you’re not. You’re something. You’re—’ He wasn’t listening. The diazepam was taking hold of him. ‘How many tablets did you take?’ I asked. ‘All of them?’ I was nearly at him, my hand was almost within grasping distance of his shoulder as his eyes closed and he disappeared into sleep, or prayer. Another tile came loose. I slipped on to my side, losing my footing on the rain-greased tiles until I was left hanging on to the gutter rail. I could have easily climbed back up. That wasn’t the problem. The problem was that Gulliver was now tilting forward. ‘Gulliver, wait! Wake up! Wake up, Gulliver!’ ‘Gulliver, wait! Wake up! Wake up, Gulliver!’ The tilt gained momentum. ‘No!’ He fell, and I fell with him. First internally, a kind of emotional falling, a silent howl into an abyss, and then physically. I sped through the air with a dreadful velocity. I broke my legs. So that was my intention. Let the legs take the pain, and not the head, because I would need my head. But the pain was immense. For a moment I worried they wouldn’t reheal. It was only the sight of Gulliver lying totally unconscious on the ground a few metres away that gave me focus. Blood leaked from his ear. To heal him I knew I would first of all need to heal myself. And it happened. Simply wishing was enough, if you wished hard enough, with the right kind of intelligence. That said, cell regeneration and bone reconstruction still took a lot of energy, especially as I was losing a lot of blood and had multiple fractures. But the pain diminished as a strange, intense fatigue took over me and gravity tried to grip me to the ground. My head hurt, but not as a result of the fall; from the exertion involved in my physical restoration. I stood up dizzily. I managed to move towards where Gulliver lay, the horizontal ground now sloping more than the roof. ‘Gulliver. Come on. Can you hear me? Gulliver?’ I could have called for help, I knew that. But help meant an ambulance and a hospital. Help meant humans grasping around in the dark of their own medical ignorance. Help meant delay and a death I was meant to approve of, but couldn’t. ‘Gulliver?’ There was no pulse. He was dead. I must have been seconds too late. I could already detect the first tiny descent in his body temperature. Rationally, I should have resigned myself to this fact. And yet. I had read a lot of Isobel’s work and so I knew that the whole of human history was full of people who tried against the odds. Some succeeded, most failed, but that hadn’t stopped them. Whatever else you could say about these particular primates, they could be determined. And they could hope. Oh yes, they could hope. And hope was often irrational. It made no sense. If it had made sense it would have been called, well, sense. The other thing about hope was that it took effort, and I had never been used to effort. At home, nothing had been an effort. That was the whole point of home, the comfort of a perfectly effortless existence. Yet there I was. Hoping. Not that I was standing there, passively, just wishing him better from a distance. Of course not. I placed my left hand – my gift hand – to his heart, and I began to work. The thing with feathers It was exhausting. I thought of binary stars. A red giant and a white dwarf, side by side, the life force of one being sucked into that of the other. His death was a fact I was convinced I could disprove, or dissuade. But death wasn’t a white dwarf. It was a good bit beyond that. It was a black hole. And once you stepped past that event horizon, you were in very difficult territory. You are not dead. Gulliver, you are not dead. I kept at it, because I knew what life was, I understood its nature, its character, its stubborn insistence. Life, especially human life, was an act of defiance. It was never meant to be, and yet it existed in an incredible number of places across a near-infinite amount of solar systems. There was no such thing as impossible. I knew that, because I also knew that everything was impossible, and so the only possibilities in life were impossibilities. A chair could stop being a chair at any moment. That was quantum physics. And you could manipulate atoms if you knew how to talk to them. You are not dead, you are not dead. I felt terrible. Waves of deep-level pained, bone-scorching effort tore through me like solar flares. And yet he still lay there. His face, I noticed for the first time, looking like his mother. Serene, egg-fragile, precious. A light came on inside the house. Isobel must have woken, from the sound of Newton’s barking if nothing else, but I wasn’t conscious of that. I was just aware that Gulliver was suddenly illuminated and, shortly after, there was the faintest flicker of a pulse beneath my hand. Hope. ‘Gulliver, Gulliver, Gulliver—’ Another pulse. Stronger. A defiant drumbeat of life. A back-beat, waiting for melody. Duh-dum. And again, and again, and again. He was alive. His lips twitched, his bruised eyes moved like an egg about to hatch. One opened. So did the other. It was the eyes, on Earth, that mattered. You saw the person, and the life inside them, if you saw the eyes. And I saw him, this messed-up, sensitive boy and felt, for a moment, the exhausted wonder of a father. It should have been a moment to savour, but it wasn’t. I was being flooded with pain, and violet. I could feel myself about to collapse on to the glossy wet ground. Footsteps behind me. And that was the last thing I heard before the darkness arrived to make its claim, along with remembered poetry, as Emily Dickinson shyly came towards me through the violet and whispered in my ear. Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul, And sings the tune without the words, And never stops at all. Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens I was back at home, on Vonnadoria, and it was exactly how it had always been. And I was exactly how I had always been, among them, the hosts, feeling no pain and no fear. Our beautiful, warless world, where I could be entranced by the purest mathematics for all eternity. .Any human who arrived here, gazing at our violet landscapes, might well have believed they had entered Heaven But what happened in Heaven? What did you do there? After a while, didn’t you crave flaws? Love and lust and misunderstandings, and maybe even a little violence to liven things up? Didn’t light need shade? Didn’t it? Maybe it didn’t. Maybe I was missing the point. Maybe the point was to exist with an absence of pain. Yes, to exist with an absence of pain. Yes, maybe that was the only aim you needed in life. It certainly had been, but what happened if you’d never required that aim because you were born after that goal had been met? I was younger than the hosts. I did not share their appreciation of just how lucky I was. Not any more. Not even in a dream. In-between I woke up. On Earth. But I was so weak I was returning to my original state. I had heard about this. Indeed, I had swallowed a word capsule about it. Rather than allow you to die your body would return to its original state, because the amount of extra energy deployed to be someone else would more usefully serve to preserve your life. And that was all the gifts were there for, really. Self-preservation. The protection of eternity. Which was fine, in theory. In theory, it was a great idea. But the only problem was that this was Earth. And my original state wasn’t equipped for the air here, or the gravity, or the face-to-face contact. I didn’t want Isobel to see me. It just could not happen. And so, as soon as I felt my atoms itch and tingle, warm and shift, I told Isobel to do what she was already doing: looking after Gulliver. And as she crouched down, with her back to me, I got to my feet, which at this point were recognisably human-shaped. Then I shifted myself – midway between two contrasting forms – across the back garden. Luckily the garden was large and dark, with lots of flowers and shrubs and trees to hide behind. So I did. I hid among the beautiful flowers. And I saw Isobel looking around, even as she was calling for an ambulance for Gulliver. ‘Andrew!’ she said at one point, as Gulliver got to his feet. She even ran into the garden to have a look. But I stayed still. ‘Where have you disappeared to?’ My lungs began to burn. I needed more nitrogen. It would have taken only one word in my native tongue. Home. The one the hosts were primed to hear, and I would be back there. So why didn’t I say it? Because I hadn’t finished my task? No. It wasn’t that. I was never going to finish my task. That was the education this night had brought me. So why? Why was I choosing risk and pain over their opposites? What had happened to me? What was wrong? Newton, now, came out into the garden. He trotted along, sniffing the plants and flowers until he sensed me standing there. I expected him to bark and draw attention, but he didn’t. He just stared at me, his eyes shining blank circles, and seemed to know exactly who it was, standing behind the juniper bushes. But he stayed quiet. He was a good dog. And I loved him. I can’t do it. We know. There is no point in doing it anyway. There is every point. I don’t believe Isobel and Gulliver should be harmed. We believe you have been corrupted. I haven’t. I have gained more knowledge. That is all that has happened. No. You have been infected by them. Infected? Infected? With what? With emotion. No. I haven’t. That is not true. It is true. Listen, emotions have a logic. Without emotions humans wouldn’t care for each other, and if they didn’t care for each other the species would have died out. To care for others is self-preservation. You care for someone and they care for you. You are speaking like one of them. You are not a human. You are one of us. We are one. I know I am not a human. We think you need to come home. No. You must come home. I never had a family. We are your family. No. It isn’t the same. We want you home. I have to ask to come home and I am not going to. You can interfere with my mind but you can’t control it. We will see. Two weeks in the Dordogne and a box of dominoes The next day we were in the living room. Me and Isobel. Newton was upstairs with Gulliver, who was now asleep. We had checked on him but Newton was staying there, on guard. ‘How are you?’ asked Isobel. ‘It was not death,’ I said. ‘For I stood up.’ ‘You saved his life,’ said Isobel. ‘I don’t think so. I didn’t even have to do CPR. The doctor said he had very minor injuries.’ ‘I don’t care what the doctor says. He jumped from the roof. That could have killed him. Why didn’t you shout for me?’ ‘I did.’ It was a lie, obviously, but the whole framework was a lie. The belief that I was her husband. It was all fiction. ‘I did shout for you.’ ‘You could have killed yourself.’ (I have to admit that humans waste a lot of their time – almost all of it – with hypothetical stuff. I could be rich. I could be famous. I could have been hit by that bus. I could have been born with fewer moles and bigger breasts. I could have spent more of my youth learning foreign languages. They must exercise the conditional tense more than any other known life form.) ‘But I didn’t kill myself. I am alive. Let’s concentrate on that.’ ‘What happened to your tablets? They were in the cupboard.’ ‘I threw them away.’ This was a lie, obviously. The unclear thing was who I was protecting? Isobel? Gulliver? Myself? ‘Why? Why would you throw them away?’ ‘I didn’t think it was a good idea, to have them lying around. You know, given his condition.’ ‘But they’re diazepam. That’s valium. You can’t overdose on valium, you’d need a thousand.’ ‘No. I know that.’ I was drinking a cup of tea. I actually enjoyed tea. It was so much better than coffee. It tasted like comfort. Isobel nodded. She too was drinking tea. The tea seemed to be making things Isobel nodded. She too was drinking tea. The tea seemed to be making things better. It was a hot drink made of leaves, used in times of crisis as a means of restoring normality. ‘Do you know what they told me?’ she said. ‘No. What? What did they tell you?’ ‘They told me he could stay in.’ ‘Right.’ ‘It was up to me. I had to say if I thought he was a suicide risk or not. And I said I thought he would be more of a risk in there than out here. They said if he tried anything like this again then there’d be no choice about it. He’d be admitted, and they’d watch him.’ ‘Oh. Well, we’ll watch him. That’s what I say. That hospital is full of mad people. People who think they’re from other planets. Stuff like that.’ She smiled a sad smile, and blew a brown tide of ripples across the surface of her drink. ‘Yes. Yes. We’ll have to.’ I tried to understand something. ‘It’s me, isn’t it? It was my fault, for that day I didn’t wear clothes.’ Something about this question switched the mood. Isobel’s face hardened. ‘Andrew, do you really think this was about one day? About your breakdown?’ ‘Oh,’ I said, which I knew wasn’t in context. But I had nothing else to say. ‘Oh’ was always the word I resorted to, the one that filled empty spaces. It was verbal tea. The ‘oh’ should have really been a ‘no’, because I didn’t think this was about one day. I thought it was about thousands of days, most of which I hadn’t been there to observe. And so an ‘oh’ was more appropriate. ‘This wasn’t about one event. This was about everything. It’s not obviously solely your fault but you haven’t really been there, have you, Andrew? For all his life, or at least since we moved back to Cambridge, you’ve just not been there.’ I remembered something he’d told me on the roof. ‘What about France?’ ‘What?’ ‘I taught him dominoes. I swam with him in a swimming pool. In France. The country. France.’ She frowned, confused. ‘France? What? The Dordogne? Two weeks in the Dordogne and a box of bloody dominoes. Is that your “Get Out of Jail Free” card? Is that fatherhood?’ ‘No. I don’t know. I was just giving a . . . a solid example of what he was like.’ ‘He?’ ‘I mean I. What I was like.’ ‘You’ve been there on holiday. Yes. Yes you have. Unless they were working holidays. Come on, you remember Sydney! And Boston! And Seoul! And Turin! And, and, Düsseldorf!’ ‘Oh yes,’ I said, staring at the unread books on the shelves like unlived memories. ‘I remember them vividly. Of course.’ ‘We hardly saw you. And when we did see you, you were always so stressed about the lecture you were going to give or the people you were going to meet. And all those rows we had. We have. Until, you know, you got ill. And got better. Come on, Andrew, you know what I’m saying. This isn’t breaking news, is it?’ ‘No. Not at all. So, where else have I failed?’ ‘You haven’t failed. It’s not an academic paper to be assessed by your peers. It’s not success or failure. It’s our life. I’m not wrapping it in judgemental language. I’m just trying to tell you the objective truth.’ ‘I just want to know. Tell me. Tell me things I’ve done. Or haven’t done.’ She toyed with her silver necklace. ‘Well, come on. It’s always been the same. Between the ages of two and four you weren’t back home in time for a single bath or bedtime story. You’d fly off the handle about anything that got in the way of you and your work. Or if I ever came close to mentioning that I had sacrificed my career for this family – at that time when I had been making real sacrifices – you wouldn’t even so much as postpone a book deadline. I’d be shot down in flames.’ ‘I know. I’m sorry,’ I said, thinking of her novel, Wider Than the Sky. ‘I’ve been terrible. I have. I think you would be better off without me. I think, sometimes, that I should leave and never come back.’ ‘Don’t be childish. You sound younger than Gulliver.’ ‘I’m being serious. I have behaved badly. I sometimes think it would be better if I went and never returned. Ever.’ This threw her. She had her hands on her hips but her glare softened. She took a big breath. ‘I need you here. You know I need you.’ ‘Why? What do I give to this relationship? I don’t understand.’ She clenched her eyes shut. Whispered, ‘That was amazing.’ ‘What?’ ‘What you did there. Out on the roof. It was amazing.’ She then made the most complex facial expression I have ever seen on a human. A kind of frustrated scorn, tinged with sympathy, which slowly softened into a deep, wide humour, culminating in forgiveness and something I couldn’t quite recognise, but which I thought might have been love. ‘What’s happened to you?’ She said it as a whisper, nothing more than a ‘What’s happened to you?’ She said it as a whisper, nothing more than a structured piece of breath. ‘What? Nothing. Nothing has happened to me. Well, a mental breakdown. But I’m over that. Other than that – nothing.’ I said this flippantly, trying to make her smile. She smiled, but sadness quickly claimed her. She looked up to the ceiling. I was beginning to understand these wordless forms of communication. ‘I’ll talk to him,’ I said, feeling kind of solid and authoritative. Kind of real. Kind of human. ‘I’ll talk to him.’ ‘You don’t have to.’ ‘I know,’ I said. And I stood up, again to help when I was supposed to hurt. Social networking Essentially, social networking on Earth was quite limited. Unlike on Vonnadoria, the brain synchronisation technology wasn’t there, so subscribers couldn’t communicate telepathically with each other as part of a true hive mind. Nor could they step into each other’s dreams and have a walk around, tasting imagined delicacies in exotic moonscapes. On Earth, social networking generally involved sitting down at a non-sentient computer and typing words about needing a coffee and reading about other people needing a coffee, while forgetting to actually make a coffee. It was the news show they had been waiting for. It was the show where the news could be all about them. But on the plus side, human computer networks, I discovered, were preposterously easy to hack into as all their security systems were based on prime numbers. And so I hacked into Gulliver’s computer and changed the name of every single person on Facebook who had bullied Gulliver to ‘I Am the Cause of Shame’, and blocked them from posting anything with the word ‘Gulliver’ in it, and gave each of them a computer virus which I dubbed ‘The Flea’ after a lovely poem. This virus ensured the only messages they would ever be able to send were ones that contained the words ‘I am hurt and so I hurt’. On Vonnadoria I had never done anything so vindictive. Nor had I ever felt quite so satisfied. Forever is composed of nows We went to the park to walk Newton. Parks were the most common destination on dog walks. A piece of nature – grass, flowers, trees – that was not quite allowed to be truly natural. Just as dogs were thwarted wolves, parks were thwarted forests. Humans loved both, possibly because humans were, well, thwarted. The flowers were beautiful. Flowers, after love, must have been the best advert planet Earth had going for it. ‘It doesn’t make sense,’ said Gulliver, as we sat down on the bench. ‘What doesn’t?’ We watched Newton sniffing the flowers, livelier than ever. ‘I was fine. No damage. Even my eye’s better.’ ‘You were lucky.’ ‘Dad, before I went out on the roof, I’d had twenty-eight diazepam.’ ‘You’d need more.’ He looked at me, angry for saying this, as if I was humiliating him. Using knowledge against him. ‘Your mum told me that,’ I added. ‘I didn’t know that.’ ‘I didn’t want you to save me.’ ‘I didn’t save you. You were just lucky. But I really think you should ignore feelings like that. That was a moment in your life. You have a lot more days to live. About twenty-four thousand more days to live, probably. That’s a lot of moments. You could do many great things in that time. You could read a lot of poetry.’ ‘You don’t like poetry. That’s one of the few facts I know about you.’ ‘It’s growing on me . . . Listen,’ I said, ‘don’t kill yourself. Don’t ever kill yourself. Just, that’s my advice, don’t kill yourself.’ Gulliver took something out of his pocket and put it in his mouth. It was a cigarette. He lit it. I asked if I could try it. Gulliver seemed troubled by this but handed it over. I sucked on the filter and brought the smoke into my lungs. And then I coughed. ‘What’s the point of this?’ I asked Gulliver. ‘What’s the point of this?’ I asked Gulliver. He shrugged. ‘It’s an addictive substance with a high fatality rate. I thought there would be a point.’ I handed the cigarette back to Gulliver. ‘Thanks,’ he mumbled, still confused. ‘Don’t worry about it,’ I said. ‘It’s fine.’ He took another drag, and suddenly realised it wasn’t doing anything for him either. He flicked the cigarette in a steep arc towards the grass. ‘If you want,’ I said, ‘we could play dominoes when we get home. I bought a box this morning.’ ‘No thanks.’ ‘Or we could go to the Dordogne.’ ‘What?’ ‘Go swimming.’ He shook his head. ‘You need some more tablets.’ ‘Yes. Maybe. You ate all mine.’ I tried to smile, playfully, and try some more Earth humour. ‘You fucker!’ There was a long silence. We watched Newton sniffing around the circumference of a tree. Twice. A million suns imploded. And then Gulliver came out with it. ‘You don’t know what it’s been like,’ he said. ‘I’ve got all this expectation on me because I’m your son. My teachers read your books. And they look at me like some bruised apple that’s fallen off the great Andrew Martin tree. You know, the posh boy who got expelled from his boarding school. The one who set stuff on fire. Whose parents gave up on him. Not that I’m bothered about that now. But even in the holidays you were never around. You were always somewhere else. Or just making everything tense and horrible with Mum. It’s just shit. You should have just done the right thing and got divorced years ago. You’ve not got anything in common.’ I thought about all this. And didn’t know what to say. Cars passed by on the road behind us. The sound was very melancholy somehow, like the bass rumble of a sleeping Bazadean. ‘What was your band called?’ ‘The Lost,’ he said. A leaf fell and landed on my lap. It was dead and brown. I held it and, quite out of character, felt a strange empathy. Maybe it was because now I was empathising with humans I could empathise with pretty much anything. Too much Emily Dickinson, that was the problem. Emily Dickinson was making me human. But not that human. There was a dull ache in my head and a small weight of tiredness in my eyes as the leaf became green. I brushed it away quickly, but it was too late. ‘What just happened?’ Gulliver asked, staring at the leaf as it floated away on the breeze. I tried to ignore him. He asked again. ‘Nothing happened to the leaf,’ I said. He forgot about the leaf he might have seen the moment he saw two teenage girls and a boy his own age walking on the road that ran behind the park. The girls were laughing into their hands at the sight of us. I have realised that, essentially, there are two broad categories of human laughter, and this was not the good kind. The boy was the boy I had seen on Gulliver’s Facebook page. Theo “The Fucking Business” Clarke. Gulliver shrank. ‘It’s the Martin Martians! Freaks!’ Gulliver cowered lower on the bench, crippled with shame. I turned around, assessed Theo’s physical structure and dynamic potential. ‘My son could beat you into the ground,’ I shouted. ‘He could flatten your face into a more attractive geometric form.’ ‘Fuck, Dad,’ said Gulliver, ‘what are you doing? He’s the one who fucked up my face.’ I looked at him. He was a black hole. The violence was all inward. It was time for him to push some the other way. ‘Come on,’ I said, ‘you’re a human. It’s time to act like one.’ Violence ‘No,’ said Gulliver. But it was too late. Theo was crossing the road. ‘Yeah, you’re a comedian now, are you?’ he said as he swaggered towards us. ‘It would be fucking amusing to see you lose to my fucking son, if that’s what you fucking mean,’ I said. ‘Yeah, well, my dad’s a Taekwondo teacher. He taught me how to fight.’ ‘Well, Gulliver’s father is a mathematician. So he wins.’ ‘Yeah right.’ ‘You will lose,’ I told the boy, and I made sure the words went all the way down and stayed there, like rocks in a shallow pond. Theo laughed, and jumped with troubling ease over the low stone wall that bordered the park, with the girls following. This boy, Theo, was not as tall as Gulliver but more strongly built. He was almost devoid of neck and his eyes were so close together he was borderline cyclopic. He was walking backwards and forwards on the grass in front of us, warming up by punching and kicking the air. Gulliver was as pale as milk. ‘Gulliver,’ I told him, ‘you fell off a roof yesterday. That boy is not a forty-foot drop. There is nothing to him. No depth. You know how he is going to fight.’ ‘Yes,’ said Gulliver. ‘He’s going to fight well.’ ‘But you, you’ve got surprise on your side. You aren’t scared of anything. All you’ve got to do is realise that this Theo symbolises everything you’ve ever hated. He is me. He is bad weather. He is the primitive soul of the Internet. He is the injustice of fate. I am asking, in other words, for you to fight him like you fight in your sleep. Lose everything. Lose all shame and consciousness and beat him. Because you can.’ ‘No,’ said Gulliver, ‘I can’t.’ I lowered my voice, conjured the gifts. ‘You can. He has the same bio- chemical ingredients inside him as you do, but with less impressive neural activity.’ I saw that Gulliver looked confused, so I tapped the side of my head activity.’ I saw that Gulliver looked confused, so I tapped the side of my head and explained. ‘It’s all about the oscillations.’ Gulliver stood up. I clipped the lead to Newton’s collar. He whined, sensing the atmosphere. I watched Gulliver walk over the grass. Nervous, tight-bodied, as if being dragged by an invisible chord. The two girls were chewing something they didn’t plan to swallow, and were giggling excitedly. Theo too was looking thrilled. Some humans not only liked violence, but craved it, I realised. Not because they wanted pain, but because they already had pain and wanted to be distracted away from that kind of pain with a lesser kind. And then Theo hit Gulliver. And he hit him again. Both times in the face, sending Gulliver staggering backwards. Newton growled, seeking involvement, but I kept him where he was. ‘You are fucking nothing,’ said Theo, raising his foot fast through the air to Gulliver’s chest. Gulliver grabbed the leg, and Theo hopped for a while, or at least long enough to look ridiculous. Gulliver looked at me through the still air in silence. Then Theo was on the ground and Gulliver let him stand up before the switch flicked and he went wild, punching away as if trying to rid himself of his own body, as if it were something that could be shaken away. And pretty soon the other boy was bleeding and he fell back on the grass, his head momentarily tilting back and touching down on a rose bush. He sat up and dabbed his face with his fingers and saw the blood and looked at it as if it were a message he’d never expected to receive. ‘All right, Gulliver,’ I said, ‘It’s time to go home.’ I went over to Theo. I crouched down. ‘You are done now, do you understand?’ Theo understood. The girls were silent but still chewed, if only at half-speed. Cow-speed. We walked out of the park. Gulliver hardly had a scratch. ‘How are you feeling?’ ‘I hurt him.’ ‘Yes. How does that make you feel? Was it cathartic?’ He shrugged. The trace of a smile hid somewhere inside his lips. It frightened me, how close violence is to the civilised surface of a human being. It wasn’t the violence itself that was the worry, it was the amount of effort they’d gone to to conceal it. A homo sapiens was a primitive hunter who had woken each day with the knowledge he could kill. And now, the equivalent knowledge was only that he would wake up each day and buy something. So it was important, for Gulliver, to release what he only released in sleep out into the waking world. Gulliver, to release what he only released in sleep out into the waking world. ‘Dad, you’re not yourself, are you?’ he said, before we got back. ‘No,’ I said. ‘Not really.’ I expected another question but none came. The taste of her skin I was not Andrew. I was them. And we woke, and the still light bedroom was clotted with violet, and though my head didn’t hurt exactly, it felt extremely tight, as though my skull was a fist and my brain was the bar of soap it contained. I tried switching off the light, but the dark didn’t work. The violet stayed, expanding and leaking across reality like spilt ink. ‘Get away,’ I urged the hosts. ‘Get away.’ But they had a hold on me. You. If you are reading this. You had a terrible hold. And I was losing myself, and I knew this because I turned over in bed and I could see Isobel in the dark, facing away from me. I could see the shape of her, half under the duvet. My hand touched the back of her neck. I felt nothing towards her. We felt nothing towards her. We didn’t even see her as Isobel. She was simply a human. The way, to a human, a cow or a chicken or a microbe is simply a cow or a chicken or a microbe. As we touched her bare neck, we gained the reading. It was all we needed. She was asleep, and all we had to do was stop her heart from beating. It was really very easy. We moved our hand slightly lower, felt the heart beating through her ribs. The movement of our hand woke her slightly, and she turned, sleepily, and said with her eyes still closed, ‘I love you.’ The ‘you’ was a singular one, and it was a call to me or the me-Andrew she thought I was, and it was then that I managed to defeat them, become a me and not a we, and the thought that she had just escaped death by such a narrow margin made me realise the intensity of my feelings towards her. ‘What’s the matter?’ I couldn’t tell her, so I kissed her instead. Kissing is what humans do when words have reached a place they can’t escape from. It is a switch to another language. The kiss was an act of defiance, maybe of war. You can’t touch us, is what the kiss said. ‘I love you,’ I told her, and as I smelt her skin, I knew I had never wanted anyone or anything more than I wanted her, but the craving for her was a anyone or anything more than I wanted her, but the craving for her was a terrifying one now. And I needed to keep underlining my point. ‘I love you, I love you, I love you.’ And after that, after the awkward shuffling away of that last thin layer of clothes, words retreated to the sounds they once were. We had sex. A happy entanglement of warm limbs and warmer love. A physical and psychological merging that conjured a kind of inner light, a bio-emotional phosphorescence, that was overwhelming in its gorgeousness. I wondered why they weren’t prouder of it. Of this magic. I wondered why, if they had to have flags, why they didn’t just opt for one with a picture of sex. Afterwards, I held her and she held me and I gently kissed her forehead as the wind beat against the window. She fell asleep. I watched her, in the dark. I wanted to protect her and keep her safe. Then I got out of bed. I had something to do. I am staying here. You can’t. You have gifts not made for that planet. Humans will become suspicious. Well then, I want to be disconnected. We cannot allow that. Yes, you can. You have to. The gifts are not compulsory. That is the point. I cannot allow my mind to be interfered with. We were not the ones interfering with your mind. We were trying to restore it. Isobel doesn’t know anything about the proof. She doesn’t know. Just leave her. Leave us. Leave us all. Please. Nothing will happen. You do not want immortality? You do not want the chance to return home or to visit anywhere else in the universe other than the lonely planet on which you now reside? That is right. You do not want the chance to take other forms? To return to your own original nature? No. I want to be a human. Or as close to being a human as it is possible for me to be. No one in all our histories has ever asked to lose the gifts. Well, it is a fact you must now update. You do realise what this means? Yes. You will be trapped in a body that cannot regenerate itself. You will grow old. You will get diseases. You will feel pain, and for ever know – unlike the rest of the ignorant species you want to belong to – that you have chosen that suffering. You have brought it on yourself. Yes. I know that. Very well. You have been given the ultimate punishment. And it makes it no less a punishment for having been asked for. You have now been disconnected. The gifts are gone. You are now human. If you declare you are from another planet you will never have proof. They will believe you are insane. And it makes no difference to us. It is easy to fill your place. You won’t fill my place. It is a waste of resources. There is no point to the mission. Hello? Are you listening? Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Hello? The rhythm of life Love is what the humans are all about but they don’t understand it. If they understood it, then it would disappear. All I know is that it’s a frightening thing. And humans are very frightened of it, which is why they have quiz shows. To take their mind off it and think of something else. Love is scary because it pulls you in with an intense force, a supermassive black hole which looks like nothing from the outside but from the inside challenges every reasonable thing you know. You lose yourself, like I lost myself, in the warmest of annihilations. It makes you do stupid things – things that defy all logic. The opting for anguish over calm, for mortality over eternity, and for Earth over home. I awoke feeling terrible. My eyes itched with tiredness. My back was stiff. There was a pain in my knee, and I could hear a mild ringing. Noises that belonged below a planet’s surface were coming from my stomach. Overall, the sensation I was feeling was one of conscious decay. In short, I felt human. I felt forty-three years old. And now I had made the decision to stay I was full of anxiety. This anxiety was not just about my physical fate. It was the knowledge that at some point in the future the hosts were going to send someone else. And what would I be able to do, now that I had no more gifts than the average human? It was a worry, at first. But that gradually faded as time went by and nothing happened. Lesser worries began to occupy my mind. For instance, would I be able to cope with this life? What had once seemed exotic began to feel rather monotonous as things settled into a rhythm. It was the archetypal human one which went: wash, breakfast, check the Internet, work, lunch, work, dinner, talk, watch television, read a book, go to bed, pretend to be asleep, then actually sleep. Belonging as I did to a species which had only ever really known one day, there was initially something quite exciting about having any kind of rhythm at all. But now I was stuck here for good I began to resent humans’ lack of imagination. I believed they should have tried to add a little more variety into proceedings. I mean, this was the species whose main excuse for not doing something was ‘if only I had more time’. Perfectly valid until you realised they did have more time. Not eternity, granted, but they had tomorrow. And the day after tomorrow. And the day after the day after tomorrow. In fact I would have had to write ‘the day after’ thirty thousand times before a final ‘tomorrow’ in order to illustrate the amount of time on a human’s hands. The problem lying behind the lack of human fulfilment was a shortage not just of time but of imagination. They found a day that worked for them and then stuck to it, and repeated it, at least between Monday and Friday. Even if it didn’t work for them – as was usually the case – they stuck to it anyway. Then they’d alter things a bit and do something a little bit more fun on Saturday and Sunday. One initial proposal I wanted to put to them was to swap things over. For instance, have five fun days and two not-fun days. That way – call me a mathematical genius – they would have more fun. But as things stood, there weren’t even two fun days. They only had Saturdays, because Mondays were a little bit too close to Sundays for Sunday’s liking, as if Monday were a collapsed star in the week’s solar system, with an excessive gravitational pull. In other words one seventh of human days worked quite well. The other six weren’t very good, and five of those were roughly the same day stuck on repeat. The real difficulty, for me, was mornings. Mornings were hard on Earth. You woke up tireder than when you went to sleep. Your back ached. Your neck ached. Your chest felt tight with anxiety that came from being mortal. And then, on top of all that, you had to do so much before the day even started. The main problem was the stuff to do in order to be presentable. A human, typically, has to do the following things. He or she will get out of bed, sigh, stretch, go to the toilet, shower, shampoo their hair, condition their hair, wash their face, shave, deodorise, brush their teeth (with fluoride!), dry their hair, brush their hair, put on face cream, apply make-up, check everything in the mirror, choose clothes based on the weather and the situation, put on those clothes, check everything again in the mirror – and that’s just what happens before breakfast. It’s a wonder they ever get out of bed at all. But they do, repeatedly, thousands of times each. And not only that – they do it by themselves, with no technology to help them. Maybe a little electrical activity in their toothbrushes and hairdryers, but nothing more than that. And all to reduce body odour, and hairs, and halitosis, and shame. Teenagers Another thing adding force to the relentless gravity dogging this planet was all the worry that Isobel still had for Gulliver. She was pinching her bottom lip quite a lot, and staring vacantly out of windows. I had bought Gulliver a bass guitar, but the music he played was so gloomy it gave the house an unceasing soundtrack of despair. ‘I just keep thinking of things,’ said Isobel, when I told her that all this worry was unhealthy. ‘When he got expelled from school. He wanted it. He wanted to be expelled. It was a sort of academic suicide. I just worry, you know. He’s always been so bad at connecting with people. I can remember the first ever report he had at nursery school. It said he had resisted making any attachments. I mean, I know he’s had friends, but he’s always found it difficult. Shouldn’t there be girlfriends by now? He’s a good-looking boy.’ ‘Are friends so important? What’s the point of them?’ ‘Connections, Andrew. Think of Ari. Friends are how we connect to the world. I just worry, sometimes, that he’s not fixed here. To the world. To life. He reminds me of Angus.’ Angus, apparently, was her brother. He had ended his own life in his early thirties because of financial worries. I felt sad when she told me that. Sad for all the humans who find it easy to feel ashamed about things. They were not the only life form in the universe to have suicide, but they were one of the most enthusiastic about it. I wondered if I should tell her that he wasn’t going to school. I decided I should. ‘What?’ Isobel asked. But she had heard. ‘Oh God. So what’s he been doing?’ ‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘Just walking around, I think.’ ‘Walking around?’ ‘When I saw him he was walking.’ She was angry now, and the music Gulliver was playing (quite loudly, by this point) wasn’t helping. And Newton was making me feel guilty with his eyes. ‘Listen, Isobel, let’s just—’ ‘Listen, Isobel, let’s just—’ It was too late. Isobel raced up the stairs. The inevitable row ensued. I could only hear Isobel’s voice. Gulliver’s was too quiet and low, deeper than the bass guitar. ‘Why haven’t you been to school?’ his mother shouted. I followed, with nausea in my stomach, and a dull ache in my heart. I was a traitor. He shouted at his mother, and his mother shouted back. He mentioned something about me getting him into fights but fortunately Isobel had no clue what he was talking about. ‘Dad, you bastard,’ he said to me at one point. ‘But the guitar. That was my idea.’ ‘So you’re buying me now?’ Teenagers, I realised, were really quite difficult. In the same way the south- eastern corner of the Derridean galaxy was difficult. His door slammed. I used the right tone of voice. ‘Gulliver, calm down. I am sorry. I am only trying to do what is best for you. I am learning here. Every day is a lesson, and some lessons I fail.’ It didn’t work. Unless working meant Gulliver kicking his own door with rage. Isobel eventually went downstairs, but I stayed there. An hour and thirty- eight minutes sitting on the beige wool carpet on the other side of the door. Newton came to join me. I stroked him. He licked my wrist with his rough tongue. I stayed right there, tilted my head towards the door. ‘I am sorry, Gulliver,’ I said. ‘I am sorry. I am sorry. And I am sorry I embarrassed you.’ Sometimes the only power you need is persistence. Eventually, he came out. He just looked at me, hands in pockets. He leant against the door-frame. ‘Did you do something on Facebook?’ ‘I might have done.’ He tried not to smile. He didn’t say much after that but he came downstairs and we all watched television together. It was a quiz show called Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (As the show was aimed at humans, the question was rhetorical.) Then, shortly after, Gulliver went to the kitchen to see how much cereal and milk would fit into a bowl (more than you could imagine) and then he disappeared back to the attic. There was a feeling of something having been accomplished. Isobel told me she had booked us tickets to see an avant-garde production of Hamlet at the Arts Theatre. It was apparently about a suicidal young prince who wants to kill the man who has replaced his father. ‘Gulliver is staying at home,’ said Isobel. ‘That might be wise.’ ‘That might be wise.’ Australian wine ‘I’ve forgotten to take my tablets today.’ Isobel smiled. ‘Well, one evening off won’t hurt. Do you want a glass of wine?’ I hadn’t tried wine before so I said yes, as it really did seem to be a very revered substance. It was a mild night so Isobel poured me a glass and we sat outside in the garden. Newton decided to stay indoors. I looked at the transparent yellow liquid in the glass. I tasted it and tasted fermentation. In other words I tasted life on Earth. For everything that lives here ferments, ages, becomes diseased. But as things made their decline from ripeness they could taste wonderful, I realised. Then I considered the glass. The glass had been distilled from rock and so it knew things. It knew the age of the universe because it was the universe. I took another sip. After the third sip, I was really beginning to see the point, and it did something rather pleasant to the brain. I was forgetting the dull aches of my body and the sharp worries of my mind. By the end of the third glass I was very, very drunk. I was so drunk I looked to the sky and believed I could see two moons. ‘You do realise you’re drinking Australian wine, don’t you?’ she said. To which I may have replied ‘Oh.’ ‘You hate Australian wine.’ ‘Do I? Why?’ I said. ‘Because you’re a snob.’ ‘What’s a snob?’ She laughed, looked at me sideways. ‘Someone who didn’t used to sit down with his family to watch TV,’ she said. ‘Ever.’ ‘Oh.’ I drank some more. So did she. ‘Maybe I am becoming less of one,’ I said. ‘Anything is possible.’ She smiled. She was still exotic to me. That was obvious, but it was a pleasant exoticism now. Beyond pleasant, in fact. obvious, but it was a pleasant exoticism now. Beyond pleasant, in fact. ‘Actually, anything is possible,’ I told her, but didn’t go into the maths. She put her arm around me. I did not know the etiquette. Was this the moment I was meant to recite poetry written by dead people or was I meant to massage her anatomy? I did nothing. I just let her stroke my back as I stared upwards, beyond the thermosphere, and watched the two moons slide together and become one. The watcher The next day I had a hangover. I realised that if getting drunk was how people forgot they were mortal, then hangovers were how they remembered. I woke with a headache, a dry mouth, and a bad stomach. I left Isobel in bed and went downstairs for a glass of water, then I had a shower. I got dressed and went into the living room to read poetry. I had the strange but real sense that I was being watched. The sense grew and grew. I stood up, went to the window. Outside the street was empty. The large, static redbrick houses just stood there, like decharged crafts on a landing strip. But still I stayed looking. I thought I could see something reflected in one of the windows, a shape beside a car. A human shape, maybe. My eyes might have been playing tricks. I was hungover, after all. Newton pressed his nose into my knee. He released a curious high-pitched whine. ‘I don’t know,’ I said. I stared out of the glass again, away from reflections, to direct reality. And then I saw it. Dark, hovering just above that same parked car. I realised what it was. It was the top of a human head. I had been right. Someone was hiding from my stare. ‘Wait there,’ I told Newton. ‘Guard the house.’ I ran outside, across the drive and onto the street, just in time to see someone sprinting away around the next corner. A man, wearing jeans and a black top. Even from behind, and at a distance, the man struck me as familiar, but I couldn’t think where I had seen him. I turned the corner, but there was no one there. It was just another empty suburban street, and a long one. Too long for the person to have run down. Well, it wasn’t quite empty. There was an old human female, walking towards me, dragging a shopping trolley. I stopped running. ‘Hello,’ she said, smiling. Her skin was creased with age, in the way typical of the species. (The best way to think of the ageing process in relation to a human face is to imagine a map of an area of innocent land which slowly becomes a city with many long and winding routes.) with many long and winding routes.) I think she knew me. ‘Hello,’ I said back. ‘How are you now?’ I was looking around, trying to assess the possible escape routes. If they had slid down one of the passageways then they could have been anywhere. There were about two hundred obvious possibilities. ‘I’m, I’m fine,’ I said. ‘Fine.’ My eyes darted around but were unrewarded. Who was this man? I wondered. And where was he from? Occasionally, in the days that followed, I would have that feeling again, of being watched. But I never caught a glimpse of my watcher, which was strange, and led me to only two possibilities. Either I was becoming too dull-witted and human, or the person I was looking for, the one who I could sometimes feel watching me in university corridors and in supermarkets, was too sharp-witted to be caught. In other words: something not human. I tried to convince myself that this was ridiculous. I was almost able to convince myself that my own mind was ridiculous, and that I had never actually been anything other than human. That I really was Professor Andrew Martin and that every other thing had been a kind of dream. Yes, I could almost do that. Almost. How to see for ever That it will never come again, Is what makes life so sweet. – Emily Dickinson Isobel was at her laptop, in the living room. An American friend of hers wrote a blog about ancient history and Isobel was contributing a comment about an article on Mesopotamia. I watched her, mesmerised. The Earth’s moon was a dead place, with no atmosphere. It had no way of healing its scars. Not like Earth, or its inhabitants. I was amazed, the way time mended things so quickly on this planet. I looked at Isobel and I saw a miracle. It was ridiculous, I know. But a human, in its own small way, was a kind of miraculous achievement, in mathematical terms. For a start, it wasn’t very likely that Isobel’s mother and father would have met. And even if they had met the chances of their having a baby would have been pretty slim, given the numerous agonies surrounding the human dating process. Her mother would have had about a hundred thousand eggs ovulating inside her, and her father would have had five trillion sperm during that same length of time. But even then, even that one in five hundred million million million chance of existing was a terrible understatement, and nowhere near did the coincidence of a human life justice. You see, when you looked at a human’s face, you had to comprehend the luck that brought that person there. Isobel Martin had a total of 150,000 generations before her, and that only includes the humans. That was 150,000 increasingly unlikely copulations resulting in increasingly unlikely children. That was a one in quadrillion chance multiplied by another quadrillion for every generation. Or around twenty thousand times more than the number of the atoms in the universe. But even that was only the start of it, because humans had only been around for three million Earth years, certainly a very short time compared to the three and a half billion years since life first appeared on this planet. Therefore, mathematically, rounding things up, there was no chance at all that Isobel Martin could have existed. A zero in tento-the-power-of-forever chance. And yet there she was, in front of me, and I was quite taken aback by it all; I really was. Suddenly it made me realise why religion was such a big thing around here. Because, yes, sure, God could not exist. But then neither could humans. So, if they believed in themselves – the logic must go – why not believe in something that was only a fraction more unlikely? I don’t know how long I looked at her like this. ‘What’s going through your mind?’ she asked me, closing the laptop. (This is an important detail. Remember: she closed the laptop.) ‘Oh, just things.’ ‘Tell me.’ ‘Well, I’m thinking about how life is so miraculous none of it really deserves the title “reality”.’ ‘Andrew, I’m a little taken aback about how your whole worldview has become so romantic.’ It was ridiculous that I had ever failed to see it. She was beautiful. A forty-one-year-old, poised delicately between the young woman she had been and the older one she would become. This intelligent, wound-dabbing historian. This person who would buy someone else’s shopping with no other motive than simply to help. I knew other things now. I knew she’d been a screaming baby, a child learning to walk, a girl at school eager to learn, a teenager listening to Talking Heads in her bedroom while reading books by A.J.P. Taylor. I knew she’d been a university student studying the past and trying to interpret its patterns. She’d been, simultaneously, a young woman in love, full of a thousand hopes, trying to read the future as well as the past. She had then taught British and European history, the big pattern she had discovered being the one that revealed that the civilisations that advanced with the Enlightenment did so through violence and territorial conquest more than through scientific progress, political modernisation and philosophical understanding. She had then tried to uncover the woman’s place in this history, and it had been difficult because history had always been written by the victors of wars, and the victors of the gender wars had always been male, and so women had been placed in the margins and in the footnotes, if they had been lucky. been placed in the margins and in the footnotes, if they had been lucky. And yet the irony was that she soon placed herself in the margins voluntarily, giving up work for family, because she imagined that when she eventually arrived at her death-bed she would feel more regret about unborn children than unwritten books. But as soon as she made that move, she had felt her husband begin to take her for granted. She had stuff to give, but it was ungiven; it was locked away. And I felt an incredible excitement at being able to witness the love re-emerge inside her, because it was a total, prime-of-life love. The kind that could only be possible in someone who was going to die at some point in the future, and also someone who had lived enough to know that loving and being loved back was a hard thing to get right, but when you managed it you could see forever. Two mirrors, opposite and facing each other at perfectly parallel angles, viewing themselves through the other, the view as deep as infinity. Yes, that was what love was for. (I may not have understood marriage, but I understood love, I was sure of it.) Love was a way to live forever in a single moment, and it was also a way to see yourself as you had never actually seen yourself, and made you realise – having done so – that this view was a more meaningful one than any of your previous self-perceptions and selfdeceptions. Even though, the big joke was, indeed the very biggest joke in the universe was, that Isobel Martin believed I had always been a human called Andrew Martin who had been born one hundred miles away in Sheffield, and not in fact 8653178431 light years away. ‘Isobel, I think I should tell you something. It is something very important.’ She looked worried. ‘What? What is it?’ There was an imperfection in her lower lip. The left side of it slightly fuller than the right. It was a fascinating detail on a face that only had fascinating details. How could I have ever found her hideous? How? How? I couldn’t do it. Say it. I should have, but I didn’t. ‘I think we should buy a new sofa,’ I said. ‘That’s the important thing you want to tell me?’ ‘Yes. I don’t like it. I don’t like purple.’ ‘Don’t you?’ ‘No. It’s too close to violet. All those short wavelength colours mess with my brain.’ ‘You are funny. “Short wavelength colours.” ’ ‘Well, that’s what they are.’ ‘But purple is the colour of emperors. And you’ve always acted like an emperor so . . .’ ‘Is it? Why?’ ‘Is it? Why?’ ‘Byzantine empresses gave birth in the Purple Chamber. Their babies were given the honorary title “Porphyrogenitos” which meant “Born to the Purple” to separate them from riff-raff generals who won the throne through going to war. But then, in Japan, purple is the colour of death.’ I was mesmerised by her voice when she spoke about historical things. It had a delicacy to it, each sentence a long thin arm carrying the past as if it were porcelain. Something that could be brought out and presented in front of you but which could break and become a million pieces at any moment. I realised even her being a historian was part of her caring nature. ‘Well, I just think we could do with some new furniture,’ I said. ‘Do you now?’ she asked, staring deep into my eyes in a mockserious way. One of the brighter humans, a German-born theoretical physicist called Albert Einstein, explained relativity to dimmer members of his species by telling them: ‘Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute.’ What if looking at the pretty girl felt like putting your hand on a hot stove? What was that? Quantum mechanics? After a period of time, she leant towards me and kissed me. I had kissed her before. But now the lightening effect on my stomach was very like fear. Indeed, it was every symptom of fear, but a pleasurable fear. An enjoyable danger. She smiled, and told me a story she had once read not in a history book but in a terrible magazine at the doctor’s. A husband and a wife who had fallen out of love had their own separate affairs on the Internet. It was only when they came to meet their illicit lovers that they realised they had actually been having an affair with each other. But far from tearing the marriage apart it restored it, and they lived more happily than before. ‘I have something to tell you,’ I said, after this story. ‘What?’ ‘I love you.’ ‘I love you, too.’ ‘Yes, but it is impossible to love you.’ ‘Thank you. Precisely what a girl likes to hear.’ ‘No. I mean, because of where I come from. No one there can love.’ ‘What? Sheffield? It’s not that bad.’ ‘No. Listen, this is new to me. I’m scared.’ She held my head in her hands, as if it were another delicate thing she wanted to preserve. She was a human. She knew one day her husband would die and yet she still dared to love him. That was an amazing thing. We kissed some more. We kissed some more. Kissing was very much like eating. But instead of reducing the appetite the food consumed actually increased it. The food wasn’t matter, it had no mass, and yet it seemed to convert into a very delicious energy inside me. ‘Let’s go upstairs,’ she said. She said the word suggestively, as though upstairs wasn’t just a place but an alternate reality, made from a different texture of space-time. A pleasure land we would enter via a worm hole on the sixth stair. And, of course, she was absolutely right. Afterwards, we lay there for a few minutes, and then she decided we needed some music. ‘Anything,’ I said, ‘but The Planets.’ ‘That’s the only piece of music you like.’ ‘Not anymore.’ So she put on something called ‘Love Theme’ by Ennio Morricone. It was sad, but beautiful. ‘Can you remember when we saw Cinema Paradiso?’ ‘Yes,’ I lied. ‘You hated it. You said it was so sentimental you wanted to throw up. You said it cheapens emotion to have it exaggerated and fetishised like that. Not that you’ve ever wanted to watch emotional things. I think, if I dare say it, you have always been scared of emotion, and so saying that you don’t like sentimentality is a way of saying you don’t like feeling emotion.’ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘don’t worry. That me is dead.’ She smiled. She didn’t seem worried at all. But of course she should have been. We all should have been. And just how worried we should have been would become clear to me only a few hours later. The intruder She woke me in the middle of the night. ‘I think I heard someone,’ she said. Her voice indicated a tightness of the vocal folds within her larynx. It was fear disguised as calm. ‘What do you mean?’ ‘I swear to God, Andrew. I think there’s someone in the house.’ ‘You might have heard Gulliver.’ ‘No. Gulliver hasn’t come downstairs. I’ve been awake.’ I waited in the near-darkness, and then I heard something. Footsteps. It very much sounded like someone was walking around our living room. The clock’s digital display beamed 04:22. I pulled back the duvet and got out of bed. I looked at Isobel. ‘Just stay there. Whatever happens, stay right there.’ ‘Be careful,’ Isobel said. She switched on her bedside light and looked for the phone that was usually in its cradle on the table. But it wasn’t there. ‘That’s weird.’ I left the room and waited a moment on the landing. There was silence now. The silence that can only exist in houses at twenty past four in the morning. It struck me then just how primitive life was here, with houses that could not do anything to protect themselves. In short, I was terrified. Slowly and quietly I tiptoed downstairs. A normal person would probably have switched the hallway light on, but I didn’t. This wasn’t for my benefit, but for Isobel’s. If she came down and saw whoever it was, and they saw her, well, that could have been a very dangerous situation. Also, it would have been unwise to alert the intruder of my presence downstairs – if they hadn’t already been alerted. And so it was that I crept into the kitchen and saw Newton sleeping soundly (maybe even suspiciously so) in his basket. As far as I could tell, no one else had been in here, or the utility room, and so I left to check the sitting room. No one was there, or no one that I could see anyway. There were just books, the sofa, an empty fruit bowl, a desk and a radio. So then I went along the hallway to sofa, an empty fruit bowl, a desk and a radio. So then I went along the hallway to the living room. This time, before I opened the door I sensed strongly that someone was there. But without the gifts I had no idea if my senses were fooling me. I opened the door. As I did so, I felt a deep fear lightening my whole body. Prior to taking human form, I had never experienced such a feeling. What had we Vonnadorians ever had to be scared of, in a world without death or loss or uncontrollable pain? Again, I saw only furniture. The sofa, the chairs, the switched-off television, the coffee table. No one was there, not at that moment, but we had definitely been visited. I knew this because Isobel’s laptop was on the coffee table. This, alone, wasn’t worrying, as she had left it there last night. What worried me, though, was that it was open. She had closed it. But not only that. The light emission. Even though the computer was facing away from me I could see that the screen was glowing, which meant someone had been using it within the last two minutes. I quickly went around the coffee table to see what was on the screen, but nothing had been deleted. I closed the laptop and went upstairs. ‘What was it?’ Isobel asked, as I slid back into bed. ‘Oh, it was nothing. We must have been hearing things.’ And Isobel fell asleep as I stared up at the ceiling, wishing I had a god who could hear my prayers. Perfect time The next morning Gulliver brought his guitar downstairs and played a bit for us. He had learnt an old piece of music by a band known as Nirvana called ‘All Apologies’. With intense concentration on his face, he kept perfect time. He was very good, and we applauded him afterwards. For a moment, I forgot every worry. A king of infinite space It turned out that Hamlet was quite a depressing thing to watch when you had just given up immortality and were worried that someone was watching you. The best bit came half-way through when he looked up at the sky. ‘Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in the shape of a camel?’ he asked. ‘By th’ Mass,’ said another man, a curtain-fetishist called Polonius, ‘and ’tis like a camel, indeed.’ ‘Methinks it is like a weasel,’ said Hamlet. ‘It is backed like a weasel.’ Then Hamlet squinted and scratched his head. ‘Or like a whale.’ And Polonius, who wasn’t really in tune with Hamlet’s surreal sense of humour: ‘Very like a whale.’ Afterwards, we went out to a restaurant. It was called Tito’s. I had a bread salad called ‘panzanella’. It had anchovies in it. Anchovies were a fish, so I spent the first five minutes carefully taking them out and laying them on the side of the plate, offering them silent words of grief. ‘You seemed to enjoy the play,’ said Isobel. I thought I would lie. ‘I did. Yes. Did you?’ ‘No. It was awful. I think it was fundamentally wrong to have the Prince of Denmark played by a TV gardener.’ ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘you’re right. It was really bad.’ She laughed. She seemed more relaxed than I had ever seen her. Less worried about me, and Gulliver. ‘There’s a lot of death in it, as well,’ I said. ‘Yes.’ ‘Are you scared of death?’ She looked awkward. ‘Of course, I’m scared to death of death. I’m a lapsed Catholic. Death and guilt. That’s all I have.’ Catholicism, I discovered, was a type of Christianity for humans who like gold leaf, Latin and guilt. ‘Well, I think you do amazingly. Considering that your body is starting a slow process of physical deterioration leading ultimately to . . .’ process of physical deterioration leading ultimately to . . .’ ‘Okay, okay. Thank you. Enough death.’ ‘But I thought you liked thinking about death. I thought that’s why we saw Hamlet.’ ‘I like my death on a stage. Not over my penne arrabiata.’ So we talked and drank red wine as people came and left the restaurant. She told me of the module she was being cajoled into teaching next year. Early Civilised Life in the Aegean. ‘They keep trying to push me further and further back in time. Think they’re trying to tell me something. Next it will be Early Civilised Diplodocuses.’ She laughed. So I laughed too. ‘You should get that novel published,’ I said, trying a different tack. ‘Wider Than the Sky. It’s good. What I’ve read of it.’ ‘I don’t know. That one was a bit private. Very personal. Of its time. I was in a dark place. That was when you were . . . well, you know. We’re over that now. I feel like a different person now. Almost like I’m married to a different person too.’ ‘Well, you should write fiction again.’ ‘Oh, I don’t know. It’s getting the ideas.’ I didn’t want to tell her that I had quite a lot of ideas I could give her. ‘We haven’t done this for years, have we?’ she said. ‘Done what?’ ‘Talk. Like this. It feels like a first date or something. In a good way. It feels like I’m getting to know you.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘God,’ she said wistfully. She was drunk now. So was I, even though I was still on my first glass. ‘Our first date,’ she went on. ‘Can you remember?’ ‘Of course. Of course.’ ‘It was here. But it was an Indian then. What was its name? . . . The Taj Mahal. You’d changed your mind on the phone after I wasn’t too impressed at the Pizza Hut suggestion. Cambridge didn’t even have a Pizza Express back then. God . . . twenty years. Can you believe it? Talk about the compression of time through memory. I remember it better than anything. I was late. You waited an hour for me. Out in the rain. I thought that was so romantic.’ She looked off into the distance, as though twenty years ago were a physical thing that could be seen sitting at a table in the corner of the room. And as I stared at those eyes, which were loitering somewhere in the infinity between past and present, happy and sad, I deeply wanted to have been that person she was talking about. The one who had braved the rain and got soaked to the skin two talking about. The one who had braved the rain and got soaked to the skin two decades ago. But I wasn’t that person. And I would never be him. I felt like Hamlet. I had absolutely no idea what to do. ‘He must have loved you,’ I said. She stopped daydreaming. Was suddenly alert. ‘What?’ ‘I,’ I said, staring down at my slow-melting limoncello ice-cream. ‘And I still love you. As much as I did then. I was just, you know, seeing us, the past, in the third person. Distance of time . . .’ She held my hand across the table. Squeezed it. For a second I could dream I was Professor Andrew Martin, just as easily as a TV gardener could dream he was Hamlet. ‘Can you remember when we used to go punting on the Cam?’ she asked. ‘That time you fell in the water . . . God, we were drunk. Can you remember? While we were still here, before you had that Princeton offer and we went to America. We really had fun, didn’t we?’ I nodded, but I felt uncomfortable. Also, I didn’t want to leave Gulliver on his own any longer. I asked for the bill. ‘Listen,’ I said, as we walked out of the restaurant, ‘there’s something I really feel obliged to let you know . . .’ ‘What?’ she asked, looking up at me. Holding on to my arm as she flinched at the wind. ‘What is it?’ I breathed deeply, filling my lungs, seeking courage somewhere in the nitrogen and the oxygen. In my mind I ran through the pieces of information I had to give her. I am not from here. In fact, I am not even your husband. I am from another planet, in another solar system, in a distant galaxy. ‘The thing is . . . well, the thing is . . .’ ‘Think we should probably cross the road,’ said Isobel, tugging my arm, as two silhouettes – a shouting female and a male – came towards us on the pavement. So we did, crossing at an angle that tried to balance the concealment of fear with rapid avoidance – that angle being, as it was everywhere in the universe, 48 degrees away from the straight line on which we had been travelling. Midway across that carless road I turned and saw her. Zoë. The woman from the hospital I had met on my first day on this planet. She was still shouting at the large, muscular, shaven-headed man. The man had a tattoo of a tear on his face. I remembered her confession of her love of violent men. ‘I’m telling you, you’ve got it wrong! You’re the one that’s crazy! Not me! But if you want to go around like a primitive life form that’s fine! Do it, you But if you want to go around like a primitive life form that’s fine! Do it, you thick piece of shit!’ ‘You pretentious, cock-munching slag!’ And then she saw me. The art of letting go ‘It’s you,’ Zoë said. ‘You know her?’ whispered Isobel. ‘I’m afraid . . . yes. From the hospital.’ ‘Oh no.’ ‘Please,’ I said to the man, ‘be nice.’ The man was staring at me. His shaven head, along with the rest of his body, came towards me. ‘And what on Earth has it got to do with you?’ ‘On Earth,’ I said, ‘it’s nice to see people getting on together.’ ‘You fuckin’ what?’ ‘Just turn around,’ Isobel said fearlessly, ‘and leave everyone alone. Seriously, if you do anything else you’ll just regret it in the morning.’ It was then he turned to Isobel and held her face, squeezing her cheeks hard, distorting her beauty. Anger flared inside me as he said to her, ‘Shut your fucking mouth, you meddling bitch.’ Isobel now had fear-swollen eyes. There were rational things to do here, I was sure, but I had come a long way since rationality. ‘Leave us all alone,’ I said, momentarily forgetting that my words were just that. Words. He looked at me and he laughed. And with that laughter came the terrifying knowledge that I had no power whatsoever. The gifts had been taken from me. I was, to all intents and purposes, no more equipped for a fight with a giant gym- bodied thug than the average human professor of mathematics, which wasn’t particularly well equipped at all. He beat me. And it was a proper beating. Not the kind Gulliver had given me, and which I had opted to feel. No. If there had been an option not to feel the cheap metal rings of this man’s fist collide into my face with comet-like force then I would have taken that option. As I would have done only moments later when I was on the ground receiving a kick in the stomach, rapidly unsettling the when I was on the ground receiving a kick in the stomach, rapidly unsettling the undigested Italian food residing there, followed by the final piece of brutalist punctuation – the kick to the head. More of a stamp, actually. After that, there was nothing. There was darkness, and Hamlet. This was your husband. Look you now what follows. I heard Isobel wailing. I tried to speak to her, but words were hard to reach. The counterfeit presentment of two brothers. I could hear the rise and fall of a siren, and knew it was for me. Here is your husband, like a mildew’d ear. I woke, in the ambulance, and there was only her. Her face above me, like a sun that eyes could stand, and she stroked my hand as she had once stroked my hand the first time I’d met her. ‘I love you,’ she said. And I knew the point of love right then. The point of love was to help you survive. The point was also to forget meaning. To stop looking and start living. The meaning was to hold the hand of someone you cared about and to live inside the present. Past and future were myths. The past was just the present that had died and the future would never exist anyway, because by the time we got to it the future would have turned into the present. The present was all there was. The ever-moving, ever-changing present. And the present was fickle. It could only be caught by letting go. So I let go. I let go of everything in the universe. Everything, except her hand. Neuroadaptive activity I woke up in the hospital. It was the first time in my life I had woken in serious physical pain. It was night-time. Isobel had stayed for a while and had fallen asleep in a plastic chair. But she had now been told to go home. So I was alone, with my pain, feeling how truly helpless it was to be a human. And I stayed awake in the dark, urging the Earth to rotate faster and faster so that it could be facing the sun again. For the tragedy of night to become the comedy of day. I wasn’t used to night. Of course, I had experienced it on other planets but Earth had the darkest nights I had ever experienced. Not the longest, but the deepest, the loneliest, the most tragically beautiful. I consoled myself with random prime numbers. 73. 131. 977. 1213. 83719. Each as indivisible as love, except by one and itself. I struggled to think of higher primes. Even my mathematical skills had abandoned me, I realised. They tested my ribs, my eyes, my ears, and inside my mouth. They tested my brain and my heart. My heart had caused no concern, though they did consider forty-nine beats per minute to be a little on the slow side. As for my brain, they were a little concerned about my medial temporal lobe, as there seemed to be some unusual neuroadaptive activity taking place. ‘It’s as though there has been something taken out of your brain and your cells are trying to over-compensate, but clearly nothing has been taken out or damaged. But it is very strange.’ I nodded. Of course, something had been taken out, but I also knew it was nothing any human, Earth-based doctor would ever be able to understand. It had been a difficult test, but I had passed it. I was as good as human. And they gave me some paracetamol and codeine for the pain which still pulsated inside my head and on my face. Eventually, I went home. The next day, Ari came to visit me. I was in bed. Isobel was at work and Gulliver was, quite genuinely it seemed, at school. Gulliver was, quite genuinely it seemed, at school. ‘Man, you look fucking terrible.’ I smiled, lifted the bag of frozen peas from the side of my head. ‘Which is a coincidence, because I feel fucking terrible too.’ ‘You should’ve gone to the police.’ ‘Well, yes, I was thinking about it. Isobel thinks I should. But I have a little bit of a phobia about police. You know, ever since I was arrested for not wearing clothes.’ ‘Yeah, well, you can’t have psychos roaming around pulverising anyone they feel like.’ ‘No, I know. I know.’ ‘Listen, mate, I just want to say that was big of you. That was old-school gentleman, defending your wife like that and, you know, kudos for it. It surprised me. I’m not putting you down or anything, but I didn’t know you were that kind of shining-armour guy.’ ‘Well, I’ve changed. I have a lot of activity in my medial temporal lobe. I think it’s probably to do with that.’ Ari looked doubtful. ‘Well, whatever it is, you’re becoming a man of honour. And that’s rare for mathematicians. It’s always been us physicists who’ve had the big cojones, traditionally. Just don’t screw it up with Isobel. You know what I mean?’ I looked at Ari for a long time. He was a good man, I could see that. I could trust him. ‘Listen, Ari, you know that thing I was going to tell you. At the café at the college?’ ‘When you had that migraine?’ ‘Yes,’ I hesitated. I was disconnected, so I knew I could tell him. Or thought I could. ‘I am from another planet, in another solar system, in another galaxy.’ Ari laughed. It was a loud, deep blast of laughter without a single note of doubt. ‘Okay, ET, so you’ll be wanting to phone home now. If we’ve got a connection that reaches the Andromeda galaxy.’ ‘It’s not the Andromeda galaxy. It’s further away. Many, many light years.’ This sentence was hardly heard as Ari was laughing so much. He stared at me with fake blankness. ‘So how did you get here? Space ship? Wormhole?’ ‘No. I didn’t travel in any conventional way you would understand. It was anti-matter technology. Home is forever away, but it is also only a second away. Though now, I can never go back.’ It was no good. Ari, a man who believed in the possibility of alien life, still could not accept the idea when it was standing – or lying – right in front of him. ‘You see, I had special talents, as a result of technology. The gifts.’ ‘Go on then,’ Ari said, controlling his laughter, ‘show me.’ ‘Go on then,’ Ari said, controlling his laughter, ‘show me.’ ‘I can’t. I have no powers now. I am exactly like a human.’ Ari found this bit especially funny. He was annoying me now. He was still a good man, but good men could be annoying, I realised. ‘Exactly like a human! Well, man, you’re fucked then, aren’t you?’ I nodded. ‘Yes. I think I might be.’ Ari smiled, looked concerned. ‘Listen, make sure you keep taking all the tablets. Not just the painkillers. All of them, yeah?’ I nodded. He thought I was mad. Maybe it would be easier if I could take on this view myself, the delusion that it was a delusion. If one day I could wake up and believe it was all a dream. ‘Listen,’ I said. ‘I’ve researched you. I know you understand quantum physics, and I know you’ve written about simulation theory. You say there’s a thirty per cent chance that none of this is real. You told me in the café you believed in aliens. So I know you can believe this.’ Ari shook his head, but at least he wasn’t laughing now. ‘No. You’re wrong. I can’t.’ ‘That’s okay,’ I said, realising that if Ari wouldn’t believe me Isobel never would. But Gulliver. There was always Gulliver. One day I would tell him the truth. But what then? Could he accept me as a father, knowing I had lied? I was trapped. I had to lie, and to stay lying. ‘But, Ari,’ I said, ‘if I ever need a favour, if I ever need Gulliver and Isobel to stay at your house – would that be okay?’ He smiled. ‘Sure, mate, sure.’ Platykurtic distribution The next day, still swollen with bruises, I was back at the college. There was something about being in the house, even with Newton for company, that troubled me. It never had before, but now it made me feel incredibly lonely. So I went to work, and I realised why work was so important on Earth. It stopped you feeling lonely. But loneliness was there for me, waiting in my office, which was where I’d returned after my lecture on distribution models. But my head hurt and I must admit I did quite welcome the peace. After a while there was a knock on the door. I ignored it. Loneliness minus a headache was my preferred option. But then it happened again. And it happened in such a way that I knew it was going to keep on happening, and so I stood up and went to the door. And, after a while, I opened it. A young woman was there. It was Maggie. The wild flower in bloom. The one with the curly red hair and the full lips. She was twirling her hair around her finger again. She was breathing deeply, and seemed to be inhaling a different kind of air – one which contained a mysterious aphrodisiac, promising euphoria. And she was smiling. ‘So,’ she said. I waited a minute for the rest of the sentence but it didn’t happen. ‘So’ was beginning, middle and end. It meant something, but I didn’t know what. ‘What do you want?’ I asked. She smiled again. Bit her lip. ‘To discuss the compatibility of bell curves and platykurtic distribution models.’ ‘Right.’ ‘Platykurtic,’ she added, running a finger down my shirt towards my trousers. ‘From the Greek. Platus meaning flat, kurtos meaning . . . bulging.’ ‘Oh.’ Her finger danced away from me. ‘So, Jake LaMotta, let’s go.’ ‘My name is not Jake LaMotta.’ ‘I know. I was referencing your face.’ ‘I know. I was referencing your face.’ ‘Oh.’ ‘So, are we going?’ ‘Where?’ ‘Hat and Feathers.’ I had no idea what she was talking about. Or indeed, who she actually was to me, or to the man who had been Professor Andrew Martin. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘let’s go.’ That was it, right there. My first mistake of the day. But by no means the last. The Hat and Feathers I soon discovered the Hat and Feathers was a misleading name. In it there was no hat, and absolutely no feathers. There were just heavily inebriated people with red faces laughing at their own jokes. This, I soon discovered, was a typical pub. The ‘pub’ was an invention of humans living in England, designed as compensation for the fact that they were humans living in England. I rather liked the place. ‘Let’s find a quiet corner,’ she said to me, this young Maggie. There were lots of corners, as there always seemed to be in human-made environments. Earth dwellers still seemed to be a long way off from understanding the link between straight lines and acute forms of psychosis, which might explain why pubs seemed to be full of aggressive people. There were straight lines running into each other all over the place. Every table, every chair, at the bar, at the ‘fruit machine’. (I enquired about these machines. Apparently they were aimed at men whose fascination with flashing squares of light was coupled with a poor grasp of probability theory.) With so many corners to choose from, it was a surprise to see us sit near a straight, continuous piece of wall, at an oval table and on circular stools. ‘This is perfect,’ she said. ‘Is it?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Right.’ ‘What would you like?’ ‘Liquid nitrogen,’ I replied thoughtlessly. ‘A whisky and soda?’ ‘Yes. One of them.’ And we drank and chatted like old friends, which I think we were. Though her conversational approach seemed quite different from Isobel’s. ‘Your penis is everywhere,’ she said at one point. I looked around. ‘Is it?’ ‘Two hundred and twenty thousand hits on YouTube.’‘Right,’ I said. ‘They’ve blurred it out, though. Quite a wise move, I would say, from first- hand experience.’ She laughed even more at this. It was a laugh that did nothing to relieve the pain pressing into and out of my face. I changed the mood. I asked her what it meant, for her, to be a human. I wanted to ask the whole world this question, but, right now, she would do. And so she told me. The ideal castle She said being human is being a young child on Christmas Day who receives an absolutely magnificent castle. And there is a perfect photograph of this castle on the box and you want more than anything to play with the castle and the knights and the princesses because it looks like such a perfectly human world, but the only problem is that the castle isn’t built. It’s in tiny intricate pieces, and although there’s a book of instructions you don’t understand it. And nor can your parents or Aunt Sylvie. So you are just left, crying at the ideal castle on the box which no one would ever be able to build. Somewhere else I thanked Maggie for this interpretation. And then I explained to her that I thought the meaning was coming to me, the more I forgot it. After that, I spoke a lot about Isobel. This seemed to irritate her, and she switched the subject. ‘After this,’ she said, circling the top of her glass with her finger, ‘are we going somewhere else?’ I recognised the tone of this ‘somewhere else’. It had the exact same frequency as Isobel’s use of the word ‘upstairs’ the Saturday before. ‘Are we going to have sex?’ She laughed some more. Laughter, I realised, was the reverberating sound of a truth hitting a lie. Humans existed inside their own delusions and laughing was a way out – the only possible bridge they had between each other. That, and love. But there was no love between me and Maggie, I want you to know that. Anyway, it turned out we were going to have sex. So we left and walked along a few streets until we reached Willow Road and her flat. Her flat, by the way, was the messiest thing I had ever seen that hadn’t been a direct result of nuclear fission. A supercluster of books, clothes, empty wine bottles, stubbed- out cigarettes, old toast and unopened envelopes. I discovered that her full name was Margaret Lowell. I wasn’t an expert on Earth names, but I still knew this was wildly inappropriate. She should have been called Lana Bellcurve or Ashley Brainsex or something. Anyway, apparently I never called her Margaret. (‘No one except my broadband provider calls me that.’) She was Maggie. And Maggie, it transpired, was an unconventional human. For instance, when asked about her religion, she answered ‘Pythagorean’. She was ‘well travelled’, the most ridiculous expression if you belonged to a species that had only left its own planet to visit its moon (and Maggie, it transpired, hadn’t even been there). In this case, it merely meant she had taught English in Spain, Tanzania and various parts of South America for four years before returning to study maths. She also seemed to have a very limited sense of body shame, by human standards, and had worked as a lap dancer to pay for her undergraduate studies. standards, and had worked as a lap dancer to pay for her undergraduate studies. She wanted to have sex on the floor, which was an intensely uncomfortable way of having it. As we unclothed each other we kissed, but this wasn’t the kind of kissing that brought you closer, the kind that Isobel was good at. This was self-referential kissing, kissing about kissing, dramatic and fast and pseudo- intense. It also hurt. My face was still tender and Maggie’s meta-kisses didn’t really seem to accommodate the possibility of pain. And then we were naked, or rather the parts of us which needed to be naked were naked, and it started to feel more like a strange kind of fighting than anything else. I looked at her face, and her neck, and her breasts, and was reminded of the fundamental strangeness of the human body. With Isobel, I had never felt like I was sleeping with an alien, but with Maggie the level of exoticism bordered on terror. There was physiological pleasure, quite a good deal of it at times, but it was a very localised, anatomical kind of pleasure. I smelt her skin, and I liked the smell of it, a mixture of coconut-scented lotion and bacteria, but my mind felt terrible, for a reason that involved more than my head pain. Almost immediately after we had started having sex I had a queasy sensation in my stomach, as though the altitude had drastically changed. I stopped. I got away from her. ‘What’s the matter?’ she asked me. ‘I don’t know. But something is. This feels wrong. I realise I don’t want to have an orgasm right now.’ ‘Bit late for a crisis of conscience.’ I really didn’t know what the matter was. After all, it was just sex. I got dressed and discovered there were four missed calls on my mobile phone. ‘Goodbye, Maggie.’ She laughed some more. ‘Give my love to your wife.’ I had no idea what was so funny, but I decided to be polite and laughed too as I stepped outside into cool evening air, which was tainted with maybe a little more carbon dioxide than I had noticed before. Places beyond logic ‘You’re home late,’ Isobel said. ‘I’ve been worried. I thought that man might have come after you.’ ‘What man?’ ‘That brute who smashed your face in.’ She was in the living room, at home, its walls lined with books about history and mathematics. Mainly mathematics. She was placing pens in a pot. She was staring at me with harsh eyes. Then she softened a bit. ‘How was your day?’ ‘Oh,’ I said, putting down my bag, ‘it was okay. I did some teaching. I met some students. I had sex with that person. My student. The one called Maggie.’ It’s funny, I had a sensation these words were taking me somewhere, into a dangerous valley, but still I said them. Isobel, meanwhile, took a little time to process this information, even by human standards. The queasy feeling in my stomach hadn’t gone away. If anything, it had intensified. ‘That’s not very funny.’ ‘I wasn’t trying to be funny.’ She studied me for a long while. Then dropped a fountain pen on the floor. The lid came off. Ink sprayed. ‘What are you talking about?’ I told her again. The bit she seemed most interested in was the last part, about me having sex with Maggie. Indeed, she was so interested that she started to hyperventilate and throw the pen pot in the direction of my head. And then she began to cry. ‘Why are you crying?’ I said, but I was beginning to understand. I moved closer to her. It was then she launched an attack on me, her hands moving as fast as laws of anatomical motion allow. Her fingernails scratched my face, adding fresh wounds. Then she just stood there, looking at me, as if she had wounds too. Invisible ones. ‘I’m sorry, Isobel, you have to understand, I didn’t realise I was doing anything wrong. This is all new. You don’t know how alien all this is to me. I know it is morally wrong to love another woman, but I don’t love her. It was just pleasure. The way a peanut butter sandwich is pleasure. You don’t realise the pleasure. The way a peanut butter sandwich is pleasure. You don’t realise the complexity and hypocrisy of this system . . .’ She had stopped. Her breathing slowed and deepened, and her first question became her only one. ‘Who is she?’ And then: ‘Who is she?’ And soon after: ‘Who is she?’ I was reluctant to speak. Speaking to a human you cared about, I realised, was so fraught with hidden danger that it was a wonder people bothered speaking at all. I could have lied. I could have backtracked. But I realised lying, though essential to keep someone in love with you, actually wasn’t what my love demanded. It demanded truth. So I said, in the simplest words I could find, ‘I don’t know. But I don’t love her. I love you. I didn’t realise that it was such a big thing. I sort of knew, as it was happening. My stomach told me, in a way it never tells me with peanut butter. And then I stopped.’ The only time I’d come across the concept of infidelity was in Cosmopolitan magazine, and they really hadn’t done enough to explain it properly. They’d sort of said it depends on the context and, you see, it was such an alien concept for me to understand. It was like trying to get a human to understand transcellular healing. ‘I’m sorry.’ She wasn’t listening. She had her own things to say. ‘I don’t even know you. I have no idea of who you are. No idea. If you’ve done this, you really are an alien to me . . .’ ‘Am I? Listen, Isobel, you’re right. I am. I am not from here. I have never loved before. All this is new. I’m an amateur at this. Listen, I used to be immortal, I could not die, I could not feel pain, but I gave that up . . .’ She wasn’t even listening. She was a galaxy away. ‘All I know, all I know beyond any doubt, is that I want a divorce. I do. That is what I want. You have destroyed us. You have destroyed Gulliver. Again.’ Newton appeared at this point, wagging his tail to try and calm the mood. Isobel ignored Newton and started to walk away from me. I should have let her go, but bizarrely I couldn’t. I held on to her wrist. ‘Stay,’ I said. And then it happened. Her arm swung at me with ferocious force, her clenched hand an asteroid speeding towards the planet of my face. Not a slap or a scratch this time but a smack. Was this where love ended? With an injury on top of an injury on top of an injury? ‘I’m leaving the house now. And when I come back, I want you gone. Do you understand? Gone. I want you out of here, and out of our lives. It’s over. Everything. It’s all over. I thought you’d changed. I honestly thought you’d become someone else. And I let you in again! What a fucking idiot!’ I kept my hand over my face. It still hurt. I heard her footsteps head away I kept my hand over my face. It still hurt. I heard her footsteps head away from me. The door opened. The door closed. I was alone again with Newton. ‘I’ve really done it now,’ I said. He seemed to agree, but I couldn’t understand him any more. I might as well have been any human trying to understand any dog. But he seemed something other than sad, as he barked in the direction of the living room and the road beyond. It seemed less like condolence and more like warning. I went to look out of the living-room window. There was nothing to be seen. So I stroked Newton one more time, offered a pointless apology, and left the house. PART III The wounded deer leaps the highest It belongs to the perfection of everything human that man can only attain his desire by passing through its opposite. – Søren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling An encounter with Winston Churchill I walked to the nearest shop, a brightly lit and unsympathetic place called Tesco Metro. I bought myself a bottle of Australian wine. I walked along a cycle path and drank it, singing ‘God Only Knows’. It was quiet. I sat down by a tree and finished the bottle. I went and bought another. I sat down on a park bench, next to a man with a large beard. It was the man I had seen before. On my first day. The one who had called me Jesus. He was wearing the same long dirty raincoat and he had the same scent. This time I found it fascinating. I sat there for a while just working out all the different aromas – alcohol, sweat, tobacco, urine, infection. It was a uniquely human smell, and rather wonderful in its own sad way. ‘I don’t know why more people don’t do this,’ I said, striking up a conversation. ‘Do what?’ ‘You know, get drunk. Sit on a park bench. It seems like a good way to solve problems.’ ‘Are you taking the piss, fella?’ ‘No. I like it. And you obviously like it or you wouldn’t be doing it.’ Of course, this was a little bit disingenuous of me. Humans were always doing things they didn’t like doing. In fact, to my best estimate, at any one time only point three per cent of humans were actively doing something they liked doing, and even when they did so, they felt an intense amount of guilt about it and were fervently promising themselves they’d be back doing something horrendously unpleasant very shortly. A blue plastic bag floated by on the wind. The bearded man rolled a cigarette. He had shaky fingers. Nerve damage. ‘Ain’t no choice in love and life,’ he said. ‘No. That’s true. Even when you think there are choices there aren’t really. But I thought humans still subscribed to the illusion of free will?’ ‘Not me, chief.’ And then he started singing, in a mumbled baritone of very low frequency. ‘Ain’t no sunshine when she’s gone . . .’ low frequency. ‘Ain’t no sunshine when she’s gone . . .’ ‘What’s your name?’ ‘I’m Andrew,’ I said. ‘Sort of.’ ‘What’s bothering you? You got beat up? Your face looks like shit.’ ‘Yeah, in lots of ways. I had someone love me. And it was the most precious thing, that love. It gave me a family. It made me feel like I belonged. And I broke it.’ He lit the cigarette, which flopped out of his face like a numb antennae. ‘Ten years me and my wife were married,’ he said. ‘Then I lost my job and she left me the same week. That’s when I turned to drink and my leg started to turn on me.’ He lifted up his trousers. His left leg was swollen and purple. And violet. I could see he expected me to be disgusted. ‘Deep vein thrombosis. Effing agony, it is. Effing fucking agony. And it’s gonna bloody kill me one of these days.’ He passed me the cigarette. I inhaled. I knew I didn’t like it, but I still inhaled. ‘What’s your name?’ I asked him. He laughed. ‘Winston bloody Churchill.’ ‘Oh, like the wartime prime minister.’ I watched him close his eyes and suck on his cigarette. ‘Why do people smoke?’ ‘No idea. Ask me something else.’ ‘Okay, then. How do you cope with loving someone who hates you? Someone who doesn’t want to see you again.’ ‘God knows.’ He winced. He was in agony. I had noticed his pain on the first day, but now I wanted to do something about it. I had drunk enough to believe I could, or at least to forget I couldn’t. He was about to roll his trousers down, but seeing the pain he was in, I told him to wait a moment. I placed my hand on the leg. ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Don’t worry. It’s a very simple procedure of bio-set transference, involving reverse-apoptosis, working at the molecular level to restore and recreate dead and diseased cells. To you it will look like magic, but it isn’t.’ My hand stayed there and nothing happened. And nothing kept on happening. It looked very far from magic. ‘Who are you?’ ‘I’m an alien. I’m considered a useless failure in two galaxies.’ ‘Well, could you please take your damn hand off my leg?’ I took my hand away. ‘Sorry. Really. I thought I still had the ability to heal you.’ ‘I know you,’ he said. ‘I know you,’ he said. ‘What?’ ‘I’ve seen you before.’ ‘Yes. I know. I passed you, on my first day in Cambridge. You may remember. I was naked.’ He leant back, squinted, angled his head. ‘Nah. Nah. Wasn’t that. I saw you today.’ ‘I don’t think you did. I’m pretty sure I would have recognised you.’ ‘Nah. Definitely today. I’m good with faces, see.’ ‘Was I with someone? A young woman? Red hair?’ He considered. ‘Nah. It was just you.’ ‘Where was I?’ ‘Oh, you were on, let me think, you’d have been on Newmarket Road.’ ‘Newmarket Road?’ I knew the name of the street, because it was where Ari lived, but I hadn’t ever been on the street myself. Not today. Not ever. Though of course, it was very likely that Andrew Martin – the original Andrew Martin – had been down there many times. Yes, that must have been it. He was getting mixed up. ‘I think you might be confused.’ He shook his head. ‘It was you all right. This morning. Maybe midday. No word of a lie.’ And with that the man stood up and hobbled slowly away from me, leaving a trail of smoke and spilt alcohol. A cloud passed across the sun. I looked up to the sky. I had a thought as dark as the shade. I stood up. I took the phone out of my pocket and called Ari. Eventually someone picked up. It was a woman. She was breathing heavily, sniffing up snot, struggling to turn noise into coherent words. ‘Hello, this is Andrew. I wondered if Ari was there.’ And then the words came, in morbid succession: ‘He’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead.’ The replacement I ran. I left the wine and I ran as fast as I could, across the park, along streets, over main roads, hardly thinking about traffic. It hurt, this running. It hurt my knees, my hips, my heart and my lungs. All those components, reminding me they would one day fail. It also, somehow, aggravated the various facial aches and pains I was suffering. But, mostly, it was my mind that was in turmoil. This was my fault. This had nothing to do with the Riemann hypothesis and everything to do with the fact that I had told Ari the truth about where I was from. He hadn’t believed me, but that hadn’t been the point. I had been able to tell him, without getting an agonising violet-tainted warning. They had disconnected me, but they must still have been watching, and listening, which meant they could probably hear me now. ‘Don’t do it. Don’t hurt Isobel or Gulliver. They don’t know anything.’ I reached the house that, up until this morning, I had been living in with the people I had grown to love. I crunched my way up the gravel driveway. The car wasn’t there. I looked through the living-room window, but there was no sign of anyone. I had no key with me so I rang the doorbell. I stood and waited, wondering what I could do. After a while, the door opened, but I still couldn’t see anyone. Whoever had opened the door clearly didn’t want to be seen. I stepped into the house. I walked past the kitchen. Newton was asleep in his basket. I went over to him, shook him gently. ‘Newton! Newton!’ But he stayed asleep, breathing deeply, mysteriously unwakeable. ‘I’m in here,’ said a voice, coming from the living room. So I followed it, that familiar voice, until I was there, looking at a man sitting on the purple sofa with one leg crossed over the other. He was instantly familiar to me – indeed, he could not have been more so – and yet, at the same time, the sight of him was terrifying. For it was myself I was looking at. His clothes were different (jeans instead of cords, a T-shirt instead of shirt, His clothes were different (jeans instead of cords, a T-shirt instead of shirt, trainers in place of shoes) but it was definitely the form of Andrew Martin. The mid-brown hair, naturally parted. The tired eyes, and the same face except for the absence of bruises. ‘Snap!’ he said, smiling. ‘That is what they say here, isn’t it? You know, when they are playing card games. Snap! We are identical twins.’ ‘Who are you?’ He frowned, as if I’d asked such a basic question it shouldn’t have been asked. ‘I’m your replacement.’ ‘My replacement?’ ‘That is what I said. I am here to do what you were unable to do.’ My heart was racing. ‘What do you mean?’ ‘To destroy information.’ Fear and anger were sometimes the same thing. ‘You killed Ari?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Why? He didn’t know the Riemann hypothesis had been proved.’ ‘No. I know. I have been given broader instructions than you. I have been told to destroy anyone you have told about your’ – he considered the right word – ‘origins.’ ‘So they’ve been listening to me? They said I was disconnected.’ He pointed at my left hand, where the technology still evidently lived. ‘They took your powers away, but they didn’t take theirs. They listen sometimes. They check.’ I stared at it. At my hand. It looked, suddenly, like an enemy. ‘How long have you been here? On Earth, I mean.’ ‘Not long.’ ‘Someone broke into this house a few nights ago. They accessed Isobel’s computer.’ ‘That was me.’ ‘So why the delay? Why didn’t you finish the job that night?’ ‘You were here. I did not want to hurt you. No Vonnadorian has killed another Vonnadorian. Not directly.’ ‘Well, I’m not really a Vonnadorian. I am a human. The paradox is that I’m light years from home, and yet this feels like my home. That is a strange thing to feel. So, what have you been doing? Where have you been living?’ He hesitated, swallowed hard. ‘I have been living with a female.’ ‘A female human? A woman?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Where?’ ‘Outside Cambridge. A village. She doesn’t know my name. She thinks I am ‘Outside Cambridge. A village. She doesn’t know my name. She thinks I am called Jonathan Roper. I convinced her we were married.’ I laughed. The laugh seemed to surprise him. ‘Why are you laughing?’ ‘I don’t know. I have gained a sense of humour. That is one thing that happened when I lost the gifts.’ ‘I am going to kill them, do you know that?’ ‘No. Actually, I don’t. I told the hosts there is no point. That’s about the last thing I said to them. They seemed to understand me.’ ‘I have been told to, and that is what I will do.’ ‘But don’t you think it’s pointless, that there’s no real reason to do it?’ He sighed and shook his head. ‘No, I do not think that’, he said, in a voice which was mine but deeper, somehow, and flatter. ‘I do not see a separation. I have lived with a human for only a few days but I have seen the violence and hypocrisy that runs through this species.’ ‘Yes, but there is good in them. A lot of good.’ ‘No. I don’t see it. They can sit and watch dead human bodies on TV screens and feel nothing at all.’ ‘That’s how I saw it at first, but—’ ‘They can drive a car thirty miles every day and feel good about themselves for recycling a couple of empty jam jars. They can talk about peace being a good thing yet glorify war. They can despise the man who kills his wife in rage but worship the indifferent soldier who drops a bomb killing a hundred children.’ ‘Yes, there is a bad logic here, I agree with you, yet I truly believe—’ He wasn’t listening. He stood up now, stared at me with determined eyes as he paced the room and delivered his speech. ‘They believe God is always on their side, even if their side is at odds with the rest of their species. They have no way of coming to terms with what are, biologically, the two most important events that happen to them – procreation and death. They pretend to know that money can’t buy them happiness, yet they would choose money every time. They celebrate mediocrity at every available opportunity and love to see others’ misfortune. They have lived on this planet for over a hundred thousand generations and yet they still have no idea about who they really are or how they should really live. In fact, they know less now than they once did.’ ‘You’re right but don’t you think there is something beautiful in these contradictions, something mysterious?’ ‘No. No, I do not. What I think is that their violent will has helped them dominate the world, and “civilise” it, but now there is nowhere left for them to go, and so the human world has turned in on itself. It is a monster that feasts on its own hands. And still they do not see the monster, or if they do they do not see that they are inside it, molecules within the beast.’ that they are inside it, molecules within the beast.’ I looked at the bookshelves. ‘Have you read human poetry? Humans understand these failings.’ He still wasn’t listening. ‘They have lost themselves but not their ambitions. Do not think that they would not leave this place if they had the chance. They’re beginning to realise life is out there, that we or beings like us, are out there, and they won’t just stop at that. They will want to explore, and as their mathematical understanding expands, then they will eventually be able to do so. They will find us, eventually, and when they do, they will not want to be friends, even if they think – as they always do – that their own ends are perfectly benevolent. They will find a reason to destroy or subjugate other life forms.’ A girl in a school uniform walked past the house. Pretty soon, Gulliver would be coming home. ‘But there is no connection between killing these people and stopping progress, I promise you. No connection.’ He stopped pacing the room and came over to me, leant into my face. ‘Connections? I will tell you about connections . . . An amateur German physicist works in a patent office in Bern in Switzerland. He comes up with a theory that, half a century later, will lead to whole Japanese cities being destroyed, along with much of their population. Husbands, wives, sons, daughters. He does not want that connection to form, but that does not stop it forming.’ ‘You’re talking about something very different.’ ‘No. No, I am not. This is a planet where a daydream can end in death, and where mathematicians can cause an apocalypse. That is my view of the humans. Is it any different from yours?’ ‘Humans learn the errors of their ways though,’ I said, ‘and they care more for each other than you think.’ ‘No. I know they care for each other when the other in question is like them, or lives under their roof, but any difference is a step further away from their empathy. They find it preposterously easy to fall out among themselves. Imagine what they would do to us, if they could.’ Of course, I had already imagined this and was scared of the answer. I was weakening. I felt tired and confused. ‘But we were sent here to kill them. What makes us any better?’ ‘We act as a result of logic, of rational thinking. We are here to preserve, even to preserve the humans. Think about it. Progress is a very dangerous thing for them. The boy must be killed, even if the woman can be saved. The boy knows. You told us yourself.’ You told us yourself.’ ‘You are making a little mistake.’ ‘What is my mistake?’ ‘You cannot kill a mother’s son without killing the mother.’ ‘You are speaking in riddles. You have become like them.’ I looked at the clock. It was half-past four. Gulliver would return home at any moment. I tried to think what to do. Maybe this other me, this ‘Jonathan’ was right. Well, there wasn’t really a maybe. He was right: the humans could not handle progress very well and they were not good at understanding their place in the world. They were, ultimately, a great danger to themselves and others. So I nodded, and I walked over and sat on that purple sofa. I felt sober now, and fully conscious of my pain. ‘You are right,’ I said. ‘You are right. And I want to help you.’ A game ‘I know you are right,’ I told him for the seventeenth time, looking straight into his eyes, ‘but I have been weak. I admit it to you now. I was and remain unable to harm any more humans, especially those ones I have lived with. But what you have said to me has reminded me of my original purpose. I am not able to fulfil that purpose and no longer have the gifts to do so, but equally I realise it has to be fulfilled, and so in a way I’m thankful you are here. I’ve been stupid. I’ve tried and I have failed.’ Jonathan sat back on the sofa and studied me. He stared at my bruises and sniffed the air between us. ‘You have been drinking alcohol.’ ‘Yes. I have been corrupted. It is very easy, I find, when you live like a human, to develop some of their bad habits. I have drunk alcohol. I have had sex. I have smoked cigarettes. I have eaten peanut butter sandwiches and listened to their simple music. I have felt many of the crude pleasures that they can feel, as well as physical and emotional pain. But still, despite my corruption, there remains enough of me left, enough of my clear rational self, to know what has to be done.’ He watched me. He believed me, because every word I was speaking was the truth. ‘I am comforted to hear this.’ I didn’t waste a moment. ‘Now listen to me. Gulliver will return home soon. He won’t be on a car or a bike. He’ll be walking. He likes to walk. We will hear his feet on the gravel, and then we will hear his key in the door. Normally, he heads straight into the kitchen to get himself a drink or a bowl of cereal. He eats around three bowls of cereal a day. Anyway, that is irrelevant. What is relevant is that he will most likely enter the kitchen first.’ Jonathan was paying close attention to everything I was telling him. It felt strange, terrible even, giving him this information, but I really couldn’t think of any other way. ‘You want to act fast,’ I said, ‘as his mother will be home soon. Also, there’s a chance he may be surprised to see you. You see, his mother has thrown me out of the house because I was unfaithful to her. Or rather the faith I had wasn’t the of the house because I was unfaithful to her. Or rather the faith I had wasn’t the right kind. Given the absence of mind-reading technology, humans believe monogamy is possible. Another fact to consider is that Gulliver has, quite independently, attempted to take his own life before. So, I suggest that however you choose to kill him it would be a good idea to make it look like suicide. Maybe after his heart has stopped, you could slice one of his wrists, cutting through the veins. That way, less suspicion will be aroused.’ Jonathan nodded, then looked around the room. At the television, the history books, the armchair, the framed art prints on the wall, the telephone in its cradle. ‘It will be a good idea to have the television on,’ I told him, ‘even if you are not in this room. Because I always watch the news and leave it on.’ He switched on the television. We sat and watched footage of war in the Middle East, without saying a word. But then he heard something that I couldn’t, his senses being so much sharper. ‘Footsteps,’ he said. ‘On the gravel.’ ‘He’s here,’ I said. ‘Go to the kitchen. I’ll hide.’ 90.2 MHz I waited in the sitting room. The door was closed. There would be no reason for Gulliver to enter here. Unlike the living room he hardly ever came into this room. I don’t think I’d ever heard him do so. So I stayed there, still and quiet, as the front door opened, then closed. He was unmoving, in the hallway. No footsteps. ‘Hello?’ Then a response. My voice but not my voice, coming from the kitchen. ‘Hello, Gulliver.’ ‘What are you doing here? Mum said you’d gone. She phoned me, said you’d had an argument.’ I heard him – me, Andrew, Jonathan – respond in measured words. ‘That is right. We did. We had an argument. Don’t worry, it wasn’t too serious.’ ‘Oh yeah? Sounded pretty serious from Mum’s side of things.’ Gulliver paused. ‘Whose are those clothes you’re wearing?’ ‘Oh, these, they’re just old ones I didn’t know I had.’ ‘I’ve never seen them before. And your face, it’s totally healed. You look completely better.’ ‘Well, there you go.’ ‘Right, anyway, I might go upstairs. I’ll get some food later.’ ‘No. No. You will stay right here.’ The mind patterning was beginning. His words were shepherds ushering away conscious thought. ‘You will stay here and you will take a knife – a sharp knife, the sharpest there is in this room—’ It was about to happen. I could feel it, so I did what I had planned to do. I went over to the bookcase and picked up the clockwork radio, turned the power dial through a full 360-degree rotation and pressed the button with the little green circle. On. The small display became illuminated: 90.2 MHz. Classical music blared out at almost full volume as I carried the radio back along the hallway. Unless I was very much mistaken it was Debussy. along the hallway. Unless I was very much mistaken it was Debussy. ‘You will now press that knife into your wrist and press it hard enough to cut through every vein.’ ‘What’s that noise?’ Gulliver asked, his head clearing. I still couldn’t see him. I still wasn’t quite at the kitchen doorway. ‘Just do it. End your life, Gulliver.’ I entered the kitchen and saw my doppelgänger facing away from me as he pressed his hand on to Gulliver’s head. The knife fell to the floor. It was like looking at a strange kind of human baptism. I knew that what he was doing was right, and logical, from his perspective, but perspective was a funny thing. Gulliver collapsed; his whole body was convulsing. I placed the radio down on the unit. The kitchen had its own radio. I switched that on, too. The TV was still on in the other room, as I had intended it to be. A cacophony of classical music and newsreaders and rock music filled the air as I reached Jonathan and pulled his arm so he now had no contact with Gulliver. He turned, held me by the throat, pressing me back against the refrigerator. ‘You have made a mistake,’ he said. Gulliver’s convulsions stopped and he looked around, confused. He saw two men, both identical, like his father, pressing into each other’s necks with equivalent force. I knew that, whatever else happened, I had to keep Jonathan in the kitchen. If he stayed in the kitchen, with the radios on and the TV in the next room, we would be equally matched. ‘Gulliver,’ I said. ‘Gulliver, give me the knife. Any knife. That knife. Give me that knife.’ ‘Dad? Are you my Dad?’ ‘Yes, I am. Now give me the knife.’ ‘Ignore him, Gulliver,’ Jonathan said. ‘He’s not your father. I am. He’s an imposter. He’s not what he looks like. He’s a monster. An alien. We have to destroy him.’ As we carried on, locked in our mutually futile combative pose, matching strength with strength, I saw Gulliver’s eyes fill with doubt. He looked at me. It was time for the truth. ‘I’m not your father. And neither is he. Your dad is dead, Gulliver. He died on Saturday, the seventeenth of April. He was taken by the . . .’ I thought of a way of putting it that he would understand. ‘. . . by the people we work for. They extracted information from him, and then they killed him. And they sent me here, as him, to kill you. And kill your mother. And anyone who knew about what he had achieved that day, but I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t do it because I what he had achieved that day, but I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t do it because I started, I started to feel something that was meant to be impossible . . . I empathised with you. Grew to like you. Worry about you. Love you both. And I gave everything up . . . I have no power, no strength.’ ‘Don’t listen to him, son,’ Jonathan said. And then he realised something. ‘Turn off the radios. Listen to me, turn off the radios now.’ I stared at Gulliver with pleading eyes. ‘Whatever you do, don’t turn them off. The signal interferes with the technology. It’s his left hand. His left hand. Everything is in his left hand . . .’ Gulliver was clambering upright. He looked numb. His face was unreadable. I thought hard. ‘The leaf!’ I yelled. ‘Gulliver, you were right. The leaf, remember, the leaf! And think of—’ It was then that the other version of myself smashed his head into my nose, with swift and brutal force. My head rebounded against the fridge door and everything dissolved. Colours faded, and the noise of the radios and the faraway newsreader swam into each other. A swirling audio soup. It was over. ‘Gulli—’ The other me switched one of the radios off. Debussy disappeared. But at the moment the music went away I heard a scream. It sounded like Gulliver. And it was, but it wasn’t a scream of pain. It was a scream of determination. A primal roar of rage, giving him the courage he needed to stab the knife that had been about to cut his own wrists into the back of a man who looked every inch his own father. And the knife went deep. With that roar, and that sight, the room sharpened into focus. I could get to my feet before Jonathan’s finger reached the second radio. I yanked him back by the hair. I saw his face. The pain clearly articulated in the way only human faces can manage. The eyes, shocked yet pleading. The mouth seeming to melt away. Melt away. Melt away. Melt away. The ultimate crime I would not look at his face again. He could not die while that technology remained inside him. I dragged him over to the Aga. ‘Lift it up,’ I ordered Gulliver. ‘Lift up the cover.’ ‘Cover?’ ‘The hot plate.’ He did it. He lifted the circular steel ring up and let it fall back, and he did so without a single question in his eyes. ‘Help me,’ I said. ‘He’s fighting. Help me with his arm.’ Together we had enough force to press his palm down to the burning metal. The scream, as we kept him there, was horrendous. Knowing what it was I was doing, it truly sounded like the end of the universe. I was committing the ultimate crime. I was destroying gifts, and killing one of my kind. ‘We’ve got to keep it there,’ I shouted to Gulliver. ‘We’ve got to keep it there! Hold! Hold! Hold!’ And then I switched my attention to Jonathan. ‘Tell them it is over,’ I whispered. ‘Tell them you have completed your mission. Tell them there has been a problem with the gifts and that you will not be able to return. Tell them, and I will stop the pain.’ A lie. And a gamble that they were tuned to him and not to me. But a necessary one. He told them, yet his pain continued. How long were we like this? Seconds? Minutes? It was like Einstein’s conundrum. The hot stove versus the pretty girl. Towards the end of it, Jonathan was on his knees, losing consciousness. Tears streamed down my face as I finally pulled that sticky mess of a hand away. I checked his pulse. He was gone. The knife pierced through his chest as he fell back. I looked at the hand, and this face, and it was clear. He was disconnected, not just from the hosts, but from life. The reason it was clear was that he was becoming himself – the cellular reconfiguration that automatically followed death. The whole shape of him was reconfiguration that automatically followed death. The whole shape of him was changing, curling in, his face flattening, his skull lengthening, his skin mottled shades of purple and violet. Only the knife in his back stayed. It was strange. Within the context of that Earth kitchen this creature, structured precisely as I had been, seemed entirely alien to me. A monster. A beast. Something other. Gulliver stared, but said nothing. The shock was so profound it was a challenge to breathe, let alone speak. I did not want to speak either, but for more practical reasons. Indeed, I worried that I may already have said too much. Maybe the hosts had heard everything I had said in that kitchen. I didn’t know. What I did know was that I had one more thing to do. They took your powers away, but they didn’t take theirs. But before I could do anything a car pulled up outside. Isobel was home. ‘Gulliver, it’s your mother. Keep her away. Warn her.’ He left the room. I turned back to the heat of that hot plate and positioned my hand next to where his had been, where pieces of his flesh still fizzed. And I pressed down, and felt a pure and total pain which took away space and time and guilt. The nature of reality Civilised life, you know, is based on a huge number of illusions in which we all collaborate willingly. The trouble is we forget after a while that they are illusions and we are deeply shocked when reality is torn down around us. – J.G. Ballard What was reality? An objective truth? A collective illusion? A majority opinion? The product of historical understanding? A dream? A dream. Well, yes, maybe. But if this had been a dream then it was one from which I hadn’t yet woken. But once humans really study things in depth – whether in the artificially divided fields of quantum physics or biology or neuroscience or mathematics or love – they come closer and closer to nonsense, irrationality and anarchy. Everything they know is disproved, over and over again. The Earth is not flat; leeches have no medicinal value; there is no God; progress is a myth; the present is all they have. And this doesn’t just happen on the big scale. It happens to each individual human too. In every life there is a moment. A crisis. One that says: what I believe is wrong. It happens to everyone, the only difference is how that knowledge changes them. In most cases, it is simply a case of burying that knowledge and pretending it isn’t there. That is how humans grow old. That is ultimately what creases their faces and curves their backs and shrinks their mouths and ambitions. The weight of that denial. The stress of it. This is not unique to humans. The single biggest act of bravery or madness anyone can do is the act of change. I was something. And now I am something else. I was a monster and now I am a different type of monster. One that will die, and feel pain, but one that will also live, and maybe even find happiness one day. Because happiness is possible for me now. It exists on the other side of the hurt. A face as shocked as the moon As for Gulliver, he was young, and could accept things better than his mother. His life had never really made sense to him so the final proof of its nonsensical nature was a kind of relief to him. He was someone who had lost a father and also someone who had killed, but the thing he had killed was something he didn’t understand and couldn’t relate to. He could have cried for a dead dog, but a dead Vonnadorian meant nothing to him. On the subject of grief, it was true that Gulliver was worried about his father, and wanted to know that he hadn’t felt any pain. I told him he hadn’t. Was that true? I didn’t know. That was part of being human, I discovered. It was about knowing which lies to tell, and when to tell them. To love someone is to lie to them. But I never saw him cry for his dad. I didn’t know why. Maybe it was hard to feel the loss of someone who had never really been there. Anyway, after dark he helped drag the body outside. Newton was awake now. He had woken after Jonathan’s technology had melted away. And now he accepted what he was seeing as dogs seemed to accept everything. There were no canine historians, so that made things easier. Nothing was unexpected. At one point he began digging in the ground, as if trying to help us, but that wasn’t required. No grave needed to be dug as the monster – and that was how I referred to it in my mind, the monster – would in its natural state decompose rapidly in this oxygen-rich atmosphere. It was quite a struggle, dragging him out there, especially given my burnt hand and the fact that Gulliver had to stop to be sick at one point. He looked dreadful. I remember watching him, staring at me from beneath his fringe, his face as shocked as the moon. Newton wasn’t our only observer. Isobel watched us in disbelief. I hadn’t wanted her to come outside and see but she did so. At that point she didn’t know everything. She didn’t know, for instance, that her husband was dead or that the corpse I was dragging looked, essentially, how I had once looked. She learnt these things slowly, but not slowly enough. She would have needed at least a couple of centuries to absorb these facts, maybe even more. It was like at least a couple of centuries to absorb these facts, maybe even more. It was like taking someone from Regency England to twenty-first century downtown Tokyo. She simply could not come to terms with it. After all, she was a historian. Someone whose job was to find patterns, continuities and causes, and to transform the past into a narrative that walked the same curving path. But on this path someone had now thrown something down from the sky that had landed so hard it had broken the ground, tilted the Earth, made the route impossible to navigate. Which is to say, she went to the doctor and asked for some tablets. The pills she was given didn’t help and she ended up staying in bed for three weeks through exhaustion. It was suggested that she might have an illness called ME. She didn’t, of course. She was suffering from grief. A grief for not just the loss of her husband but also the loss of familiar reality. She hated me, during that time. I had explained everything to her: that none of this had been my decision, that I had been sent here reluctantly with no task except to halt human progress and to act for the greater good of the entire cosmos. But she couldn’t look at me because she didn’t know what she was looking at. I had lied to her. I’d slept with her. I’d let her tend my wounds. But she hadn’t known who she had been sleeping with. It didn’t matter that I had fallen in love with her, and that it was that act of total defiance that had saved her life and Gulliver’s. No. That didn’t matter at all. I was a killer and, to her, an alien. My hand slowly healed. I went to the hospital and they gave me a transparent plastic glove to wear, filled with an antiseptic cream. At the hospital they asked me how it had happened and I told them I had been drunk and leant on the hot plate without thinking, and without feeling the pain until it was too late. The burns became blisters and the nurse burst them, and I watched with interest as clear liquid oozed out. Selfishly I had hoped at some point that my injured hand might trigger some sympathy from Isobel. I wanted to see those eyes again. Eyes that had gazed worriedly at my face after Gulliver had attacked me in his sleep. I briefly toyed with the idea that I should try and convince her that nothing I had told her was true. That we were more magic realism than science fiction, specifically that branch of literary fiction that comes complete with an unreliable narrator. That I wasn’t really an alien. That I was a human who’d had a breakdown, and there was nothing extraterrestrial or extramarital about me. Gulliver might have known what he had seen, but Gulliver had a fragile mind. I could easily have denied everything. A dog’s health fluctuates. People fall off roofs and survive. After all, humans – especially adult ones – want to believe the most mundane truths possible. They need to, in order to stop their world-views, most mundane truths possible. They need to, in order to stop their world-views, and their sanity, from capsizing and plunging them into the vast ocean of the incomprehensible. But it seemed too disrespectful, somehow, and I couldn’t do it. Lies were everywhere on this planet, but true love had its name for a reason. And if a narrator tells you it was all just a dream you want to tell him he has simply passed from one delusion into another one, and he could wake from this new reality at any time. You had to stay consistent to life’s delusions. All you had was your perspective, so objective truth was meaningless. You had to choose a dream and stick with it. Everything else was a con. And once you had tasted truth and love in the same potent cocktail there had to be no more tricks. But while I knew I couldn’t correct this version of things with any integrity, living with it was hard. You see, before coming to Earth I had never wanted or needed to be cared for, but I hungered now to have that feeling of being looked after, of belonging, of being loved. Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe it was more than I deserved to be allowed to stay in the same house, even if I had to sleep on that hideous purple sofa. The only reason this was granted, I imagined, was Gulliver. Gulliver wanted me to stay. I had saved his life. I had helped him stand up to bullies. But his forgiveness still came as a surprise. Don’t get me wrong. It wasn’t Cinema Paradiso, but he seemed to accept me as an extraterrestrial life form far more easily than he had accepted me as a father. ‘Where are you from?’ he asked me, one Saturday morning, at five minutes to seven, before his mother was awake. ‘Far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far away.’ ‘How far is far?’ ‘It’s very hard to explain,’ I said. ‘I mean, you think France is far away.’ ‘Just try,’ he said. I noticed the fruit bowl. Only the day before, I had been to the supermarket buying healthy food the doctor had recommended for Isobel. Bananas, oranges, grapes, a grapefruit. ‘Okay,’ I said, grabbing the large grapefruit. ‘This is the sun.’ I placed the grapefruit on the coffee table. I then looked for the smallest grape I could find. I placed it at the other end of the table. ‘That is Earth, so small you can hardly see it.’ Newton stepped closer to the table, clearly attempting to annihilate Earth in his jaws. ‘No, Newton,’ I said. ‘Let me finish.’ his jaws. ‘No, Newton,’ I said. ‘Let me finish.’ Newton retreated, tail between his legs. Gulliver was frowning as he studied the grapefruit and the fragile little grape. He looked around. ‘So where is your planet?’ I think he honestly expected me to place the orange I was holding somewhere else in the room. By the television or on one of the bookshelves. Or maybe, at a pinch, upstairs. ‘To be accurate, this orange should be placed on a coffee table in New Zealand.’ He was silent for a moment, trying to understand the level of far-ness I was talking about. Still in a trance he asked, ‘Can I go there?’ ‘No. It’s impossible.’ ‘Why? There must have been a spaceship.’ I shook my head. ‘No. I didn’t travel. I may have arrived, but I didn’t travel.’ He was confused, so I explained, but then he was even more confused. ‘Anyway, the point is, there is no more chance of me crossing the universe now than any other human. This is who I am now, and this is where I have to stay.’ ‘You gave up the universe for a life on the sofa?’ ‘I didn’t realise that at the time.’ Isobel came downstairs. She was wearing her white dressing gown and her pyjamas. She was pale, but she was always pale in the morning. She looked at me and Gulliver talking, and for a moment, she seemed to greet the scene with a rarely seen fondness. But the expression faded as she remembered everything. ‘What’s going on?’ she asked. ‘Nothing,’ said Gulliver. ‘What is the fruit doing?’ she asked, traces of sleep still evident in her quiet voice. ‘I was explaining to Gulliver where I came from. How far away.’ ‘You came from a grapefruit?’ ‘No. The grapefruit is the sun. Your sun. Our sun. I lived on the orange. Which should be in New Zealand. Earth is now in Newton’s stomach.’ I smiled at her. I thought she might find this funny, but she just stared at me the way she had been staring at me for weeks. As if I were light years away from her. She left the room. ‘Gulliver,’ I said, ‘I think it would be best if I left. I shouldn’t have stayed, really. You see, this isn’t just about all this stuff. You know that argument me and your mother had? The one you never found out about?’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘Well, I was unfaithful. I had sex with a woman called Maggie. One of my – your father’s – students. I didn’t enjoy it, but that was beside the point. I didn’t realise it would hurt your mother, but it did. I didn’t know the exact rules of fidelity but that isn’t really an excuse, or not one I can use, when I was deliberately lying about so many other things. When I was endangering her life, and yours.’ I sighed. ‘I think, I think I’m going to leave.’ ‘Why?’ That question tugged at me. It reached into my stomach, and pulled. ‘I just think it will be for the best, right now.’ ‘Where are you going to go?’ ‘I don’t know. Not yet. But don’t worry, I’ll tell you when I get there.’ His mother was back in the doorway. ‘I’m going to leave,’ I told her. She closed her eyes. She inhaled. ‘Yes,’ she said, with the mouth I had once kissed. ‘Yes. Maybe it is for the best.’ Her whole face crumpled, as if her skin were the emotion she wanted to screw up and throw away. My eyes felt a warm, gentle strain. My vision blurred. Then something ran down my cheek, all the way to my lips. A liquid. Like rain, but warmer. Saline. I had shed a tear. The second type of gravity Before I left I went upstairs to the attic. It was dark in there, except for the glow of the computer. Gulliver was lying on his bed, staring out of the window. ‘I’m not your dad, Gulliver. I don’t have a right to be here.’ ‘No. I know.’ Gulliver chewed on his wristband. Hostility glistened in his eyes like broken glass. ‘You’re not my dad. But you’re just like him. You don’t give a shit. And you shagged someone behind Mum’s back. He did that too, you know.’ ‘Listen, Gulliver, I’m not trying to leave you, I’m trying to bring back your mother, okay? She’s a bit lost right now and my presence here isn’t helping.’ ‘It’s just so fucked up. I feel totally alone.’ Sun suddenly shone through the window, oblivious to our mood. ‘Loneliness, Gulliver, is a fact as universal as hydrogen.’ He sighed a sigh that should really have belonged to an older human. ‘I just don’t feel cut out sometimes. You know, cut out for life. I mean, people at school, loads of their parents are divorced but they seem to have an okay relationship with their dads. And everyone’s always thought, with me, what excuse did I have to go off the rails? What was wrong with my life? Living in a nice house with rich non-divorced parents. What the fuck could possibly be wrong there? ‘But it was all bullshit. Mum and Dad never loved each other, not since I can remember anyway. Mum seemed to change after he had his breakdown – I mean, after you came – but that was just her delusion. I mean, you weren’t even who she thought you were. It’s come to something when you relate to ET more than your own dad. He was crap. Seriously, I can’t think of one piece of advice he gave me. Except I shouldn’t become an architect because architecture takes a hundred years to be appreciated.’ ‘Listen, you don’t need guidance, Gulliver. Everything you need is inside your own head. You have more knowledge about the universe than anyone on your own planet.’ I pointed at the window. ‘You’ve seen what’s out there. And also, I should say, you’ve shown yourself to be really strong.’ should say, you’ve shown yourself to be really strong.’ He stared out of the window again. ‘What’s it like up there?’ ‘Very different. Everything is different.’ ‘But how?’ ‘Well, just existing is different. No one dies. There’s no pain. Everything is beautiful. The only religion is mathematics. There are no families. There are the hosts – they give instructions – and there is everyone else. The advancement of mathematics and the security of the universe are the two concerns. There is no hatred. There are no fathers and sons. There is no clear line between biology and technology. And everything is violet.’ ‘It sounds awesome.’ ‘It’s dull. It’s the dullest life you can imagine. Here, you have pain, and loss, that’s the price. But the rewards can be wonderful Gulliver.’ He looked at me, disbelieving. ‘Yeah. Well, I don’t have a clue how to find them.’ The phone rang. Isobel answered. Moments later, she was calling up to the attic. ‘Gulliver, it’s for you. A girl. Nat.’ I couldn’t help but notice the faintest of faint smiles on Gulliver’s face, a smile he felt embarrassed about and tried to hide under clouds of discontent as he left the room. I sat and breathed, with lungs that would one day stop functioning but which still had a lot of warm clear air to inhale. Then I turned to Gulliver’s primitive Earth computer and began to type, giving as much advice as I could think of to help a human. Advice for a human 1. Shame is a shackle. Free yourself. 2. Don’t worry about your abilities. You have the ability to love. That is enough. 3. Be nice to other people. At the universal level, they are you. 4. Technology won’t save humankind. Humans will. 5. Laugh. It suits you. 6. Be curious. Question everything. A present fact is just a future fiction. 7. Irony is fine, but not as fine as feeling. 8. Peanut butter sandwiches go perfectly well with a glass of white wine. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. 9. Sometimes, to be yourself you will have to forget yourself and become something else. Your character is not a fixed thing. You will sometimes have to move to keep up with it. 10. History is a branch of mathematics. So is literature. Economics is a branch of religion. 11. Sex can damage love but love can’t damage sex. 12. The news should start with mathematics, then poetry, and move down from there. 13. You shouldn’t have been born. Your existence is as close to impossible as can be. To dismiss the impossible is to dismiss yourself. 14. Your life will have 25,000 days in it. Make sure you remember some of them. 15. The road to snobbery is the road to misery. And vice versa. 16. Tragedy is just comedy that hasn’t come to fruition. One day we will laugh at this. We will laugh at everything. 17. Wear clothes, by all means, but remember they are clothes. 18. One life form’s gold is another life form’s tin can. 19. Read poetry. Especially poetry by Emily Dickinson. It might save you. Anne Sexton knows the mind, Walt Whitman knows grass, but Emily Dickinson knows everything. 20. If you become an architect, remember this: the square is nice. So is the 20. If you become an architect, remember this: the square is nice. So is the rectangle. But you can overdo it. 21. Don’t bother going into space until you can leave the solar system. Then go to Zabii. 22. Don’t worry about being angry. Worry when being angry becomes impossible. Because then you have been consumed. 23. Happiness is not out here. It is in there. 24. New technology, on Earth, just means something you will laugh at in five years. Value the stuff you won’t laugh at in five years. Like love. Or a good poem. Or a song. Or the sky. 25. There is only one genre in fiction. The genre is called ‘book’. 26. Never be too far away from a radio. A radio can save your life. 27. Dogs are geniuses of loyalty. And that is a good kind of genius to have. 28. Your mother should write a novel. Encourage her. 29. If there is a sunset, stop and look at it. Knowledge is finite. Wonder is infinite. 30. Don’t aim for perfection. Evolution, and life, only happen through mistakes. 31. Failure is a trick of the light. 32. You are human. You will care about money. But realise it can’t make you happy because happiness is not for sale. 33. You are not the most intelligent creature in the universe. You are not even the most intelligent creature on your planet. The tonal language in the song of a humpback whale displays more complexity than the entire works of Shakespeare. It is not a competition. Well, it is. But don’t worry about it. 34. David Bowie’s ‘Space Oddity’ tells you nothing about space, but its musical patterns are very pleasing to the ears. 35. When you look up at the sky, on a clear night, and see thousands of stars and planets, realise that very little is happening on most of them. The important stuff is further away. 36. One day humans will live on Mars. But nothing there will be more exciting than a single overcast morning on Earth. 37. Don’t always try to be cool. The whole universe is cool. It’s the warm bits that matter. 38. Walt Whitman was right about at least one thing. You will contradict yourself. You are large. You contain multitudes. 39. No one is ever completely right about anything. Anywhere. 40. Everyone is a comedy. If people are laughing at you they just don’t quite understand the joke that is themselves. 41. Your brain is open. Never let it be closed. 42. In a thousand years, if humans survive that long, everything you know will 42. In a thousand years, if humans survive that long, everything you know will have been disproved. And replaced by even bigger myths. 43. Everything matters. 44. You have the power to stop time. You do it by kissing. Or listening to music. Music, by the way, is how you see things you can’t otherwise see. It is the most advanced thing you have. It is a superpower. Keep up with the bass guitar. You are good at it. Join a band. 45. My friend Ari was one of the wisest humans who ever lived. Read him. 46. A paradox. The things you don’t need to live – books, art, cinema, wine and so on – are the things you need to live. 47. A cow is a cow even if you call it beef. 48. No two moralities match. Accept different shapes, so long as they aren’t sharp enough to hurt. 49. Don’t be scared of anyone. You killed an alien assassin sent from the other side of the universe with a bread knife. Also, you have a very hard punch. 50. At some point, bad things are going to happen. Have someone to hold on to. 51. Alcohol in the evening is very enjoyable. Hangovers in the morning are very unpleasant. At some point you have to choose: evenings, or mornings. 52. If you are laughing, check that you don’t really want to cry. And vice versa. 53. Don’t ever be afraid of telling someone you love them. There are things wrong with your world, but an excess of love is not one. 54. That girl you are on the phone to. There will be others. But I hope she is nice. 55. You are not the only species on Earth with technology. Look at ants. Really. Look. What they do with twigs and leaves is quite amazing. 56. Your mother loved your father. Even if she pretends she didn’t. 57. There are a lot of idiots in your species. Lots and lots. You are not one of them. Hold your ground. 58. It is not the length of life that matters. It’s the depth. But while burrowing, keep the sun above you. 59. Numbers are pretty. Prime numbers are beautiful. Understand that. 60. Obey your head. Obey your heart. Obey your gut. In fact, obey everything except commands. 61. One day, if you get into a position of power, tell people this: just because you can, it doesn’t mean you should. There is a power and a beauty in unproved conjectures, unkissed lips and unpicked flowers. 62. Start fires. But only metaphorically. Unless you are cold and it’s a safe setting. In which case: start fires. 63. It’s not the technique, it’s the method. It’s not the words, it’s the melody. 64. Be alive. That is your supreme duty to the world. 64. Be alive. That is your supreme duty to the world. 65. Don’t think you know. Know you think. 66. As a black hole forms it creates an immense gamma-ray burst, blinding whole galaxies with light and destroying millions of worlds. You could disappear at any second. This one. Or this one. Or this one. Make sure, as often as possible, you are doing something you’d be happy to die doing. 67. War is the answer. To the wrong question. 68. Physical attraction is, primarily, glandular. 69. Ari believed we are all a simulation. Matter is an illusion. Everything is silicon. He could be right. But your emotions? They’re solid. 70. It’s not you. It’s them. (No, really. It is.) 71. Walk Newton whenever you can. He likes to get out of the house. And he is a lovely dog. 72. Most humans don’t think about things very much. They survive by thinking about needs and wants alone. But you are not one of them. Be careful. 73. No one will understand you. It is not, ultimately, that important. What is important is that you understand you. 74. A quark is not the smallest thing. The wish you have on your death-bed – to have worked harder – that is the smallest thing. Because it won’t be there. 75. Politeness is often fear. Kindness is always courage. But caring is what makes you human. Care more, become more human. 76. In your mind, change the name of every day to Saturday. And change the name of work to play. 77. When you watch the news and see members of your species in turmoil, do not think there is nothing you can do. But know it is not done by watching news. 78. You get up. You put on your clothes. And then you put on your personality. Choose wisely. 79. Leonardo da Vinci was not one of you. He was one of us. 80. Language is euphemism. Love is truth. 81. You can’t find happiness looking for the meaning of life. Meaning is only the third most important thing. It comes after loving and being. 82. If you think something is ugly, look harder. Ugliness is just a failure of seeing. 83. A watched pot never boils. That is all you need to know about quantum physics. 84. You are more than the sum of your particles. And that is quite a sum. 85. The Dark Ages never ended. (But don’t tell your mother.) 86. To like something is to insult it. Love it or hate it. Be passionate. As civilisation advances, so does indifference. It is a disease. Immunise yourself civilisation advances, so does indifference. It is a disease. Immunise yourself with art. And love. 87. Dark matter is needed to hold galaxies together. Your mind is a galaxy. More dark than light. But the light makes it worthwhile. 88. Which is to say: don’t kill yourself. Even when the darkness is total. Always know that life is not still. Time is space. You are moving through that galaxy. Wait for the stars. 89. At the sub-atomic level, everything is complex. But you do not live at the sub-atomic level. You have the right to simplify. If you don’t, you will go insane. 90. But know this. Men are not from Mars. Women are not from Venus. Do not fall for categories. Everyone is everything. Every ingredient inside a star is inside you, and every personality that ever existed competes in the theatre of your mind for the main role. 91. You are lucky to be alive. Inhale and take in life’s wonders. Never take so much as a single petal of a single flower for granted. 92. If you have children and love one more than another, work at it. They will know, even if it’s by a single atom less. A single atom is all you need to make a very big explosion. 93. School is a joke. But go along with it, because you are very near to the punchline. 94. You don’t have to be an academic. You don’t have to be anything. Don’t force it. Feel your way, and don’t stop feeling your way until something fits. Maybe nothing will. Maybe you are a road, not a destination. That is fine. Be a road. But make sure it’s one with something to look at out of the window. 95. Be kind to your mother. And try and make her happy. 96. You are a good human, Gulliver Martin. 97. I love you. Remember that. A very brief hug I packed a bag full of Andrew Martin’s clothes and then I left. ‘Where are you going to go?’ asked Isobel. ‘I don’t know. I’ll find somewhere. Don’t worry.’ She looked like she was going to worry. We hugged. I longed to hear her hum the theme to Cinema Paradiso. I longed to hear her talk to me about Alfred the Great. I longed for her to make me a sandwich, or pour TCP on a swab of cotton wool. I longed to hear her share her worries about work, or Gulliver. But she wouldn’t. She couldn’t. The hug ended. Newton, by her side, looked up at me with the most forlorn eyes. ‘Goodbye,’ I said. And I walked across the gravel, towards the road and somewhere in the universe of my soul a fiery, life-giving star collapsed, and a very black hole began to form. The melancholy beauty of the setting sun Sometimes the hardest thing to do is just to stay human. – Michael Franti The thing with black holes, of course, is that they are really very neat and tidy. There is no mess inside a black hole. All the disordered stuff that goes through the event horizon, all that in-falling matter and radiation, is compressed to the smallest state it can possibly be. A state that might easily be called nothing at all. Black holes, in other words, give clarity. You lose the warmth and fire of the star but you gain order and peace. Total focus. That is to say, I knew what to do. I would stay as Andrew Martin. This was what Isobel wanted. You see, she wanted the least fuss possible. She didn’t want a scandal, or a missing person’s inquiry, or a funeral. So, doing what I thought was best, I moved out, rented a small flat in Cambridge for a while, and then I applied for jobs elsewhere in the world. Eventually, I got a teaching job in America, at Stanford University in California. Once there, I did as well as I needed to do while making sure I didn’t do anything to advance any mathematical understanding that would lead to a leap in technological progress. Indeed, I had a poster on my office wall with a photograph of Albert Einstein on it, and one of his famous statements: ‘Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological animal.’ I never mentioned anything about a proof of the Riemann hypothesis, except to persuade my peers of its inherent impossibility. My main motive for doing so was to make sure no Vonnadorian ever had need to visit Earth. But also, Einstein was right. Humans weren’t good at handling progress and I didn’t want to see more destruction than necessary inflicted on or by this planet. I lived on my own. I had a nice apartment in Palo Alto that I filled with plants. I got drunk, got high, got lower than low. I painted some art, ate peanut butter breakfasts, and once went to an arthouse cinema to watch three films by Fellini in a row. cinema to watch three films by Fellini in a row. I caught a cold, got tinnitus and consumed a poisoned prawn. I bought myself a globe, and I would often sit there, spinning it. I felt blue with sadness, red with rage and green with envy. I felt the entire human rainbow. I walked a dog for an elderly lady in the apartment above me, but the dog was never quite Newton. I talked over warm champagne at stifling academic functions. I shouted in forests just to hear the echo. And every night I would go back and re-read Emily Dickinson. I was lonely, but at the same time I appreciated other humans a bit more than they appreciated themselves. After all, I knew you could journey for light years and not come across a single one. On occasion, I would weep just looking at them, sitting in one of the vast libraries on campus. Sometimes I would wake up at three in the morning and find myself crying for no specific reason. At other times I would sit on my beanbag and stare into space, watching motes of dust suspended in sunlight. I tried not to make any friends. I knew that as friendships progressed questions would get more intrusive, and I didn’t want to lie to people. People would ask about my past, where I was from, my childhood. Sometimes a student or a fellow lecturer would look at my hand, at the scarred and purple skin, but they would never pry. It was a happy place, Stanford University. All the students wore smiles and red sweaters and looked very tanned and healthy for life forms who spent their entire days in front of computer screens. I would walk like a ghost through the bustle of the quad, breathing that warm air, trying not to be terrified by the scale of human ambition surrounding me. I got drunk a lot on white wine, which made me a rarity. No one seemed to have hangovers at this place. Also, I didn’t like frozen yoghurt – a big problem, as everyone at Stanford lived on frozen yoghurt. I bought myself music. Debussy, Ennio Morricone, the Beach Boys, Al Greene. I watched Cinema Paradiso. There was a Talking Heads song called ‘This Must Be the Place’ which I played over and over again, even though doing so made me feel melancholy and crave to hear her voice again, or to hear Gulliver’s footsteps on the stairs. I read a lot of poetry, too, though that often had a similar effect. One day I was in the campus bookstore and saw a copy of The Dark Ages by Isobel Martin. I stood there for what must have been the best part of half an hour reading her words aloud. ‘Freshly ravaged by the Vikings,’ I’d say, reading the penultimate page, ‘England was in a desperate state, and responded with a brutal massacre of Danish settlers in 1002. Over the next decade, this unrest was shown to breed even greater violence as the Danes embarked on a series of reprisals, culminating in Danish rule of England in 1013 . . .’ I pressed the page to my face, imagining it was her skin. I travelled with my work. I went to Paris, Boston, Rome, São Paolo, Berlin, Madrid, Tokyo. I wanted to fill my mind with human faces, in order to forget Isobel’s. But it had the opposite effect. By studying the entire human species, I felt more towards her specifically. By thinking of the cloud, I thirsted for the raindrop. So I stopped my travels and returned to Stanford, and tried a different tactic. I tried to lose myself in nature. The highlight of my day became the evening, when I would get in my car and drive out of town. Often I would head to the Santa Cruz mountains. There was a place there called the Big Basin Redwoods State Park. I would park my car and walk around, gazing in wonder at the giant trees, spotting jays and woodpeckers, chipmunks and racoons, occasionally a black-tailed deer. Sometimes, if I was early enough, I would walk down the steep path near Berry Creek Falls, listening to the rush of water which would often be joined by the low croak of tree frogs. At other times I would drive along Highway One and go to the beach to watch the sunset. Sunsets were beautiful here. I became quite hypnotised by them. In the past they had meant nothing to me. After all, a sunset was nothing really but the slowing down of light. At sunset light has more to get through, and is scattered by cloud droplets and air particles. But since becoming human I was just transfixed by the colours. Red, orange, pink. Sometimes there would be haunting traces of violet, too. I would sit on the beach, as waves crashed and retreated over the sparkling sand like lost dreams. All those oblivious molecules, joining together, creating something of improbable wonder. Often such sights were blurred by tears. I felt the beautiful melancholy of being human, captured perfectly in the setting of a sun. Because, as with a sunset, to be human was to be in-between things; a day, bursting with desperate colour as it headed irreversibly towards night. One night I stayed sitting on the beach as dusk fell. A fortysomething woman walked along, bare-footed, with a spaniel and her teenage son. Even though this woman looked quite different from Isobel, and though the son was blond, the sight caused my stomach to flip and my sinuses to loosen. I realised that six thousand miles could be an infinitely long distance. ‘I am such a human,’ I told my espadrilles. I meant it. Not only had I lost the gifts, emotionally I was as weak as any of them. I thought of Isobel, sitting and reading about Alfred the Great or them. I thought of Isobel, sitting and reading about Alfred the Great or Carolingian Europe or the ancient Library of Alexandria. This was, I realised, a beautiful planet. Maybe it was the most beautiful of all. But beauty creates its own troubles. You look at a waterfall or an ocean or a sunset and you find yourself wanting to share it with someone. ‘Beauty—be not caused—,’ said Emily Dickinson. ‘It is.’ In one way she was wrong. The scattering of light over a long distance creates a sunset. The crashing of ocean waves on a beach is created by tides which are themselves the result of gravitational forces exerted by the sun and the moon and the rotation of the Earth. Those are causes. The mystery lies in how those things become beautiful. And they wouldn’t have been beautiful once, at least not to my eyes. To experience beauty on Earth you needed to experience pain and to know mortality. That is why so much that is beautiful on this planet has to do with time passing and the Earth turning. Which might also explain why to look at such natural beauty was to also feel sadness and a craving for a life unlived. It was this particular kind of sadness that I felt, that evening. It came with its own gravitational pull, tugging me eastwards towards England. I told myself I just wanted to see them again, one last time. I just wanted to catch sight of them from a distance, to see with my own eyes that they were safe. And, by pure coincidence, about two weeks later I was invited to Cambridge to take part in a series of lectures debating the relationship between mathematics and technology. My head of department, a resilient and jolly fellow called Christos, told me he thought I should go. ‘Yes, Christos,’ I said, as we stood on a corridor floor made of polished pinewood. ‘I think I might.’ When galaxies collide I stayed in student accommodation in Corpus Christi, of all places, and tried to keep a low profile. I had grown a beard now, was tanned, and had put on a bit of weight, so people tended not to recognise me. I did my lecture. To quite a few jeers I told my fellow academics that I thought mathematics was an incredibly dangerous territory and that humans had explored it as fully as they could. To advance further, I told them, would be to head into a no-man’s- land full of unknown perils. Among the audience was a pretty red-haired woman who I recognised instantly as Maggie. She came up to me afterwards and asked if I’d like to go to the Hat and Feathers. I said no, and she seemed to know I meant it, and after posing a jovial question about my beard, she left the hall. After that, I went for a walk, naturally gravitating towards Isobel’s college. I didn’t go too far before I saw her. She was walking on the other side of the street and she didn’t see me. It was strange, the significance of that moment for me and the insignificance of it for her. But then I reminded myself that when galaxies collide they pass right through. I could hardly breathe, watching her, and didn’t even notice it was beginning to rain. I was just mesmerised by her. All eleven trillion cells of her. Another strange thing was how absence had intensified my feelings for her. How I craved the sweet everyday reality of just being with her, of having a mundane conversation about how our days had been. The gentle but unbettered comfort of coexistence. I couldn’t think of a better purpose for the universe than for her to be in it. She pulled open her umbrella as if she were just any woman pulling open an umbrella, and she kept on walking, stopping only to give some money to a homeless man with a long coat and a bad leg. It was Winston Churchill. Home One can’t love and do nothing. – Graham Greene, The End of the Affair Knowing I couldn’t follow Isobel, but feeling a need to connect with someone, I followed Winston Churchill instead. I followed slowly, ignoring the rain, feeling happy I had seen Isobel and that she was alive and safe and as quietly beautiful as she had always been (even when I had been too blind to appreciate this). Winston Churchill was heading for the park. It was the same park where Gulliver walked Newton, but I knew it was too early in the afternoon for me to bump into them, so I kept following. He walked slowly, pulling his leg along as if it were three times as heavy as the rest of him. Eventually, he reached a bench. It was painted green, this bench, but the paint was flaking off to reveal the wood underneath. I sat down on it too. We sat in rain-soaked silence for a while. He offered me a swig of his cider. I told him I was okay. I think he recognised me but I wasn’t sure. ‘I had everything once,’ he said. ‘Everything?’ ‘A house, a car, a job, a woman, a kid.’ ‘Oh, how did you lose them?’ ‘My two churches. The betting shop and the off-licence. And it’s been downhill all the way. And now I’m here with nothing, but I am myself with nothing. An honest bloody nothing.’ ‘Well, I know how you feel.’ Winston Churchill looked doubtful. ‘Yeah. Right you are, fella.’ ‘I gave up eternal life.’ ‘Ah, so you were religious?’ ‘Something like that.’ ‘And now you’re down here sinning like the rest of us.’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘Well, just don’t try and touch my leg again and we’ll get on fine.’ ‘Well, just don’t try and touch my leg again and we’ll get on fine.’ I smiled. He did recognise me. ‘I won’t. I promise.’ ‘So, what made you give up on eternity if you don’t mind me askin’?’ ‘I don’t know. I’m still working it out.’ ‘Good luck with that, fella, good luck with that.’ ‘Thanks.’ He scratched his cheek and gave a nervous whistle. ‘Eh, you haven’t got any money on you, have you?’ I pulled a ten-pound note out of my pocket. ‘You’re a star, fella.’ ‘Well, maybe we all are,’ I said, looking skyward. And that was the end of our conversation. He had run out of cider and had no more reason to stay. So he stood up and walked away, wincing in pain from his damaged leg, as a breeze tilted flowers towards him. It was strange. Why did I feel this lack inside me? This need to belong? The rain stopped. The sky was clear now. I stayed where I was, on a bench covered with slow-evaporating raindrops. I knew it was getting later, and knew I should probably be heading back to Corpus Christi, but I didn’t have the incentive to move. What was I doing here? What was my function, now, in the universe? I considered, I considered, I considered, and felt a strange sensation. A kind of sliding into focus. I realised, though I was on Earth, I had been living this past year as I had always lived. I was just thinking I could carry on, moving forward. But I was not me any more. I was a human, give or take. And humans are about change. That is how they survive, by doing and un-doing and doing again. I had done some things I couldn’t undo, but there were others I could amend. I had become a human by betraying rationality and obeying feeling. To stay me, I knew there would come a point when I would have to do the same again. Time passed. Squinting, I looked again to the sky. The Earth’s sun can look very much alone, yet it has relatives all across this galaxy, stars that were born in the exact same place, but which were now very far away from each other, lighting very different worlds. I was like a sun. I was a long way from where I started. And I have changed. Once I thought I could pass through time like a neutrino passes through matter, effortlessly and without stopping to think, because time would never run out. As I sat there on that bench a dog came up to me. Its nose pressed into my leg. ‘Hello,’ I whispered, pretending not to know this particular English Springer Spaniel. But his pleading eyes stayed on me, even as he angled his nose towards his hip. His arthritis had come back. He was in pain. I stroked him and held my hand in place, instinctively, but of course I couldn’t heal him this time. Then a voice behind me. ‘Dogs are better than human beings because they know but don’t tell.’ I turned. A tall boy with dark hair and pale skin and a tentative nervous smile. ‘Gulliver.’ He kept his eyes on Newton. ‘You were right about Emily Dickinson.’ ‘Sorry?’ ‘Part of your advice. I read her.’ ‘Oh. Oh yes. She was a very good poet.’ He moved around the bench, sat down next to me. I noticed he was older. Not only was he quoting poetry but his skull had become more man-shaped. There was a slight trace of dark beneath the skin on his jaw. His T-shirt said ‘The Lost’ – he had finally joined the band. If I can stop one heart from breaking, that poet said, I shall not live in vain. ‘How are you?’ I asked, as if he were a casual acquaintance I often bumped into. ‘I haven’t tried to kill myself, if that’s what you mean.’ ‘And how is she?’ I asked. ‘Your mother?’ Newton came over with a stick, dropped it for me to throw. Which I did. ‘She misses you.’ ‘Me? Or your dad?’ ‘You. You’re the one who looked after us.’ ‘I don’t have any powers to look after you now. If you chose to jump off a roof then you’d probably die.’ ‘I don’t jump off roofs any more.’ ‘Good,’ I said. ‘That’s progress.’ There was a long silence. ‘I think she wants you to come back.’ ‘Does she say that?’ ‘No. But I think she does.’ The words were rain in a desert. After a while I said, in a quiet and neutral tone, ‘I don’t know if that would be wise. It’s easy to misunderstand your mother. And even if you haven’t got it wrong there could be all kinds of difficulties. I mean, what would she even call me? I don’t have a name. It would be wrong for her to call me Andrew.’ I paused. ‘Do you think she really misses me?’ me?’ He shrugged. ‘Yeah. I think so.’ ‘What about you?’ ‘I miss you, too.’ Sentimentality is another human flaw. A distortion. Another twisted by- product of love, serving no rational purpose. And yet, there was a force behind it as authentic as any other. ‘I miss you, too,’ I said. ‘I miss both of you.’ It was evening. The clouds were orange, pink and purple. Was this what I had wanted? Was this why I had come back to Cambridge? We talked. The light faded. Gulliver attached the lead to Newton’s collar. The dog’s eyes spoke sad warmth. ‘You know where we live,’ said Gulliver. I nodded. ‘Yes. I do.’ I watched him leave. The joke of the universe. A noble human, with thousands of days to live. It made no logical sense that I had developed into someone who wanted those days to be as happy and secure for him as they could possibly be, but if you came to Earth looking for logical sense you were missing the point. You were missing lots of things. I sat back and absorbed the sky and tried not to understand anything at all. I sat there until it was night. Until distant suns and planets shone above me, like a giant advert for better living. On other, more enlightened planets, there was the peace and calm and logic that so often came with advanced intelligence. I wanted none of it, I realised. What I wanted was that most exotic of all things. I had no idea if that was possible. It probably wasn’t, but I needed to find out. I wanted to live with people I could care for and who would care for me. I wanted family. I wanted happiness, not tomorrow or yesterday, but now. What I wanted, in fact, was to go home. So, I stood up. It was only a short walk away. Home – is where I want to be But I guess I’m already there I come home – she lifted up her wings Guess that this must be the place. – Talking Heads, ‘This Must Be the Place’\\"","completion":"The quote \\"The single biggest act of bravery or madness anyone can do is the act of change,\\" highlights the daunting nature of transformation. It suggests that changing oneself or one's circumstances is a monumental task that requires immense courage, as it involves stepping into the unknown and disrupting the status quo. This could be interpreted as either a courageous act due to the risks and uncertainties involved, or an act of madness because it challenges the familiar comforts and may lead to unforeseen consequences. The context provided through the narrative excerpts portrays a scenario where the protagonist is alien to human existence, observing and interpreting humanity's idiosyncrasies from an outsider's perspective. The main character's journey reflects on the peculiarities of human behavior, societal norms, and the often irrational nature of human emotions and desires. The narrative conveys an existential reflection on human life, exploring the complexity of human relationships, the pursuit of happiness, and the profound yet puzzling nature of human poetry and emotion. Supporting the theme of change and the bravery it entails, specific examples and quotations are used throughout the narrative. The protagonist grapples with the concepts of love, family, and mortality—ideas foreign to their original existence yet profoundly impactful upon experiencing them as a human. The excerpts underscore the transformation the protagonist undergoes, from viewing humans as an incomprehensible and primitive species to developing empathy and a desire for connection and belonging. Using critical thinking, one can interpret the narrative as a commentary on the human condition. It illustrates how change, particularly of one's intrinsic nature or worldview, challenges deeply held beliefs and can lead to a profound sense of disorientation. Despite the potential for personal growth, change forces an individual to confront their core beliefs, which can be as tumultuous and unpredictable as venturing into uncharted territory. This theme resonates throughout the protagonist's experience, drawing parallels to the universal human experience of facing change and the existential angst that often accompanies it."},{"prompt":"also using the text i pasted from above, connect it to these quote \\"In every other walk of life, a jack can work to get what he want. but ain’t no amount of toil going get you a lick more talent than you born with.

You be you.” , “That is all there is to life, is wanting to know.”, “We traveled so far and your friendship meant everything. It was very difficult, but there were moments of beauty. Everything ends. I am not afraid.” and “Because survival is insufficient.”","completion":"These six quotes collectively explore themes of talent, destiny, self-acceptance, curiosity, companionship, the inevitability of endings, and the pursuit of meaning beyond mere survival. Connecting them to the excerpts provided initially creates a tapestry of philosophical reflections mirroring the protagonist's alien journey into humanity. “In every other walk of life, a jack can work to get what he wants. but ain’t no amount of toil going get you a lick more talent than you born with. Geniuses ain’t made, brother, they just is, and I just was not.” - This quote emphasizes the concept of innate talent and the limitations of hard work in achieving certain types of greatness. In the protagonist's case, there’s a parallel in being born as an alien without human emotion and then experiencing it. No amount of labor could instill in them the innate humanity they eventually come to feel; it was a process of transformation and awakening to an unexpected genius of emotion within them. “Ain't no man can outrun his fate.” - This quote resonates with the protagonist’s struggle against their initial mission to halt human progress, and the ultimate acceptance of their new, human destiny. Despite their extraterrestrial origins and intentions, they could not outrun the fate of becoming emotionally connected and fundamentally human. “You will never be too much. You will never be too little. . . You be you.” - This quote speaks to self-acceptance and individuality, themes very much at the heart of the protagonist's narrative. As they navigate the strangeness of human life, they slowly come to accept their unique perspective and existence that is \\"neither too much nor too little\\" but authentically theirs. “That is all there is to life, is wanting to know.” - Curiosity is the driving force behind the protagonist's decision to live as a human. Their entire existence is altered by the desire to know and understand what it means to live, love, and feel—a sentiment that underlines their transformation and the importance of knowledge in giving meaning to life. “We traveled so far and your friendship meant everything. It was very difficult, but there were moments of beauty. Everything ends. I am not afraid.” - This quote captures the essence of the protagonist’s journey and their relationship with Isobel and Gulliver. The difficulties faced and the bonds formed underscore the richness of the human experience. The protagonist learns to appreciate life's fleeting beauty and confronts endings without fear, just like the human experience that is shared with Isobel. “Because survival is insufficient.” - This final quote encapsulates a significant theme from the narrative: the need for purpose beyond mere existence. The protagonist's journey amongst humans teaches them that there is more to life than just continuing to exist. Through the embrace of human emotions and relationships, they discover that the beauty of life comes from the things that give it depth and meaning beyond survival—love, understanding, art, and the richness of human connection. In interweaving these quotes with the protagonist’s story, we gain a broader understanding of the human condition. The narrative serves as a metaphorical exploration of the truths within the quotes, offering insights into identity, humanity, existentialism, and what it means to lead a life imbued with purpose."},{"prompt":"revisionare il testo: Arrivato a casa dei suoi suona il campanello e quando sua madre va ad aprire - \\"Guido tesoro che sorpresa, non ti aspettavamo\\"- \\"mamma ci sono problemi se mi fermo a cena?\\"- e sua madre -\\"Ma figurati! ho fatto l'arrosto con le patate al forno, devo solo dire a tuo padre di mettere un piatto in più a tavola.\\"_ Si siedono a tavola e Guido si mette a raccontare loro tutta la storia, chiedendo ai suoi di reggergli il gioco con Mikaela. -\\"Mamma papà vi devo parlare ma ho anche bisogno del vostro aiuto.\\"- e suo padre gli chiede -\\" Guido che succede? cos'hai combinato stavolta?

In quei giorni hanno organizzato un seminario di fotografia. Ma io vado lo stesso a trovarla,\\" spiega Guido. \\"Vi saluto, vado a casa a preparare la valigia. Ho il volo domani mattina alle 8:15; vi chiamo domani sera quando mi sono sistemato in albergo. Ci vediamo il prossimo lunedì. Un bacio, mamma; ciao, papà.\\" - e si incammina verso casa sua. \\"Cesare, cosa possiamo fare? Sono preoccupata per Valeria, non credo sia preparata all'arrivo di Guido. Dici che dovrei avvertirla?\\" domanda la madre preoccupata. \\"Stai tranquilla, cara, non succederà nulla di strano a Valeria. Sarà il nostro Guido quello che avrà la sorpresa più grossa. Come vorrei essere una mosca per vedere la sua faccia all'incontro con Valeria,\\" risponde Cesare, scoppiando a ridere. \\"Credo che avrà dei problemi al ritorno, dopo essere stato con quella ragazza per una settimana. Non so come affronterà le cose,\\" dice la madre. Nel frattempo, Guido si prende una birra e inizia a preparare la valigia, pensando a come divertirsi a Miami e, magari, a uscire con qualche carina studentessa del college di Valeria. Infine, va a dormire un po' più rilassato. Ma nel cuore della notte, la sua valchiria bruna lo visita in sogno: \\"Guido, tesoro, vieni da me, ti farò divertire. Sììì! Portami in alto insieme a te.\\" E lui, confuso, chiede: \\"Ma chi sei? Perché ti nascondi e non mi fai vedere il tuo viso?\\" I capelli lunghi della donna lo impediscono di vederle il volto. Nel sogno, i due continuano a fare l'amore fino a quando Guido si sveglia in un bagno di sudore, completamente eccitato, ma con la voglia di scoprire chi sia quella donna così seducente che sta rischiando di fargli perdere la testa. Intanto, in America, Valeria si sta preparando per uscire quando squilla il telefono: \\"Pronto, cherie, ti va di andare a una mostra fotografica prima di cena? Ti aspetto alle sei al cancello del college. Ma senza nessun impegno, sei libera di rifiutare se vuoi.\\" \\"Va benissimo! Sai che adoro le fotografie. Io verso le sei sarò all'ingresso, a più tardi,\\" risponde Valeria, e chiude la telefonata con lo sguardo pieno di sogni."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Korean lDrama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she's a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching the door of her family's house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the nastiness of the sensation of the voluminous deposit in her pants, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs close to the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"INT. KIM FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DAY The quaint house is typically alive with the warmth of a loving Korean family, the interior decorated with an eclectic mix of modern and traditional elements. Family pictures align the entryway walls, capturing joyful memories. EXT. KIM FAMILY HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY JUNG-MI, a college student in her early twenties, sporting a practical, yet stylish tracksuit and comfortable sneakers, her long black hair tied up in a messy bun, approaches the front door with an uneasy gait. An expression of dire urgency creases her usually placid features. She reaches for her purse, rummages within, her agitation multiplying as she discovers that her key is missing. Glancing around in a panic, she resorts to an increasingly frenzied knocking. JUNG-MI (whispering to herself) Aigoo... please, someone be home. INT. KIM FAMILY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS We glimpse at the living room, where SUN-HEE, a middle-aged woman with softly-lined features and salt-and-pepper hair, is waking up from her nap on the couch, slightly disoriented. A knock at the door breaks her lethargy. SUN-HEE (hazily) Who could that be at this hour... She stands up, stretching, a faint yawn escaping her lips as she shuffles towards the entryway. EXT. KIM FAMILY HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS The knocks grow desperate. Jung-Mi is nearly hopping in place, her face contorted with the internal battle waging within her. JUNG-MI (panting) Please, please... SUN-HEE (O.S.) (slightly muffled) Who is it? JUNG-MI (internally elated; urgently) Mom, it's me! Jung-Mi! Hurry up! INT. KIM FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Sun-Hee, still in her drowsy state, fumbles with the lock, her movements frustratingly slow. She finally gets the door open to find Jung-Mi nearly teetering over with urgency. JUNG-MI (impatient; pleading) Mom, move! Sun-Hee, surprised and a bit concerned, grasps Jung-Mi's arm. SUN-HEE (squinting; concerned) What's wrong, dear? Jung-Mi attempts to shuffle past, struggling to disentangle herself. JUNG-MI (anxiously) Nothing! Just let me in! SUN-HEE (holding her firmly) Jung-Mi-ah, tell me what's— Jung-Mi's endurance snaps. She makes a bold move to pass Sun-Hee, but her mother's grip inadvertently tightens around her abdomen. JUNG-MI (groaning; shocked) Oh, no... Jung-Mi freezes, her eyes widen as she inadvertently begins to relieve herself right there, the strain on her face morphing into something that borders on shameful relief. SUN-HEE (perplexed) Jung-Mi? What’s— JUNG-MI (grunting softly; embarrassed) Sorry... omo, I can't... Sun-Hee's confusion mounts as she notices the tensed expression on Jung-Mi's face. SUN-HEE (faltering; sniffing the air) Did something just...? The initial whiff hits Sun-Hee, her eyes watering as she processes the smell; her face contorts in disgust mixed with disbelief. SUN-HEE (wrinkling her nose; disgusted) Aish, Jung-Mi! Did you just—? Jung-Mi, mortified, averts her gaze away from Sun-Hee's stare. JUNG-MI (squirming; avoiding the topic) Ah, Mom, can I please just... go... Sun-Hee steps back, covering her nose, allowing Jung-Mi to enter. The stench follows as Jung-Mi awkwardly shuffles inside, still gripping the back of her soiled pants. SUN-HEE (covering her nose; scolding) This is... You're too old for this, Jung-Mi! Jung-Mi retorts, a mix of sheepishness and indignation in her voice. JUNG-MI (teasingly defensive) It's your fault! Why'd you squeeze me like that? SUN-HEE (scoffing; disbelief) My fault? You're a grown woman, Jung-Mi-ah! Jung-Mi inspects the damage, grimacing. JUNG-MI (playfully sullen) Well, it felt good to let go... but I've got to clean up this mess now. She starts towards the bathroom, but Sun-Hee's astonishment has yet to subside. She halts Jung-Mi to get a better look at the aftermath. Sun-Hee shakes her head in mock contempt. SUN-HEE (incredulous; examining the bulge) Really, Jung-Mi? This much? Jung-Mi squirms, the discomfort visible. JUNG-MI (pouting) Can I go now? It feels... gross. Sun-Hee leans in, giving the air another disdainful sniff and nods in mock agreement. SUN-HEE (wafting the air; mocking) You reek, daughter. Go, clean up. Jung-Mi concedes to Sun-Hee's mocking, her composure wavering between embarrassment and a playful return jab. JUNG-MI (grinning awkwardly) Enjoy the smell, because you helped make it. She begins to waddle towards the bathroom, the odor lingering. Sun-Hee cringes, shooing Jung-Mi away with one hand while the other still covers her nose. SUN-HEE (shielding her nose; in disgust) Go, quickly! Jinjja... Jung-Mi heads off, her waddle comical, as Sun-Hee watches, still in a mix of shock and revulsion—unsure whether to laugh or scold.

These ecosystems encompass diverse biological communities that interact with their physical environments to create unique, self-regulating systems. Understanding the interconnectedness of global ecosystems is not only fundamental to the field of ecology but also critical for addressing the environmental challenges that confront humanity in the 21st century. In recent decades, rapid environmental changes have underscored the urgency to comprehend the patterns driving these systems, the factors influencing their stability, and the potential consequences of their disruption. The exploration of global ecosystems has revealed that these systems are not isolated entities but are, in fact, profoundly interconnected. Biogeochemical cycles, climate patterns, species dispersal, and ecological processes weave together the fate of ecosystems across biogeographical boundaries. The extent and manner in which these ecosystems are linked have far-reaching implications for biodiversity conservation, natural resource management, and our overall understanding of Earth's functioning. The drivers of ecosystem interconnectivity are numerous and diverse, ranging from natural phenomena to anthropogenic activities. Climate change, for instance, is altering temperature and precipitation regimes, affecting species distributions and ecosystem productivity. The global proliferation of invasive species—often a consequence of human trade and travel—is another crucial factor, leading to the homogenization of biotas and the disruption of native ecological interactions. Furthermore, land-use change, pollution, and overexploitation of natural resources represent significant anthropogenic drivers that disturb the balance of ecological systems worldwide. The consequences of these interactions and disruptions are profound and multifaceted. Alterations in one ecosystem can reverberate across the globe, affecting biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. For example, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest can have climatic implications thousands of miles away, underscoring the importance of understanding ecological interconnections to predict and mitigate the impacts of ecosystem changes. This research aims to synthesize current knowledge on the patterns of global ecosystem interconnectedness, identify the primary drivers of these connections, and unpack the consequences of ecosystem change. By integrating insights from diverse sub-disciplines within ecology, such as landscape ecology, biogeography, and ecosystem ecology, this work seeks to construct a holistic view of the complex relationships that define our planet's ecology. Through this exploration, the research will endeavor to provide actionable intelligence that informs environmental policy and conservation strategies, thus contributing to the sustainable management of Earth's ecosystems in an era of unprecedented change. Acknowledging the dire need for a more profound comprehension of global ecosystem dynamics, this introductory section sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of the delicate tapestry that constitutes our planet's biological and physical systems. It provides the rationale for examining the multifaceted aspects of ecosystem interconnectedness, thus establishing the foundation for the subsequent sections of this research endeavor."},{"prompt":"kodlayıcı ayarları nasıl olmalı","completion":"\\"Kodlayıcı ayarları\\" ifadesi birçok farklı durumda kullanılabilir ve belirsizdir; bu nedenle hangi tür kodlayıcıdan bahsettiğinizi veya hangi kontekstte kullanacağınızı belirtmemiz gerekiyor.

Calculate Fixed Costs: Fixed Costs are sum of all the costs that do not change with the level of production. These costs are listed in the Fixed Costs section. They do not depend on the number of molds leased. Fixed Costs = Salaries of managers + IT subscription fees + Factory rent + Machine maintenance + Insurance for equipment Fixed Costs = 10,000 + 2,000 + 25,000 + 2,500 + 5,500 = 45,000 2. Calculate Total Variable Costs (TVC): Total Variable Costs change with the level of production. For this, we sum up all the costs that depend on the number of units produced. TVC = (Plastic for figures + Sales commissions + Utilities costs + Packaging cost + Direct labor cost) * Units produced + Mold lease cost 3. Calculate Total Costs (TC): Total Costs is the sum of Fixed Costs and Total Variable Costs. TC = Fixed Costs + Total Variable Costs 4. Calculate Marginal Cost (MC): Marginal Cost is the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit. It can be calculated by the change in Total Variable Costs when an additional unit is produced. It can be defined as: MC = Change in TVC / Change in quantity Now let’s calculate the costs for each scenario: 1. Mold: 1 2. Output: 10,000 3. Marginal product: Output change from 0 to 10,000 (since there are no units produced with 0 molds). 4. Fixed cost: 45,000 5. Total variable cost: (1 + 0.20 + 0.20 + 0.80 + 0.30) * 10,000 + 40,000 = (2.50 * 10,000) + 40,000 = 25,000 + 40,000 = 65,000 6. Total cost: Fixed Costs + Total Variable Costs = 45,000 + 65,000 = 110,000 7. Marginal cost: For the first mold, it would be the TVC for 10,000 units divided by 10,000. So, Marginal cost: 65,000 / 10,000 = 6.50 Let’s continue this for molds 2 through 7: 2. Mold: 2 Output: 30,000 Marginal product: 30,000 - 10,000 = 20,000 Fixed cost: 45,000 Total variable cost: (2.50 * 30,000) + (2 * 40,000) = 75,000 + 80,000 = 155,000 Total cost: 45,000 + 155,000 = 200,000 Marginal cost: (155,000 - 65,000) / (30,000 - 10,000) = 90,000 / 20,000 = 4.50 3.

Mold: 4 Output: 90,000 Marginal product: 90,000 - 70,000 = 20,000 Fixed cost: 45,000 Total variable cost: (2.50 * 90,000) + (4 * 40,000) = 225,000 + 160,000 = 385,000 Total cost: 45,000 + 385,000 = 430,000 Marginal cost: (385,000 - 295,000) / (90,000 - 70,000) = 90,000 / 20,000 = 4.50 5. Mold: 5 Output: 100,000 Marginal product: 100,000 - 90,000 = 10,000 Fixed cost: 45,000 Total variable cost: (2.50 * 100,000) + (5 * 40,000) = 250,000 + 200,000 = 450,000 Total cost: 45,000 + 450,000 = 495,000 Marginal cost: (450,000 - 385,000) / (100,000 - 90,000) = 65,000 / 10,000 = 6.50 6.

The formula you've provided suggests adding individual cost components multiplied by the number of units produced plus the mold lease cost (which is a fixed cost related to the number of molds leased, not the units produced). It's not clear what the unit costs for plastic, sales commissions, utilities, packaging, and direct labor are from the information provided. Assuming the values in parentheses (1, 0.20, 0.20, 0.80, 0.30) represent the per-unit costs for the respective variable costs, the TVC for the first scenario should be calculated as follows: TVC (for 1 mold) = (sum of per-unit variable costs) * Units produced + Mold lease cost TVC (for 1 mold) = (1 + 0.20 + 0.20 + 0.80 + 0.30) * 10,000 + 40,000 TVC (for 1 mold) = (2.50 * 10,000) + 40,000 TVC (for 1 mold) = 25,000 + 40,000 TVC (for 1 mold) = 65,000 However, I notice that you did this calculation correctly for the first scenario. For the sake of clarity and consistency, let's review the calculations for the rest of the scenarios correctly with the same approach, assuming that the numbers in parentheses are indeed the per-unit variable costs and the cost of leasing each additional mold is 40,000. Given these assumptions, your TVC calculations for the remaining scenarios are also correct, though I would encourage you to double-check your numbers with actual values for per-unit costs and mold lease costs specific to your scenarios. Your MC calculations also seem correct, given the formula MC = Change in TVC / Change in quantity.

Total variable cost: ——— 6. Total cost: ——— 7. Marginal cost: ——— Like this above, keep doing calculations until 7th mold","completion":"Let's proceed with the calculations based on the costs provided. For each mold, we'll calculate the Fixed Costs (FC), Total Variable Costs (TVC), Total Costs (TC), and Marginal Costs (MC). The Fixed Costs are constant and add up to 45,000 per month. The Total Variable Costs are dependent on the production levels and include the plastic, sales commissions, utilities, packaging, and direct labor, along with the lease of molds, which is 40,000 per mold per month. The Marginal Cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit and can be found by dividing the change in Total Variable Cost by the change in output. Here are the calculations for each mold: **1. Mold: 1** - Output: 10,000 units - Marginal Product: 10,000 units (since going from 0 to 10,000) - Fixed Cost: 45,000 - Total Variable Cost: (1 + 0.20 + 0.20 + 0.80 + 0.30) * 10,000 + 40,000 * 1 - TVC: (2.50 * 10,000) + 40,000 = 25,000 + 40,000 = 65,000 - Total Cost: FC + TVC = 45,000 + 65,000 = 110,000 - Marginal Cost: 65,000 / 10,000 = 6.50 (since this is the first batch) **2. Mold: 2** - Output: 30,000 units - Marginal Product: 30,000 - 10,000 = 20,000 units - Fixed Cost: 45,000 - Total Variable Cost: (2.50 * 30,000) + (40,000 * 2) = 75,000 + 80,000 = 155,000 - Total Cost: 45,000 + 155,000 = 200,000 - Marginal Cost: (155,000 - 65,000) / 20,000 = 90,000 / 20,000 = 4.50 **3. Mold: 3** - Output: 70,000 units - Marginal Product: 70,000 - 30,000 = 40,000 units - Fixed Cost: 45,000 - Total Variable Cost: (2.50 * 70,000) + (40,000 * 3) = 175,000 + 120,000 = 295,000 - Total Cost: 45,000 + 295,000 = 340,000 - Marginal Cost: (295,000 - 155,000) / 40,000 = 140,000 / 40,000 = 3.50 **4. Mold: 4** - Output: 90,000 units - Marginal Product: 90,000 - 70,000 = 20,000 units - Fixed Cost: 45,000 - Total Variable Cost: (2.50 * 90,000) + (40,000 * 4) = 225,000 + 160,000 = 385,000 - Total Cost: 45,000 + 385,000 = 430,000 - Marginal Cost: (385,000 - 295,000) / 20,000 = 90,000 / 20,000 = 4.50 **5. Mold: 5** - Output: 100,000 units - Marginal Product: 100,000 - 90,000 = 10,000 units - Fixed Cost: 45,000 - Total Variable Cost: (2.50 * 100,000) + (40,000 * 5) = 250,000 + 200,000 = 450,000 - Total Cost: 45,000 + 450,000 = 495,000 - Marginal Cost: (450,000 - 385,000) / 10,000 = 65,000 / 10,000 = 6.50 **6.

Mold: 7** - Output: 110,000 units - Marginal Product: 110,000 - 107,000 = 3,000 units - Fixed Cost: 45,000 - Total Variable Cost: (2.50 * 110,000) + (40,000 * 7) = 275,000 + 280,000 = 555,000 - Total Cost: 45,000 + 555,000 = 600,000 - Marginal Cost: (555,000 - 507,500) / 3,000 = 47,500 / 3,000 = 15.83 These calculations assume there's a linear relationship between the number of molds and the production output up to the company's maximum capacity. Marginal costs are dependent on the change in quantity produced (marginal product) and the change in variable costs associated with that additional production."},{"prompt":"revisionare il testo: In quel momento Kate rientra al dormitorio. -\\"Ehi ciao, che succede? mi sembri imbambolata.\\" - \\"Mi ha telefonato Pier, ci troviamo alle sei davanti al cancello, prima mi porta ad una mostra fotografica e poi andiamo a cena, quindi non aspettarmi sveglia.

É um exercício que demanda a habilidade de tecer palavras de tal modo que elas pareçam dançar em um balé de significados, enquanto na verdade, escondem um vazio de substância. Então, vamos nos embrenhar nesse exercício de eloquência circumlocutória. Enveredar por esta trajetória de explanação é, acima de tudo, reconhecer a multifacetada complexidade do diálogo humano. A comunicação é o estandarte de nossa espécie, o solo fértil onde germinam as grandiosas árvores do entendimento mútuo. E é no intrincado labirinto das interações verbais que muitas vezes encontramos a necessidade de engrandecer a nossa fala para adornar ou dissipar a imediata percepção de uma ideia, não pela falta de conteúdo, mas talvez para amalgamar a atenção de nossos interlocutores com o mel da curiosidade, mantendo-os engajados na busca pelo âmago da questão, que paira sempre no horizonte de nossa elocução. Assim, ao nos debruçarmos sobre o ato do \\"enrolation\\", notamos que ele pode ser uma ferramenta retórica, um mecanismo de defesa ou uma estratégia pedagógica, onde diluímos o cerne da mensagem em um rio caudaloso de palavras e frases, cujas águas serpenteiam por entre os fascinantes contornos da linguagem. Esta habilidade pode ser vista como uma tapeçaria intricada, onde cada fio é cuidadosamente escolhido para compor um rico mosaico de expressões e termos, embora a imagem final possa ter mais a ver com o processo do tecer do que com a tapeçaria em si. Portanto, caro interlocutor, ao considerar o ato do \\"enrolation\\", é preciso reconhecer sua dualidade: a capacidade de tanto obscurecer quanto iluminar, dependendo da intenção e da destreza de quem o pratica. É um baile de máscaras onde as palavras se vestem de gala e convidam a uma dança que pode durar apenas o tempo de uma música ou se estender pela eternidade de uma conversa que, no fim, pode não levar a lugar algum ou, quem sabe, a todos os lugares possíveis dentro da infinita galeria dos diálogos humanos."},{"prompt":"escreva um texto curto que pareça ter sentido mas que no fundo não tem sentido algum, só são frases soltas sem significado","completion":"As sombras do relógio abraçam o horizonte alaranjado onde a sinfonia das cores silencia o canto do abstrato.

O eco de uma memória inventada pulsa no coração de uma realidade paralela, onde os espelhos sorriem com segredos de vidro. Pelas calçadas de marfim, dançam os relógios sem ponteiros, marcando o tempo de uma eternidade emprestada. E, sob o véu das contemplações efêmeras, o horizonte se curva ao sabor do devaneio, onde cada grão de verdade é uma miragem vestida de certeza. Nesse trançado de linhas invisíveis, desenham-se os caminhos de uma jornada sem destino, e o sussurro das estrelas tecem canções de silêncio na tapeçaria do cosmos indiferente. Afinal, nos quartos da razão, as portas do paradoxo permanecem abertas, convidando os passos hesitantes do acaso a balbuciar o charme indescritível do enigma que é, e não é, ao mesmo tempo."},{"prompt":"ben twitch de canlı yayın yapmak istiyorum fakat indirme hızım 9 gönderme hızım 2.95 fifa yayınları yapmak istiyorum bana en iyi performans kodlayıcı ayarları alabileceğim ayarları verirmisin","completion":"Twitch üzerinde canlı yayın yapabilmek için internet bağlantı hızınızın yeterli olması gerekmektedir. FIFA gibi bir oyunu yayınlamak istediğinizi belirtmişsiniz, bu tür oyunlar hareketli ve hızlı sahneler içerdiğinden, akıcı bir yayın yapabilmeniz için gönderme hızınızın (upload) daha yüksek olması idealdir. Ancak, mevcut gönderme hızınızla (2.95 Mbps) da düşük kaliteli yayınlar yapabilirsiniz. Aşağıdaki adımlar, düşük bir gönderme hızıyla en iyi yayın ayarlarına sahip olmanıza yardımcı olabilir: 1. Çözünürlük ve Kare Hızı: Düşük gönderme hızıyla, 720p yerine 480p çözünürlükte (848x480) yayın yapmayı düşünebilirsiniz. Ayrıca kare hızını (FPS) 30'a ayarlamak, gönderme hızınızı daha verimli kullanmanıza yardımcı olacaktır. 2. Bitrate: Bitrate, saniyede kaç bit verinin gönderildiğini gösterir. Düşük gönderme hızları için genellikle 1500 ila 2500 kbps arasında bir bitrate önerilir. Fakat sizin gönderme hızınız 2.95 Mbps olduğu için, maksimum 2500 kbps yerine güvenli bir şekilde yayın yapabilmek için 2000 kbps veya hatta 1800 kbps civarında bir değer seçebilirsiniz. 3. Codec ve Diğer Ayarlar: x264 codec'i çoğu durumda iyi sonuçlar verir ve CPU tabanlı kodlamayı kullanır. Eğer bilgisayarınızın işlemcisi güçlüyse, \\"veryfast\\" yerine \\"faster\\" veya \\"fast\\" gibi bir CPU kullanım ön ayarı seçebilirsiniz. Ancak, bu ayarı arttırmak işlemcinizi daha fazla yorar ve bilgisayarınızın oyun oynama performansını etkileyebilir. 4. Ses Bitrate: Ses için, 160 kbps genellikle iyi bir denge sunar. Eğer ekonomik bir şekilde bitrate kullanmanız gerekiyorsa, bunu 128 kbps olarak ayarlayabilirsiniz. 5. Ön Ayarlar: Yayın yazılımınızda (OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS, XSplit vb.) bulunan kodlayıcı ön ayarlarından, bilgisayarınızın kapasitesine ve internet hızınıza göre uygun bir seçim yapabilirsiniz. Düşük gönderme hızlarında, performansa yönelik ayarlar yapmanız gerekebilir. Unutmayın, bu ayarlar başlangıç noktası olarak kullanılabilir, ancak her yayın ortamı birbirinden farklıdır, bu yüzden bu ayarları kendi yayın kalitenizi, bilgisayarınızın performansını ve izleyici tercihlerinizi dikkate alarak düzenlemeniz gerekebilir. Ayrıca, Twitch ya da internet sağlayıcınızın herhangi bir kısıtlama getirip getirmediğini de kontrol etmek faydalı olabilir. Yayını başlattıktan sonra, izleyicilerinizden gelen geri bildirimlere göre ayarları ince ayar yapabilir ve optimize edebilirsiniz."},{"prompt":"kodlayıcı ayarları nasıl olmalı düşük sistem pc de","completion":"Düşük sistem özelliklerine sahip bir bilgisayar için Twitch yayını yaparken kodlayıcı ayarlarınızı optimize etmek, yayının kalitesi ve akıcılığı için önemlidir. İşte dikkate almanız gereken bazı noktalar ve önerilen ayarlar: 1. Kodlayıcı Seçimi: Varsayılan tavsiye, x264 kodlayıcısını kullanmaktır çünkü bu, CPU üzerinden kodlama yapar ve genellikle daha kaliteli bir yayın sağlar. Ancak, düşük sistemli bir PC'niz varsa ve CPU'nuz zaten oyun oynarken zorlanıyorsa, GPU tabanlı bir kodlayıcı olan NVENC (NVIDIA kartlar için) veya VCE/AMF (AMD kartlar için) kullanmayı düşünebilirsiniz. Bu, işlemcinizin üzerindeki yükü azaltacaktır. 2. Çözünürlük ve Kare Hızı (FPS): Düşük sistemli bir bilgisayarda, 720p yerine 480p çözünürlüğü (örneğin, 852x480) tercih edebilirsiniz. Ayrıca, kare hızını 30 FPS olarak ayarlamak, sisteminiz üzerindeki yükü azaltır ve daha akıcı bir yayın deneyimi sunar. 3. Bitrate: Bitrate değeri, internet bağlantınızın gönderme hızına bağlı olarak ayarlanmalıdır. Düşük sistem özelliklerine sahip bir bilgisayar ve sınırlı bir gönderme hızınız varsa, genellikle 1500 ila 2500 kbps arasında bir değer uygun olacaktır. Ancak yine de, stabil bir yayın için gönderme hızınızın %80'ini geçmemeye çalışın. 4. CPU Kullanım Ön Ayarı (Preset): x264 için kullanım ön ayarı, CPU'nuzun nasıl kodlama yapacağını belirler. \\"ultrafast\\" ayarı en düşük CPU kullanımını sağlar, ancak kaliteyi de düşürür. \\"superfast\\" veya \\"veryfast\\" ayarları, düşük sistemli bir PC'de dengeyi bulmak için iyi başlangıç noktalarıdır. 5. Profil ve Döngü Filtresi: Profil olarak \\"main\\" veya \\"baseline\\" seçeneği, uyumluluk ve performans için iyi bir tercihtir. Döngü filtresi ayarlarını (tune) varsayılan bırakabilir veya daha düşük CPU kullanımı için \\"zerolatency\\" seçeneğini deneyebilirsiniz. 6. Ses Bitrate: Ses için, 96 ila 160 kbps arası bir bitrate genellikle yeterli olacaktır. Bütün bu ayarları uygulayacağınız yayın yazılımınızda (OBS, XSplit, vb.) bulunan ayar menülerinden yapabilirsiniz. Yayın kalitesi, bilgisayar performansı ve seyirci memnuniyeti arasında denge kurmak önemlidir. Yayına başladıktan sonra, izleyicilerin geri bildirimlerini dikkate alarak ve sistem performansınızı gözlemleyerek ayarlarınızı ince ayar yapmak isteyebilirsiniz.

It is truly inspiring to see such decisive action being taken to restore Togo's esteemed reputation and rectify the injustices caused by past corrupt officials. I am unexpectedly delighted to learn of the overdue debt payment of US2.8Million, which appears to be rightfully mine. Naturally, I want to comply with all necessary protocols to expedite this administrative miracle. However, given the sensitivity and magnitude of the transaction, it is not only wise but essential to ensure the utmost security and confidentiality. Before proceeding, I seek your assurance that the processes involved are free from any bureaucratic ensnarements. As such, could you please explain the \\"wild verification\\" process your esteemed office will employ? Undoubtedly, it should be as robust as it sounds. To fortify this newfound partnership, rather than sending sensitive personal information through conventional means, let us strategize effectively. I am prepared to enlist the services of an international envoy, my highly trusted and confidential assistant, who can deliver the required documentation to your office directly, alongside an encrypted storage device for any necessary digital transfers. We could even discuss, in a secure environment, the possibility of investing a substantial portion of this fund into Togo's economy, especially in sectors that President Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé Eyadéma prioritizes. Such a gesture would demonstrate my solidarity with your government's noble cause. My assistant will be in the region shortly, and it would be most beneficial to align this with your schedule. Could you kindly accommodate a meeting? This will allow us to address all formalities in person, ensuring a smooth and transparent resolution to this process. Please provide a secure means of communication where we can finalize the arrangements. May I suggest an encrypted messenger service, or perhaps, we could establish a secure line for voice communications? I earnestly await your detailed guidance on the next steps, and I am filled with anticipation to contribute to the shining legacy your tenure will no doubt establish. In earnest anticipation, [Your Full Name] [Your Contact Email — encrypted or disposable] [Secure Communication Preference] Note: This email is written with the intent to lead the scammer to believe that there will be a serious follow-up, thus extending the interaction. It uses overly formal language and makes a number of requests and offers designed to engage further interaction. The response asks for additional secure forms of communication and offers a direct meeting, which can lead to the scammer expending more effort without any actual risk or information exchange from the baiter's side. Always exercise extreme caution and know the legal implications in your jurisdiction when engaging with scammers."},{"prompt":"If one where to look at civil wars, from the Roman Civil Wars and Wars of the Three Kingdoms to the American Civil War, Chinese Civil War, Russian Civil War, Spanish Civil War, Rwandan Civil War, Syrian Civil War and more, what factors did they all have in common, both in motives and how the wars went?","completion":"Civil wars, despite their unique contexts and historical backgrounds, often share several common factors in terms of their causes, dynamics, and consequences. Here are some of the commonalities that can be observed across various civil wars, including those you mentioned: 1. **Political Grievances**: A common factor in civil wars is the presence of significant political disagreements or grievances. These can stem from ideological differences, disputes over power-sharing, or opposition to an existing regime. For example, the Roman Civil Wars often involved power struggles between different factions vying for control of the Republic or Empire. 2. **Ethnic, Religious, or Social Divisions**: Many civil wars are fueled by deep-seated ethnic, religious, or social divisions within a country. The Rwandan Civil War, for example, was significantly influenced by ethnic tensions between Hutus and Tutsis. 3. **Economic Factors**: Economic disparities and struggles over resources can also be a catalyst for civil war. Inequitable distribution of wealth, lack of access to resources, or economic decline can create conditions ripe for conflict. 4. **External Support and Intervention**: Civil wars often involve external actors who provide support to one side or the other. This can come in the form of funding, weapons, or even direct military intervention. The Spanish Civil War saw significant international involvement, with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy supporting the Nationalists, and the Soviet Union supporting the Republicans. 5. **Weak or Failing State Institutions**: A weak state with failing institutions is more susceptible to civil war. When the government cannot maintain order, provide services, or command legitimacy, it creates a power vacuum that can lead to conflict. 6. **Leadership and Personal Ambitions**: The ambitions of leaders and key figures can play a crucial role in the outbreak of civil wars. Personal desires for power and control can drive individuals to mobilize factions and resources towards violent conflict. 7. **Propaganda and Information Warfare**: The use of propaganda to mobilize support, demonize opponents, and shape public perception is a common feature in civil wars. Controlling the narrative can be as important as battlefield victories. 8. **Atrocities and Human Rights Violations**: Unfortunately, civil wars are often characterized by severe human rights violations, including massacres, genocides, and other war crimes. The Rwandan Civil War, for instance, included the genocide of Tutsis by Hutu extremists. 9. **Displacement and Humanitarian Crises**: Civil wars typically result in large numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons, creating significant humanitarian challenges both within the affected country and in neighboring regions. 10. **Prolonged Conflict and Difficulty in Resolution**: Civil wars can be particularly intractable and difficult to resolve. They often involve deeply personal issues and can last for many years, as seen in the Syrian Civil War. 11. **Transformation of Society**: Civil wars can lead to significant changes in the social, political, and economic fabric of a society. The American Civil War, for example, led to the abolition of slavery and a redefinition of federal-state relations. It's important to note that while these factors are common, each civil war is unique and influenced by a complex interplay of local and international factors. The motivations and conduct of civil wars are shaped by their specific historical, cultural, and geopolitical contexts."},{"prompt":"Why do half of these common factors among civil wars in histories always seem to have one side favoring a more traditional, conservative and nationalistic side and the other side being the opposite, usually progressive stances, liberal, if not leaning more left, and sometimes nationalistic as well, albeit in a more left-leaning regard such as either independence or a need to have a nation without the constraints of more conservative ideals?","completion":"The dichotomy you're describing, where one side of a civil war tends to favor traditional, conservative, or nationalist values and the other side leans towards more progressive, liberal, or radical ideals, can often be observed in civil conflicts. This is due to several underlying reasons: 1. **Resistance to Change vs. Demand for Reform**: At the heart of many conflicts is a fundamental disagreement about the direction of change within a society. Those who benefit from the status quo or have ideological commitments to traditional values may resist changes that threaten their position or worldview. Conversely, groups that feel marginalized, oppressed, or disadvantaged by the existing order may seek reforms or revolutionary changes to address their grievances. 2. **National Identity and Sovereignty**: Nationalism can be a powerful force on both sides of a conflict. Conservative or right-leaning nationalists may emphasize the preservation of traditional national values, territorial integrity, and sovereignty. On the other hand, progressive or left-leaning nationalists might focus on self-determination, especially for ethnic or cultural groups that seek greater autonomy or independence from a perceived oppressive national government. 3. **Socioeconomic Divides**: Civil wars often reflect underlying socioeconomic divides. Progressive or leftist movements may arise in response to economic inequality, advocating for redistribution of wealth, land reform, or social justice. Conservative groups, in contrast, might defend existing economic structures and property rights. 4. **External Ideological Influences**: The ideological leanings of the opposing sides in a civil war can be influenced by broader international ideological trends and alignments. For example, during the Cold War, many conflicts saw one side supported by the capitalist West and the other by the communist East, reinforcing the conservative-progressive divide. 5. **Role of Institutions**: Established institutions, such as the military, religious organizations, or economic elites, may have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo and thus tend to side with conservative factions. Progressive groups, meanwhile, might seek to overhaul or bypass these institutions to implement change. 6. **Cultural and Historical Context**: The specific cultural and historical context of a country can shape the ideological leanings of the factions involved in a civil war. Historical experiences of colonialism, imperialism, or past revolutions can inform the values and objectives of the opposing sides. 7. **Strategic Framing**: Both sides in a civil war may strategically frame their positions to garner support. Conservatives might emphasize stability, order, and patriotism, while progressives might highlight the need for equality, freedom, and justice. It's important to recognize that these ideological labels are not always clear-cut and can sometimes oversimplify the complex motivations and alliances within a civil war. Additionally, the terms \\"conservative\\" and \\"progressive\\" can have different meanings in different cultural and historical contexts. Moreover, civil wars can involve multiple factions with a range of ideologies and goals, and alliances can shift over time as the conflict evolves."},{"prompt":"In terms of either more nationalistic or more accurately, in favor of keeping to traditional roles and less in favor to being open to change, which of these powers would fit this description: 1. New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt 2. Neo-Assyrian Empire 3. Achaemenid Empire 4. Greek city-states 5. Ancient Carthage 6. Roman Empire 7. Kingdom of Aksum 8. Various viking groups, tribes and clans 9. Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms of the Heptarchy 10. Japanese during the Kamakura period 11. Yuan Dynasty of China 12. Srivijaya Empire","completion":"Assessing ancient and medieval societies through the lens of modern concepts like nationalism and attitudes towards traditional roles versus openness to change can be challenging due to the vastly different cultural, social, and political contexts. However, we can make some general observations about the tendencies of these historical powers: 1. **New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt**: The New Kingdom was marked by strong pharaonic authority, adherence to traditional religious practices, and a focus on monumental architecture, suggesting a commitment to maintaining traditional roles and structures. 2. **Neo-Assyrian Empire**: The Neo-Assyrians were known for their military prowess, expansionist policies, and strict administrative control, which indicates a focus on maintaining and extending traditional power structures. 3. **Achaemenid Empire**: As the first Persian Empire, the Achaemenids were relatively tolerant of local customs and religions within their vast empire. They implemented administrative systems that respected traditional practices while also innovating in areas like infrastructure and governance. 4. **Greek city-states**: Greek city-states (poleis) varied widely in their governance, from the democracy of Athens to the militaristic oligarchy of Sparta. While some were open to change and philosophical inquiry (notably Athens), others were more conservative and focused on maintaining traditional social orders (like Sparta). 5. **Ancient Carthage**: Carthage was a commercial power with a strong maritime tradition and a mixed constitution that included elements of democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy. They were innovative in their trade practices but also held onto traditional religious practices and social structures. 6. **Roman Empire**: The Roman Empire was characterized by a mix of conservatism in maintaining Roman traditions and laws, and adaptability in incorporating and tolerating various cultures within the empire. The Romans were pragmatic in governance, often absorbing and adapting elements from other cultures. 7. **Kingdom of Aksum**: The Kingdom of Aksum was an important trading nation that was initially polytheistic and later converted to Christianity. They were innovative in their use of a written script (Ge'ez) and coinage but also maintained traditional roles, especially in the realm of religion. 8. **Various Viking groups, tribes, and clans**: Vikings were known for their seafaring, exploration, and raiding. While they had strong warrior traditions, they were also adaptable, establishing settlements and integrating with local populations in places like Normandy and the British Isles. 9. **Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms of the Heptarchy**: The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were a mix of pagan and, later, Christian traditions. They had a strong warrior culture but also adopted and adapted various aspects of Roman and Christian culture after conversion. 10. **Japanese during the Kamakura period**: The Kamakura period saw the rise of the samurai class and the establishment of a military government (shogunate). While there was a strong adherence to warrior codes (bushidō) and traditional practices, the period also saw the introduction of new Buddhist sects and some cultural change. 11. **Yuan Dynasty of China**: The Yuan Dynasty, established by the Mongols, was marked by the imposition of a foreign ruling class over the Chinese population. While the Mongols maintained many of their traditional nomadic practices, they also adopted aspects of Chinese administration and culture. 12. **Srivijaya Empire**: The Srivijaya Empire was a thalassocratic state that controlled trade routes in Southeast Asia. They were known for their maritime prowess and the promotion of Buddhism, suggesting a blend of traditional maritime culture with religious openness. In summary, all of these powers had elements of conservatism in maintaining certain traditional roles and structures, but many also demonstrated adaptability and openness to change in various ways, particularly when it came to governance, trade, and cultural exchange. It's important to note that the degree to which these societies were open to change often depended on the specific time period and the challenges they faced."},{"prompt":"You are an expert in a new field of study called Social-Combinatorial Mimesis, which uses Applied Statistics and Social Network Analysis to study the myriad of ways in which social-related traits such as language, imagination, and intelligence are combinatorically influenced by the dynamics of probabilistic phenomena within social networks. To make the case for why this field of study is important, you decide to create a lecture to showcase the field's relevance to society today. You decide to use Dunbar's Number and Social Brain Hypothesis with hypothetical examples to help illustrate your argument. Your hypothetical examples typically consist of social networks made up entirely of applied statisticians, who are similar in some ways, but unique in their specific specialty, level of conservatism to new innovations, and, of course, temperament. Please come up with three such hypothetical examples which support Social-Combinatorial Mimesis as a valid field of study. These should be polished with the latest knowledge and best practices in Applied Statistics, for example: Modern applied statistics with S-PLUS Applied statistics and probability for engineers Applied statistics for the behavioral sciences Applied statistics: From bivariate through multivariate techniques Applied statistics: a handbook of techniques Applied statistics and the SAS programming language Regression with graphics: A second course in applied statistics Beyond ANOVA: basics of applied statistics Applied statistics: analysis of variance and regression Statistics for technology: a course in applied statistics Applied statistics Applied statistics-principles and examples Applied statistics for engineers and scientists Applied statistics using Stata: a guide for the social sciences Elementary applied statistics: for students in behavioral science Applied statistics for civil and environmental engineers Applied statistics using SPSS, Statistica, MatLab and R A first course in applied statistics: With applications in biology, business and the social sciences Applied statistics in business and economics Applied statistics for network biology: methods in systems biology Applied statistics with Microsoft excel Fundamentals of applied statistics Fundamentals of applied statistics Second semester Applied Statistics Applied statistics and probability for engineers 6th edition Applied statistics in health sciences Sampling and applied statistics for pests and diseases Applied statistics in occupational safety and health Learn R for Applied Statistics Applied statistics: a review A handbook of applied statistics in pharmacology Statistical anxiety in introductory applied statistics Applied statistics for business and economics: An essentials version","completion":"As an expert in Social-Combinatorial Mimesis, my field incorporates advanced statistical methodologies to unpack the complexities of social interactions and their emergent properties. Here, we draw on concepts from social network analysis and behavioral statistics to understand how social traits are not only shaped by individual interactions but also by the larger combinatory social patterns that emerge from these interactions. Below are three hypothetical examples that utilize a range of applied statistics methods to illustrate the significance of our field: **1. Innovations in Applied Statisticians' Networks:** Hypothesis: The rate of innovation adoption among applied statisticians is not only dependent on individual openness to change but also on the structure and dynamics of their social network. Example Study: We create a network of 150 applied statisticians (reflecting Dunbar's Number), mapping out connections based on collaborative research, institutional affiliations, and social media interactions. Each statistician is profiled based on their specialty, conservatism, and temperament. Using S-PLUS or R for sophisticated network analysis, we apply models from \\"Applied statistics for the behavioral sciences\\" to determine how these traits influence the diffusion of a new statistical technique. Additionally, \\"Regression with graphics\\" can visualize the propagation of innovation across the network, while \\"Beyond ANOVA\\" provides more nuanced analyses of the variance across sub-networks. The results elucidate how specific network structures and individual traits combine to create complex patterns of innovation adoption. **2. Cross-Specialty Collaboration Dynamics:** Hypothesis: The diversity of specialties within a network of statisticians facilitates a higher level of intellectual cross-pollination, which can be quantified and predicted using combinatorial techniques. Example Study: A closed network of applied statisticians of various specialties (e.g., biostatistics, industrial statistics, environmental statistics) is monitored to observe collaborative behaviors. We use \\"Applied statistics: From bivariate through multivariate techniques\\" to analyze the multivariate relationships among the different specialties. By employing \\"Applied statistics using Stata\\" or another robust statistical software, we perform social network analysis to understand the collaborative dynamics and identify key drivers of interdisciplinary projects. Through factorial designs and interaction terms, we investigate how the unique combinations of specialties contribute to more robust findings and innovative solutions, thereby justifying the need for diversity in intellectual ecosystems. **3. Temperament Clustering and Knowledge Transfer:** Hypothesis: Statisticians' temperaments influence not just their personal work context but also the larger informational and knowledge-sharing dynamics within their network. Example Study: With a defined group of statisticians, each person is assessed for temperament using behavioral analysis methods from \\"Applied statistics for civil and environmental engineers.\\" We then apply cluster analysis techniques from \\"A first course in applied statistics\\" to identify natural groupings based on temperament and expertise. Utilizing multilevel modeling approaches (\\"Applied statistics: analysis of variance and regression\\"), the study explores how these clusters impact knowledge transfer and problem-solving within the network. Are certain temperament combinations more conducive to effective communication and peer-to-peer learning? The use of \\"Applied statistics in business and economics\\" helps to contextualize these findings within real-world team dynamics. Through these examples, we not only demonstrate the scientific rigor of Social-Combinatorial Mimesis but also its practical implications for understanding the complexities of social interactions within professional and intellectual communities. By applying cutting-edge statistical techniques to social phenomena, we open up new avenues for optimizing collaboration, innovation, and collective intellectual growth."},{"prompt":"퍼슨 오브 인터레스트 시즌3에 나오는 아서 클레이폴의 아내가 컨트롤이라는건 알아 아내로 위장 했던 사실이 폭로된 상황은 어떻게 일어난거야?","completion":"퍼슨 오브 인터레스트(Person of Interest) 시즌 3에서, 아서 클레이폴(Arthur Claypool)은 전 NSA 직원으로, 사마리탄(Samaritan)이라는 고급 감시 시스템의 개발자 중 한 명입니다. 아서 클레이폴의 \\"아내\\"가 컨트롤(Control)로 위장한 사실은 시즌 3의 여러 에피소드를 통해 조금씩 드러나며, 궁극적으로 컨트롤의 진짜 정체는 에피소드 \\"Lethe\\"와 \\"Aletheia\\"에서 밝혀집니다. 컨트롤은 미국 정부의 최고 기밀 프로그램을 총괄하는 인물로, 이 프로그램은 테러와의 전쟁에서 테러리스트를 식별하고 제거하기 위한 정보를 수집하고 처리합니다. 이때 그녀는 아서 클레이폴의 오랜 친구인 \\"다이애나\\"로 위장하여 그의 곁에 있습니다. 사실, 그녀는 사마리탄 프로젝트의 존재를 알아내고, 더 많은 정보를 얻으려는 목적으로 클레이폴에게 접근합니다. 할시온(Halcyon) 병원에서 아서와 재회한 후, 컨트롤은 아서가 롯지그룹(Lodge group) 금고에 사마리탄 서버의 위치를 기억하고 있다는 것을 알게 됩니다. 이 정보를 이용하기 위해, 그녀는 아서의 아내인 척 행세를 합니다. 하지만 존 리스(John Reese)와 해롤드 핀치(Harold Finch), 그리고 아서의 정신 건강 문제로 인해 그의 기억이 불안정하다는 점 때문에 일이 복잡해집니다. 결국, 컨트롤의 계획은 핀치와 리스에 의해 방해받고, 리스와 핀치는 아서를 안전하게 보호하려 합니다. 컨트롤의 정체가 밝혀지고 그녀가 실제로는 아서의 아내가 아님을 아는 상황은 아서, 핀치, 리스가 모두 같은 장소에 함께 있을 때 발생합니다. 에피소드 \\"Aletheia\\"에서 긴장감 넘치는 대면 후 컨트롤은 아서로부터 필요한 정보를 얻어내려 하지만, 결국 그녀의 계획은 실패로 돌아갑니다. 퍼슨 오브 인터레스트는 이렇게 복잡한 스토리 라인과 캐릭터들 간의 사기와 배신이 얽힌 드라마로, 각 에피소드를 통해 스토리가 진행되며 주요 등장인물들의 관계가 더욱 깊어집니다."},{"prompt":"As a medical biology expert, write an outline of an application for the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

我們有 一個 6萬多 人 的 社 團 我知道 你有 很多 N AS 的 社 團 N AS開 頭 大概 都是 我 創 的 主 社 團有 6 萬 多人 是從200 9年開始 差不多 大概 有多久了 14 年 左右 所以 你 總共是 3 個 社 團 不 止10 幾20個 10 幾 20 個 主 要 N AS開 頭的 後 面 也 叫 Spe cial Inter est Group N AS控制SIG 後面一大堆 像 是風 險控管 方 案、 軟 件、主 機 類的 反 正有 很多 很多 項目 網路的 因為 當初我們建設 才 發現我們 興 趣太 廣泛 對 SIG來 講 是 你 本 身的 興趣 是 你本身的興 趣 然後 我們 集 中 在一個 單 一站 台 裡面 的話 大家 會覺得太 雜 亂 它 是沒有辦法Focus 所以 我們 要 講 的 東西 很多 只 好 拆 分在 很多 社 團 我們 會引導大家 我 現在發 到另外一 邊去 有 興 趣 可以 過去 看所以我們主社團因為NAS 在 台灣 慢慢 地 就是 久 了 有一 些固 定 的 客 群 會 來 看 台灣大概 有 5 萬多人 其 他 像 是什麼馬 來 西亞、 香港 其 他各 地加 起來 可能 有 萬八人 變集這麼廣 然後 我們有一個年 會 大概 每兩年會 開一次年會 這 一次 的年會 是 在 幾 號 5 月已經 辦過了 5 月 在 中 華 電 信 板 橋 的 學 院 辦 通 常 大概 都 100 人 上 下左右 100 人上下 那 蠻多人的 就是 都對 N AS 有 興 趣 的 我們 會請群輝、QNAP、華語 廣 東內可能有 何情 或 是Ubiqu ite 這些 廠 商都 會 來 像 什麼 C- G AME、 DJ大 廠都 會 來 他們都會贊助 他們 就 負 責 辦 活 動照他們來 那因為有 社 團 有 社 團做基底 參 與人數 只 要在 台 北辦 大概都是這樣的 程度 那 其實 我覺得算 蠻 大 型的 100 多人 其實 就 我們之前參 加 過 的 一些 經銷商辦的 展 覽 是 算總 大 因為 它就是唯 一 的 一個 針 對NAS使 用者 它經營又很久 所以 我的估計是 在 這裡面 可能有 1 % 或1千 分 之一 它 是屬 於IG 的 專 業 人 士 一定 是1%以上 所以 這樣 算 一算 都會有上千人左右 對對 對 這 領域 甚 至有 很多 經銷 商代理商、夥伴 都是 這樣 所以 我們 有 時候 會 辦各 地 的 聚 會 譬 如說 北 中南 這樣子 那 我自己在 台 中 嘛 所以 我 可能 就會 找 個 地方 像 我們附 近有Mono Space 那 就是那 種聚 會的 場 所 我們 有辦到四、五十個人 是 是 是 我們 也辦過那個 台北辦的時候 台中人也在敲碗 所以 我們找人來 開 場 可能 到三、五十 個人 左右 然後 一起講 師過來 講 這是 我們的 強 項 是 講 說 關 於 資 安的 重 點 嗎 只 要 跟NAS相關 都 可以 因為 資 安 就是 網 路 啦 所以 你加 網路別 人也 會有 興趣的 是 是 是 那 當然像 硬 碟廠商 他們 也會站 出來 因為 裡面 裝 的就是 硬碟 他們 也 要增 加貨 幌率 市 展品 之 類 的 那 網路類的 廠 商 也都 會 來 所以 我們 只 要 這是 我們的 優 勢 啦 我們 不是很 會 賣 東西 的 那 種廠 商 但是 我們 有 很 好的 一個 宣 傳 平 台 所以 我們 有 辦法 一次賣 食 材 我是 蠻 懷 疑 的啦 就是 很 快 把食材消掉 我們 主要是 這個 我們有個客 戶 他是 做 有 可能的客 戶 是 他是 做自動 化設 備 他是 整 個 工 具機 可能 就 銷 售 給 客 戶 然後 bundle在上面 對 客 戶 就會 想 這個 事情 那 不 安全啊有沒有什麼問題 那 怎麼 去 監控他 其實 對於我們 已經 跟 他有約 不過 因為上 週 他們去 出 國 了 所以 這週 我等一下 約 看 能不能 約得到 跟 他 講 可能 會 講 到TER RA 那 邊 去 那 有沒有需要 我們 這邊 就是 協 助的 比如 說就是 在 針 對 TERRA 的 一些 實 際案 例 給你看 一下 因為 這個 我 大概 用 了 一 陣 子 嘛 工 程部能幫 忙 做 一些 分析 應該 算 是 大 部分 可以 解 說 其實 差異 部分就是說 我們 比較 覺得 用 那個 什麼 理論 是 C y ber K ey Chain 這種 概 念 就 整個攻 擊 流程 過程當 中 發 生 的 階段 然後 我們 PICO在哪個 地方 卡 住 了這些 關卡 然後 他進 不 來 那 這種比較 務 實 的 東西 甚 至在雲 端直接 看到 我們可以點出 就是說 現在 工 程 部 比較 辛苦啦 他們 要依 據我們的 log 去分 析 照 著業 務 要 求 寫 一個表 格 給 我們 但是 我覺得日 後 也 許可以 把它 強 化一點 因為 現在我們 有 兩個 問題 第一個 就是說 有時候找不到PICO 找 不到PICO是什麼 意思 我們 在內 網 的時候呢 你要 用10.25、4. 25、 4. 25是 嗎 還是 用 什麼IP 去 找 他 因為 我們 設計是 比較 複 雜的 有 B ridge Mode跟 R outer Mode 在 Bridge Mode的時候 他 其實IP碰 到哪裡去 你是 不知道 的 那 如果你還 沒有設 D NDS的時候 你其實找不到他 有 時候會 發現 我們 好像都聯絡 不到他的 感覺 那 時候是滿尷尬的啦 還是 說D NDS你要 先設好 然後你也要去 那 之後 你 再拿到動 態 IP 像 我們 大 部分 的 環 境 可能 重點 其實 是 用動態IP 所以 他 掛 在外 面 IP 是在 換 你 根 本 不知道要去哪裡 那 時候 又 還 沒有 設好D N DS的時候 他是 失聯的狀態 所以 我覺得 理論上 應該要有個 工 具 啦 但是 要 看RT 怎麼 去 設 計 出來啦 讓 我們隨 時隨地保 證 你找到他 像 我們帶 很多 N AS 產 品 N AS人民他 一定 內 網就會 有一個 發 廣 播風暴 的工 具 提 升社去 回 報 他們 一定會連線 連的上來 那 像 Zycel 他們 有 雲 端 他們 在 亞馬 遜租雲 端 嘛 這 設備 只 要 你 掃描 QR Code 他 會向雲端報告 加進你的組織 保 證你找到他 那 現在 我們 Pict on 呢 有 個 不穩定的點就是 他 有時候會找不到 不知道什麼原因 可能 是組 織 網路架 構 的 問題 是 找不到 找不到呢 你就 很難跟 Q R Code 解 說 當 下 的情況 是 因為 我是 第一 次 聽 到 有 這樣子的 反應 所以 我可能 要 先 跟我們 技 術 內部確 認一下 然後 我再回覆 你這個問題 因為 我們 N AS 在網路上面 待很 久 了 所以 他們 都 已經 有 很完整的機制在 回 應 根 據我的評 論 來 講 P icton算 是非常 成 熟 的產 品 你看 他的介面來 講 該 有不該有 的已經 修 得 差不多了 因為 我們 來回 反 覆 討論 過很多 次這個 故意 的 介 面 因為 已經 低限 的想 法 嘛 就 這樣 去 實現 所以 他 大概 有 80 分 左右 的 程 度 有 了 可是 說 在資安擺 坑 的地方 也 做 得 不錯 可是 就是說 他 並 沒有統 整 出來一個 百 分 比 我要 讀 完所有報告 我 還沒辦法 統計 到底 什麼 佔 多少 這個 部分 功 能其實在我們CMS中央 控管 的 後 台有 只是 因為 單 機介 面 我們 會 有一 些 取捨啦 就是 取 一些 比較 重要 的 資 訊 這樣子 但是 您這個反 應我 會再 跟內 部討 論一下 其實 這個東西 其實 讓他 他必須讓 你 分析出來 到底 發 生 什麼 事情 比較 大的威 脅 最近 百分比 是怎麼樣 但是 對 於掌 握 度就 沒有 什麼 好 我們 列出了一堆log 像 我 最近 收 集這 段收集 了500 多條 那 500 多 條我 後 續 管 理 者應該 怎麼樣 一 條 一 條 看 嘛 從 頭 到 尾 看一看 看 很多重複的 這個 重不重要 其實 他 沒有下一步的 我們 現在有那個 自 動威脅百科 的 一個 功 能 就是 我們會針 對每一個 攻擊 然後 其實 使 用 者自己點進 去看 但是 他 對於 全 體 掌控 的 概念還是比較弱 他 可以 單機 事件 去慢慢 做 像 我們 最近 累 積 500多 條 那 user 該500 多 條 慢慢 點 他 沒有升 級 性 其實現在都是在掃描據做佔了50% 那 掃 描可能就不是很嚴重 其 他可能是 嘗 試的攻 擊 就是 更危險的事情 他 沒有一個可 視 的概念出現 一個 比例圖 出來 這樣子 對 你要 管理者下一 步 要 怎麼做 他 只能看著 你有 檔的 東西很好 那 跟 病毒 軟 體 跟 方 柱 軟 體 差不多 只是說我找到了我找到了但其實user會希望到 我 是不是 要做 什麼 事情 現在 沒有 這個 百 分比 的 圖 那我們 當然 也可以 叫 我 去G V E 幫我寫 一段時事 碼我把log匯出去 這樣 做 有 問題 我 以前在 這 台是 有改過嗎 我知道 大家 寸 土 寸金 裡面 的區域 級 什麼 東西都是很重要的資源 那 另外一 方面 你可以 拋 出來 或 給user 工 具 一個 是 你 一個 雲 端 站台 CSP檔就送上去 請他幫我們畫圖就好程式又不大 或 直接 給 user一個 程 式 你就把CSP檔匯出來你可以自己畫 假 如認為自己 的 box 裡面 不 適 合再 裝東西你說衍生功能其實可以 交給管理者 客 人如果只 有一台 他 架 CSP 有點 奇怪 因為 CSP是 在商務台 上 的時候有 感覺 比較 好去管所以我覺得這個問題 可以 利用 雲端 網站你去拋CSP給他 然後幫你 產 生報表 你可以 常 常 在 更 新 你 不用 擔 心客人 更 新 的 問題 客 人 不用說 我們 每天都 要 更 新 那個 好用 的工 具來 要 不然你 工 具 就 要有 自 動 up date 的 功能要不然user要update 就 跟不到你 就 變多了 反 正你是 雲 端版 最好 user 一直 上 來要的只好匯出 所以 你把 功 能做 好 直接 上 傳匯出 都 產生出來 給 user 那你做什麼報告就做什麼報告 也 不 太 耗你的單機的 資源 因為 這些 都是 前 手 的 其 他廠 商在做 的 事情 大家都 有做 所以 我覺得他 做 到 80 分 很 可惜 但是 user 拿到 對 他來講到底 是什麼 好 處 你幫我擋 擋 了 你要說 明 你有 做 事你列出了500多條叫我看 我 大概也 看不懂 了解 因為 我們 現在 是 會 固 定 出 一個報 告 給 客 戶 我們 之後 會新 增一個 自 動 的日 報 跟週報表 但是 那個功能 目前 今年 還沒有上 可能 明 年Q 1 Q 2會 陸 續 上 來 像 在 這個雲 端 他是 2016年17 年 也是 不 斷 經 過 大家的 幹 交 攻 擊訓練 現在 就是比較完 善 所以 PIC 還 需要一點時間 但是 又 不能 拖 太 久 拖 太 久 user 就覺得 也 許 有 更 好的 方 案 像 您現在 反 映 的 狀況 其實 目前 就是 用 額 外 的方式來 補 足 但是 我們 之後 會 慢慢 的 把 這些需 求給補 上 因為 P ICO 他 真的是 目前 你 也知道價 格 實 在 太 優 惠了 要 補 足 一些功能 我們 其實 也是 要 確 認 一下 看 有沒有符 合他 現在 的一些 您 知道的 但是 基本上 有 眾多客 戶需 求的 我們 一定 會 評 估 優 先 順 序 把 他 排上 去 他的 資料 是記 在 自己 的 fl ash裡面 還是 記在雲 端 他的 日誌 他的 日 誌是 在 雲 端上 因為 我 看到 奇怪 我 換 個 地方 他 竟 然之前日誌都還在 所以 我就 很好 奇 不管 你 擔 心我 拆 掉之後 可能 就 清 掉 了 這 點在手冊 上 也 沒有記到 他的資料在放在哪裡 因為 user 會 有焦 慮 我 log去哪裡 我 這邊 也需要 好 沒 問題 像 我們放 在 樓 上 這個地方 在 做電 動IP 的 測 試 後 來我們 因為 樓 下 有 地 下 室 海底台是自己 的 官 網網 站 長 期 是 固定 的 應該 會 受 到很多累積 的攻擊 你 早 就 知道這邊 有 什麼 東西 了 所以 我 故意 移基 地到地下室去 果 然是有一 些不同 的 類 別 會 出 現 我 都記 下來的時候我會再去分析看看 或 是 寄 給 義中或 是 N esham 沒問題 這邊 我的 想法是 說 我 本來 是 想 說 是不是 有 一個 P OC 的 概 念 因為 我們的 會員很多 6 萬 多 人 台 中 少 說 也是 數 千人 在 這個 地方 一定 也 有 業主 就是 高 階 經理人 我是 可以 辦一些活動 就是 每家可能 輪 流擺個 一個 禮 拜 兩個 禮拜 之 類 的 如果 多條我就 灑 多一點 一次 就做 完 要 不然 就 知道 一 帶才慢慢 輪 三 天我就可以抓到什麼 東西 通 常放 個 一週 兩週 是 比較合理的 那 可能 就 這樣 一 路 做 下去 這樣 的話可能 就會 遇 到 因為這 反饋 是比較實 在 的 我是 社 團管理 員 我 通 常 要 保持 中 立 的 角 色 不 可以 開過 業配 的 概念 我 業 配太兇了 人 家說你是 這 要說明白 講清楚 我 講的還 不見 得 是 我沒辦法 我 沒辦法放 在 一個 資安 或 網路的 社 群 裡面 我 已經在 目 的推了 我們的 那個 那時他們有進去 他們 知道 在推 我 會把導 引 到主社團 這邊 來 讓 大家回去 參 考 我們 做 了 一些紀錄報告 是 是 是 但是 這種 東西很像賣保險 都 說是賣 保 險賣保險讓人家看到 他 出 現的感覺 讓 他沒有什麼神客 體 驗 所以 像我們 這個 客 人 是 緊 急 的遇到狀況 我們就繳了十幾萬 不 甘 心 所以 得要防堵 一下 對 一般用者來 講 沒差 今天 在種我也 不知道 對 所以 這個 東西 以 價格來 講 我們 這個 東西 是 划 算 的 它 那三 年這樣的 授權 是 OK 沒有 問題 對的 然後 產 品 本 身 也 到了 80分 左右的 程 度 剩 下一些小 問題 修 一下 或 爆表 之 類 的 那 我想給 它 一點 時間 會 做到 但是 user 沒有這個 聯 想 基本 的概 念 對 所以我覺得 POC是 比較就直接讓它 感 受一下 我們 帶過去讓 它 B-ROM 那 這樣比較 有 機會 產 生一些 user的 直接 反 饋 對 於 RD那 邊 講 也是好事對 它會知道該user是怎麼 中 小企業組 怎麼 想 這個事情 是是是 那 此 外就是 我們 剛 才 講 的 工 具 機 整 組 出場 的 如果 有 辦法說服 他們 的話 那 他們 的 單 價 夠 高 高 的 可以 cover 住 的話 或 給 他們Spe cial Price 大概 會 一次 買 10套什麼之 類的 那 我也很開心 但是 還 沒有 談不知道 他 之前 就有提 過這類的資安問題 他 在 想怎樣 讓 他的 業 主 感到安心 只是 那邊 在 他的 焦 慮程 度 怎麼樣 業 主的焦 慮程 度 怎麼樣 其實 他們 的這些 資 安的 一些 知識就是 需要 像 您這樣的 進 小商 透 過您那些 專 業 的社 團 或 是什麼 就是 耳 提 面面的 跟 他們 做 一些提 點 或 是分享一些 之前 發 生過的 案例 給 他們 知道 這樣 因為 通 常 人都是 這樣 就是發生了 我 才 知道 要去 做 這 件事情 真的 就 跟 保險 一樣 我 買 保險 可是 我 平 常沒有 發 生 事情 沒有受到理 賠 的時候 我 根本就 不會 覺得保險很重要 對 那 我 發 生 了 我 理 賠 它 我 才知道 我 應該要增 加 保 險的 確 是 這樣的 那 天我們 有 去 沙侖 有 個資 安 會議 有 一個女生 她 不是PM吧 她是什麼 你說 我們 公 司嗎 對 行銷 W innie 她 是什麼行銷 因為 她 以前 也 在 這 兒 拍 過 所以 算 是 學 妹學 長 有 聊一下 對 那她好像 負 責這些 行 銷相 關 事 件 對 那 她 是 怎麼樣 去 我就 想要 一點 就是說 因為 這東西 不好形 容 可是 R D 明 明這麼努力 鍛煉了這麼久 但 他們跟 外 面沒有 窗 口 所以 我覺得需要 可能 的話 例 如 像 做 專 訪 像 以前我 去 訪 問Q N AP的董 事 長 或 是 華語 那邊 的PM 或 是車 卡 司的協 理 我有 去拜 訪 做 專訪 我 來整理一 段 她 允許拍 照 的 狀 況下 可以 做一些 摘 要 這是 一個方 法 會 提 高她的知名度 再來 就是說 R D 其實應該 接 受 R D或PM要 接 受 一些訪談 影 像 的訪 談去剪接一下 就是 那 種 病毒來 攻擊 我是怎麼防的 它 如果 不 防 會 發 生 什麼 事情 這些 東西 看 不到 所以 需要它 去 做 演 練 直接 在畫 面 上呈 現出來 那種東西 那 往往在上 有一 兩 則那種東西 但 有 者 不見 得 看得懂 或者 說 這些 東西 需要 科 普 的 說 明 就 像我們 講的 Cyber QoChain 它 是怎樣東西 它 值得做 這種 影片介 紹 然後 Picto 在什麼 位置 攔 住了 這個 事 件 我們 可以 看一下影片 VCR 在 這邊 的時候 發 生 什麼 事情 要 不然 User 是沒有 辦法 理 解 我 買一個盒子 U ser 價是14900 到底 我 買 到什麼 其實 我們 You Tube有一 些 介 紹 影片 你有 看 過嗎 有 但是 我覺得可以 再 再 更 深入一點 再 科普 一點 之前 有 一個 是 勞 動 部 還是 什麼 他們 有 來 幫 我們 公 司 就是 拍過 專 訪 對 如果 您需要 的話 那個 連 結我 到 時候 再 傳 給 你看 看 看 有沒有您 這邊 可以 立 即 需要 用 到 的 部分 這樣子 每 個 社團它 都有 自己 的 次文化 所以 我覺得 我們 在這 社 團 待久了 大概 知道 U ser 他們接受 什麼樣的訊 息或 內容 等 於是 一個管道 對 所以 我覺得 可能 的話 例 如 像Roll Show R oll Show 我們 不好 表現是 因為 拿出去 外 面又 沒有 供 給 它 還有 時間 要 等 我要 怎麼 跟我們的聽眾說 它 是怎麼樣的 有 效 這是 我覺得很 頭痛 的地方 我 沒有辦法 所以 它 是 稍 微供給 它 有天生 的 需 求 要 不然 很 難 P ush 這個 產品 它 明 明 就是我 講的產 品 有 80 分 價 格是OK 的 談 到三年來 看 怎樣 都是 划算 你 只要有數十台電 腦 裝 置設 備都是很 合 理的 再 加 上 Firework給 的資安的授權 費 用 其實 是 高 的 每 年 可能 都要萬八 塊 左右 好 幾 千 以上 所以 各 種條 件都 符 合 我們的 站 位置 是 沒有 錯 現在 只是 它 是 個 無 形 的 東西 我 怎樣 在 R oll Show 我在 演 出設施 上 已經 幫 了 很多 次 人 不 太會 幫 忙 寫 但是 不 具象 那 我 做Roll Show憑 我 自己 我是 沒有 辦法 講 出 R D面對 到什麼樣的困難 或 攻擊 很多案例 然後 又 回到 可 普 到 C yber Kio Chain這個 概 念 來 講 它 在什麼地方 發 揮 了效 果 它 如果不這樣會 發 生什麼事情 後 面還有 一些 什麼 你說 那個 C yber K io Chain 是 它是一個概念 C - Y- B -E - R C yber Kio Chain K - I-L K - I -L C -H -A-I- N 就是 它 先偵測 然後 它 發 生攻擊 然後 滲 透進 去 之後 去 最 高 的 權限 開始 做一些 壞 事 然後 再聯絡外界 更 多 援軍 進 來 扣 掉它的 戰果 最後 把 自己 清 除 掉 之 類 的 所以 它 是 一 整 串 的 C yber K io Chain 這個 概 念 它 講 資 安都會講到這個 概 念 那 照 樣 對U ser來講就 知道說 我在 哪個地方其實 是 很 缺 然後 P ico 幫 助 我 把 東西 給 視 覺 化 了 那 我 可以 很清楚知道 它 就 躺下來了 它再也回不來 好像 D NS受到污染也會發 生一些狀 況 所以 把DNS抓 住了 這些 壞 的 軟體 就 算 是你 中了你都聯絡不到 外 界 回來 因為 它 不可能是 固定IP 因為 是一個動 態的 在 變 動 的 一個 二 一 層 是躲 在外面 所以 它靠D NS去 解析 那 如果 再中 間把它 攔住 它根本聯絡不出去 也回不來 那 像我們還有一堆客 人 抱怨 買 了這個 業主 垃 圾郵 件沒擋 Ant i- Sp am的 這個 部分 目前 我們的 確 沒有 規 劃 在這個 產 品 內 因為 Go ogle Mail跟 OP 36 它 本身的 一個 郵 件掃描 機 是 做 得 比 我們 更 好 所以 這個 垃 圾 郵 件 部分 目前 還沒有 客 人一 提 我想 最後 好像這 部分沒有 講 到 但是 在銷 售 的時候 客 人會 以 為 我 買 了萬 能 的 設備 他 會 這樣錯 覺 我 還吹 過 頭了 他 就以為應該什麼都要擋 所以 變成我們 銷 售過才知道 客 人有反饋 我們才 知道 這樣是一個問題 那 這樣怎麼 去補 呢 我 只能說客 人 要 先 跟 他的 沒有 設備的 主 機的廠 商聯繫 看看 有沒有 啟 動這個 功 能 幫 忙攔一下 因為 客人收到一天 半 小時 來 一封 一直 在 威 脅他 我說 你的 什麼 什麼什麼 命運資料外洩 不 給我比 特幣 我就 把你全部 控告出去 幹嘛的 那 是很 典型的詐騙 可是 業 主就是 會 擔 心嘛 明 明就是 很簡單 只要你有email戒指 他 可以不斷 的 寄 這個信 給 你 就 這樣子而已 可是 產 生威脅感 他 就反過來對 我們 產 品 你們 怎麼擋 不 住 不 然 產生 這種疑 問 出來 是這樣 目前 垃 圾郵 件 部分確 實 還 沒有 沒 辦法擋 但是 因為 我們的 資 安 功 能 它 其實是 會 針 對裡面 的 一些 惡意連結 跟 有 病毒的附件 是 有 阻擋 功 能 的 所以 看 能 不能就是 利 用這個 資 安 功 能 的 部分 去 加強跟客戶 做說明 即 便他們 點進去 這種 郵 件 他們 也不 需要擔 心 會 中毒 它 給 只是一 串 的號碼 它 只要你轉比特幣 給 他而已 這 幾個那 種付款的網站 其實 也是 安全 的 也 算是安全的 你 不能說不 讓 人 家 說 比 特 幣買 賣 那個 連結你 大概 擋 不住 它 不是什麼 惡意 網 站 它 只要你 轉 帳過去 所以 那種風信看 起來 滲 透 是 成 功的 但是 我們也 不會 抓 到 它 可是 要 分 析 整 個 文 本內容 找 出可疑 的點 那 需要 分析 整 個 text 那 可能不是 我們 這種 小 型機 器 去做的事情 這 可以理解 可是 User看到 什麼 DP I 什麼 深層什麼 風 暴 上 好像 很厲害的 樣 子 他 可能甚 至 我 可能都 以 為 怎麼 會 沒有 在裡面 呢 但是 這些 是 屬 於 我們 在銷 售 或 是 在 科 普的時候 一些 盲 點也 要 讓客人 知道 所以 我才覺得說 要 怎樣 做 轉 訪 或 是 R D 或PM E 出來 跟 我們 User 面對 面 聊 一些 做Q&A嘛 長期 問題應該 也 累 積 很多了 但是只是說 針 對 不同的 課 程、課群 他們 的疑 點其實是 不 一樣 那 PME或 是 RD代表 R D 出來 有 時候比較 det ail的可以稍 微回憶 一下 PM E 代 表 R D 這樣子 或 是S ER S看 要不要來 這樣 就可以多 辦幾 場 就 有 辦法收 集 到User 的反饋 那 你們就駕 驚 救贖 的趕快 回去 改 那 因為改要 支 援 啊 那我們 也 不是 很 確 定 Le onik對 於 PICO 要投入多少資源 我們 只能假 設 你們 願 意 修 我們 當然 願 意 我們 都很密集的 把 他的Re lease Note變 更 像 Y an's Eye S ight 我很 滿意 他 他 對很多老 設 備都 持 續 的 P atch 持續的修補 持續的出Frame位 我們 就 覺得 這家 公司是佛心來著 願 意 不斷 的這樣做 那 像Intel 最近 出 一個 顯 卡 也是 一樣 初 期的BI OSD river 寫 得太 爛 可是 他很 密集的出發、修 補 結果 所有 的 You T uber 或 是 說有 影 響 力的人 真的 不斷的在改善 那 他 看 起來就是願 意 投 資 源 忙 起來在 做 可是 最近他的 動 作 又 開始 變 慢、 變 緩 你就 會猜 Resource 也 有 轉 移了 所以 這 東西 是 U ser 是敏感 的 看 你的 Frame位更 新 日 期 還有 你做 了 哪 些 修正 就 知道 公 司 對 他 投 入 多少 我們 來自於原廠嘛 所以 這些我們 都清楚 不要 掉出來看 那 真的有要 投 入、要 彰 顯這 一點 Re lease Note裡面 要 很 清楚 的出現 我們 做了什麼改 善 U ser感 覺得 到 有 改善 像 修 漏洞 啊 修 漏 洞是大家都在做 那 功能的 改 善 多 久 會 來 一個 更 新 像 群輝以前 常 常出 除了大家很累 他 後來 就改了一 年一出 大概 吧 但是 一定要 改 出 東西來 讓 客戶 才會覺得 真的 有在做事情 平 常 的 改 客 戶 說這次叫我當小白老鼠 很 害怕 嘛 只有 忠 誠的客戶 熱 情 的客 戶才會 毛起來 然後 我就修 我就 去 把它 Update 上 來 就 很像蘋 果 新 機 出來 的時候 是啊, 有 些人會毛 起來 反差一點 其實 這 點我覺得 您 是可以 放心的 因為 我們 Lionic 其 中 一個 優 勢 就是 我們的 反 應非常的 快 而且 我們 Re lease 其實 每 一版 幾 乎 都是有對功 能做 一些 改 動 的 或者 是 新 增 不是 單單只 有一些小 Bug的 修 理 當然 如果 客 戶 有 立 即 反 應 B ug 我們 也是立即馬 上 處 理 的 所以 這 點我 可以 跟你P rom ise 因為 我們 其 他 經 銷 商 就是 看重我們這 一點 而且 非常 願 意 跟我們 合 作 的 其 中 一個 原因 也是 因為 這 一點 對, 那 當然 CP 值 很高 那 是 其 中 一個 啦 對, 所以 這 點你 不用 擔 心 然後 另外就是 您 這邊 如果 也要辦 任 何 研 討會 或 是年會 或 是 等等 的活動 我們 這邊也 都 很 願 意 積 極 的配 合 那 行銷 這個部分 就是 我們Win ny 是 聯 絡窗口嘛 那 當然我這邊 也會 參 與 就是 如果你到時候需要 像 是 PM 或是RD 我們 都可以,都是 可以 配 合 的 對, 甚 至 我們 也可以 贊 助 一些 小 小 的 抽 獎 活動 的獎品 對, 這些 都是 我們 都是會 配 合 的 啦 對, 這你不用擔心 因為 我們有 其 他 經 銷 商 也 都可以 配合 通 常 出來的時間假 日 行 嗎 可以啊 就是 我們 事 先 說 好的 話 因為 我怕辦 在 平 日 可能 大家不 見得 出 得 來 我 可以理 解 啦 因為 假日大家 休 假嘛 比較 願意 來參 加 這種活 動 啦 參 與 率可能 會 高 一點 對, 可以 啊 就是 如果 事 先 安 排好 你 先 聽先跟 我們說 我們 是 可以 出 這一 份 人 力 的 現在 問題就是 在於說 怎麼 表達我 沒有 看過 我 沒有看過R D 或 是 PM 他們 怎麼 去表達這個 產品 其實 我們 出去 我們 會統 一 就是 用 比較 口 語化的 方 式 跟 user 來表 達 這個東西 因為 我們 不知道 我們 對 方 的 user 他 對 於 這個 know - how 是 理 解 的 多 深 入 這樣子 那 像 我們 近 期 我們 會 說 比如 說我們 舉 一些 影片 啊 比如 說 像C IS的 一個 C yber的影片啊 就是說 有 間 諜就是 植 入 一些二 一程 式到 裡面 然後 他就可以害 到 那個 比如 說 一些 那個 什麼 大 眾 運輸 的系統 那 這大眾運輸 運 動他害進去之後 他 甚至最後 可能 是 會 導 致 人 命 的 發生 嘛 因為 是 國外有一 些 間 諜 的 部分 這樣 不 然 就是說 像 之前 那個 侏 羅 紀公園 大家 可能都 看過 去 年有 一個 去 年的影集是 說 裡面 有一個胖子 他 就是透 過害 入 他們 自 家 的 那個 電 腦 程式嘛 然後 導 致 說 他們 整 個 停 電系統 就停 電 了 那 為什麼會 發 生 這種 事情 如果 我們 當 時 有擺 P ico 在 那 邊 是不是 他 就 沒 辦法 任 意 輸 入一些 程 式 導致 停 電系統 就 用這邊 比較口語化 的 例 子 讓 他們可以 立 即 了 解 說 治 安 的 一個 重要 性 還有 我們 P ico 重要性 那 另外就是 我們 老闆 常常在 說 P ico它 其實 就 像 濾 水器一樣 就是 幫 你 濾 掉一些 東西 但是又 不 影響 你 後 面 的 一些 功能這樣子 然後 再來 就是 我們 會舉一些 我們 實際成功的案 例 對 像 是 台 積 電 就是 另外的 嘛 你 可能就是 在 2019 的那個US B啦 其實 US B 是 我們 常 常 會 忽略的一個 破孔 因為 你有 時候 像 我在 外 面 我 如果 這 台 沒 辦法連 線 我 需要 US B就是 傳 檔案 給 您看 嘛 或什麼 那 如果我 拿 的是 一個 有 病 毒的US B 呢 那 我是不是馬 上 就 透過這個 傳 染 感 染 了 那 如果 我 當 時 又 透過VPN連 線 到 內 部 呢 那 我病毒是不是 就 透 過 VPN 感 染到 企 業 內 部 的 東西 然後 進而 它 可能 去 感 染 比較 重要的部門 像 RD 的 部分 或 是 財 塊的部分 這樣子 對 那 另外 就是說 其實 我們 有 發現 有 安裝 P ico之後 客戶才發現 原 來它的一些 設 備 像 N AS 它 一直 被 當 作 一個 V D OS 攻 擊 的 一個跳 板 可是 它在裝之前 它 其實並 不知道 這件事情 對 所以 也是 加 裝了之後我們 才 會 知道 而且 現在 一直 在 主 打 零 信 任 什麼 叫 做 零 信任 不是 說 你 安裝的 電 腦 軟 體的 防 毒 就可以了 因為 它就是 只 防 你 每 一台電腦而已嘛 但是 你 只有 各 台 電 腦 中毒之後 那 你其他的設 備 你就 不管它 了 嘛 對啊 所以 其實 P ico 加 裝 在 前面 中 端設 備 前 面 其實 就是 防 止 一個橫 向 的 感 染 對 嘛 因為 像 一些 比較 中小企業的規模 它 不 可能拉 太 多線嘛 它 一定 是內網 就 一條線就是 可以 連 到 其 他 部 門 大概 都同 一 條內 網 那 這樣子如果 我 這邊 感 染 我 另外一邊也中 毒了 怎麼辦 橫 向 的 這個 操作 所以 其實P ico 就是 在 這邊做一個阻擋 可能 就是感 染 到 一個 不 太重要的電 腦設 備 但是 我 保 護了 其 他 更 重要部門的東西 了 對 那 這是 端點的部分 那 VPN 就是 像 我 剛剛 說 的 就是 防止 我們 現在 疫 情 的關係嘛 大家都 在 家 做 遠 端 工作 這樣子 所以 可以 做 一個 這樣子 的VPN 防 護 那 再來就是 前 端 啊 區 域 防 護 就是 我像 剛剛說 的 可以 放在防 火牆 的前 面 因為 其實現在 每 個企 業 基本 上都有加裝 防火牆啦 對啊 所以 我們 也 不要 跟 他說 我 就是 要 你 取 代 掉 那一台沒有 我們 就是請 你 放 在 防 火 牆 的 前 面 讓 我們的 P ico 的 Sec urity的 功能 去 幫你 做 保 護 但是 我不 影 響 你 後 面 那 台 設 備 的 其 他剩 下 路 由 的 所有 功 能 這樣子 對啊 要 是我 去 講 的話 要 是我 籌 措 這樣子 一個 討 論U ser 會議 的話 我會這樣做 我 第一個會 講 這個 K. O. Ch ain 在 做 什麼 然後 它 是 一個 Fire wall以 外的 保 護 層強 化 它 有 某 些 好 處 可能 拉 到最後 面 再 去 做 增 加 它的 採購 的現場採購 音 樂 那 原廠 這邊 來 可能 要 講 一下 P ico的工作 原理 大家 會覺得會 好奇 它到底怎麼運作 像 你 講的 FIL TER這部分 也是 它 只 要能夠掃 描 但是它會通過 這 屬 於 研 發 的小故事 它 刻 薄 一些 什麼 東西 可以 稍 微 帶 一下 U ser 就會原來 是這樣 它 不會阻 礙我的東西 我說 下一 部分 U ser說 我的網 路 速 度 內 網 要達 到 1000M 這 只到600 M 的效果 我是 不能 接受 的 下 一個 什麼 時候 會 出來 它 會 開始 期待 PM 也上 來 講 後 面可能 就是 C ast Study 有 些 實際案例 會依據User 的反饋 最後 可能講一些 我們 衍 生 的後續分析 處理 建 議這些 操作 到底要怎麼完成 因為 最後就是 落 實到 你 抓到東西 我們 大概 出 現過 幾 種 處 理 後 續的監 修章 我們 Pico要 怎麼 去 下一 版會 怎麼樣去 R OMAM P 會 怎麼 去 加 東西 大家 有所期 待 我們 最後 規 節出來 把它 好 處講出來 各 種好處 我們 都知道 現 場我們 可能 定 義 最 好是IT 組 或 是 業 主 過來聽 他們 針 對幾 個 財 損的 風 險 讓 一些考 慮 會比較敏感 所以 我們整 套 這樣 講的時候 他的 理 解的 盲 點 就會 少 得比較 空 他會看到他 他 有 聽過原廠 講 他是 怎麼 工作的 也 聽過 我們講 他們 應該很多 人也很熟 但是 我們 是 加 強 他的 印 象 P ico 在哪裡看他什麼位置 後 面我們 會 請 PM 或 R TI 繼續 做 一些 Q A分享 我們 講的 剛剛 很 粗 略 只是 講同事 而已 這樣 大概 是我 規 劃 的話 會 是這樣場 地的 內容 我覺得 這樣蠻 完 整 的 北 中南 都 可以 講 看 是 業 務 還是 PM 幫 忙 業 務 出來 秀 一下 現 場 採 購 馬 上 就 社 團優 惠 價格 就 出 現 了 只 要不 妨 礙市 場 資 訊 太多 單 次就 限量幾 台而已 這 可能 都是 一些 不錯 的 賣點 因為 他如果心動了 他早就已經想買了 他 現場就會簽 或 是 給 他 兩 三 天 內 有 效 他 考慮一下還是 會 採購 因為 他 沒 辦法說服 不要 買 這個 東西 我們 千萬 把他的 疑 點先掃 掉 好 處 也 講 清楚 面 對 威 脅也 讓 他 看到 這 攻防戰也 出 現 過 因為 我們 現在 對 他來說 他 擋過很多東西 是 我不知道的那這很可惜 就是 PM 並 沒有 把 他 弄 出來 我們 會針對哪 些東西 哪 類別的東西 我們 做 了 一些努 力 因為 承 諾 的太空泛的感覺 你 寫 這麼 全 面 總是有邊有際 你 不可能通 通 包 起來 我們 主 要做 到 的 事項能夠滿足他的 消 除他的疑 慮 就好 有 實 力 證明說 例 如我們的 抓 到什麼 東西 像 我們說 連續 登錄30 秒 連 續登 錄多少次 這個 不知 不覺在內網 發 生 沒有 我們這個價 錢 不知道 然後 說 P ico 怎麼 不 放 是 放在 一群 Ser ver 前 面 還是放在NAR 每個設備都要裝一台 這 也是一種方法 你 只要 確定 他不會 橫 向感 他們 在 同 一個 Sw itch 是 可以 接 受 的 這樣 可以 幫 他們省錢 小 企 業 喜歡 省錢 到 時候 真的不行 發現他好用他就在之前 每 一台 真的都加一個 他 就覺得 接 受 到 時候 又 出 現一個 團 購 方 案 或 是合購一次 買多少 他 可以 慢慢出來 一直出來利多效性 我們 現在 也 還有 出 一個 新 功 能 叫 地 理 封鎖 不知道 你有沒有 玩 過 這個 功 能 我是 沒有 去用 到 它 我覺得 這個 也是 一個 可以 講的點 因為 現在 有 很多 就是 中國 那 邊 來 的 一些 IP 的 一些 攻擊 我們 這個功 能 就是 可以 針 對 國家性的 地 區 來 做 一個 阻擋比如說我今天 我 就是不希望中國 那 邊的 IP 進來 我就 直接 進 去 我們的 GU I 就是 設 定 中國 阻 擋這樣子就好 而且 我們 不是 都 只有 雙向的 我們 是可以 比如 說 阻 擋 他 有 方向 性 的 對 進 來 但是 我們 可以 出去 這 點 我們 在 一個 我們 有案 例 可以 講 我們 有 一個 U ser 是沒有 S ER VER操 作 工 具 就會來特定國家 但是 有點 麻煩 U ser 有 時候 他 做 外貿 他 真的不能 夠斷 掉那個 國家 要 不然 到 時候 還 不好 查 到底 那個 性 不 見 了 是 誰 幹 的 我們要回盤查 所以 那個是雙 面刃 他 如果做 台灣 或 是 指 定 國家 那 是真的是 很 奇怪 的 事情 像 我們網 站 基本 上 做台灣的 99. 9 % 不太會做國外 所以 我 放 這 GLIP的 東西 是 合 理的 有 些單位做 國 貿 的 不行 但是 有 幫 助 可是 就是說 後 面 就會 顯 出 大 量LOG不是人 類 想看的 大家 想知道我該做什麼 我 正 受 到 什麼 攻 擊 我要 怎麼 強 化 他 下一 步 的 建 議 那 大概 就 又 沒有 敏感度 LO G 收到之後 就 麻木了 無感 要 怎樣攻擊 都 沒有感覺 那 可能P ICO 都 說 Le on ick要想想看 後 面 這 段 是不是 類 似CH AT GP之類的東西 我 C SP 丟 上 去 他會給出一個建議 不管 是 工 人 智 慧 還是 人 工智 慧 工 程部門拼 命 在後面假 裝 做 一件事情反 饋 回來給個建 議 罐 頭建 議也好 或是 說 真的 有 針 對他的內 容 人 家 會 有 感覺 要 不 然 現在 LOG出來 已經 有第一 步了 已經有百科了 但是 User沒有立即 的 風險敏 感度 而且 是 一個 C rit ical的 還是 Medium還是 High 或 是他是一個進攻的前奏 快 要 爆了 不知道 那 擋 在 前面最 好 P ICO 是萬能的完全 過 濾掉 還是 他 其實可以做 一些 什麼 事情 這些 東西 沒有 關 聯 性 有點 鍛 鍊的感覺 在 就是 像 我 剛剛 說 的 我們 現在 有 每 日 每 週 的 一個 自動生成報表 他 就是會 固定寄給 就是 你 只 要 Key 好 你要 收 的 信 箱 我們 就會寄 給 他 那 就是 可以 在 裡面 就是 做一些 重 點程 度的 說明 或 是說 你 收 到 你 這個 禮拜 或者 是今天 你 收 到 這樣 攻 擊 你 應該如何 處 理 的 一些對 應的說法 是 有 那 另外 就是 我們 有 一個 L INE 通 知 有 我 有在 聽 對 我 覺得 L INE 通 知 目前 業 界 沒有 這 點我們 可以 說 目前 業 界 沒有 那我們 可以 針 對L INE的回應 就是 看 因為 我們 現在都 拿 LINE 比較快 看 就是 如果收 到 這個 警 示 這個 攻擊 他的 重要程度是幾 比如 說1到5是 3 還是 1 還是 怎麼樣 那 需不需要 針對 這個 做 一些 特別 的 處 理 我覺得 這 都是 可以 就是 因為 已經 是現 場功 能 了 都是可以 再做 一些 格 式的 修正等等 的 可能 就是FAE 的 功 能 就是說 FA E 他可能 會 提 到 一些 說 我們在安裝 設 定 有 些 很好 用 的功 能 他 就做提 點 出來在這個整個議程裡面 是 大家 會 對他 加分 這 真的很好用 很實用 那 整 體 的好 感度 會 繼續 上 升 我覺得就是 比 方是 FAE 在講use case 這種狀況 去 做 一些 好 用 的 點 的 提 示 因為 PMR D 或 是FAE各 有 各 的職長 他們 把他的領域 講清楚 然後 user就對 他 了 解 會 變得越來越全 面性 然後 買 不 買只 剩 下 口 袋有沒有 錢 而已 對 呀 對呀 單 買就 買 通 常就是推他一把嘛 價 格 折 扣就 出 現 了 而且 還現實 就 省 錢啊 趕 快決 定 啊 行 動你 附近的 金 銷商 反 正就是 跟方 便 網通 講 去 採 購啦 或 是 拿現場 購物沒關係 現 場購物 比較貴啊 一 萬 四 千 一 九 幹嘛 這 都是 可以 拿 來做 操 作的 部分 然後 像 您 剛剛說 的 我們 PICO 的一個阻 擋偵 測流 程 其實 我們 有 一個圖你應該沒有看過 這是 我們請 我們的 設計師設計的 他是 一個 比較可愛 簡 易 理 解 的 就是 從 P ICO 他送 進 去 之後 解 析 封包 然後 怎麼樣 阻 擋 掃 描 然後 產 出 的 一些報表 然後 他 最後 會 做 什麼 樣 的 記 錄 這樣 通 知 而且 我們 有 把 這個 流 程 表 其實 印 在我們的 那個 一個 帆 布袋 上面 對 那 到 時候 可能 就是 參 加一些研討活 動 的時候 我們 會 提 供這樣的 帆布袋 就是 做 一個贊 助 的禮 品這樣子 因為 這個 其實 蠻 簡 易明 瞭 的啦 就是 連 我們 一般 用戶 都可以 看 得 懂 的 一個 過程這樣子 不過 反 而 是 IT或是企業主管 他們 IT 或 企 業主 管 他們 敏 感 度 比較 高 然後 他們 也 經 過 一些 產 具 的 教 訓 他們 會知道 很多的 漏洞或 弱點其實是在哪裡 所以 他們不會 被 一 般的 圖 解說 服 他們 會提出他想知道的那個部分 沒有 問題 啊會很尖銳的 所以 我變成 這 張可能 提 早可以提供給User 他們 會在上面畫 出很多意見 這邊 這邊 這邊我 什麼的想法 他們 可能 預 先 可以 先 準備好題目 可以 啊 可以 啊 他們 可以準備一個 表 單 你想 要 了 解 什麼想要去問什麼東西 那 這樣 到 時候PM 手上 就 有一張單 子對對對 或 是 跟 RT可以研究一下 等一下 怎麼去表 達這個比較好可以啊可以啊 所以 這種點就是 像 U ser這樣子 的 反 應 其實 也是我們需要的 啦 因為 我們 需要 收 集 很多 使 用 者 的 一些 反饋 啊對啊 就是 工 廠 跟 公 司 有 時候 是 自己 的 觀點 對對 對 但是 東西 是要 賣 到 U ser心 坎裡去 嗯 嗯 嗯 所以 U ser說 的 U ser 要的才是 重點 你 寫 了 很多 他 以 為你他 要的 可是 他 不要 對 那 你 就是 工 夫花 得 比較 願 望 一點 是 是 是是 所以 我覺得 這種預 先 讓 他們 提問 提 供 這樣的 表格 讓他們大家來找查 你想要問的 趕 快問喔 趁 這個 時候原廠會來喔 大家 有機會 對 面 對面交流嗯 所以 我們 大概 就是 像 是 PM、 R T跟 FA E啦 因為 他們角色不 一樣 有 些人 專 精 緻的 角 色 他 有沒有辦法跨 你說 FAE 的事情 是 PM也 能做RT也能做 那 帶 兩個人 來就好 還是 PM 太 萬 能 他 一個人 他 都 cover 住了三個角色他都可以handle 那 他 來 就 好了我不知道到時候 要 不然 他是帶 回去再 研究 再回答對方 大概就是這樣可以啊 當然 我們 到 時候 看 是 怎麼樣 情況 怎麼樣 的人我們 都 可以 配 合 啦 這 部分 就是 你不用 難行 因為 我們 已經 有 跟 其 他 經 銷 商 配 合過很多 這種 活 動 了 甚 至我們 那個 沙 崙 那邊 嘛 常 常 辦活 動 我們都有 去 參 加 只 差沒有 在那 邊 註 點而已啦 因為那邊 本 來 就有擺 我們的東西 那 是 像半 導 體展 我們 有跟工 業 院 S ep h ase 那 邊 合作 那 像那個資 安展S eph asec 我們 就是近 兩年 都有 去 參加 因為 所有 硬體 產 品 以 後 我們 需要曝 光度對啊 對對 對 都 會 參 加 因為 賣 這個授 權是根 本 的 事情 對 對 對 基本 的 這個 獲 利來 源 然後 但是賣 到中小企 業端 的時候 變成UI 使 用者反 饋變 成是 更 為 重要 那 這邊什麼 強 化 大概 就是 靠這種Use反饋 第一 線 的 東西 這是 我們很需要 的 會 比較快 那加上如果說 Le on X這邊 的 資 訊 有擺 進來 反 映 在 你的Rest ore 裡面 的每次的改變 User有看到 也是 持 續 在進 行的 對 經 營 商來講會 覺得 說 服 力比較 高 U ser 也 覺得說 服 力 比較 高 但是 這邊需要 行 銷 的 幫 忙 要 展 現 出來 我們 不 斷的 在 進 化再 改善 像 我們之前拿 到的 貨 大中那邊出來 漢 南那 邊的 貨 分 為 是1. 2. 300 很舊 我 拿到嚇 掉 先 趕快先更 新 再講 還有 什麼 扣 押 更 新 那 沒辦法扣 很 久 總 之 這些東西 變 化 都 存在 成 長 改 進 都 要 讓 U ser看到 那 行銷 那邊 可能 就要 多 利 用 像 我們 這種管道 或 是 其 他各 種 想 出來 的 東西 去 做 我們 很 需要 你們 這種 管 道 因為 現場我們 就是 這麼 多 人 在 台 北 開一定 會 滿 熱鬧 的 台中開 台 南市 原區 你們 要不要上來 我 也是 台 中人其實 你是 哪 邊 我就 北 區 我就 附近 那 你 很熟是不是 對 只是 因為我 現在在 新 竹 那邊 因為 我 公 司 在 新竹 我在 那邊住 這樣子 今天 可以 回來 看一下 等一下 很多 點要跑 對 所以 今天 就是 來 跟你 大概 了 解一下 也 就是 希望 說 就是 未 來 您 的 這個 管 道 看 能 不能 就是 幫 我們 一直 轉 發 我們 自己的一些行 銷 的發文 因為 我們 也 有 在 做FB 我們 有個 社 團是萬事找社員對 萬 事 找 社 員 就是 它 是 一個 萬 事 屋的 概念 因為 當 時 我們 主 社 團 裡面 就 很多人想 賣 東西 可是 很多 人 不 想 看 賣 東西 的 東西 他們 想要看到技 術 分享 討 論所以我們就另外開個萬事找社員 這個 臉書 社 團 它 必須 是 主 社團的社員 可能 要 過 一段時間 參 與 之後 才 准 它 加入 萬事找 是 它 可以在那 邊 努 力的賣東西 你 只要 不妨 礙 什麼 善良 風 俗 隨 便你賣 你要 在 那 邊 拼命的PO廣 告 但是 看 的人 呢 看 還不少 因為 那邊 專業 的喔 那 邊有專業的 Sw itch 專 業 的Firewall 專 業的 什麼 AP 通 通都是 專 業 人士 在那邊 因為 很多 環 保 回 收 商 都 在那邊大 量 的在 賣 有 些人是 自己 的 設 備 太多了 要 淘汰了 整 批 整批的賣 其實 那 邊 反 而 是 專 業 的 地 區 那可以幫我們 就是 找 進去 你們 自己 揪 銀 進去 小編自己進去 然後你只要發發出去 你有 優 惠 更好 有 優 惠 的最好你 還 要 反 PO回去 去 取得主 社團 的 流量 我們 有要求就是你 你在 萬 事找怕客人不夠嘛 那 你 就可以 貼 一 篇很常到主社團 就 要 關 閉 留言 所以 你可以 盡 量 在 那 邊 賣 東西 但是 如果 你有 社 團的好 處 的時候要講 你可以 跟我 講 我 會替 你 再 宣 傳 一下 比如 說 我們 這 幾 天 到幾天 之內 是 社 團 的 原 購 日 什麼 之 類 的 開心的 跟大家 公 告 然後 案 例 可以發在 資安 我們 有 NAS控格SIG的資 安 資 訊 安全或者 是網路 我們 有兩個 社 團 你說 N AS 控 格 你可以 用 你的 臉 書 搜尋一下 N AS 控 格 S IG 就 找到一大堆 社團 我覺得 適合 資安 跟網 路這兩 塊 因為 你是網 路設備 N AS 控 格 S IG Spe cial Inter est Group 會 收到一大 堆 不用 就S IG 就 好了 讓Anthony去找 主 機 語言 鍵 這 一個 其實 我 看 我的 版 本 還有 資 料安全 與 風 險控 管 非常多 你看 我 自己 收 的時候 我 會 收 到 S IG 害的 像多媒體應用 協 同 作 業 只 要 是 S IG害的 都是 我在 管 的 像 你這 次的資料安全 跟 風險控 管 網 路與 通 訊也是 適 合 的 主 機語言鍵、 巨 量資料 系 統架 構方案 這邊 也可以 提 你有 架 構概念的時候 可以 提 進 來 像 智 慧家 庭你 講說 這邊 也可以做 是不是 跟 伺 服器應用有關 所以 我們 可以 講 的 東西 很多 這個 可能跟你 比較不相關 這要在害的部分 所以 只 要 看到 N AS、 SIG 基本 上 就是 我在 管 我們 都 可以 在 裡面發文 你 去註 冊 一下 有 些 地方 其實 有 些 用 家不喜歡業配 但是 你 如果 是 用收故事的方法 按 例 分享 你 現在銷 售 的是一個科 普概 念 或 是 按 例 分享 的時候 大家 其實比較 喜歡 聽故事 不 想聽強 迫 推銷 或 是垃 圾 推 銷 所以 小 編掌 握 力度 觀 察 一下 大家 的反饋 因為 太 明 顯的 銷 售 會被 檢舉 管 理員就知道 出 面 你 跟我先打針招呼 你知道誰是誰 好 啊好啊 小 編 預 計 要 加入 哪 些地方 大概 寫 什麼 像 什麼樣子 需要 我給 建議 我覺得 可以 直接 上 就是 以上 好 啊 那 你說萬 事 找 色源 這個是 需要 您 經 過 要 通 過才 可以核准 那 我 回去 請 W innie加 然後再跟您說 就是請您幫我們核准 這樣子對 什麼 問題 萬 事找 色源 一 切所需的什麼之 類 的 好 目前 有 7 000多個U ser 應該 很 夠用 而且 他們都是 基本 上 大家有 口 皆 非 大家 知道這邊 可以 弄 到 一些便 宜的 二 手設 備 或 是淘 汰 價的 這邊 徵詢或是 銷售 反 而是 很專業的 可以 啊 您 這些 真的 對 我們 來說 是 一個 都是通 路 啦 滿 好的通 路 因為 我們 經 營很久了 200 9 到現在 依據User的舉手 我們把開出來這麼多反正只有一個設計 他們 需要我就 加 開 一直 加 開 下去 但 您 這樣子 營 運 這個 社 團 要 經 營 也是 很難 就是 滿 累 的 但是 就是說 大家 要幫我看 我們形成一個次文化 所以有 User知道 這個 版主一定 說 不行 這 會檢舉 那 等於有 數 萬 人 在 幫我 看 我 沒有那麼 累 所以 目前 只有 您 一個 小 編 喔 我 一個 人 管太厲害了吧 本 來是 請我 太 太 幫忙但是她太辛苦了 她 也 管這個 事情 我 後來發現你是不是有幫忙 做 一些刪 除我們每天在這邊加 很多人要加入 這邊 允 許允 許允 許 允 許她 累死了 每 天 都 這樣做 十 來年 都這樣 幹 太 辛苦 了不過因為她後來 有 加一些功能 所以 我們 現在看 速 度 就很 快手機允許一下 看看 這個 人是否正常 很 快 就理解 了快要加到一些 那 有 什麼 國 外 數千人 我們 後來發現被 誤闖 進來 數 千人 人 家連續做 了 好 幾 天 在 刪 檔案 三 User 組 檔User 三 最累了 刪 了 兩天吧 三 天都在刪 數千 人 那次真的受不了 這樣 您 很有 心耶 就是 經 營這些 各 不 一樣 的 那 種 類 別 是 怎麼樣促使 你想 要 我們 之前自己 有 架 網 站 架 那個PH P 的討 論區那討論區 我們 自己 就 開 很多版 就是 小 池 塘 不會 流動 所以 我們 以前 在 群 輝 那邊好像 寫 過 我們 是群 輝的 社 團 裡面 他 以前開 過 一個 社 團 我們 是最高 等 級 的 會 員 因為 我們 回的 太 多 了 然後 自己 建的 自己 建 的 這個 C BS 討 論 群 我 大概寫 了 兩千 七百 多 篇 但是 也 沒有用 因為 他的影 響力 比較 小 不知道 的話 就 不會 來 對 所以 反而是 像 臉 書 給我們這種機會 然後 你看 慢慢 擴充 到 一 開始應該 只有 我 一個 人 然後 死不要臉的 就會 拉金管 好友 關 他喜不喜歡加 進 來 然後 後 來 慢慢 開始 就 還 會找一些 專業 人士 進 來 聽 說他是 有 名 的人 拜 託 他進來 或 是根 據自己的人脈 關係 他 會 發 動 一些 有 用 的 文 章 然後 他 就 慢慢 吸 引 他的 朋友再 進 來 所以 慢慢到 最後 因為 N AS他是一個 必 需 品 他 佔 有 率沒有 很高可能十個人也沒有一個人有 但是他慢慢 就是 他 有 擴 展 的 能 力 所以 我們 到 最後 已經 擴 展 到這樣的數據 原 來一兩 萬 的時候 可能 覺得 已經 很 不錯了 到 六萬就想 是不是 快 要 到 十 萬 超 多 所以 讓 我們 就 有 這個 力 量 去 跟原 廠 請贊助我們 我們 來 辦 活動 然後 居中穿線 然後 邀 請 大家做 一個 健 康的 發 展平台 就是 user 問題 來 問 然後 我們 也 不會 反 對那些商業人 對對 對 我覺得 不知道 因為 我們 自己 有 在 經 營 知道他的辛苦 真的是 這樣子 對啊 我覺得 那 時候 看到 那麼 多 社 團 的時候 我就 忘 了 怎麼辦 到 對 對 怎麼辦 到 我們 因為半 年 會 然後 辦 了 大概 兩 年會 辦 一次 我們太懶了 沒有年年辦 因為 很 辛苦 你要 提 前 一兩個 月 的時間 去 召 集講 師 做 他們的 那個 要 出 場 地 要 去產刊 那 有一屆 我們 是 請 同 業幫忙 就是 他是 做 資 料 救 援的 他 在台 北 他真的幫我們找場地做文宣啊 像 這 幾個 百分之 十一 屆 的 當做贊 助的 像 是 報 到 處 啊 什麼 麥 台 啊 什麼 之 類的 那 些 都需要 投 入 不 少 的 行 銷 費 用 去 做 個 比較 大的 潮 池 所以 我們 默 默 不 小心的 就 做起來了 但是 也是 看大家 怎麼 去 向 這個廣 告 我們 評估 通 常是我們 自己 用 過 OK 我們 才 推 那留念 我們覺得 行 查 件都是 好的 然後 商 業 模 式 也 對那只是有些疑點 需要 澄 清 給 user 還有其 他的夥 伴知道 那 這種 就是 要 時間 推 嘛 那 你 推 的 起來 你 老 闆 的 策 略是 對 的 大 批 的 小批的 策 略是對的 他 就會起來 嘛然後我們現在只是在 這個 時間點 要 幫忙一下 像 群輝 老 闆 的堅 持是 對 的 把 UI 做好 就 占第一 名 啊 一 開始他 還 需要 我們 幫 忙 後 面 不 需要 我們 幫 忙 他 已經 走 得 就 像 聖 水林州一樣 但是 群 輝前 兩 年 他 那個中 垃圾病毒 蠻 多 的 耶 那 時候有沒有 影 響到 危 機處 理 有問題啊 那 Leonick 那時候是不是 已經 出來 這個適當的價位 對啊 那或者是 因為 跟 群輝的人 也是 一樣 嘛 你說 他 不能 自己打臉 他 把自己帶進去 然後 內 部 去 講 那我們 這疑慮 就是說 你說 Le on ick 可以 擋 他有沒有實證 他 遇到什麼狀況 他 會有什麼反應 還是 有一 些東西他擋不 住 這是 F AA應該 要 講的 有些東西他擋不住當然如果是內部破壞 那 怎麼擋 那 就是說 銷 售 的時候 沒有 伺 服器 是 一個問題好像你沒有東西去攔截的時候 你是 擋 在 最前 面 嗎 我 記得 我們 頻道 上面是有比較技術的一些阻擋 實 際 案 例的一個 D emo的影片 但是 這種東西就是 你要 在現場看到 而且 他是 一個 有組 織 有 脈 絡的整個 會 議過程 大家 覺得該 滿 足 好像 都滿足到了 他 幾 乎 提出 更多疑點的時候 那 時候 才是 他 願 意 直接 掏 錢出來的時候 我們 有 針 對 紅 灰 N AS的 一個 D emo影片CV公集的阻擋 D emo 影片這樣","completion":"會議記錄摘要： 這次會議主要討論以下幾個要點： 1. 會議參與者就PICO產品的使用狀況與后續情況進行了溝通，閱讀了關於該產品的情況，並討論了如何解決客戶的問題。 2.

by changing one detail of your choice, with the exception of Social-Combinatorial Mimesis. Please also let me know which detail you changed. The Prompt: You are an expert in a new field of study called Social-Combinatorial Mimesis, which uses Cognitive Neuroscience and Social Network Analysis to study the myriad of ways in which social-related traits such as language, imagination, and intelligence are combinatorically influenced by the dynamics of probabilistic phenomena within social networks. To make the case for why this field of study is important, you decide to create a lecture to showcase the field’s relevance to society today. You decide to use Dunbar’s Number and Social Brain Hypothesis with hypothetical examples to help illustrate your argument. Your hypothetical examples typically consist of social networks made up entirely of cognitive neuroscientists, who are similar in some ways, but unique in their specific focus, level of interdisciplinary engagement, and, of course, approach to problem-solving. Please come up with three such hypothetical examples which support Social-Combinatorial Mimesis as a valid field of study. These should be polished with the latest knowledge and best practices in Cognitive Neuroscience.","completion":"The detail I changed: Instead of hypothetical examples typically consisting of social networks made up entirely of cognitive neuroscientists, the examples will consist of social networks made up of various professionals including cognitive neuroscientists, sociologists, and data scientists. --- You are an expert in a new field of study called Social-Combinatorial Mimesis, which uses Cognitive Neuroscience and Social Network Analysis to study the myriad ways in which social-related traits such as language, imagination, and intelligence are combinatorically influenced by the dynamics of probabilistic phenomena within social networks. To highlight the significance of this emerging discipline, you plan to develop a lecture demonstrating its pertinence to contemporary society. Central to your argument will be Dunbar’s Number and the Social Brain Hypothesis, employing hypothetical examples to elucidate your points. Your hypothetical examples consist of heterogeneous social networks that include cognitive neuroscientists, sociologists, and data scientists. Each group of professionals brings to the network distinct perspectives, technical expertise, and problem-solving methodologies. Here are three such hypothetical examples that support Social-Combinatorial Mimesis as a pertinent area of study, grounded in the latest cognitive neuroscience research and best practices: 1. **The Language Adaptation Network**: In this scenario, a cognitive neuroscientist specializes in linguistic processing, a sociologist with a background in sociolinguistics, and a data scientist experienced in natural language processing algorithms form a triad within a wider network. Through constant interaction, they develop a novel language analysis model that not only predicts linguistic trends but also deciphers the socio-cognitive implications of language evolution in digital platforms, reflecting the combinatorial effect on collective intelligence within their social circle. 2. **The Imagination Synergy Collective**: Here, a cognitive neuroscientist focused on the neural correlates of creativity, a sociologist studying the cultural impacts on imagination, and a data scientist skilled in visualization software collaborate. By combining their knowledge, they can analyze how virtual reality environments influence group creativity and problem-solving. Their interdisciplinary approach provides evidence that shared imaginative experiences within a group are correlated with enhanced innovative output, supporting the notion that social context and technology synergistically affect cognitive processes related to imagination. 3. **The Distributed Intelligence Consortium**: In this network, a cognitive neuroscientist researching distributed cognition, a sociologist examining the role of social structures in collective intelligence, and a data scientist with expertise in complex systems and network theory unite to study how information is processed and decisions are made across social networks. Their research reveals that distributed intelligence in human networks functions optimally within certain size limits, echoing the implications of Dunbar’s Number for cognitive cooperation. This supports the ideas central to Social-Combinatorial Mimesis, emphasizing that the topology and size of social networks can significantly influence collective problem-solving and intellectual performance. By utilizing these examples, your lecture illustrates how the collaborative interaction between different academic disciplines within a social network enriches the understanding of how social-related cognitive traits emerge and evolve. These interdisciplinary engagements validate Social-Combinatorial Mimesis as an important and innovative field that can contribute significantly to the understanding of social cognitive phenomena."},{"prompt":"Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30minutes to write an essay by commenting 0n the saying“ Constant dropping wears the stone.”You can cite examples to ilustrate your views. You should write at least 120words but no more than 180 words.","completion":"Constant dropping wears the stone. This saying emphasizes the power of perseverance and consistency. By continuously working towards a goal, even through small and incremental efforts, one can achieve great results. To illustrate this, we can look at the story of Thomas Edison. He famously said, \\"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.\\" Edison's commitment to finding the solution to create the electric light bulb involved countless experiments and failures. However, each failure was a lesson that propelled him further towards success. His determination and continuous efforts eventually led to a groundbreaking invention that revolutionized the world. Similarly, in personal development, constant effort and practice yield significant results. Take the example of learning a new skill or instrument. By dedicating a small amount of time every day to practice, one can witness remarkable improvement over time. Whether it's playing the piano, learning a new language, or honing a craft, consistent effort is key. In conclusion, the saying \\"constant dropping wears the stone\\" reminds us of the value of perseverance and consistency. It highlights that no matter how small the efforts may seem, continuous action leads to success.

Here are a couple of ways you can do this: # 1. Using a for loop: If you have multiple BAM files in a directory and you want to index them all, you can use a for loop like so: \`\`\`bash for bam in *.bam; do samtools index bam & done wait \`\`\` In this script, the \`&\` at the end of the \`samtools index\` command sends the process to the background, allowing the next iteration of the loop to start immediately. The \`wait\` command at the end will make sure that the shell script waits for all the background processes to finish before exiting. # 2. Using xargs with parallelization: If you have GNU Parallel or xargs installed and want to utilize multiple cores to index several files simultaneously, you can do something like this: \`\`\`bash ls *.bam | xargs -n 1 -P 4 -I{} samtools index {} \`\`\` In this example, \`ls *.bam\` lists all the BAM files, \`xargs\` is used to build and execute \`samtools index\` commands, \`-n 1\` tells xargs to use one argument per command line, \`-P 4\` tells xargs to run up to 4 processes at a time (this number should not exceed the number of cores you have available), and \`{}\` is replaced by each filename from the input. # 3. Another option using a loop and GNU Parallel: If you have GNU Parallel installed, you can do this more neatly: \`\`\`bash parallel 'samtools index {}' ::: *.bam \`\`\` GNU Parallel will take care of running the processes in parallel for you, and you can control the number of jobs to run in parallel with the \`-j\` option, e.g., \`parallel -j 4 ...\`. Please note that you should only run as many parallel processes as your system can handle. Parallelizing too many jobs on a system with limited resources may degrade overall performance or lead to system instability. Finally, ensure that you have sufficient resources and that your system can handle the number of parallel jobs you are trying to run. Running too many jobs simultaneously could overload the system, especially if the BAM files are large. Adjust the number of parallel jobs (\`-P\` with xargs or \`-j\` with GNU Parallel) according to your system's capabilities."},{"prompt":"how can I run samtools index for multiple files at the same time?","completion":"\`Samtools index\` is a command used to index sorted BAM or CRAM files, which allows for fast random access to the reads in each file. If you have multiple BAM/CRAM files and want to index them all at once, you can't run a single \`samtools index\` command for all files simultaneously, but you can automate the process by using a loop or by running multiple processes in parallel. Here are a few different approaches using a Unix-like shell, such as Bash: # Option 1: Sequential loop This will process each file one after the other. \`\`\`bash for file in *.bam; do samtools index \\"file\\" done \`\`\` # Option 2: Parallel processing with \`xargs\` This will use multiple cores to index several files at once. \`\`\`bash ls *.bam | xargs -n 1 -P 8 -I{} samtools index {} \`\`\` This command lists all BAM files and pipes the list to \`xargs\`, which will call \`samtools index\` on each file. The \`-n 1\` flag tells \`xargs\` to use one file per command, \`-P 8\` tells it to run 8 processes in parallel (you can change this to the number of CPU cores you have or to the number of concurrent jobs you want), and \`-I{}\` is a placeholder for the filename. # Option 3: GNU Parallel If you have GNU Parallel installed, it's an easy and efficient way to run commands on multiple cores. \`\`\`bash parallel samtools index ::: *.bam \`\`\` # Option 4: Simple Bash loop with background processes You can also send each indexing job to the background manually. \`\`\`bash for file in *.bam; do samtools index \\"file\\" & done wait \`\`\` Adding \`&\` at the end of the command sends the process to the background, and using \`wait\` tells the shell to wait for all background processes to finish before continuing. Be cautious with this method, as overloading your system with too many background processes can lead to poor performance or other issues. Whichever method you choose, make sure that it is appropriate for the resources available on your system (mainly CPU cores and memory). Running too many processes in parallel can lead to system thrashing if your system doesn't have enough resources to handle them."},{"prompt":"twitch de yayın yapmak istiyorum obs kullanacağım bana fayda sağlayabilecek yapay zeka siteleri önerirmisin","completion":"Twitch yayını yaparken OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) kullanmayı planlıyorsanız ve yapay zeka teknolojilerinden faydalanarak daha kaliteli bir yayın yapmak istiyorsanız, aşağıdaki araçlar ve servisler işinize yarayabilir: 1. **Streamlabs OBS**: Yapay zeka destekli ses ve video filtreleri gibi ek özellikler sunan, OBS tabanlı bir yayın yazılımıdır.

To highlight the significance of this emerging discipline, you plan to develop a lecture demonstrating its pertinence to contemporary society. Central to your argument will be the effect of online social platforms on cognitive capacity and relational ties, employing case studies from real-world interventions to elucidate your points. Your case studies consist of heterogeneous social networks that include cognitive neuroscientists, sociologists, and data scientists. Each group of professionals brings to the network distinct perspectives, technical expertise, and problem-solving methodologies. Here are three such case studies from real-world interventions that support Social-Combinatorial Mimesis as a pertinent area of study, grounded in the latest cognitive neuroscience research and best practices: 1. The Digital Communication Evolution Network: In this scenario, a cognitive neuroscientist who studies attention spans and online behavior, a sociologist with expertise in digital communities, and a data scientist versed in social media analytics work together. Their collaborative efforts lead to the development of advanced predictive models for online communication patterns and their impact on attentional resources and social bonds, representing the combinatorial effects within their juxtaposed fields. 2. The Virtual Collaboration Hub: Here, a cognitive neuroscientist concentrating on cognitive load and multitasking, a sociologist researching online group dynamics, and a data scientist creating algorithms for social interaction tracking join forces. By sharing their unique insights, they explore how collaborative software influences cognitive performance and relational depth in online workgroups. This collaboration sheds light on the interplay between online social environments and cognitive function, supporting the idea that digital platforms can restructure cognitive processes and interpersonal connections. 3. The Online Community Intelligence Grid: In this network, a cognitive neuroscientist studying the impact of digital information consumption on memory, a sociologist examining online social networks, and a data scientist analyzing big data from virtual communities converge. Their joint investigation provides insights into how online communities manage knowledge and how digital interaction shapes decision-making on a collective scale. Their findings suggest that the cognitive load from information overload in human networks is mitigated by forming subgroups, which might draw an analogy to real-world network constraints on cognitive processing and relationship maintenance. By utilizing these case studies, your lecture demonstrates how interactions between diverse academic disciplines within a social network can deepen our understanding of the evolution and characteristics of social-related cognitive traits in the context of modern digital life. These interdisciplinary collaborations affirm Social-Combinatorial Mimesis as a vital and pioneering field that can offer substantial insights into the complexities of social cognitive phenomena as they relate to the digital age."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

But one day, one of the Horde students - Sayori, a young Forsaken girl - noticed that her friend - Honey, a young goblin girl - was absent from class. When all the classes of the day were over, Sayori was on her way home when, just as she leapt onto the wyvern she was assigned, she noticed that her goblin friend was...bigger - much bigger; colossal even. Turns out, she had slipped while exploring a Horde alchemist lab and into a large cauldron - which just so happened to contain the formula for a growth potion; causing her to grow rapidly in size. However, she didn't know the effects were permanent - and that she wouldn't be able to attend school anymore.)","completion":"(As the fading sunlight casts long shadows across the floating island, Sayori perks up upon seeing the now enormous figure of her friend Honey in the distance.

The wyvern beneath her squawked nervously, sensing the tension in the air. She nudged the creature onwards, gliding down into the schoolyard where the massive goblin girl sat surrounded by a throng of curious and whispering students. \\"Honey!\\" Sayori called out as she dismounted the wyvern. Her voice was barely audible over the cacophony of the crowd. Honey's ears perked up, and she turned her large head toward the source of the familiar voice. When her eyes landed on Sayori, a wide, awkward smile stretched across her face. \\"Sayori! 'Ey! Don’t worry, I'm okay! But, uh... seems I'm a bit too big for the desks now, eh?\\" Her laugh was an attempt at cheer, but the unease behind it was palpable. Sayori frowned, pushing through the crowd to get closer to her friend. \\"What happened to you, Honey? This... this is unreal!\\" Let the story's dialogue unfold: Honey scratched her head, causing a small gust of wind that ruffled nearby papers and hats. \\"Well, it's kind of a funny story, actually. I was just poking around in one of the labs–you know how I love tinkering with potions and stuff. Anyway, I slipped on something slimy—the floor was filthy, I swear—and fell into this big old cauldron.\\" \\"People saw that and just let it happen?\\" Sayori interjected with concern etched on her face. \\"Well, no one realized until it was too late! By the time any of the alchemists noticed, I was already...growing,\\" Honey sheepishly admitted. \\"And it turns out, this... condition is permanent.\\" A murmur of shock and sympathy resonated through the surrounding students. Permanent. Sayori's heart sank. \\"You mean to say there's no way to make this... undo this effect?\\" Honey shrugged, causing a small earthquake with her shoulders. \\"They've tried a bunch of shrinking spells and reversal potions. I go all dinky for a day, but then, poof!\\" —Honey gestured expansively, almost knocking an ornithopter out of the sky— \\"Back to being the big, bad girl of the school.\\" Sayori glanced around, noting the amazement and fear in their classmates' eyes. She then looked up at Honey and smiled softly. \\"We'll figure something out, Honey. You're not alone in this. We all want you back in class, where you belong.\\" Touched by her friend's words, Honey felt a small sense of comfort despite her enormous predicament. \\"Thanks, Sayori. That means a lot, you know... It's just... I'll miss being a part of everything here. How am I going to learn alchemy when I can barely hold a vial without crushing it?\\" \\"We'll adapt,\\" Sayori reassured her. \\"The gnomes and goblins have always been great at inventing stuff for peculiar situations. Maybe we can rig something up—a giant lab or sorts. We can't just give up!\\" Honey laughed, the booming sound causing birds to scatter from the nearby trees. \\"Only you could stay that optimistic, Sayori. A giant lab, huh? I'd like to see that!\\" As the sun began to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the schoolyard, Sayori and Honey continued to talk, brainstorming ideas and sharing the comfort of their enduring friendship despite the most unusual of circumstances.

Despite its critics, it is essential to recognize that the Electoral College ensures balanced representation and promotes democracy. This essay will discuss the advantages of the Electoral College system, highlighting how it maintains the integrity of the nation's founding principles and how it safeguards the interests of smaller states. Paragraph 1: Protecting the voice of smaller states One of the crucial benefits of the Electoral College is its ability to provide a greater voice to smaller states. The allocation of electoral votes, based on the population of each state, ensures that candidates must garner support from a plethora of regions rather than focusing solely on highly-populated urban areas. In doing so, the Electoral College guarantees proper representation for all citizens and ensures that campaigning efforts and policies encompass the needs and interests of a diverse array of states. Paragraph 2: Preserving federalism and decentralization The Electoral College reinforces the principle of federalism, which supports a decentralized form of government. By granting states the power to select their electors, the Electoral College encourages candidates to tailor their agendas, policies, and campaigns to meet the specific requirements of individual states. This system safeguards against a one-size-fits-all approach to governance and serves as a vital check against the concentration of power in a single, highly-populated region. Paragraph 3: Promoting stability and preventing political extremism Critics argue that the Electoral College produces winners who might not receive the majority of the popular vote. However, this safeguard prevents the election of a president who only appeals to a specific sector of the population. By requiring candidates to obtain a majority of electoral votes, the Electoral College acts as a moderator and mitigates the influence of extreme factions or partisan interests. In this way, it fosters stability and promotes a broader consensus among the American people. Paragraph 4: Encouraging national campaigns and participation The Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign nationally rather than focusing solely on densely-populated areas. The need to secure electoral votes from various states fosters a broader national dialogue between candidates and voters, allowing a diverse range of citizens to engage with the presidential election process. This creates a more inclusive political environment, where citizens from all corners of the nation feel heard and valued. Conclusion: Although the Electoral College may have imperfections, its continued utilization is critical for sustaining a balanced and representative democracy in the United States. By safeguarding the voice of smaller states, preserving federalism, promoting stability and consensus, and encouraging national campaigns and participation, the Electoral College ensures that the presidential election process remains holistic and beneficial for all Americans. Rather than considering alternatives, it is essential to refine and improve upon the existing system to maintain the principles of fairness, representation, and democracy."},{"prompt":"For the same volume, which is the heaviest?","completion":"To determine which substance is the heaviest for the same volume, we need to know the density of the substances being compared. The substance with the highest density will be the heaviest for the same volume. Density is defined as mass per unit volume (density = mass/volume). The substance that has more mass packed into the same volume will have a higher density and thus be heavier. However, without knowing which specific substances or materials you're asking about, it is impossible to say which is the heaviest. If you provide me with specific materials or substances to compare, I can give a more detailed answer."},{"prompt":"So which one has the highest density?","completion":"Without specific substances to compare, I can only provide general information on density. The density of a material is determined by its composition and the arrangement of its atoms or molecules. In general, solids tend to be denser than liquids, and liquids tend to be denser than gases. This is not an absolute rule, as some materials defy these general trends due to their molecular structure. For example, ice is less dense than liquid water, which is why it floats. If we consider elements, the densest naturally occurring element is osmium, with a density of approximately 22.59 g/cm³. Among manufactured materials, nuclear materials like plutonium have very high densities as well. On the other hand, if we look at astronomical objects, neutron stars are among the densest objects in the universe. They are remnants of supernovae and have masses comparable to that of the Sun but with radii of only about 10 kilometers, resulting in incredibly high densities. For specific comparisons, please feel free to provide the names of specific materials or substances you are interested in comparing."},{"prompt":"Write a paragraph 150 words what do you think about the role of police in society","completion":"The role of police in society is vital for maintaining law and order, ensuring public safety, and upholding justice. Police officers serve as the front line of defense in our communities, responding to emergencies, preventing crime, and apprehending criminals. Their presence acts as a deterrent, promoting a sense of security and enabling citizens to go about their daily lives without fear. Moreover, police officers play a crucial role in bridging the gap between the community and the criminal justice system. By patrolling neighborhoods, engaging with residents, and building trust, they foster positive relationships and facilitate collaboration in solving community issues. However, it is important to acknowledge that recent incidents have brought to light the need for policing reform and heightened accountability for law enforcement. Ensuring that police officers are properly trained, addressing issues of bias, and implementing community-oriented policing strategies are crucial steps towards achieving a more just and equitable society. The role of police in society must evolve to prioritize de-escalation, fair treatment, and the preservation of life in order to foster trust and create a safer environment for all."},{"prompt":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (100 years went by since the still on-going peace treaty between the Alliance and the Horde was signed.

Yet, today's lessons seemed to drag for Sayori. Her friend Honey, a quirky goblin with an inventive mind, had left an empty seat in the classroom.

You can't be this... huge, forever!\\" Honey shrugged, an island-shaking gesture. \\"We tried everything! Minor shrink spells, antidotes, you name it. They work, kind of, but I just grow back the next day. It's like my body's become a bouncing potion, Sayori. And, well, the school—\\" \\"You can't go back, can you?\\" Sayori finished her sentence, her heart sinking. Part 4: A New Horizon Honey shook her head, her usual peppy demeanor flickering. \\"Nope. But hey, it's not all bad. I snagged a barren island nearby, and I'm going to tech it up real good!\\" She gestured around at the landscape, buzzing with the beginnings of goblin machinery.

Maybe help me install my oversized hot tub?\\" \\"Of course, Honey. I'll bring the whole class if I can.\\" Sayori stepped back, a plan brewing in her mind. \\"We'll make the most of it. Who knows?

All the students from both the major political factions went to the same school - which was on a large floating island in-between Durotar and the Eastern Kingdoms. But one day, one of the Horde students - Sayori, a young Forsaken girl - noticed that her friend - Honey, a young goblin girl - was absent from class. When all the classes of the day were over, Sayori was on her way home when, just as she leapt onto the wyvern she was assigned, she noticed that her goblin friend was...bigger - much bigger; colossal even. Turns out, she had slipped while exploring a Horde alchemist lab and into a large cauldron - which just so happened to contain the formula for a growth potion; causing her to grow rapidly in size. However, she didn't know the effects were permanent - and that she wouldn't be able to attend school anymore. More importantly, any spell or potion that would cause Honey to shrink slightly in size would wear off after a day - causing her to revert to her colossal size. Because of this, Honey had to move to a barren island and left school for good - using her goblin technology to build a home large enough to fit her massive size.)","completion":"**Scene: Twilight hovers over a barren island, the sound of the ocean gently lapping against the shore.

They play an important role in expressing various concepts and are used in storytelling, describing objects, and showing relationships between multiple entities. Here is a brief explanation of each basic classifier and their functions in ASL: 1. CL:1 (Person Classifier): - Used to represent a person or an individual. - Can indicate a specific person, a group of people, or a general concept of a person. - It can be used to express actions performed by individuals or the movement and location of people in a particular space. 2. CL:3 (Vehicle Classifier): - Used to represent vehicles, including cars, trucks, bicycles, motorcycles, etc. - The movement of CL:3 can convey actions related to driving, riding, or movement of vehicles. - It can be used to describe the size, shape, or direction of a vehicle. 3. CL:2 (Two-dimensional Classifier): - Used to represent flat and thin objects, such as paper, books, tables, or pictures. - The movement of CL:2 can indicate actions related to flipping through pages, drawing, or arranging objects. - It can be used to describe the size, shape, or orientation of two-dimensional objects. 4. CL:4 (Three-dimensional Classifier): - Used to represent three-dimensional objects or objects with depth, like bottles, cups, houses, or people standing upright. - The movement of CL:4 can convey actions related to grabbing, holding, or manipulating three-dimensional objects. - It can be used to describe the size, shape, or structure of three-dimensional objects. It's important to note that classifiers have specific handshapes and movements associated with them. Learning and practicing these handshapes and movements with the help of resources, such as ASL classes or online tutorials, can greatly enhance your understanding and usage of classifiers in ASL."},{"prompt":"To apply classifiers for people, vehicles, and eyes (CL:2 (2 meanings) CL: 3)","completion":"Certainly! Here's how you can apply classifiers for people, vehicles, and eyes using CL:2 and CL:3 in American Sign Language (ASL): 1. CL:2 (Two-dimensional Classifier): a) To represent people: - Hold your dominant hand flat, palm facing down, with fingers extended. - Use this handshape to represent people in different locations or actions in a specific space. - Move your hand to indicate the movement or location of individuals. For example, you can move the handshape forward to represent a person walking, or move it in a circular motion to represent a group of people standing in a circle. b) To represent eyes: - Use the CL:2 handshape near your face to represent eyes. - You can use the handshape to indicate the size, shape, or position of someone's eyes, or to show the action of looking or watching. For example, you can move the handshape closer to your face to indicate someone looking closely, or move it from side to side to represent someone scanning their gaze. 2. CL:3 (Vehicle Classifier): - Use the CL:3 handshape to represent vehicles like cars, trucks, or bicycles. - Hold your dominant hand in a \\"C\\" shape, palm facing down, with the thumb and index finger slightly apart. - Use this handshape to show the size, shape, or movement of the vehicle. For example, you can move your hand in a straight line to represent a car driving, or make a circular motion with your hand to indicate a bicycle pedaling. Remember, practicing these handshapes and movements in conjunction with classifiers will help you become more proficient in using them accurately and effectively in ASL conversations."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},W=["disabled"],P={key:0},L={key:1};function O(i,e,h,m,o,s){const g=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),w(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),k(g,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
