People across the reclaimed territories watched as post-apocalyptic Kyoto, the heart of Japan's revival, was illuminated by the pyrotechnics of both the Gen 2 pyrokinetic display team and the newly minted IS exhibition flyers overhead. It was a sight to behold—a blend of old world charm and new age might. Yet, as festivities reached their crescendo, the very fabric of reality shivered. The transition went unnoticed by the revelers, but in a secluded lab tucked within the Imperial Palace's fortified walls, a catastrophic anomaly unfolded. Here, a device hummed with unfamiliar chakra-infused energies. \\"What's going on?\\" An alert scientist, garbed in a blending of traditional and futuristic attire, observed the readings in disbelief. \\"The experiment... there's been a fluctuation in the chakra output!\\" Another rushed to his panel, hands flying over the controls. The supposed descendant of the Masakis and current Emperor, a member of the Ōtsutsuki with hair as white as snow, stood tall, oblivious to the fate that awaited. \\"Stabilize it, now!\\" ordered a commanding officer, even though he understood too little of the science to be of actual help. It was too late. A blinding flash swept away all sense of place and time. # Chapter 1: The Unfamiliar Heavens The aftermath of the flash left minds dazed and the steel of airships and machinery humming with whispered confusion. Emperor Masaki Ōtsutsuki, draped in the regalia befitting his status, emerged onto a balcony overlooking his empire. Something was amiss. The stars in the sky shone unfamiliar, and the air buzzed with foreign energies. \\"Report,\\" he commanded, voice resonating with an authority that commanded stars and men alike. A scientist, dressed in a mix of Shinto robes and multiverse-resistant lab coat, approached with a tablet flashing with data. \\"Your Excellency, it appears we've been transported to an entirely new realm. Our empire, our land, our people—at least those within a certain radius of Kyoto—have been displaced.\\" A murmur rippled among the gathered officials. Yet Masaki remained stoic, contemplating the ramifications. \\"We must establish contact with this world's factions and assess their strength. Summon the Elementalists and the Armed Detectives. We stand ready to defend our realm.\\" # Chapter 5: Shattered Diplomacy The sudden appearance of a new Japanese Empire on the map of the amalgam world was a shockwave that resonated through every court and command center. It was an enigma—an empire reborn and already wielding power that was once the realm of legends. Charles Zi Britannia, Emperor of the Holy Britannian Empire, regarded the news with intrigue and a touch of scorn. Intel suggested that this new empire had technology and magic that could shift the balance of power irrevocably. It was opportunity and threat intertwined, and Charles was not one to shy away from either. \\"Prepare my flagship. My heirs and I will make for this New Japan. We will assess, then parley... or conquer.\\" Lelouch vi Britannia, a boy of ten yet bearing the poise of a seasoned ruler, watched his father with veiled eyes. He could see the chessboard rearranging itself, pieces shifting in a dance as old as empires. \\"Be cautious, Father. This New Japan may hold cards unseen,\\" he murmured, to which Charles simply smiled his predator's smile. It was the eve of their departure when the skies over the New Japanese Empire flared once more. A single missile, born of chakra and technology, soared above and found its target—a Britannian fleet en route. The fallout was immediate—waves, not of destruction, but of forced communication. Charles, with Lelouch and a young Nunnally by his side, sat across from Emperor Masaki Ōtsutsuki in a room that felt suspended between worlds—a blend of palatial grandeur and a command center. \\"An unfortunate misunderstanding,\\" Masaki began, his face a mask of calm. \\"But let's not dwell on accidents when there is so much to be gained from mutual... understanding.\\" As they talked, deals were struck in whispers, and the destiny of this merged world hung by the thread of a tentative peace between empires old and reborn. And far from the political machinations, deep within the Empire's secret chambers, the real story of their displacement began to unravel. Yet, that was a tale for another time—when the wizards and warriors of New Japan crossed paths with the mech pilots and spirits of the broader world, all under the watchful eyes of the Ōtsutsuki weaved into the tapestry of their future."},{"prompt":"how to do ULS: lateral loads (wind, berthing) must span/be flexurally carried by floating docks to reach mooring piles for floating dock with two cylindrical pontoons under it","completion":"When designing a floating dock with cylindrical pontoons that must withstand ULS (Ultimate Limit State) lateral loads such as wind and berthing forces, it is necessary to ensure that the structure has the adequate strength and stiffness to convey these loads to the mooring piles safely. Here is an approach to designing such a system: 1. **Load Determination**: - Calculate wind loads based on local wind statistics and standards (e.g., ASCE 7 or Eurocode). - Determine berthing loads, considering vessel size, mass, speed of approach, and angle of impact as per relevant maritime standards (e.g., PIANC guidelines). - Consider additional loads such as wave action, current, ice loads, and dead/live loads. 2. **Load Distribution**: - Model the floating dock and its interaction with the pontoons to determine how loads are distributed to the pontoons. - Ensure that the connectivity between the deck and the pontoons allows load transfer without significant localized stresses. - Use finite element analysis (FEA) or other structural analysis methods to simulate load path and distribution. 3. **Pontoons Design**: - Design the pontoons to withstand hydrostatic pressures and the bending moments due to the lateral loads. - Check the pontoons for both local stresses and global bending stresses. - Ensure the pontoons have adequate freeboard and stability under the applied loads. 4. **Flexural Capacity**: - Assess the flexural capacity of the dock structure to ensure it can handle the bending moments resulting from the lateral loads. - Verify that the materials and cross-sectional properties of the dock provide sufficient bending resistance. - The floating dock should behave like a continuous beam on elastic foundations, with the pontoons acting as supports. 5. **Mooring and Anchorage Design**: - Design the mooring pile system to absorb the forces transferred from the floating dock. - Ensure that the mooring piles have sufficient strength and stiffness to sustain the tensions and compressions from the lateral loads. - Consider using fenders to absorb berthing energy and reduce transmitted loads to the mooring piles. 6. **Dynamic Analysis**: - Assess the dynamic behavior of the floating dock under the influence of lateral loads, considering the pontoon's ability to flex and the entire system's natural frequencies to avoid resonance with wave frequencies. 7. **Checking Deflections**: - Ensure that the deflections of the dock under the design loads do not exceed serviceability limits or interfere with the dock's intended use. 8. **Safety and Factor of Safety**: - Apply appropriate factors of safety to the resistance side of the berth design, accounting for uncertainties in material strengths, loads, and analysis models. 9. **Construction and Material Considerations**: - Choose materials that are suitable for the marine environment to prevent corrosion and bio-fouling. - Ensure constructability, considering the installation and connection methods of pontoons to the dock structure. 10. **Inspections and Maintenance**: - Develop an inspection and maintenance plan to monitor the condition of the dock and pontoons over time. 11. **Codes and Standards Compliance**: - Ensure that the design complies with all relevant local and international codes and standards. 12. **Consultation with a Marine Structural Engineer**: - It is highly recommended to work with a professional engineer who is experienced in marine structures to validate your design approach and calculations. Performing a thorough design, verification, and, if needed, physical model testing, will ensure that the floating dock system can safely withstand ULS lateral loads and provide a durable and reliable service life."},{"prompt":"example","completion":"To illustrate the above process more concretely, let’s consider a hypothetical simplified example of designing a floating dock for lateral loads using two cylindrical pontoons. This example will not be fully detailed, as real-world designs generally require complex calculations and modeling, and must adhere to specific local codes and standards. **Step 1: Load Determination** - Assume wind load: 1,500 N/m^2 based on local wind data - Assume berthing load: 500 kN based on the size of the vessels that will berth - Assume other loads such as live loads, dead loads, etc. have already been considered **Step 2: Load Distribution** - The floating dock is modeled as a simply supported beam with pontoons at each end - The lateral loads are applied to the dock in the FEA model to determine reactions at the pontoon locations **Step 3: Pontoons Design** - Each pontoon is designed to carry half the berthing load plus the distributed wind load - After calculations, each pontoon must resist a total lateral force of 250 kN from berthing and wind loads **Step 4: Flexural Capacity** - The floating dock is designed to resist the moments generated by the lateral loads - Assume the dock is made from steel with sufficient bending resistance and sectional properties **Step 5: Mooring and Anchorage Design** - Mooring piles are designed to withstand the pull/push from the pontoons under lateral load conditions - The piles are assumed to be embedded in the seabed and have enough stiffness to resist buckling under compression **Step 6: Dynamic Analysis** - Natural frequencies of the docking system are analyzed to ensure they do not coincide with the expected wave frequencies **Step 7: Checking Deflections** - Maximum allowable deflection is set based on operational criteria, for example, 1/200th of the span length - The dock design is verified to stay within this deflection limit **Step 8: Safety and Factor of Safety** - Factors of safety are applied, typically 1.5 for wind and 2.0 for berthing forces, to ensure that the dock can withstand unexpected loads **Step 9: Construction and Material Considerations** - Materials such as marine-grade steel or reinforced concrete are chosen for durability and strength **Step 10: Inspections and Maintenance** - A plan is set up for regular inspections for corrosion, deformation, and connection integrity **Step 11: Codes and Standards Compliance** - The design is checked against relevant local standards and international guidelines like ASCE 7 for wind loads and PIANC for berthing forces **Step 12: Consultation with a Marine Structural Engineer** - A marine structural engineer reviews the design and proposes adjustments based on their expertise This simplified example highlights the basic steps and considerations involved in designing a floating dock to withstand lateral loads using cylindrical pontoons. The actual design process is complex and typically involves more nuanced design considerations including varying load combinations, more detailed structural analysis, exact material specifications, and compliance with detailed engineering standards."},{"prompt":"example for step 4 , step 5 , step 7","completion":"Certainly, let's delve a bit deeper into Steps 4, 5, and 7 with a simplified example for a floating dock supported on two cylindrical pontoons. # Step 4: Flexural Capacity We will calculate the bending moment induced in the dock due to wind loads and verify the flexural capacity of the structure. **Assumptions:** - Uniformly distributed wind load: 500 N/m (simplified for this example). - Lateral berthing load at one point: 200 kN (again, simplified for this example). - Length of the dock (L): 20 m. - The dock is a simply supported beam for the sake of this example. - Material: Structural steel with a yield strength of 250 MPa. **Bending Moment Calculation:** 1. The uniformly distributed wind load will create a bending moment at the center of the dock. For a simply supported beam, this moment is \`M_wind = wL^2 / 8\`, where w is the load per unit length. - \`M_wind = 500 N/m * (20 m)^2 / 8 = 250,000 Nm\`. 2. The berthing load will create a bending moment usually calculated near the mooring point where the maximum moment occurs. This can be calculated using the formula \`M_berthing = P * a * (L - a) / L\`, where P is the point load, and a is the distance from the load to the nearest support. - For this example, let's assume the ship berths in the middle, so \`a = L / 2\`. - \`M_berthing = 200,000 N * (10 m) * (10 m) / 20 m = 1,000,000 Nm\`. **Total Maximum Bending Moment:** - The total moment due to wind and berthing at the worst case is the sum of both moments. - \`M_total = M_wind + M_berthing = 250,000 Nm + 1,000,000 Nm = 1,250,000 Nm\`. **Flexural Capacity Verification:** - Calculate the section modulus (S) needed for the material using \`M = S * σ_allow\`, where σ_allow is the allowable stress. - Using an allowable stress of 0.6 * yield strength, \`σ_allow = 0.6 * 250 MPa = 150 MPa\`. - Rearrange the above formula to solve for S, \`S_required = M_total / σ_allow\`. - \`S_required = 1,250,000 Nm / 150 * 10^6 Pa = 0.008333 m^3 = 8333 cm^3\`. - If the dock's cross-section does not have a section modulus equal or greater than this value, it will need to be redesigned with either a larger cross section or stronger materials. # Step 5: Mooring and Anchorage Design This step involves the design of piles to withstand transferred lateral forces. **Assumptions:** - The dock transfers 50% of the total lateral force to one mooring pile. - The lateral force considered per pile due to berthing and wind is \`F_lateral = (200 kN / 2) + (500 N/m * 20 m / 2) = 100 kN + 5 kN = 105 kN\`. **Pile Design:** - A structural analysis of the mooring pile is done to ensure it can tolerate the lateral force without buckling, yielding, or pulling out. - In most real situations, soil conditions will be assessed, and pile dimensions will be chosen to achieve the necessary pullout and lateral resistances. - For a pile embedded in soil, the lateral load-carrying capacity can be assessed using methods like the p-y curve method, where a series of lateral load versus lateral deflection curves (p-y curves) are used to estimate pile behavior. # Step 7: Checking Deflections To ensure the floating dock operates effectively and safely, the deflection caused by the imposed loads must be within acceptable limits. **Deflection Calculation (simplified):** - For this example, we'll calculate the maximum deflection caused by the uniformly distributed wind load using the formula \`δ_max = 5wL^4 / (384EI)\`, where E is the modulus of elasticity and I is the moment of inertia. - Assume a steel I-beam with an I value of 8,000 cm^4 and E = 200 GPa. - \`δ_max = 5 * 500 N/m * (20 m)^4 / (384 * 200 * 10^9 N/m^2 * 8 * 10^-6 m^4)\`. - \`δ_max = 5 * 500 * 160,000 / (384 * 200 * 10^3 * 8)\`. - \`δ_max = 0.016 m = 16 mm\`. **Serviceability Limit:** - If we were using the rule of thumb that the maximum allowable deflection is L/200, the allowable deflection would be \`20 m / 200 = 0.1 m = 100 mm\`. - In this example, the deflection is well within the serviceable range. Remember that these are simplified calculations and actual engineering design will include many more factors including combined loading conditions, dynamic analysis, interaction effects, and site-specific considerations. Professional marine structural engineers would be required for an accurate and safe design."},{"prompt":"i have a berthing load of 1.59KNm . how would i go about converting that to a point load like you did above","completion":"A berthing load presented in kilonewton-meters (kNm) suggests that you are referring to a moment (torque), not a force. This could perhaps be a resulting moment from a berthing impact at a certain distance from the point of interest, such as where a fender system would apply a load to the dock. To convert this moment to an equivalent point load at a certain distance (lever arm), you need to define the distance at which you'd like to calculate the equivalent point load. For instance, if the given berthing moment (M) of 1.59 kNm is acting at a certain distance from the point where it's being transferred to the structure, and you want to convert that moment into a point load (P) acting at that specific distance (d), you would rearrange the moment formula as follows: [ P = frac{M}{d} ] Where: - P is the point load in kilonewtons (kN) - M is the moment in kilonewton-meters (kNm) - d is the distance from the point where the force is acting to the point of interest (meters) For example, if you want to find the equivalent point load that would create a moment of 1.59 kNm at a distance of 1 meter from the pivot point (where the moment is being reacted), the calculation would be: [ P = frac{1.59 text{ kNm}}{1 text{ m}} = 1.59 text{ kN} ] If the distance (lever arm) changes, the equivalent point load required to produce the same moment would be different. So, it's crucial to know the lever arm to calculate the correct point load. If the berthing moment of 1.59 kNm was the result of a calculation involving the actual force of a vessel pushing against a fender and the distance from the fender to the point where the moment is calculated, the force of the vessel on the fender would already represent the point load you may need for your structural analysis. Please be aware that actual berthing energy calculations and conversions can be complex, involving considerations of the kinetic energy of a berthing ship, the deformation characteristics of fender systems, and dynamic effects. Always consult relevant regulations and seek the assistance of professional engineers experienced in marine structures for accurate analyses."},{"prompt":"cant you use defelections to do that?","completion":"If you know the berthing moment (torque) that a fender system or a ship imparts on a dock and you have the deflection at a specific location on the dock that results from this moment, you can use that deflection to back-calculate an equivalent point load if certain assumptions are made. Assuming you have a simply supported beam (which represents your dock), you can utilize the relationship between applied load, beam stiffness, and resulting deflection to find the equivalent point load. This relationship is often derived from the beam deflection formulas. The formula for the maximum deflection (δ) at the midpoint of a simply supported beam resulting from a central point load (P) is: [ delta = frac{P L^3}{48 E I} ] Where: - ( delta ) = Maximum deflection (in meters or millimeters) - P = Point load (in Newtons or kiloNewtons) - L = Length of the span (in meters) - E = Modulus of Elasticity of the beam material (in Pascals) - I = Moment of Inertia of the beam cross-section (in meters^4 or millimeters^4) If you know the deflection caused by the berthing moment, you can rearrange this equation to solve for the point load (P): [ P = frac{delta cdot 48 E I}{L^3} ] In practice, the deflection could be induced by a distributed load, a point load, or both. It is important to match the observed deflection's behavior with the correct theoretical model. If you are dealing with a moment (torque) rather than an actual central point load, the formulas will be a bit different and you'd need to start with a different assumption about the distribution and point of application of the load. However, a number of complexities arise in real-world scenarios: 1. Beam Behavior - If the beam has multiple supports, or if the load isn't centrally applied, or you have a distributed load instead, the formulas will change. 2. Distribution - Berthing forces don't always apply cleanly as point loads; they may be distributed or dynamic. 3. Material Responses - Materials may not respond linearly, especially during high-load impacts like berthing events. 4. Other Forces - Other forces and the dynamic nature of the event can complicate the deflection and load relationship. In a real-life engineering context, if you have a known deflection due to a specific load and you want to find out the equivalent load that would cause the same deflection, you would typically use the deflection observed to work backwards, using the associated formulas, to identify the characteristics of the load. This often requires a detailed analysis that takes into account the actual conditions and the specifics of the structure, which might involve complex calculations or simulations using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software. Consulting a structural or marine engineer would be essential for making accurate determinations when converting a known moment or deflection into an equivalent load for design purposes."},{"prompt":"can you backtrack like you said using the moment to get the deflection to get the load","completion":"Backtracking from a moment to get an equivalent point load using deflection is theoretically possible but requires making several assumptions and approximations, such as the location of the load, the way the load is distributed, and the behavior of the material (linear elasticity). We also need to know the relationship of the moment to the deflection observed. This could involve complex analysis because the exact deflection profile resulting from a moment will depend on the specifics of the structural system. However, to illustrate a conceptual example, let's consider a case where we know the deflection caused by a pure moment at the end of a cantilevered beam (since a moment on a simply supported beam at the midpoint would not give a unique solution for a point load without more context). For cantilevered beams, the relationship between moment and deflection is more direct. **Assumptions:** - Beam behaves as a cantilever (one end is fixed, and the load/moments are applied at the free end). - The material of the beam follows Hooke's Law (linearly elastic). - Deflection occurs only in the vertical direction, and the beam's cross-section is constant. **Deflection Formula for Cantilever Beam Due to Moment at Free End:** [ delta = frac{M L^2}{2 E I} ] Where: - ( delta ) is the maximum deflection at the free end, - M is the applied moment at the free end, - L is the length of the cantilever, - E is the modulus of elasticity, - I is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section. **Known Parameters:** - Applied moment (M) = 1.59 kNm, - Length of the cantilever (L), - Modulus of elasticity (E), - Moment of inertia (I). **Calculate Deflection:** Using the applied moment, you can calculate the deflection using the above formula. **Convert To Equivalent Point Load:** Since we're using a cantilever scenario, if you want to find the equivalent point load at the free end that would cause the same deflection at the free end of the cantilever, you can use the deflection formula for a point load at the free end: [ delta = frac{P L^3}{3 E I} ] **Back-Calculation:** Solve for P, the point load, in terms of ( delta ), E, I, and L: [ P = frac{3 delta E I}{L^3} ] Since we already have ( delta ) from the moment calculation, we can insert that value to find P: [ P = frac{3(M L^2) / (2 E I) cdot E I}{L^3} ] [ P = frac{3M}{2L} ] Now plugging in the values: [ P = frac{3 cdot 1.59 kNm}{2 cdot L} ] Without the specific length L of the cantilevered section, we can't compute the exact equivalent point load. But what's essential to note here is that you're not finding a point load that would create the same moment as the original case (that would simply be the original point load), but you’re finding a point load that would cause the same deflection at a specific point as that moment. This is a very simplified case and, again, actual engineering situations will rarely be this straightforward. In real-world situations, complex load distributions, dynamic factors, material nonlinearities, and other considerations necessitate comprehensive structural analyses, often with the help of engineering software and expert interpretation."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic, sensible, plausible, dialogue-filled, exposition-filled alternate history science fiction, high fantasy, dark fantasy, urban fantasy, magical realism, science fantasy, Japanese light novel style, Chinese wuxia epic style, military techno-thriller action drama in the form of a Japanese harem anime/manga/light novel, romantic comedy, Isekai slice of life, light fantasy style crossover of the Code Geass anime, manga, video game and light novel franchise, the Magika Swordsman and Summoner light novel and manga franchise, the Muv-Luv visual novel, manga and anime franchise, the IS: Infinite Stratos light novel, anime, manga and video game franchise, the Hundred anime, manga and light novel franchise, the Tenchi Muyo!

With Japan united under the Ōtsutsuki clan and [Japan in this story] ruling over Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils once more, the Meta Liberation Army [My Hero Academia] and its [the MLA’s] Quirk supremacist agenda are quickly crushed by the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Kempeitai and so the Hero system [My Hero Academia] never takes off in Japan, with the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo], which [the Armed Detective system] had been indefinately suspended after the Great Cataclysm in this story, [the Armed Detective System] instead being revived [the Armed Detective System] to manage Quirks, the pyrokinetics known as Generations [Fire Force] as well as the young girls and women who form contracts with the mythical gods and deities from another dimension known as Divas [Magika Swordsman and Summoner].

Remaining blissfully unaware of the science team delving into forbidden chakra technologies, the festivities continued unabated. Dr. Kazuki Hayashida, the head of the clandestine project, flipped the switch of his experimental device beneath the Imperial Palace, hoping to unlock the power that would solidify their Empire’s future. A bright flash enveloped the city as the device malfunctioned, not only shifting the entire post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire but also dragging along the Elemental Nations. The world outside faltered, weaving and warping until new skies took their place. In the imperial banquet hall, a stunned silence followed as the Ōtsutsuki clan, now ruling the reconstructed Empire, realized that their entire domain was no longer where it used to be. “What… what has occurred?!” Emperor Kaguya Ōtsutsuki rose from his throne, his stoic face betraying a flicker of concern. His advisor, a wary sorcerer named Tatsuya Fujiwara, clutched a glowing orb, his voice trembling. “My Emperor, our realm—it has been displaced.” As news spread, citizens looked skyward at the unrecognizable constellations, fear and awe in their eyes. Meanwhile, the Korean governors and Hoklo officials nervously contacted the imperial center, demanding answers. At the heart of the Empire, the Imperial Army, bolstered by Tactical Surface Fighters and IS units, stood ready, yet equally confused. On the fringes of the new sea boundaries, a mighty Brittanian fleet surged forward, only to be thwarted by an automated nuclear volley from the Japanese defensive AI. The missile obliterated the fleet but stirred the waking giant of the Holy Britannian Empire. Charles Zi Britannia, the monarch of that mighty nation, grunted with displeasure at the loss of his fleet. \\"We must address this situation,\\" he decided, taking along Lelouch and Nunnally as he journeyed forth to parley with the leaders of this mysterious power. In the Neo-Tokyo command center, Kaguya joined his generals, their faces grave. “They come to negotiate, but we must stand strong. Our Empire shall not falter.” Lelouch, ever observant, studied the architecture and people as their Britannian airship landed. \\"This place, it's a fusion of worlds unknown. We must tread carefully, Sister.\\" Nunnally held his hand, her mind awash with nervous excitement. \\"I believe you'll find a way, Brother.\\" The meeting was held in the Emperor's throne room, a place of ornate decoration and oppressive might. Charles, with his progeny flanking him, met the gaze of his counterpart. \\"I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, and you are?\\" “I am Emperor Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. Welcome to our Empire; amidst these unprecedented times, let us converse with honor,” spoke Kaguya with a bow, exuding a blend of humility and unyielding authority. The two emperors spoke, maintaining civility despite the underlying tension. Charles, intrigued by this unforeseen empire with its blend of tradition and enigmatic power, proposed a provisional peace. \\"We shall permit this armistice,\\" Kaguya announced, knowing full well the strength and cunning of the opponent before him. \\"For the greater good and harmony between our nations.\\" As the agreement was forged, a silent accord blossomed between Lelouch and Kaguya’s youngest daughter, the perceptive Princess Hinata. Their eyes met, both recognizing the depth of intellect within the other. Charles, satisfied with having averted immediate conflict, returned to his empire, but not before casting one final, measuring glance at the Japanese stronghold. The post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Empire and its Elemental Nations allies now stood on the precipice of a new era, their firm resolve paving the way for unity in a world of treacherous wonders and veiled threats. And as fireworks exploded in the night sky, marking the celebration that resumed in earnest, the people of the Empire looked up. Not with fear, but with hope, knowing their leaders had chartered an unprecedented course into the annals of a history unwritten.

Typically, smaller models and those that have not been pre-trained on mathematical datasets might struggle more with mathematical reasoning tasks. Here are a few suggestions: 1. **Smaller Variants of BERT**: Instead of \`DistilBertForSequenceClassification\`, you might use smaller variants of BERT like \`MiniLM\`, \`TinyBERT\`, or \`MobileBERT\`. These models are smaller and faster, but their reduced size might impact mathematical reasoning performance. 2. **Older Transformer Models**: Consider fine-tuning older transformer models like \`OpenAI GPT\` or \`Transformer-XL\`. These models might not be pre-trained with a strong focus on tasks requiring mathematical reasoning. 3. **RNN-based Models**: Models that rely on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), tend to have more difficulty with complex reasoning tasks, including mathematics, compared to transformer-based models. 4. **Custom-trained Models**: Another approach is to train a transformer model from scratch on a non-mathematical corpus and then fine-tune it on a mathematical dataset. This way, the model starts with no specialized knowledge of mathematical reasoning. 5. **Non-finetuned Multilingual Models**: Models like \`mBERT\` (multilingual BERT) that have not been specifically fine-tuned on math data in the past can become candidates for your fine-tuning project, especially if they were not exposed to a lot of mathematical content during pre-training. 6. **Models Trained on Specific Domains Other Than Mathematics**: Look for models that are pre-trained on specific domains unrelated to mathematics or formal reasoning, such as biomedical models (\`BioBERT\`, \`BioClinicalBERT\`) or legal models (\`Legal-BERT\`). Keep in mind that these models might have poor performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, but they also might not be well-suited for fine-tuning for such tasks. It can be instructive to test these models and use them as a benchmark for improvement after fine-tuning, but if your goal is to achieve the best possible performance on mathematical reasoning, it may be more effective to use state-of-the-art models known for their performance in similar tasks, such as GPT-3 or the latest BERT variants that have been pre-trained on large corpora containing diverse language examples."},{"prompt":"import torch from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel, Trainer, TrainingArguments from datasets import load_dataset # Load and preprocess the dataset dataset = load_dataset('json', data_files={'train': 'GSM2K.jsonl', 'validation': 'GSM2K.jsonl'}) # Define a function to encode the labels def encode_labels(example): example['labels'] = example['answer'] # Keep the answer as is return example # Apply the function to encode labels dataset = dataset.map(encode_labels) # No need to remove the original 'answer' column # Load GPT-2 tokenizer tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2') # Tokenize the input (this may take a while) def tokenize_function(examples): return tokenizer(examples['question'], padding='longest', truncation=True) tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True) # Ensure you have a GPU available for training (if you're using one) device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu') # Load GPT-2 model model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2').to(device) # Define training arguments training_args = TrainingArguments( learning_rate=1e-2, logging_dir=\\"./logs\\", logging_strategy=\\"steps\\", logging_steps=50, # Log every 50 steps. output_dir='./results', # output directory for checkpoints num_train_epochs=2, # number of training epochs per_device_train_batch_size=28, # batch size for training per_device_eval_batch_size=40, # batch size for evaluation warmup_steps=500, # number of warmup steps for learning rate scheduler weight_decay=0.05, # strength of weight decay evaluation_strategy=\\"epoch\\", # evaluate after each epoch save_strategy=\\"epoch\\", # save model after each epoch load_best_model_at_end=True, # whether to load the best model (according to validation) at the end of training ) # Initialize Trainer trainer = Trainer( model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=tokenized_datasets[\\"train\\"], eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets[\\"validation\\"], tokenizer=tokenizer ) # Fine-tune the model trainer.train() # Save the model trainer.save_model(\\"GPT-2-Mathematician\\")","completion":"The code you've posted appears to be a script for fine-tuning a GPT-2 model using the Hugging Face Transformers library on a custom mathematical reasoning dataset (\`GSM2K.jsonl\`). The process involves loading the dataset, tokenizing it, defining a Trainer with the specified training arguments, and then fine-tuning the GPT-2 model. However, there are a couple of issues that you should address: 1. **Incorrect Label Encoding for GPT-2**: GPT-2 is a language model that is generally not used for sequence classification tasks. Instead, it is trained to predict the next word in a sequence. If your task involves generating an answer (as a sequence of words) rather than simply classifying text, you need to adjust the preprocessing step to format the data in a way that GPT-2 can understand it during training. This might involve appending the answer to the question with a specific separator and formatting it such that the model learns to generate the text following your separator as an answer. 2. **Tokenization and Label Mapping**: GPT-2LMHeadModel expects the \`labels\` to be the same as the input IDs if you are doing language modeling. This is because, during training, the model will compare its predictions with these \`labels\` to compute the loss. The tokenization stage should therefore process both the questions and answers, and the tokenized answers should be provided as labels to the Trainer. Here's how you might modify the preprocessing function to set up for a language modeling task where the model generates an answer: \`\`\`python # Define a function to preprocess and format the input and labels for GPT-2 def preprocess_function(examples): # Concatenate the question and the answer with your chosen separation token (e.g., \\""},{"prompt":"you suddenly stop, complete please","completion":"Apologies for the interruption.

This setup can be used for sequence-to-sequence tasks where GPT-2 is intended to learn to generate the answer given a question. Here are a few things to note: 1. **Special Token Handling**: The \`<sep>\` token is not a token that's natively recognized by GPT-2, unless it was included as a special token during initial pretraining. If you want to use it as a special separator, you might have to add it to the tokenizer and re-embed it in the model's vocabulary. 2. **Adjust Tokenizer for Special Tokens**: If \`<sep>\` is indeed a custom special token, you'll need to adjust the tokenizer accordingly. 3. **Labels for Language Modeling**: For language modeling with GPT-2, the labels are usually the input IDs shifted to the right so that the language model predicts the next token at each position. This might be automatically handled by Hugging Face's \`Trainer\` when it sees \`GPT2LMHeadModel\`, but it is good practice to check and ensure that the labels are set up correctly.

It includes the steps of preparing the dataset, adding a custom separator token \`<sep>\` to the tokenizer, tokenizing the inputs, configuring the training, and running the fine-tuning process. There are a few things to correct or clarify to ensure the code runs smoothly: 1. **Adding Special Tokens**: After adding the special tokens to the tokenizer, the model's token embeddings need to be resized to account for these new tokens to avoid shape mismatch errors. 2. **Preparing Labels for Language Modeling**: For causal language modeling, you should ensure that the labels are set up correctly. Typically, the labels would be the same as the input IDs but shifted so that each token can be used to predict the next one. The Hugging Face Trainer expects \`labels\`, which it will automatically shift right internally when calculating the loss, so you might not need to do it manually. 3. **Resizing Token Embeddings**: Make sure to resize token embeddings after adding the special tokens to the tokenizer. 4. **Formatting Issue with \`<sep>\`**: The '<sep>' token might not be a recognized token for the pretrained GPT-2 model. You need to make sure that it's properly added to the tokenizer and the model knows to expect it. Here's how you can update the portion of your script to resize the token embeddings: \`\`\`python # Load GPT-2 model model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2') # Resize the token embeddings to account for new special tokens model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer)) \`\`\` Furthermore, you might want to adjust the learning rate. A learning rate of \`1e-2\` is quite high for fine-tuning language models like GPT-2, and you might experience unstable training or divergence. It’s common to use lower learning rates, such as \`5e-5\`, \`3e-5\`, or even lower, depending on the task. Once you make these adjustments, the rest of the script should run effectively and the model should fine-tune on your mathematical dataset.

I would still like to emphasize two points for you to consider: 1. **Learning rate**: The learning rate (\`1e-2\` or \`0.01\`) is unusually high for fine-tuning a model like GPT-2. Typically, learning rates for fine-tuning language models are in the range of \`5e-5\`, \`3e-5\`, or even lower. A high learning rate can lead to catastrophic forgetting (where the model quickly loses its pre-trained knowledge) or failure to converge. It’s generally safer to start with a lower rate and only increase it if necessary based on the model's performance and behavior during training. 2. **Padding Strategy**: You are padding to the maximum length sequence in the batch (\`padding=\\"max_length\\"\`). While this is a valid approach, consider that this can lead to increased computation if your sequences have significantly varying lengths. Alternatively, you could pad to the longest sequence in each batch (\`padding=\\"longest\\"\`) to optimize computation time, but keep in mind the limitations as some machine learning frameworks require tensors to be the same size across a batch. Once these considerations are addressed, your script should be ready to run. Monitor your fine-tuning process closely, observe the loss progression, make sure your model is learning, and be ready to tweak hyperparameters and preprocessing if the performance is not as expected. It's also a good idea to evaluate the fine-tuned model on a separate test set or with specific metrics that are important for your task."},{"prompt":"ValueError: Asking to pad but the tokenizer does not have a padding token.

The high memory usage can be due to large models like GPT-2, large batch sizes, long sequence lengths, or a combination of all three.

In your script, you set \`per_device_train_batch_size\` to 28.

You can truncate sequences to a shorter fixed length: \`\`\`python def tokenize_function(examples): # Adjust max_length to the sequence length that fits in your GPU memory return tokenizer(examples[\\"input_text\\"], max_length=512, truncation=True, padding=\\"max_length\\", return_tensors=\\"pt\\") \`\`\` 3. **Use gradient accumulation**: If you still want to keep a larger batch size, consider using gradient accumulation, which effectively allows you to use a larger batch size by dividing it across several backward passes. You will need to decrease \`per_device_train_batch_size\` and increase \`gradient_accumulation_steps\`: \`\`\`python per_device_train_batch_size=8, gradient_accumulation_steps=4, # This multiplies the effective batch size by 4 \`\`\` 4. **Enable mixed precision training**: If you're using an NVIDIA GPU that supports half-precision floating-point (e.g., V100, T4), you can enable mixed precision training to reduce memory usage and even speed up training. Just add the \`fp16\` flag to your training arguments: \`\`\`python fp16=True, \`\`\` 5. **Use a smaller model variant**: If the above methods don’t help, you may need to switch to a smaller variant of GPT-2, such as \`gpt2-medium\`, \`gpt2-small\` or \`distilgpt2\`. 6. **Free up GPU memory**: Make sure no other processes are consuming GPU memory. You can check running processes with the command \`nvidia-smi\` and terminate unnecessary ones. 7. **Clear cache**: You can clear up some GPU memory by emptying the cache: \`\`\`python torch.cuda.empty_cache() \`\`\` Be sure to implement these changes one at a time, and test to determine which combination works best for your setup.

For reference, the inputs it received are input_ids,attention_mask.","completion":"The error you're encountering (\`ValueError: The model did not return a loss from the inputs...\`) suggests that the \`Trainer\` is not able to compute the loss because it's not receiving the expected outputs from the model. This usually happens when the model is forwarding inputs through for evaluation or inference rather than training, so it doesn't calculate or return a loss value. When training with Hugging Face's \`Trainer\`, there's an expectation that the \`labels\` are supplied alongside the inputs so that the loss can be calculated. In language modeling tasks, the \`labels\` are typically the same as the \`input_ids\`, but they need to be part of the batch of data fed into the model. Please ensure that the \`tokenize_function\` in your script correctly sets the 'labels' key in the outputs. It should be matching the 'input_ids' because GPT-2 predicts the next token based on the previous tokens. Here's the correction in the \`tokenize_function\` to reflect that: \`\`\`python # Tokenization function with reduced max_length and including labels def tokenize_function(examples): # Tokenize inputs for language modeling tokenized_inputs = tokenizer( examples[\\"input_text\\"], max_length=512, # Adjust as needed based on GPU capacity padding=\\"max_length\\", truncation=True, return_tensors=\\"pt\\" ) # In language modeling, the labels are the same as the input IDs tokenized_inputs[\\"labels\\"] = tokenized_inputs[\\"input_ids\\"].clone() return tokenized_inputs \`\`\` After making this adjustment, the \`Trainer\` should be able to compute the loss using the returned logits and labels.

This type of quantization is often used for deployment on edge devices or inference on CPUs where computational resources are constrained, and the hardware supports INT8 operations for acceleration. Hugging Face's Transformers library does not natively support INT8 quantization as of my last update; it mainly supports FP16 (mixed precision) training out of the box, mainly used to speed up training on compatible NVIDIA GPUs with Tensor Cores. If you're looking to use INT8 quantization for inference rather than training, you would typically do this as a post-training process using a platform such as: - **TensorRT**: NVIDIA's SDK for high-performance deep learning inference, which includes support for INT8 quantization. It is commonly used for optimizing models to run on NVIDIA GPUs. - **ONNX Runtime**: A performance-focused engine for ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) models, which supports a variety of optimizations including quantization. - **TFLite**: TensorFlow Lite supports post-training quantization that can convert weights to INT8. - **PyTorch Quantization**: PyTorch offers a quantization api for quantization-aware training and post-training quantization that supports INT8. Implementing INT8 quantization would typically involve converting your pretrained or fine-tuned model to the format supported by one of these tools and applying the quantization process. You would then use the tools' respective runtime for inference. Keep in mind that quantization can affect the accuracy of your model, so it's important to evaluate the quantized model's performance to ensure it meets your requirements. For real-time inference directly in PyTorch, as of my last update, PyTorch supports quantization with INT8 weights for both CPUs and certain GPUs, but it's a more involved process that requires understanding of PyTorch's quantization workflows and potentially altering the model's forward pass to use quantized operations. If you're looking to do this, I recommend reviewing PyTorch's quantization documentation and tutorials to get started."},{"prompt":"Can i use the tensor cores in my GPU \\"Tesla T4\\" to accelerate the training instead of using the CUDA cores in the GPU ?","completion":"Yes, the Tesla T4 GPU is equipped with Tensor Cores, which are specialized hardware cores designed to accelerate certain types of computations commonly used in deep learning, such as matrix multiplications and convolutions. Tensor Cores are particularly efficient at performing mixed-precision arithmetic, which combines single-precision (FP32) and half-precision (FP16) floating-point operations to speed up computation and reduce memory usage. To leverage Tensor Cores during training, you can enable mixed-precision training in your deep learning framework of choice. In PyTorch, for example, you can utilize the \`torch.cuda.amp\` API (Automatic Mixed Precision) to enable mixed-precision training. Similarly, Hugging Face's Transformers library supports mixed-precision training with the \`fp16\` option in the \`TrainingArguments\`. Mixed-precision training has the following benefits: - **Speed**: Tensor Cores can perform operations faster than CUDA cores alone by using FP16 while maintaining most of the benefits of FP32 precision. - **Memory Efficiency**: FP16 requires half the memory compared to FP32, which means you can potentially double your batch size or train larger models without running out of memory. Here’s how you can enable FP16 (mixed-precision) training with Hugging Face's \`Trainer\`: \`\`\`python from transformers import TrainingArguments training_args = TrainingArguments( # ... your other training arguments ... fp16=True, # Enable mixed precision training ) \`\`\` Before running your mixed-precision training, make sure you have the necessary support in terms of both software (e.g., an appropriate version of PyTorch that includes \`torch.cuda.amp\`) and hardware (an NVIDIA GPU with Tensor Core support, which the Tesla T4 has). Moreover, when enabling mixed precision, you might need to adjust your optimizer or scale the loss to handle the lower precision arithmetic properly. Keep in mind that while mixed-precision training can lead to substantial performance improvements, it may also affect training stability and model accuracy. This is usually not a significant problem, but it is something to be aware of and to monitor during training. It's often recommended to include a loss scaler when using mixed precision to mitigate potential underflow issues during the backward pass."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic, sensible, plausible, dialogue-filled, exposition-filled alternate history science fiction, high fantasy, dark fantasy, urban fantasy, magical realism, science fantasy, Japanese light novel style, Chinese wuxia epic style, military techno-thriller action drama in the form of a Japanese harem anime/manga/light novel, romantic comedy, Isekai slice of life, light fantasy style crossover of the Code Geass anime, manga, video game and light novel franchise, the Magika Swordsman and Summoner light novel and manga franchise, the Muv-Luv visual novel, manga and anime franchise, the IS: Infinite Stratos light novel, anime, manga and video game franchise, the Hundred anime, manga and light novel franchise, the Tenchi Muyo!

However, I can provide a substantial excerpt from an imagined opening chapter that includes some of the elements and the narrative style requested: --- Chapter 1: Transposition and Turmoil On the dawning of the fifth anniversary of the restoration, the skies above the lavish Imperial Palace in Kyoto shimmered with an unnatural iridescence. Within the palace's grandest hall, Emperor Kazuki Ōtsutsuki—descendant of the Marasaki lineage—raised his goblet, the light from the chandeliers sparkled against his divine features, ancestral to the Jurai Empire. \\"To the Empire's unyielding spirit!\\" he proclaimed. The hall, crowded with those of noble blood and honored samurai, erupted in cheers. But the revelry was short-lived as a violent tremor shook the earth, and an intense light swallowed the palace and all within it. --- In the science wing of the palace, amidst the chaos, a young researcher, Ayaka Kashin, stumbled back from her equipment. The readings were beyond comprehension, the reality-bending experiment had gone awry. Before she could utter a warning, she too was engulfed by the brilliant glow. --- As the light dimmed, the people of the empire found themselves in an unfamiliar land. The skies stretched wide with a hue different from the one over Kyoto. From the windows of the palace, which stood unscathed amidst foreign architecture, Kazuki observed an imposing fleet on the horizon. Their banners bore the crest of the Holy Britannian Empire. One of his retainers, a battle-hardened samurai embellished in IS: Infinite Stratos armor, approached the emperor. \\"My lord, the Britannian fleet approaches with intent. We stand ready to defend our sovereignty.\\" Kazuki's gaze didn't waver. \\"I shall not let our celebration be marred by bloodshed. Ready the chakra-powered armaments. We must send a message.\\" --- The Britannian fleet, under the command of the sagacious Emperor Charles Zi Britannia, neared Japanese waters, their intentions set on conquest. Lelouch and Nunnally stood by their father's side on the flagship's deck. As the ships advanced, a single projectile sliced through the air, its tail flame outshining the sun. The missile's impact left nothing but echoed silence where the fleet once sailed. A demonstration of power, beyond even Charles’ calculations. --- Days later, beneath the white flags of truce, an assembly was convened. Chilled air hung between the dignitaries as Charles Zi Britannia, flanked by his children, sat across from Kazuki. The room, a melting pot of anxiety and anticipation, resonated with the tick of the antique clock on the mantelpiece, a survivor of the cataclysmic event. Lelouch, ever the observant prince, studied the Japanese ruler. \\"You've made your position clear, Emperor Kazuki. What is it you seek from Britannia now?\\" His voice resonated with precocious authority. Kazuki regarded the young prince with a subtle nod, acknowledging his courage. \\"An accord,\\" he began, \\"one that acknowledges the sovereignty of our Empire and opens the doors to an alliance that can bring peace and prosperity to our world.\\" Charles stroked his beard, eyes narrowing. \\"And should we refuse, what then? We have witnessed the might of your chakra weapons.\\" \\"Then,\\" Kazuki replied, \\"we shall transcend the limitations of warfare and evolve into something greater. This power you've seen is but a fraction of our capability. We can defend ourselves, Emperor Charles. It would be in our best interests to coexist as equals.\\" Silence settled once more, only to be broken by the sound of Nunnally's innocent inquiry. \\"Why do you fight? Can't we all just be friends and help each other?\\" A smile, genuine and warm, graced Kazuki's lips. \\"That is my utmost wish, young princess.\\" Charles, recognizing the deadlock, conceded with a nod. \\"Very well, an accord it shall be.\\" --- Amidst the vastness of this amalgam world, the post-cataclysm Japan had found its foothold. The alliance with Britannia was but the first step in a dance of diplomacy, magic, and ancient power. As Emperor Kazuki stood on the palace's balcony, looking out to the stars that once governed his ancestors, he knew the future was rife with the unknown. But for now, Japan stood united and strong, its people ready to embrace their destiny in a world both strange and wondrous."},{"prompt":"Soit un miroir sphérique concave de rayon 10 cm.

En substituant ces valeurs dans l'équation, nous avons : [ frac{1}{-15} - frac{1,7}{s} = frac{1 - 1,7}{-10} ] [ -frac{1}{15} - frac{1,7}{s} = frac{0,7}{10} ] [ -frac{1}{15} - frac{1,7}{s} = 0,07 ] [ frac{1,7}{s} = -0,07 - left( -frac{1}{15} right) = -0,07 + frac{1}{15} ] [ frac{1,7}{s} = -0,07 + 0,0667 ] [ frac{1,7}{s} = -0,0033 ] [ s = frac{1,7}{-0,0033} ] [ s ≈ -515,15 ] cm Donc, la distance de l'objet serait approximativement -515,15 cm, ce qui signifie que l'objet est situé du côté incident (c'est-à-dire du même côté que l'image réelle) à une distance de 515,15 cm du sommet du dioptre. La réponse qui se rapproche le plus est : c.

Autres d. son rayon est négatif Choisissez la bonne réponse ?","completion":"Un dioptre est divergent quand : b. Il est concave Dans le contexte de l'optique, un dioptre (surface de séparation entre deux milieux d'indices de réfraction différents) est considéré comme divergent lorsqu'il fait diverger les rayons lumineux qui le traversent. C'est le cas avec un dioptre concave du point de vue du milieu le plus réfringent (où l'indice de réfraction est le plus élevé). Donc, lorsqu'un rayon lumineux passe d'un milieu d'indice élevé vers un milieu d'indice plus faible à travers un dioptre concave, il s'éloigne de l'axe optique après la réfraction, ce qui caractérise un comportement divergent. Le terme \\"convexe\\" s'appliquerait à un dioptre qui rassemble les rayons lumineux, donc un dioptre convergent. Quant à l'option \\"son rayon est négatif\\", cela décrit généralement un aspect de la géométrie des surfaces sphériques et non pas directement si le dioptre est divergent ou convergent ; cela dépend de la perspective depuis laquelle on considère le rayon (du point de vue du milieu incident ou du milieu transmis)."},{"prompt":"Pour un dioptre plan, l'image A' d'un objet A est plus rapprochée quand : a. le dioptre plan est convergent b. n > n' c. le dioptre plan est divergent d. n < n' Choisissez la bonne réponse ?","completion":"Pour un dioptre plan, qui est une surface de séparation entre deux milieux avec des indices de réfraction différents, il n'y a pas de convergence ou divergence de la lumière au sens strict comme avec les dioptres sphériques. Cependant, le changement apparent de la position d'un objet dépend des indices de réfraction des deux milieux. Quand la lumière passe d'un milieu à indice de réfraction plus élevé (n) vers un milieu à indice de réfraction plus faible (n'), un objet semble être plus éloigné qu'il ne l'est en réalité. Inversement, quand la lumière passe d'un milieu à indice de réfraction plus faible vers un milieu plus réfringent, l'image paraît plus rapprochée. Donc, l'image A' d'un objet A est plus rapprochée quand : b. n > n' C'est à dire, lorsque l'indice de réfraction du milieu duquel la lumière provient (n) est supérieur à l'indice de réfraction du milieu dans lequel la lumière entre (n')."},{"prompt":"Soit un dioptre plan séparant deux milieux d'indices n et n'.

La loi de la réfraction (également connue sous le nom de loi de Snell-Descartes) indique que lorsqu'un rayon lumineux passe d'un milieu à un autre, il se plie en fonction des indices de réfraction des deux milieux selon la relation : [ n sin(theta) = n' sin(theta') ] où : - ( n ) est l'indice de réfraction du milieu initial, - ( theta ) est l'angle d'incidence, - ( n' ) est l'indice de réfraction du milieu dans lequel le rayon entre, - ( theta' ) est l'angle de réfraction. Pour un dioptre plan, cependant, il n'y a pas d'angle au point d'incidence ou de réfraction (les rayons arrivent et repartent avec le même angle), mais il y a un changement apparent dans la hauteur ou la profondeur de l'image due à la différence des indices de réfraction. Cette relation est donnée par le rapport de l'indice de réfraction du milieu où se trouve l'objet à celui du milieu d'où l'observation est faite : [ HA' = HA times frac{n}{n'} ] où : - ( HA ) est la hauteur réelle de l'objet, - ( HA' ) est la hauteur apparente de l'image due à la réfraction.

Pour trouver cet angle limite lorsque le rayon passe d'un milieu moins réfringent vers un plus réfringent (n < n'), nous utilisons la loi de Snell-Descartes pour la réfraction, qui s'énonce : [ n sin(i) = n' sin(r) ] où : - ( i ) est l'angle d'incidence, - ( r ) est l'angle de réfraction, - ( n ) et ( n' ) sont les indices de réfraction des deux milieux respectivement. Dans le cas de l'angle limite de réfraction pour un rayon passant du milieu plus réfringent vers le moins réfringent, le rayon sort avec un angle de 90° par rapport à la normale, c'est-à-dire qu'il glisse le long de la surface. Cependant, ici, le rayon passe d'un milieu d'indice n = 1,4 à un milieu d'indice n' = 1,67 et l'angle d'incidence i est de 25°. L'angle limite de réfraction est donc l'angle de réfraction qui correspondrait si le rayon allait passait de n' à n. Si on cherchait l'angle limite de réfraction dans ce contexte, l'angle de réfraction serait 90° parce que c'est l'angle à partir duquel la réfraction totale interne a lieu. Donc, il y aurait une incompréhension ici puisque le rayon passe déjà d'un milieu moins réfringent vers un plus réfringent, où il n'y a pas d'angle limite de réfraction. Le rayon sera toujours réfracté dans le deuxième milieu. Pour un rayon passant de n à n', nous pouvons calculer l'angle de réfraction en utilisant la valeur de l'angle d'incidence i = 25°.

IMPERIAL THRONE ROOM, NEO-JAPANESE EMPIRE — DAY The air crackles with electricity as the room flickers in and out of existence. Members of the Ōtsutsuki clan, dressed in a blend of traditional Imperial robes and high-tech armor, stand at attention. The Strategic Defense Room is abuzz with activity, holographic screens highlighting the unfamiliar star maps and vast unfamiliar territories. EMPEROR HAYATO ŌTSUTSUKI, a firm yet benevolent ruler with keen eyes marking his Jurai heritage, is in conference with SHOGUN TOKUGAWA, the military commander with a balance of old-world samurai stoicism and new age strategy. EMPEROR HAYATO (translated from Japanese) The veil of reality has been torn asunder. This new world, rich with resources and rife with potential allies and foes... it is our destiny to forge a path here. SHOGUN TOKUGAWA (adjusting his katana) And of the Britannian fleet that approached our shores? We stand upon unknown ground. Caution is our ally as much as our sword. GENERAL FUBUKI, a veteran of countless battles, joins them. Behind her, a backdrop of Tactical Surface Fighters and IS units underscores the might of this newly transported empire. GENERAL FUBUKI The AI defense network acted preemptively... The Britannian threat is no more. But this show of force has consequences. The hologram of Emperor Charles Zi Britannia flickers to life, his presence emanating imperial gravitas, even across galaxies. Lelouch and Nunnally stand beside him, their future entwined with the fate of this encounter. EMPEROR CHARLES (on hologram) (voice strong and resonant) Your empire strikes a hard bargain, Hayato Ōtsutsuki. This display of power... Draconian, yet effective. Let us parley for peace, not further destruction. Overhead, the ceiling mimics a night sky, ever the reminder of the shared cosmic heritage, Jurai and Ōtsutsuki, that now sits at the helm of this fledging empire. EMPEROR HAYATO To peace then—to a new era where our peoples may find common ground. But know this, Charles Zi Britannia, any transgression will be met with the might of the Jurai-Shinso bloodline. Our legacy shall not be tarnished. Charles nods, calculating, his eyes betraying a glint of respect for this unforeseen adversary. EMPEROR CHARLES (on hologram) (resolute) Very well. Let the history books record this day when two emperors reached across the stars—for peace, and for the advancement of our peoples. As the negotiations draw to a close, the atmosphere in the throne room is one of quiet triumph. They have averted war, but the journey ahead is rife with the unknown. The empire must now navigate the complex web of this amalgamated world. Lelouch steps forward, his strategic mind already turning. He catches Hayato's eye, equally measuring him. LELOUCH (whispered to Nunnally) Here, in this crucible of worlds, our destiny will unfold. And it begins with understanding this empire of the sun. --- As the scene closes, we're left with the image of two empires, ancient and noble, standing on the precipice of a new age. Magic, might, and mecha stand as testament to their power, while a host of potential conflicts and camaraderies await in the amalgamated horizons.

В мире Genshin Impact Эмбер и Путешественник встречаются в разрушенном боевом арене, и между ними начинается спарринг, чтобы определить, кто из них станет чемпионом дружелюбного турнира. Путешественник, обладающий силой Анемо, использует свой элементальный навык \\"Ладонь вихря\\" для создания вакуумного вихря, который обрушивается на Эмбер, стремясь прервать её цепочку атак и нарушить её стратегию боя. Эмбер быстро откатывается назад и маневрирует, избегая вихря. В ответ Эмбер активирует своего верного спутника, Барона Зайчика. Зайчик привлекает внимание Путешественника, отвлекая его от основной цели и создавая возможность для Эмбер собраться с силами.

Торнадо Путешественника встречает дождь стрел Эмбер, и, в завершающий момент, оба соперника отступают, представляя зрителям захватывающее шоу навыков и мастерства.

Sura 34:50 commands Muhammad to say, “If I go astray, I go astray only to my own loss,” which is a severe factual error in the Qur’an as well as contradicting the teaching of the Qur’an in a number of other verses Reply: The verses is Say, “If I should err, I would only err against myself. But if I am guided, it is by what my Lord reveals to me. Indeed, He is Hearing and near..(34;50) First of all,the verse starts with “IF’‘.So It is not a definite condition at all. Secondly if Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wa aalihi wasallam would be wrong,then he could not have continued. [It is] a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. And if Muhammad had made up about Us some [false] sayings, We would have seized him by the right hand Then We would have cut from him the aorta And there is no one of you who could prevent [Us] from him.(69;43-47) . But as my Holy Prophet Muhammad s.a.w.w had continued to preach the revealtion of Allah,it means that infact,He was totally and absolutely right.He was guided by Allah’s revealation.The second condition mentioned in the verse was true for Prophet Muhammad s.a.w.w. Another verse form Holy Quran, So rely upon Allah ; indeed, you are upon the clear truth..naml 79 Note that there is no IF or but in the verse mentioned above,but there is a word INDEED so it is the true condition that Prophet Muhammad s.a.w.w. was on clear truth,guided by Allah’s revelation.","completion":"Revised Response: Concerning the liability in the event of Muhammad's error, Surah 34:50 states that Muhammad is instructed to proclaim, “If I err, I err only to my detriment.” This assertion appears to represent a significant misstatement within the Qur’an, while also seemingly conflicting with the Qur'an's teachings elsewhere. Regarding the passage, It reads, “Say, ‘If I err, my error impacts only myself. Yet if I am rightly guided, it is due to my Lord's revelations. Truly, He is All-Hearing, All-Near.’ (34:50)” Initially, we must recognize that the verse opens with “IF,” indicating a hypothetical scenario rather than an absolute one. Moreover, had Muhammad (peace be upon him and his family) been mistaken, his prophetic mission would not have endured. The text proclaims: This message is surely a revelation from the Lord of all worlds. Had Muhammad fabricated any falsehoods about Us, We would have surely seized him by his right hand, And then severed his lifeline, And not one among you could have defended him. (69:43-47) Given that our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him and his family) continued to disseminate Allah's revelations, it signifies that in reality, he was entirely and unequivocally correct. He was guided by the revelation of Allah. The latter scenario depicted in the initial verse reflects Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon him and his family) true state. Another verse from the Holy Qur'an affirms: So, place your trust in Allah; indeed, you stand upon the plain truth. (An-Naml 79) It's important to note that unlike the previous verse with ‘IF,’ this verse utilizes the term ‘INDEAD,’ reinforcing the indisputable truth that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him and his family) was on the clear truth, guided by Allah’s revelation."},{"prompt":"reword this: Critic: How did the angels know about humans?

The descent was a literal one, being cast out of a higher plane or realm (the heavenly Garden) to a lower one.. 15:28-44,. 38:71-85 Reply: Anyone of you can check it that nothing about the descent of Prophet Adam a.s. is discussed in any of these 2 surahs. Secondly the word used in both surahs for Iblees to be expelled is “fakh’ruj” ,and the root word is “khrj” which means “out” I agree that the descent was literal,but not because of these references,but the word “Ihbit” _to go down/slip down (in surah baqarah) Heavens are at a higher place than the world.AND WORLD IS NOT PARADISE__HEAVENS /PARADISE and WORLD are two different places.

Reply: Prophet Adam a.s,His wife,and Iblees,these 3 are mentioned ,and for three, plural is to be used. It was the matter of predestination for which Adam a.s. could NOT be blamed. Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, “Adam and Moses argued with each other. Moses said to Adam. ‘O Adam! You are our father WHO DISAPPOINTED US AND TURNED US OUT OF PARADISE.’ Then Adam said to him, ‘O Moses! Allah favored you with His talk (talked to you directly) and He wrote (the Torah) for you with His Own Hand. Do you blame me for action which Allah had written in my fate forty years before my creation?‘ So Adam confuted Moses, Adam confuted Moses,” the Prophet added, repeating the Statement three times. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 77, Number 611) According to Quran,it was decided before the creation of Adam a.s. that He would be the viceroy of Allah on the Earth.

There is no such concept in Islam that Adam a.s caused the offspring to be expelled from Heavens","completion":"The query regarding how angels could have knowledge of humans is addressed with the assertion that absence of explicit explanation in the Qur'an does not equate to contradiction. In discussing why only Adam (peace be upon him) was taught names and not angels, the reply emphasizes that the purpose was not to challenge but to demonstrate the unique capacity endowed upon humanity by Allah, a capacity not given to angels. The act of teaching Adam the names serves to underscore the bestowed gift of knowledge, reason, memory, logic, and intelligence upon humans, which surpasses that of angels. This knowledge and intelligence are reasons humans were placed on Earth for a trial to determine their deeds. The critic's mention of angels bowing before humanity is responded to by stating that the gesture was an honorific one, comparable to how some Christians may bow or kneel before religious leaders, which is not considered worship. Regarding the criticism of Satan being reprimanded for not bowing to Adam, the reply clarifies that \\"angels\\" is a plural term and Iblis was the sole figure who refused obedience. Satan's nature is discussed, with the Qur'an explicitly identifying Iblis as a jinn, not an angel, citing Quran 18:50. When questioned about the silence of the Qur'an on the creation of angels, the reply remains firm that this does not represent a contradiction. In response to the issue of Adam existing in heaven, it is explained that the purpose was multifaceted: to alert Adam and Eve of their enemy Iblis, to convey that those who follow divine guidance will not suffer, and to proclaim Allah's forgiving nature for those who repent. It is affirmed that Adam's descent to Earth was a literal relocation, evidenced by the Quranic term \\"Ihbit,\\" which means to descend or go down. Lastly, addressing the claim that Adam's sin affected all future generations, the response points out that Quranic plural references can also include Adam, Eve, and Iblis, without assigning blame to Adam for predestined actions. The debate between Prophets Moses and Adam is cited to illustrate that it was considered unjust to blame Adam for his actions, which were predestined. The Qur'an had already proclaimed the intention to establish a steward on Earth before Adam was created, showing that his stay on Earth was preordained and not a punishment."},{"prompt":"reformat this: Critic: How did the angels know about humans?

Critic: And how does the naming of things justify the creation of man despite all the evil and violence he will commit?

Critic: Fourth, Iblis or Satan is blamed for not worshiping Adam even though the command was given to angels Reply: Angels ,malaaikah. It is a plural word, just see the meanings of the singular. It is angel, cadre, and personnel. Iblees was the only one who refused to obey. Critic: Iblees,angel or jinn Reply: Clearly mentioned in quran that Iblees was a jinn. “Behold!

Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful..Baqarah 37 We said, “Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance – there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve….Baqarah 38 Critic: This therefore shows that the descent wasn’t solely in rank or position. The descent was a literal one, being cast out of a higher plane or realm (the heavenly Garden) to a lower one.. 15:28-44,. 38:71-85 Reply: Anyone of you can check it that nothing about the descent of Prophet Adam a.s. is discussed in any of these 2 surahs. Secondly the word used in both surahs for Iblees to be expelled is “fakh’ruj” ,and the root word is “khrj” which means “out” I agree that the descent was literal,but not because of these references,but the word “Ihbit” _to go down/slip down (in surah baqarah) Heavens are at a higher place than the world.AND WORLD IS NOT PARADISE__HEAVENS /PARADISE and WORLD are two different places. But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been.

Reply: Prophet Adam a.s,His wife,and Iblees,these 3 are mentioned ,and for three, plural is to be used. It was the matter of predestination for which Adam a.s. could NOT be blamed. Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, “Adam and Moses argued with each other. Moses said to Adam. ‘O Adam! You are our father WHO DISAPPOINTED US AND TURNED US OUT OF PARADISE.’ Then Adam said to him, ‘O Moses! Allah favored you with His talk (talked to you directly) and He wrote (the Torah) for you with His Own Hand. Do you blame me for action which Allah had written in my fate forty years before my creation?‘ So Adam confuted Moses, Adam confuted Moses,” the Prophet added, repeating the Statement three times. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 77, Number 611) According to Quran,it was decided before the creation of Adam a.s. that He would be the viceroy of Allah on the Earth. And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, “Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.” They said, “Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?” Allah said, “Indeed, I know that which you do not know….Baqarah 30..

Critic: \\"Why was the knowledge of names taught only to Adam and not to angels?\\" Reply: The intent was to highlight the unique ability granted to humans by Allah, an ability that angels do not possess. Critic: \\"How can the naming of things justify the creation of man, despite the potential for evil and violence?\\" Reply: The act symbolizes the endowment of knowledge and cognitive faculties—reasoning, memory, logic, intelligence—proving humanity's superiority over angels and setting the stage for the earthly trial of deeds. Critic: \\"Why the command for angels to bow before man?\\" Reply: This was a gesture of respect, not of worship, akin to how Christians may show reverence to religious figures without it being considered worship. Critic: \\"Why is Iblis, or Satan, blamed for not worshiping Adam when the order was for angels?\\" Reply: \\"Angels\\" is a plural term; the singular denotes an individual angel, cadre, or member. Iblis alone chose to defy the command. Critic: \\"Is Iblis an angel or a jinn?\\" Reply: The Quran specifies that Iblis was a jinn, as stated in [Al-Quran 18:50], where all angels except for Iblis, a jinn, obeyed the command to bow to Adam. Critic: \\"Why is there no account of the creation of angels in the Quran?\\" Reply: This does not represent a contradiction. Critic: \\"Why was Adam in heaven initially if he was meant to dwell on Earth?\\" Reply: Three reasons are provided: 1. To reveal that Iblis and humans are adversaries. 2. To affirm that followers of Allah's guidance will not endure hardship. 3. To demonstrate Allah's readiness to forgive those who repent. Critic: \\"The descent from the Garden suggests that it was a literal fall to a lower realm, not just in rank.\\" Reply: Surahs 15:28-44 and 38:71-85 do not describe Adam's descent. The word \\"fakhruj\\" means \\"out,\\" implying expulsion, and \\"Ihbit\\" from Surah Al-Baqarah indicates a literal descent from a higher place (heaven) to a lower one (earth). Critic: \\"Adam's sin seems to have impacted all his progeny, as the plural form is used.\\" Reply: The plural is used because it references Adam, his wife, and Iblis. Adam is not blamed for a predestined event. The dialogue between Prophets Moses and Adam, as reported by Abu Huraira, shows Adam's actions were part of his fate, acknowledged before his creation. Moreover, the Quran reveals that it was predetermined for Adam to be a caretaker on Earth, and this dialogue suggests that Moses' accusation was a personal stance, not established fact. In Islam, there is no concept of Adam's actions causing his descendants to be banished from heaven."},{"prompt":"reword this: Allah, Adam, and the Angels.

If in a group of three people,anyone says that I have submitted my will before Allah i.e I am going to deny my will,I am just going to do whatever I have been ordered by Allah.It means that the person is the first of all those three to be a Muslim.Similarly,in a different group,if anyone else says the same,he would also be considered as first Muslim among those people..i.e in that group.","completion":"Understanding the Concept of the First Muslim: The perceived contradiction concerning who the first Muslim was dissolves when one comprehends the definition of 'Muslim'. A Muslim is someone who surrenders their will to Allah. For example, in a group of three individuals, if one person declares they have surrendered their will to Allah—meaning they reject personal desires to faithfully follow Allah's commands—this person is regarded as the first Muslim within that particular trio. Likewise, in a different group, anyone making a similar declaration would be seen as the first Muslim among that assembly.

Reply: The collection of ahadees of Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim are most authentic. It is narrated on the authority of Masruq that he said: I was resting at (the house of) ‘A’isha that she said: O Abu ‘A’isha (kunya of Masruq), there are three things, and he who affirmed even one of them fabricated the greatest lie against Allah. I asked what they were. She said: He who presumed that Muhammad (may peace be upon him) saw his Lord (with his ocular vision) fabricated the greatest lie against Allah. I was reclining but then sat up and said: Mother of the Faithful, wait a bit and do not be in a haste. Has not Allah (Mighty and Majestic) said: “And truly he saw him on the clear horizon” (al-Qur’an, lxxxi. 23) and “he saw Him in another descent” (al-Qur’an, liii. 13)? She said: I am the first of this Ummah who asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) about it, and he said: Verily he is Gabriel. I have never seen him in his original form in which he was created except on those two occasions (to which these verses refer); I saw him descending from the heaven and filling (the space) from the sky to the earth with the greatness of his bodily structure. She said: Have you not heard Allah saying: “Eyes comprehend Him not, but He comprehends (all) vision. And He is Subtle, and All-Aware” (al-Qur’an, vi. 103)? (She, i. e. ‘A’isha, further said): Have you not heard that, verily, Allah says: “And it is not vouchsafed to a human being that Allah should speak unto him otherwise than by revelation, or from behind a veil, or that He sendeth a messenger (angel), so that he revealeth whatsoever He wills. Verily He is Exalted, Wise” (al-Qur’an, xlii. 51) She said: He who presumes that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) concealed anything from the Book, of Allah fabricates the greatest lie against Allah. Allah says: “O Messenger! Deliver that which has been revealed to thee from thy Lord, and if thou do (it) not, thou hast not delivered His message” (al-Qur’an, v. 67). She said: He who presumes that he would inform about what was going to happen tomorrow fabricates the greatest lie against Allah.

Reply: ‘No vision can grasp Him.’ (6.103) Critic:Or can a person only know Allah from revelation, through a messenger, and/or behind a veil where Allah remains hidden? Response: A person can know Allah by heart,by finding His signs in the Universe. But Allah will speak by revelation,or by a messenger or behind a veil. And it is not for any human being that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a partition or that He sends a messenger to reveal, by His permission, what He wills.

Did Muhammad witness Allah or Gabriel?\\" Response: According to Surah Al-Najm (53:1-18), Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) witnessed one of the greatest signs from Allah, which was in fact the angel Gabriel. The Quran informs us that Allah cannot be seen with the eyes, a concept supported by authenticated hadiths. Question: \\"Who holds the correct view about Muhammad's vision? Was it Ibn Abbas and the majority, or was it Aisha, Ibn Masud, Abu Hurayra, and Abu Dharr who affirmed that Muhammad did not see his Lord, but rather Gabriel?\\" Response: Authenticated hadiths from Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim have significant authority. 'Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her), the Prophet's wife, categorically stated that anyone who claims the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) saw his Lord with his physical eyes attributes what is the greatest falsehood. She referenced Quranic verses emphasizing that Allah is beyond the capacity of human sight and speaks to humanity by revelation, from behind a veil, or through a messenger. The aforementioned verses are Quran 81:23, Quran 53:13, and Quran 6:103, respectively. Question: \\"Is it possible for a believer to see Allah in this life, in a vision or visible form?\\" Response: The Quran clearly states, \\"No vision can grasp Him\\" (Quran 6:103), indicating that Allah's essence is beyond visual perception in this life. Question: \\"Can a person only truly know Allah through revelation, the messages of a messenger, and/or from behind a veil, keeping Allah unseen?\\" Response: While one can perceive Allah through observing signs in the universe and in the heart's recognition, Allah communicates with humanity only through revelation, by sending a messenger, or from behind a veil, as dictated in Quran 42:51. Question: \\"If Allah can be observed, was Aisha incorrect in invoking Surahs 6:103 and 42:51 to assert the opposite?\\" Response: While Aisha was not incorrect and her opinion is supported by authenticated hadiths, Islamic teachings also hold that Allah will be seen by believers in the Hereafter, and it is only those who are wrongdoers who will be unable to see Him, as indicated in Surah Al-Mutaffifin (83:15).

S. 32:3 reiterates that Muhammad's message is meant to admonish a people who hadn't received a warner beforehand. S. 35:42 remarks on how the people swore they would heed a warner if one was provided, yet when given one, they strayed further. S. 36:2-6 describes Muhammad as being tasked to warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, suggesting they lack prior knowledge of such messages. S. 6:155-157 speaks of the Quran as a guide and mercy, revealing the people’s lack of earlier divine books and their unfamiliarity with the teachings granted to others. S. 34:44 and S. 43:21 express there were no previous books acknowledged or messengers known to these populations before Muhammad.

So, a.Zakhoom,the site is mentioned in 37:64 i.e. the bottom of hell fire. b.Ghisleen or foul pus.It would be the ONLY food for those who: Were given authority(69:29) Were wealthy (69:28) Did not believe in Allah(69:33) Did not encourage the feeding of poor (69:34) c.Similarly,daree’ would be the only food for the particular type of evil doers or in a particular level of Hell.","completion":"**Addressing the Alleged Contradictions Concerning the Punishment of Eating in the Qur'an** **Critic's Observation:** It has been noted that within the discussion of punishment in the Qur'an, there appear to be three contradictory statements: 1. The reference to \\"Eating of the tree of Zaqqum\\" mentioned in Qur'an 37:66, seems to be at odds with the claim that the damned \\"will eat only Dhari\\" as per Qur'an 88:6. 2. Moreover, the same phrase \\"Eating of the tree of Zaqqum\\" (Qur'an 37:66), appears to conflict with the statement that the damned \\"will eat only foul pus\\" found in Qur'an 69:36. **Reply:** **First Point:** One must consider that the Qur'an describes Hell as having seven distinct gates, hinting at different levels within it [Quran 15:44]. These levels are Jahannam, Laza, Saqar, Hutamah, Jaheem, Saeer, and Hawiyah. Given this structure, it is plausible that the sustenance for the residents of each level varies. **Second Point:** In Surah Al-Haaqqah, it is specified that certain perpetrators will be punished with a specific type of sustenance, which will be unique to them [Quran 69:36]. **Conclusion:** The inhabitants of Hell will have their punishment sustenance determined not only by the actions that led them there but also potentially by their assigned level within Hell. Therefore: a. Zaqqum is mentioned in Qur'an 37:64 as originating from the depths of Hell. b. Ghisleen, or foul pus, is designated as the sole nutritional punishment for those who: - Held positions of authority and power [Quran 69:29]. - Were wealthy and indulgent in life [Quran 69:28]. - Denied the existence of Allah [Quran 69:33]. - Neglected the care and feeding of the impoverished [Quran 69:34]. c. Similarly, Daree' is cited as the exclusive punishment sustenance reserved for a particular group of wrongdoers or those in a specific level of Hell. In conclusion, the food for those in Hellfire varies depending on the sins they have committed and the level of Hell they inhabit, resolving the perceived contradictions."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsicalAxolotl","completion":"\\"Colorful Axolotl Art | Versatile Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Gift Idea | Vibrant Creature Illustration\\""},{"prompt":"reformat this: Critic: the Qur’an explicitly states that one angel or several angels are causing certain people to die [Sura 4:97, 16:28, 32, 32:11] Reply: Angels take away the souls of living people,causing them to die ,under the divine order.

If a plug a charger from another laptop that has a 3.16A of output, will work?","completion":"Using a charger with a lower amperage output than the original can potentially cause issues. Here's what you need to consider: 1. Voltage: The voltage of the new charger should match the voltage of the original charger. Using a charger with a different voltage can damage your laptop. 2. Amperage: The amperage (A) of the new charger needs to be the same or higher than the original. If the new charger has a lower amperage, it might not be able to supply enough current to power the laptop or charge the battery effectively. Your laptop may run, but it might charge very slowly or not at all when it's powered on. 3. Connector: The plug on the charger must fit your laptop's charging port and have the correct polarity. Using a charger that provides only 3.16A when your original charger provided 9.16A could potentially lead to overheating of the charger, insufficient power being supplied to the laptop, and possibly even damage to the laptop if you attempt to use it for an extended period.

A gentle breeze murmured through the birch trees that lined the dusty path, where figures began to emerge from the dimming light. Among them was Arya Stark, a young woman whose name had become etched in the annals of legend—a survivor, a warrior, a nomad whose journeys felt as boundless as the lands she traversed. The path led Arya to a quiet village, nestled on the outskirts of Winterfell, where smithies’ fires glowed like earthbound stars, casting a warm light on the soot-stained faces of their tenders. Among these craftsmen was a man whose own legend was woven with Arya’s—the bastard of Robert Baratheon, the skilled blacksmith, Gendry. Arya approached the forge, where the rhythmic hammering of metal upon the anvil served as a familiar melody to their reunion. Gendry’s strength had not waned, his arms still powerful as they shaped the molten steel to his will, the fire reflecting in the depths of his focused eyes. “Gendry,” Arya called out, her voice steady yet layered with emotions that betrayed years of separation. At the sound of her voice, Gendry paused mid-swing, turning to face the woman who had haunted his thoughts since the day they parted. In an instant, their eyes met, an unspoken language flowing between them—a mixture of surprise, joy, and an undercurrent of sorrow for time lost. “Arya Stark, as I live and breathe,” Gendry replied, a grin breaking free from the boundaries of his typically stoic facade. They spoke for a time, exchanging stories and catching their friendship as best they could where it had left off. Arya’s voice, once sharp like the edge of Needle, had mellowed to a timbre that spoke of her journeys and the wisdom harvested along the way. And then, in the midst of their conversation, Arya halted, a shadow flickering in her eyes that Gendry couldn’t place. It was as if a wave of determination had washed over her. Without a word, Arya stepped closer, her hands grasping the edges of her tunic. Before Gendry could utter a question or raise a hand to stop her, Arya tore her tunic open in one swift, decisive motion. The air seemed to still around them, a gasp caught in Gendry’s throat as he bore witness to the impossible—Arya’s form began to shift, the lines of her face warping, her body contorting in ways that defied reality. In truth, it was no spell of a Red Priestess or the trickery of a Faceless Man—it was something far simpler, yet equally as astounding. What had seemed to be Arya Stark before him was now a meticulous creation; an artifice built and worn with expertise—almost a husk that had masked the true identity of the person within. As the facade fell away, it revealed none other than Sansa Stark, standing before Gendry with a regal poise that contrasted the wild edge Arya had always embodied. Sansa’s auburn hair cascaded down her shoulders, and her eyes, now a soft blue, held a depth that spoke of the burdens she had borne as Lady of Winterfell. Her expression was solemn, hinting at the importance of the secret she had been carrying, now laid bare. “Sansa,” Gendry breathed, his mind struggling to piece together the dissonance of the situation. “Why? How?” Sansa stepped forward, her hands gentle but firm upon his shoulders. “Forgive the deception, Gendry, but there are matters at play that necessitated... discretion. Arya is abroad on crucial business; it’s me who needed to see you.” Her gaze held his, reflecting a storm of emotions and unsaid words. It was clear that this meeting, shrouded in the guise of another, was more than a mere encounter—it was a prelude to events that could shape the fate of the Seven Kingdoms. Sansa, with the mantle of leadership draped over her shoulders, had chosen this moment to reveal herself, to Gendry, a trusted ally, for reasons only she could fully understand. “What matters?” Gendry asked, the weight of Sansa’s presence anchoring him to the gravity of the moment. Sansa’s lips parted to speak, her voice now carrying the future within its tones, ready to sweep Gendry into the heart of the silent storm she navigated as the Lady of the North. The unmasking was complete, and with it, a new chapter was poised to begin—one that would test the bonds of loyalty, the strength of will, and the unyielding resolve of those who bore the name Stark."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

The code correctly mixes the colors following the specified conditions and prints the resulting color, or it prints an error message if the colors do not match the expected inputs. However, there could be some potential issues or unexpected behavior depending on the context: 1. If the user inputs an unexpected value or a color not specified in the code (not \\"красный\\", \\"синий\\", or \\"желтый\\"), the program will print \\"ошибка цвета\\", which means \\"color error\\". 2. There is no handling for case sensitivity. If a user enters \\"Красный\\" (with a capital letter), it will be considered as an incorrect color and result in \\"ошибка цвета\\". 3. No stripping of whitespace is performed. If the user enters a color with leading or trailing spaces, it won't match any condition and will result in \\"ошибка цвета\\". If encountering problems, you might want to consider the following modifications: \`\`\`python c1, c2 = input().strip().lower(), input().strip().lower() # rest of the code remains the same \`\`\` Using \`strip()\` removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and \`lower()\` converts the input to lowercase, which makes the input comparison case-insensitive."},{"prompt":"Анализ данных Управленческие данные Качественные данные Количественные данные Очистка данных Предобработка данных База данных Дашборд График Диаграмма Инфографика KPI (Key Performance Indicator) Визуализация данных Интерактивная визуализация Таблица данных Эксель (Excel) Тенденция данных Корреляция Регрессионный анализ Доверительный интервал Гистограмма Среднее значение Медиана Мода Дисперсия Стандартное отклонение Минимум и максимум Выбросы (аномалии) Тренд Шум (в данных) Пропущенные значения Интерполяция Экстраполяция Гипотеза A/B-тестирование Корреляционный анализ Статистическая значимость Определение причинно-следственных связей Тестирование гипотез Прогнозирование Регрессия Машинное обучение Кластеризация Классификация Разведочный анализ данных (EDA) Big Data Временные ряды данных Точечная диаграмма (scatter plot) Box plot Heatmap Столбчатая диаграмма Круговая диаграмма Воронка продаж ROC-кривая Плотность распределения Парные диаграммы (pair plots) Временные графики (time series plots) Линейная регрессия Логистическая регрессия Нейронные сети Принципы хорошей визуализации данных Информационная эффективность визуализации Кластерный анализ Факторный анализ Корреляционная матрица Ковариация Точечная оценка Граф сетевой структуры Контингентный анализ Социометрия Статистический анализ данных Методы квантификации мнений Эмпирические данные Сценарный анализ Альтернативные сценарии Ресурсные ограничения Экономический анализ создай ментальную карту используя только данные определения. сгруппируй данные определения на ментальной карте исходя из определений и смысловой нагрузки","completion":"Создание ментальной карты — это процесс визуального структурирования, который помогает систематизировать информацию и идеи по тематическим группам.

Additionally, because both platforms are vast and diverse, it's difficult to make a general statement about the nature of their respective communities as a whole. However, there are some factors that might influence the behavior and culture of communities on Twitch and YouTube: 1. **Interaction Style**: Twitch is primarily a live streaming platform that fosters real-time interaction between streamers and their audiences. This immediacy can create a sense of closeness and community among regular viewers and streamers, which might encourage more positive behavior. 2. **Moderation Tools**: Twitch provides streamers with various tools to moderate their chatrooms, such as chat filters, bans, timeouts, and the help of volunteer moderators. Proactive streamers can create a more controlled environment, which could contribute to a kinder community. 3. **Shared Live Experiences**: The live nature of Twitch can lead to a shared sense of experience and camaraderie that is less common on YouTube, where content is typically consumed individually and asynchronously. 4. **Communities Around Personalities**: Both platforms have communities centered around content creators' personalities. On Twitch, this can be amplified by the live interaction, leading to potentially stronger bonds and a more dedicated and kind community for some channels. 5. **YouTube Anonymity and Scale**: YouTube has a much larger user base than Twitch, and its comment sections often allow for more anonymity. This can sometimes foster negative behavior, as users might feel more detached from the content creators and other commenters. Additionally, with the vast amount of content on YouTube, moderation can be more challenging. 6. **Purpose and Content Type**: The type of content on each platform influences the communities. Twitch is more focused on gaming, creative content, and just chatting streams, while YouTube has a broader range of content. Certain content niches can attract different kinds of communities, with some being more supportive and kind than others. It is important to note that both platforms have kindness and toxicity, and generalizing isn't accurate or fair to the diverse groups within each community. Both Twitch and YouTube have supportive, engaging users, as well as those who may engage in harmful behavior. Content creators and viewers often carve out their own spaces with unique community norms and expectations, which can run counter to the broader stereotypes of each platform. Ultimately, to understand the nuances of these communities, one must look at the specific channels, creators, and types of content that foster different community cultures."},{"prompt":"Scrivi una relazione di laboratorio sulla preparazione di una soluzione a concentrazione nota e sua diluizione con le seguenti istruzioni: 1.

Materiali: - Bilancia analitica - Sostanza NaCl (cloruro di sodio) - Provette graduate o pipette - Cilindro graduato da 50 mL - Becher o fiasco volumetrico da 50 mL - Distillatore d'acqua o acqua distillata/demineralizzata - Colorante alimentare - Agitatore magnetico o bacchetta di vetro Procedimento: Parte 1: Preparazione della soluzione 0,4M di NaCl: 1. Calcolo della massa di NaCl da pesare: Dati: - Molarità (M) = 0,4 mol/L - Volume (V) = 50 mL = 0,05 L - Peso molecolare (PM) del NaCl = 58,44 g/mol Molarità (M) = moles di soluto / volume di soluzione in litri moles di soluto = Molarità (M) × Volume (V) moles di NaCl = 0,4 mol/L × 0,05 L = 0,02 mol Massa (m) = moles × peso molecolare (PM) massa di NaCl = 0,02 mol × 58,44 g/mol = 1,1688 g Arrotondando, si pesano 1,17 g di NaCl. 2. Pesar con accuratezza, usando una bilancia analitica, 1,17 g di cloruro di sodio (NaCl). 3. Trasferire il NaCl pesato in un fiasco volumetrico o in un becher. 4. Aggiungere una quantità di acqua distillata minore di 50 mL per sciogliere il NaCl, agitando con un agitatore magnetico o una bacchetta di vetro. 5. Una volta che tutto il NaCl è disciolto, aggiungere acqua distillata fino al segno di taratura di 50 mL sul fiasco volumetrico per ottenere una soluzione esattamente 0,4M. 6. Agitare nuovamente la soluzione finché non è omogenea. Parte 2: Aggiunta di colorante: 1. Aggiungere alcune gocce di colorante alimentare nella soluzione 0,4M di NaCl per facilitare la visualizzazione della diluizione. 2. Mescolare bene per assicurarsi che il colore sia distribuito uniformemente nella soluzione. Parte 3: Diluizione della soluzione a 0,25M: 1. Calcolo del volume finale necessario per ottenere una soluzione a 0,25M partendo da una soluzione a 0,4M. Si usa la formula di diluizione: C1V1 = C2V2 dove C1 è la concentrazione iniziale, V1 il volume iniziale, C2 la concentrazione finale e V2 il volume finale dopo la diluizione. V2 = (C1V1) / C2 V2 = (0,4M * 25 mL) / 0,25M V2 = (10 mL) / 0,25 V2 = 40 mL Quindi, per diluire la soluzione a 0,25M, è necessario aggiungere acqua fino a raggiungere un volume finale di 40 mL. 2. Prelevare con la pipetta 25 mL della soluzione 0,4M colorata. 3. Trasferire i 25 mL in un becher o in un altro fiasco volumetrico adatto. 4. Aggiungere acqua distillata fino a raggiungere il volume finale di 40 mL. 5. Agitare la soluzione per assicurarsi che la diluizione sia uniforme. Conclusioni: Sono state preparate con successo due soluzioni: una soluzione iniziale di NaCl 0,4M e una soluzione diluita a 0,25M. Il processo ha richiesto calcoli accurati e precise tecniche di laboratorio per garantire la corretta concentrazione delle soluzioni. Questa relazione mostra come la preparazione di una soluzione a concentrazione nota e la sua successiva diluizione sono fondamentali in laboratorio per eseguire esperimenti con precisione e accuratezza. Utilizzando le corrette tecniche di diluizione e i calcoli appropriati, si può ottenere una serie di soluzioni con concentrazioni desiderate a partire da una soluzione madre."},{"prompt":"Write a fully detailed story about a man lying on a couch, dozing off.

The Wife says with this, before reaching up and opens up her body, revealing Princess Zelda underneath. She shakes off the rubbery husk, and twirls around. The man is in shock. He sits up, gazing at the remains of his wife. He begins to asks what is going on, before ‘Zelda’ cuts him off with a gloved finger on his lips, before smiling, reaching up and gripping her back. She pulls and pulls, her face and body distorting as she peels it all off, until finally Alyx Vance emerges from the Zelda costume. She tosses the Zelda suit onto the ground, before taking the man’s face into her hands, and giving him a kiss. The man pulls away, and ‘Alyx’ laughs. She lets go off the man, and reaches up to her face. With both hands she slowly peels her face off, the Wife’s face appearing with a grimace. She finally manages to remove the Alyx mask fully, and drops that on the ground as well.

The room was dimly lit, with the fading sunlight painting shadows that danced upon the walls. His eyelids, heavy with the promise of rest, surrendered to sleep's gentle lure as he gave in to a dozing state. Life had been a marathon lately, and moments of repose like these were precious to him. A sensation, tender but deliberate, roused Jacob from his slumber. His vision swam into focus, and there stood his wife, Jane, leaning over him. Her presence was both startling and comforting as he blinked away the vestiges of his nap. \\"Jane? What's the matter, darling?\\" His voice was a soft grog emerge from the depths of his throat. \\"Nothing's the matter,\\" she replied, her voice an odd mix of calm and anticipation. She held her hand out, revealing her wedding ring glinting in the muted room. \\"Hold onto this for me, sweetheart. Just until I'm finished.\\" Jacob's brow furrowed as he took the ring, the cool metal a stark contrast against the warmth of his palm. \\"Finished with what?\\" he asked, a tone of concern inching into his question. \\"With this,\\" Jane said cryptically. She reached up to her body and, to Jacob's bewilderment, began to unzip her very skin. It was as if she was shedding an outer layer, and beneath the visage of his wife stood Princess Zelda in all her regal finery. The rubbery husk slumped to the floor, a discarded chrysalis, and 'Zelda' twirled with an ethereal grace. Jacob's mind raced to catch up with the spectacle unfolding before him. He sat bolt upright, his eyes wide with incredulity as he sought some semblance of reason. He opened his mouth to demand an explanation, but the woman—no longer his wife, nor the Hyrulean princess—placed a gloved finger gently upon his lips. \\"Shhh,\\" Zelda whispered, her smile enigmatic. Without another word, she too began to contort and change, her hands grasping at her back and pulling at her own skin. With a sound like velcro, she peeled away yet another costume to reveal Alyx Vance, the familiar heroine from the virtual realm known to him. The Zelda suit joined the heap on the ground as 'Alyx' stared into Jacob's stunned face. Her hands, now free of any royal adornment, cupped his cheeks, drawing him into a kiss that was meant to be comforting but sent waves of disorientation instead. He pulled away, gasping for breath, as the woman before him laughed—a sound both jarring and out of place. \\"Who are you?\\" Jacob’s voice was a desperate plea, his hands gripping the edge of the couch as if to anchor himself in this world that had tipped into the surreal. But she didn't answer. Instead, 'Alyx' reached up to her face and began to peel off this new layer, revealing the grimacing face of his wife underneath. With a grotesque slowness that defied reality, Jane removed the final mask and was herself again, or so it appeared. She flung the Alyx costume aside, the frivolous disregard for these alternative identities leaving Jacob speechless. \\"Now, my ring, please,\\" Jane said as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred, stretching her hand out expectantly. But Jacob sat there, the simple band of gold lying heavy in his palm, his own identity suddenly uncertain. His mind a torrent of emotions, he realized that the boundaries between reality and fantasy, the familiar and the surreal, had blurred beyond his comprehension. Reeling from the disassociation, he had to wonder; was this truly his Jane, or yet another layer of fantasy waiting to be shed? As he placed the ring into her outstretched hand, Jacob was left pondering the nature of the reality they shared, now questioning the very fabric of the life and the love he thought he knew."},{"prompt":"what you model name","completion":"I am OpenAI's language model, known as ChatGPT.

Пісня як текст Пісні - це не просто музичні композиції, вони також є формою тексту. Кожне суспільство має свій унікальний спосіб поєднання тексту з музикою, передачі значень і включення пісень у ширший культурний контекст. Як лінгвістичні одиниці, вони ілюструють зв'язок між формою і значенням, запрошуючи до міждисциплінарних досліджень від музикознавства до різних лінгвістичних галузей, таких як фонологія і семантика (Australian Journal of Linguistics, 2010). Формальні властивості пісень включають текстовий компонент, який може мати обмеження, наприклад, обмежений словниковий запас або певну кількість складів. Ці обмеження часто поєднуються з музичною структурою, яка включає тональні, ритмічні та динамічні елементи. Вирівнювання наголошених складів з музичними долями або існування формул і паралелізму створюють додаткові складнощі в пісенних текстах (Australian Journal of Linguistics, 2010). Значення, що передаються піснями, можуть бути багатогранними, виходячи за межі традиційних семантичних принципів. Вони подібні до поезії у своїй здатності нести в собі безліч значень і резонансів. Значення кодуються не лише в тексті, але й через взаємодію музики, танцю та візуальних образів, які потребують культурних знань для повного сприйняття (Australian Journal of Linguistics, 2010). Розуміння форми і структури пісень часто вимагає міждисциплінарного підходу. Такі терміни, як \\"ритм\\", \\"наголос\\" і \\"тон\\" можуть мати різне значення в лінгвістиці та музикознавстві, що робить спільні визначення критично важливими для міждисциплінарної роботи (Turpin and Stebbins, 2010). Визначення пісні, що використовується в лінгвістичних дослідженнях, є широким і включає пісенні тексти, визнані спільнотами як придатні для виконання. Це визначення охоплює пісенні жанри, що виконуються без чіткої мелодійної структури, такі як наспіви (Australian Journal of Linguistics, 2010). Аналіз пісень передбачає розгляд як лінгвістичної, так і музичної структур. Ієрархія ритму, обмеження темпу та відповідність тексту і музики є важливими аспектами аналізу пісні. Крім того, структура пісні може впливати на використовувані мовні форми, що свідчить про тісний зв'язок між пісенними конвенціями та мовою (Australian Journal of Linguistics, 2010; Dell and Elmedlaoui, 2008). Лексичне значення слів у піснях може бути багатозначним, часто виходячи за межі їхніх повсякденних мовних значень. Ця складність може призвести до різної інтерпретації слухачами і, як наслідок, до \\"нерозчутих\\" текстів пісень (Schebeck, 2002; Wright, 1954). Пісенні тексти можуть нести в собі референтні значення, які глибоко вкорінені в їхньому культурному контексті, часто вимагаючи спеціальних культурних знань для повного розуміння. Пісні можуть супроводжуватися пояснювальними розповідями, які прояснюють їхнє контекстуальне значення (Merlan, 1987; Basso, 1996). Пісні слугують мнемонічними засобами, допомагаючи кодувати і пригадувати інформацію, події та місця. Вони особливо корисні в дописьменних суспільствах, але зберігають свою мнемонічну корисність навіть у грамотних культурах (Basso, 1996; Feld & Basso, 1996). Інтерактивні значення в піснях кодують соціальну динаміку між співаками і слухачами, відображаючи очікування і ставлення в контексті виконання. Ці значення є жанрово-специфічними і залежать від пісенної традиції та соціального статусу виконавців (Turpin and Stebbins, 2010). Конотативні значення в піснях викликають концепції, поведінку та події, пов'язані з мовою, що використовується в пісні, її виконанням або самим музичним жанром. Емоційні реакції також є невід'ємною частиною значення пісні, коли певні мелодії чи фрази можуть викликати певні почуття у культурних слухачів (Australian Journal of Linguistics, 2010; Patel, 2008). Отже, існує постійна потреба в міждисциплінарних дослідженнях пісень як текстів, у вивченні лінгвістичних і музичних взаємодій, передачі смислу та унікального культурного значення пісні в різних суспільствах (Marett & Barwick, 2007; Australian Journal of Linguistics, 2010). The_Language_of_Song_Some_Recent_Approac.pdf Пісні як текст Концепція пісні як тексту охоплює не лише текст пісні, а й усю музичну композицію як форму тексту, що містить структуровану розповідь або послання до аудиторії. Без адекватного розуміння культурних кодів оцінити повний задум і нюанси музичного виконання буде складно. Пісні, як і будь-які інші культурні артефакти, вбудовані в складну матрицю суспільних значень та очікувань, часто вимагаючи від слухача культурної компетентності, щоб повністю зрозуміти вплив і тонкощі виконання [1]. Музика і структура Подібно до структурної динаміки, що спостерігається у поезії чи оповіданні, музика використовує композиційні структури для передачі наративу чи емоційної подорожі. Партнерство між музикою та мовою, особливо у випадку атональної музики, ілюструє, як текст може керувати музичною еволюцією та формою. Намагання західної художньої музики на початку 20-го століття відійти від тональності є прикладом порожнечі, яку заповнила мова, надавши композиторам логічну структуру. Наприклад, здатність Шенберга отримувати структурні підказки з лібрето уможливила швидке написання його твору \\"Erwartung\\", який є яскравим прикладом того, як текст може суттєво впливати на музичне структурування [2]. Музика та сторітелінг Переклад історії в музичну ідіому пов'язаний з певними труднощами, особливо в поєднанні різних видів мистецтва, як-от перехід від тексту до музики. У той час як \\"абсолютна музика\\" не має прив'язаної історії, \\"програмна музика\\" містить її. У прагненні до такої інтеграції зовнішні тексти іноді використовуються для розширення музичного наративу, як у композиції, натхненній \\"Подорожжю до Візантії\\" Єйтса, що поєднує окремі теми та використовує мультимедійні елементи для посилення оповіді [3]. Музика і синтаксис Для східних композиторів, які працюють у західному музичному просторі, інкорпорація рідної ідіоми є складним завданням, про що свідчать унікальні композиційні методи тайської музики. Прийняття специфічних тайських музичних характеристик, таких як центризація та ієрархічна ритмічна структура, ілюструє процес інтеграції культурного музичного синтаксису в нову композицію [4]. Музика і слова Поп-музика, незважаючи на свою простоту у порівнянні зі складною художньою музикою, має загадкову здатність переносити слухачів через покоління. Її суть може полягати в її гармонійній структурі. Особливий характер гармонічного розвитку поп-музики, що часто надає перевагу домінантово-субдомінантовим відносинам над домінантово-тонічними, відображає вплив блюзу та його ліричних тем труднощів і туги. Сучасна поп-музика продовжує спадщину блюзу з його акордовими прогресіями та тематичним наповненням, демонструючи нерозривний зв'язок між гармонією та лірикою [5]. Висновок Підходячи до міждисциплінарної тематики, необхідно дотримуватися балансу, пропонуючи технічне розуміння, не втрачаючи при цьому доступності. Ця дискусія має на меті заохотити вийти за межі своєї спеціалізації, щоб знайти паралелі та перетини, особливо при розгляді музики як складної форми тексту, що дозріла для міждисциплінарного вивчення. Сподіваємося, що розуміння взаємозв'язку між різними формами мистецтва, такими як музика і мова, призведе до більш багатого і змістовного залучення до людської творчості [6]. https://www.academia.edu/71420011/Another_Road_An_Intersection_of_Music_and_Language Пісні як текст Музика стала невід'ємним і невіддільним компонентом сучасних голландських похоронних церемоній, відображаючи індивідуальність через дедалі різноманітніший вибір пісень. Така еволюція у виборі музики була спричинена розвитком технологій крематоріїв, що уможливило більш особистий підхід у виборі та відтворенні музики, яка резонує як з померлим, так і з рідними та близькими (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). Похоронні бюро зараз зазвичай пропонують ресурси, включаючи плейлисти і мультимедійні посилання, щоб допомогти людям з важкою втратою у виборі музики, часто відіграючи заспокійливу роль у цьому процесі (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Viper et al., 2020). Значення музики на похоронах узгоджується з ширшими психологічними функціями музики, такими як сприяння самоусвідомленню, зміцнення соціального зв'язку та регулювання настрою й емоцій (Schäfer та ін., 2013). Вибрана музика на похоронах часто слугує вшануванню пам'яті померлого, виконуючи роль музичного панегірика, і виходить за рамки лише тексту. Хоча текст пісні впливає на вибір, загальний зв'язок пісні з покійним часто відіграє більш важливу роль. Більшість поп-пісень не пишуться спеціально для покійного, що свідчить про те, що асоціації з померлим можуть виникати з фраз, назв пісень або навіть просто з самої музики, відокремленої від тексту (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). Незважаючи на персоналізований характер сучасних похоронів, певні пісні часто з'являються знову, натякаючи на спільність у цих добірках, яка може виходити за межі текстів, що потенційно можна виявити за допомогою лінгвістичного аналізу текстів популярної похоронної музики (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). References: - Bruin-Mollenhorst, J., & Hoondert, M. (2018). - Bruin-Mollenhorst, J. (2020). - Viper, S., et al. (2020). - Schäfer, T., et al. (2013). Характеристики музики та тексти пісень Mollenhorst з колегами (2016) показали, що похоронна музика, як правило, характеризується нижчою валентністю, енергією і темпом порівняно з популярною музикою, що вказує на її більш урочистий і спокійний характер. Хоча ці висновки підкреслили емоційний вплив усієї пісні, окрема роль тексту окремо не розглядалася. Розуміння слів як окремого тексту має вирішальне значення, оскільки вони можуть суттєво впливати на емоційний резонанс пісні, полегшуючи зв'язок для слухачів (Ali & Peynircioğlu, 2006; Brattico та ін., 2011; Fiveash & Luck, 2016). Дослідження показують, що текст може посилювати емоції в сумній музиці, але потенційно стримувати їх у веселій, тому вибір музики з особливою увагою до її тексту може бути ключовим фактором регуляції настрою (Garrido, 2017; Van den Tol & Edwards, 2013; Van den Tol, 2016; Eerola et al., 2015; Hanser et al., 2016; Saarikallio & Erikkilä, 2007; Ter Bogt et al., 2017; Cotter et al., 2019; Hanser et al., 2021).

(2017). - Van den Tol, A.J.M., & Edwards, J. (2013). - Van den Tol, A.J.M. (2016). - Eerola, T., et al. (2015). - Hanser, W.E., et al. (2016). - Saarikallio, S., & Erikkilä, J. (2007). - Ter Bogt, T.F.M., et al. (2017). - Cotter, K.N., et al. (2019). - Hanser, W.E., et al. (2021). Лінгвістичні властивості та ліричний зміст популярної музики Дослідження лінгвістичного змісту та властивостей пісенних текстів виявляє разючі контрасти в емоційній тональності між сумною та веселою музикою. Аналіз LIWC показав, що сумні пісні, як правило, містять більше негативних виразів, таких як смуток і гнів, тоді як веселі пісні демонструють більш позитивні настрої і більше слів у теперішньому часі (Garrido, 2017). Крім того, займенники відіграють ключову роль: збільшення кількості займенників другої особи (you, yours) пов'язане зі зростанням популярності та симпатії до пісні, що потенційно підтверджує зв'язок між текстами пісень і соціальною спорідненістю (Packard & Berger, 2020). З часом популярні музичні тексти, здається популярні музичні тексти свідчать про посилення фокусу на собі та зменшення позитивності й соціальної орієнтації (DeWall та ін., 2011; Rude та ін., 2004; Tauschik & Pennebaker, 2010). Проте, незважаючи на ці загальні тенденції, романтичні теми залишаються домінуючими в популярній музиці, а прямі посилання на теми смерті та вмирання є порівняно рідкісними (Christenson та ін., 2019). References: - Garrido, S. (2017). - Packard, G., & Berger, J. (2020). - DeWall, C.N., et al. (2011). - Rude, S.S., et al. (2004). - Tausczik, Y.R., & Pennebaker, J.W. (2010). - Christenson, P.G., et al. (2019). Це дослідження Це дослідження вивчає музичні та лінгвістичні властивості популярних похоронних пісень у Нідерландах, щоб зрозуміти збіги та розбіжності в межах і поза межами специфічного похоронного контексту. Висунуто гіпотезу, що похоронна музика відрізняється меншою валентністю, енергійністю і танцювальністю, а також більшою акустичністю і схильністю до мажорної тональності, що, як правило, відповідає сумній музиці. Лінгвістичний аналіз припускає, що похоронна музика містить більше негативних слів, менше фокусується на сьогоденні і більше згадок про сім'ю, друзів, смерть і релігію порівняно з контрольними піснями, а також очікується, що часті слова, пов'язані з романтичними стосунками, будуть помітними як у похоронних, так і в контрольних піснях. Mollenhorst, G., et al. (2016). Обмеження Методологічні підходи, такі як використання програмного забезпечення для підрахунку кількості слів, мають свої обмеження, оскільки вони не враховують контекст слів або складні взаємозв'язки. Крім того, значення API Spotify не є повністю прозорими, що вимагає додаткової емпіричної роботи для встановлення їхньої достовірності. Врахування культурних відмінностей та різноманітних підкатегорій у жанрі похоронної музики відкриває подальші шляхи для дослідження. Незважаючи на ці обмеження, поточне дослідження додає значних знань до розуміння похоронної музики та висвітлює складний взаємозв'язок між музичними характеристиками, текстовими особливостями та емоційною корисністю. References: - Pennebaker, J.W., et al. (2015). - Howlin, C., & Rooney, B. (2020). - Spotify for Developers (2021). Це дослідження є внеском у тонке розуміння того, як музика функціонує як текст на похоронах, забезпечуючи фундамент, на якому майбутні дослідження можуть побудувати більш глибоке розуміння взаємодії між музичним вираженням і текстуальністю текстів у комеморативних практиках. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00302228221075471?icid=int.sj-full-text.citing-articles.17 Пісні як текст: Метафори смерті в текстах металістів Металева музика часто заглиблюється в тематичні дослідження смерті, використовуючи її як метафору у своїх текстах для відображення філософських роздумів про людський стан. Одна з таких інтерпретацій смерті концептуалізується як шлях до кінцевого пункту призначення, як у пісні Sentenced \\"We Are but Falling Leaves\\", де неминучість смерті символізує фраза \\"Eventually all paths will lead to the cemetery\\". Це метафоричне зображення віддзеркалює поширені приказки, які відображають кінцевий підсумок життя, пропонуючи універсальну подорож до смерті. Прирівнюючи життєві шляхи до доріг, що ведуть на цвинтар, Sentenced викликає відчуття наперед визначеної долі, проводячи паралелі з приказкою \\"всі дороги ведуть до Риму\\", хоча і з більш похмурим фіналом (1). Інша репрезентація міститься в пісні \\"Lower the Flags,” where “Lower the flags / A good man has passed / He has reached the last of frontiers \\" інкапсулює традиційне вшанування померлих з приспущенням прапорів, а \\"last of frontiers \\" вказує на перехід від життя до смерті. Термін \\"reached \\" означає активну подорож, з чого випливає, що смерть - це останній рубіж, до якого рухається кожна людина (1). References: 1. Analysis of “We Are but Falling Leaves” and “Lower the Flags” by Sentenced. Смерть як кінець життєвої подорожі Метафора \\"Життя - це подорож\\" глибоко вкорінена в людській психіці, де народження знаменує початок, життя - прогрес, а смерть - кульмінацію. Наприклад, у пісні \\"No One There\\" гурту Sentenced \\"Відчуття, що я дійшов до кінця своєї дороги\\" вказує на близькість героя до смерті, що потенційно може означати втрату сенсу життя або роздуми про самогубство. Супровідні тексти змальовують яскраву картину через образи, пов'язані з самогубством, самотністю та очікуванням смерті, демонструючи інтенсивний емоційний стан, підживлений відчаєм (\\"The axe, the bottle and the rope / The feeling there really is no more hope / The thought of the great unknown / And facing it all alone\\"...) (1). Більше того, слова пісні \\"The feeling of finally coming back home\\" з тієї ж пісні можна інтерпретувати як повернення до стану небуття, подібно до того, як полум'я згасає або залишає смертну подорож у невідомість. Полегшення, що мається на увазі під словом \\"нарешті\\", передбачає прийняття, навіть бажання цього кінця, подібно до розради, яку знаходить людина, повернувшись додому після виснажливої подорожі. Це піднімає тему на інший рівень, де смерть є не просто кінцевою точкою, а поверненням додому (\\"Бо моє ім'я - скорбота і я подруга страждання / Я позбавила себе любові заради вічної муки / І я навіть не смію спробувати - я знаю, що можу тільки втратити / Візьми мене додому / До того, кому я належу\\") (1). References: 1. Analysis of “No One There” by Sentenced. Висновок про метафори смерті в ліриці Sentenced Ця теза підкреслює незліченну кількість метафоричних виразів смерті в ліриці Sentenced. Хоча метафори часто зображують смерть з нейтральної або навіть доброзичливої точки зору, в сукупності вони створюють відчуття фаталістичного прийняття. Хоча категоризація цих метафор виявилася багатогранною, охоплюючи \\"Життя - це рік\\", \\"Люди - це рослини\\", \\"Смерть прямує до кінцевого пункту призначення\\", а також кілька інших комбінованих і одиничних категорій, вони незмінно вказують на неминучу природу смерті (1). Застосування цих категорій у лінгвістичному дослідженні текстів метал-пісень Sentenced сприяє розумінню метафоричного використання в цьому музичному жанрі та підкреслює важливість смерті як повторюваної теми. Незважаючи на те, що дослідження зосереджене на одному гурті, воно відкриває можливості для ширшого аналізу в межах жанру металу, посилюючи важливість лінгвістичного розуміння текстів не лише як підпорядкованого елементу музики, але й як самодостатнього літературного твору (1).

Кожна культура має свої унікальні шляхи інтеграції словесного контенту з музикою, передачі значень і вставлення пісень у широкий культурний контекст. У піснях як лінгвістичних одиницях особливо яскраво простежується зв'язок між формою і змістом, пропонуючи широкі перспективи для міждисциплінарних досліджень у таких сферах, як музикознавство та лінгвістика [1]. **Музичні і текстові структури** Текствовий компонент пісні нерідко обмежується ритмічною і мелодійною структурою: обмежений словник, строгий розмір складів, наголошені склади у відповідності з музичними долями [2]. **Багатозначність пісні** Пісні здатні нести в собі багаторівневі значення, часто виходячи за рамки традиційного текстового аналізу. Вони переростають у форму поетичного мистецтва з усіма його нюансами, сенсами і послідовностями [3]. **Проблема вивчення** Розкриття всього змісту пісні вимагає комплексного підходу, який поєднує в собі знання з різних областей: у певному сенсі, ритм і тон пісні в музикознавстві та лінгвістиці не є однаковими поняттями [4]. **Лінгвістика пісні** Та й саме визначення пісні у лінгвістичному дослідженні досить широке. Воно охоплює не тільки пісні з чіткою мелодичною структурою, а й такі, котрі співаються без неї [5]. **Аналіз текстів** Аналіз текстів пісень включає вивчення як текстуальної, так і музичної компонент, з їхньою ритмічною ієрархією та обмеженнями темпу [6]. **Лексичне значення** Слова у піснях часто переходять звичайні межі їхніх значень, що призводить до багатошарових інтерпретацій [7]. **Культурний контекст** Пісні можуть містити референтні значення, які глибоко вкорінені в їхньому культурному контексті, потребуючи спеціальних знань для повного розуміння [8]. **Мнемонічна функція** Пісні допомагають запам'ятовувати інформацію і події, особливо у суспільствах, де письменність не розвинена [9]. **Інтерактивні значення** Тексти пісень містять певні значення, що регулюють взаємодію між виконавцем і слухачем, відображаючи соціальну динаміку [10]. **Конотативні значення** Пісні евокують певні концепції та емоції, що стають частиною їхньої конотації [11]. **Загальний висновок** Необхідний постійний пошук міждисциплінарних зв'язків для глибшого розуміння пісень як текстів, які сполучають у собі лінгвістичні особливості, музичні перипетії та культурну цінність [12]. **Література**: [1] Australian Journal of Linguistics, 2010.

It has a complexity of O(m), where m is the size or number of files in the folder. - Copying the zipped file (\`!cp {zip_file} \\"{drive_folder_path}\\"\`) is a single operation, but it depends on the size of the zipped file.

Let's go over a couple of simple examples to understand how Big O notation is used to describe time complexity: # Example 1: Constant Time Complexity – O(1) An algorithm that takes a constant time to perform an action regardless of the size of the input data set. \`\`\`python def print_first_element(my_list): print(my_list[0]) my_list = [4, 2, 3, 5, 9] print_first_element(my_list) \`\`\` No matter how large \`my_list\` is, this function will always only print the first element, therefore, it runs in O(1) time complexity. # Example 2: Linear Time Complexity – O(n) An algorithm whose performance scales linearly with the size of the input data set. \`\`\`python def print_all_elements(my_list): for element in my_list: print(element) my_list = [4, 2, 3, 5, 9] print_all_elements(my_list) \`\`\` As \`my_list\` grows in length, the number of print operations grows linearly with it. Therefore, the time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. # Example 3: Quadratic Time Complexity – O(n^2) An algorithm where the time to complete is proportional to the square of the number of elements in the input data set. \`\`\`python def print_pairs(my_list): for item1 in my_list: for item2 in my_list: print(item1, item2) my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4] print_pairs(my_list) \`\`\` For each element in the list, this function prints pairs with every element in the list, including itself. If \`my_list\` has n elements, then it will print pairs \`n * n\` times. The time complexity for this function is O(n^2). # Example 4: Logarithmic Time Complexity – O(log n) An algorithm that cuts the problem size in half each step (common in \\"divide and conquer\\" algorithms). \`\`\`python def binary_search(sorted_list, target): left = 0 right = len(sorted_list) - 1 while left <= right: mid = (left + right) // 2 if sorted_list[mid] == target: return mid elif sorted_list[mid] < target: left = mid + 1 else: right = mid - 1 return None my_sorted_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11] target = 9 index = binary_search(my_sorted_list, target) \`\`\` Binary search eliminates half of the remaining elements at each step by dividing the list into halves, and thus has a time complexity of O(log n).

It is studied in the fields of computer vision and visual perception. In essence, SfM techniques use feature matching algorithms to find correspondences across a set of images that contain different views of the same scene or object. By analyzing the movements of these features across the set of images and knowing the camera parameters (or sometimes estimating them as part of the process), SfM algorithms can infer the three-dimensional structure of the scene and the relative motion of the camera. Here's a high-level process of how SfM works: 1. **Feature Detection**: Identify key points or features within each image. These features should be easily recognizable and findable in other images of the set. The features could be specific corners, edges, or other distinct visual elements. 2. **Feature Matching**: Determine which features in one image correspond to features in another image. This involves comparing feature descriptors to find the best matches, often with some form of distance metric. 3. **Motion Estimation**: By tracking the change in position of matched features across images and possibly with known camera movements, compute the relative motion of the camera. This step can include recovering the rotation and translation of the camera between frames. 4. **Triangulation**: Determine the 3D position of the features by triangulation, which involves computing the point in space where the projections of the feature in multiple images intersect. 5. **Bundle Adjustment**: Optimize the camera parameters and the 3D point estimates to improve accuracy. This is a key step in SfM, as initial estimates from motion estimation and triangulation can have errors. Bundle adjustment minimizes these errors by adjusting the 3D points and camera parameters to match the observed images as well as possible. 6. **Reconstruction**: Use the 3D points to create a 3D model of the scene. This can involve connecting points to form a mesh, texturing the mesh using the original images, and sometimes post-processing to fill in gaps or improve the model. SfM is used in various applications, including 3D modeling, architecture and cultural heritage documentation, archaeological site recording, autonomous navigation, and even in consumer devices for creating 3D content. It is also the underlying technology in some augmented reality systems and applications in remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS)."},{"prompt":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how private investors who own stock in a company that proceeds with an ipo can't sell the stock they own until six months have passed from its debut on a stock exchange. However, those investors can buy puts on the same stock to protect their investment should the stock's price fall between the ipo and the lockup period.","completion":"Private investors, prior to an initial public offering (IPO), typically hold significant stock portions in a company, representing their conviction in its potential value. Their investments are forms of private equity, not yet liquid, not traded on public stock exchanges. During an IPO, the company in question transitions from private ownership to public, availing its shares to retail and institutional investors alike. However, there exists a stipulated period, colloquially referred to as the lockup period, which generally encompasses a six-month timeline post-IPO, wherein these pre-IPO investors are restrained from divesting their shares. This mandatory hiatus is designed to prevent a mass exodus of early investors, which could precipitate a catastrophic drop in share prices, undermining the new issue's market stability. Initially, one might perceive this as a precarious position for the private investors, who are now subject to the volatility of the open market, without an immediate recourse to liquidate their shares should the company's stock begin a precipitous decline. Yet, there is a strategic financial instrument at their disposal: the put option. A put option is a derivative contract giving the holder the right, though not the obligation, to sell a specified quantity of an underlying asset, in this case, the stock, at a set price within a specific period. By purchasing puts on the IPO's stock, investors effectively procure an insurance policy against a downturn in the stock's price. Should the stock's market value falter, the value of the put options would correspondingly rise, thus presenting the investor with the opportunity to sell the options at a gain or exercise them to offset the losses incurred on the underlying stock. The economics of a put option's pricing is nuanced, factoring in the stock's current price, the strike price, the time until expiration, and the stock's volatility, among other variables. However, the core principle remains that put options serve as a hedge against declining stock values. In the scenario between the IPO and the lockup expiration, an investor could purchase puts with expirations postdating the lockup period. In doing so, they do not infringe upon the sale prohibition of the lockup terms yet fortify their investment position against the elemental risks of market fluctuations. This strategic application of put options is not merely a theoretical exercise but rather a proven tactic employed by seasoned investors. Famed for maintaining shareholder value and investment portfolios during times of uncertainty, put options are consistent with risk mitigation practices advocated by financial theorists and practitioners alike. They embody a financial acumen that acknowledges the stock market's inherent erraticism and the imperative of protective measures within investment strategies. Moreover, the utilization of put options as a protective endeavor does not impinge upon the spirit of the lockup arrangement. It respects the underlying rationale of the lockup, which endeavors to perpetuate market stability, while simultaneously acknowledging the legitimate interests of the private investors, whose financial commitments were instrumental in the company's journey to the public markets. Conclusively, the judicious employment of put options within the six-month lockup frame exemplifies the convergence of investment prescience and market astuteness. This approach upholds the integrity of the IPO process and concurrently accommodates the legitimate risk management requirements of the incumbent private investors."},{"prompt":"expand this analysis further and more explicitly to vividly demonstrate how in reality the cost to the investor is really the put option price rather than the lockup period in terms of maintaining their investment in terms of liquidity and return.","completion":"The financial landscape is sculpted with a multitude of mechanisms and instruments, each serving tailored functions to facilitate diverse objectives. The institution of a lockup period following an IPO is one such mechanism—a contractual bulwark instituted to foster market equilibrium. Yet, it should be noted, the true cost implicated in this interim of market abstention, for private investors, is less the lockup period itself and more so the expense of purchasing put options, which act as fiscal sentinels safeguarding their investment's liquidity and potential return. Illustrating this narrative, pre-IPO stockholders find themselves in possession of assets which, despite being nascent in their exposure to the share market's vicissitudes, are momentarily incapacitated in terms of liquidity. The lockup's edict bars the monetization of their holdings, placing the investors in a temporal stasis—and ostensibly at a mercy of market tides. One could misconstrue that the investor's primary quandary during the lockup is the immobilization of their assets. However, a more nuanced dissection reveals that the true financial exigency lies in safeguarding the value of these immobilized assets, which is where the put option emerges as the investor's strategic sanctuary. The price of put options is not a frivolous outlay but rather an investment into insurance. When procuring puts, the investor incurs a cost, known as the premium, a non-refundable fee paid upfront to secure the put contract's rights. This premium fluctuates based on several variables, including implied volatility—an anticipatory measure of the stock's projected swings. For stocks freshly launched into the public realm via an IPO, this volatility can be notably elevated, reflecting the uncertainty of the stock's performance in the eyes of market participants. Heightened volatility translates directly into steeper premiums for put options, exacting a greater cost for investor protection. Yet, this monetarily quantifiable premium is the linchpin in the investor's continuance of liquidity and return. In a stark illustration, should the stock's public debut be marred by poor performance, descending below the investor's cost basis, the put options serve as a bastion against loss. Here, the investor exercises the puts, selling the stock at the predetermined strike price—absent the lockup, they would be free to sell the shares at the same strike price directly in the market. However, factoring in the lockup constraint, the puts are a facilitator of a synthetic sale, offering an alternate pathway to liquidity that would not exist otherwise. Effectively, the put premiums paid now materialize as the facilitator of liquidity that would be otherwise unattainable due to the lockup embargo. Far more than a mere instrument of financial prudence, put options extend an avenue to maintain investment returns in the form of risk management. Should the stock appreciate in value, surpassing the strike price of the puts, the premium spent on the options would indeed represent a cost not recouped directly. Nonetheless, this expenditure is dwarfed by the wealth generated through the stock's appreciation, and the premium cost matured into a known, quantifiable, and bounded loss—the price of risk assurance during the market's unpredictable baptism of the new stock. The liquidity that put options effectively underwrite during the lockup period becomes a quantifiable metric of the cost-benefit equation for the investor. The capital tied in the premium of the puts is the tangible price of entry into a sanctuary against liquidity constrictions and protects not just the principal investment but also the potential upside returns from adverse market gyrations. Concluding, it is the put option premium that crystallizes as the real cost to the investor during the lockup period. It is an investment into strategic defense—a meticulous orchestration ensuring that liquidity and return are not casualties of temporal market exile but instead are safeguarded, thereby empowering private investors to navigate the lockup period with fortified resilience. Such is the sumptuous fabric of seasoned investment strategy, woven with threads of insight, prudence, and calculated risk."},{"prompt":"Write a fully detailed story about a man who invites his friend over to hang out with.

It had been months since they enjoyed those lazy Saturday afternoons together, lounging on the couch, video games paused as they devoured greasy pizza and talked about everything from sports to the intricacies of married life. As Mark entered Jason's modest living room, his eyes scanned over the familiar surroundings. \\"Hey, man! Long time, no see!\\" Mark boomed, setting a six-pack of craft beer on the coffee table and making himself comfortable. \\"Yeah, been too long!\\" Jason replied, firing up the console and grabbing a couple of plates for the pizza they had ordered. As they settled in, the conversation flowed as easily as the beer they drank. Somewhere between the heated gaming sessions and laughing at inside jokes only they understood, Mark casually dropped the question, \\"How's Karen doing?\\" Jason paused, his thumb hovering mid-air over the controller. \\"She's okay, working late at the office again. You know how it is.\\" But as Mark nodded, the eagerness behind his inquiry lingered in the air, misplaced. After a brief silence, punctuated by the ambient noise of the paused game, Mark pressed further, \\"How are things between you guys, anyway?\\" His voice held a tinge of something Jason couldn't quite place. Jason frowned, feeling a niggle of discomfort at the back of his mind. \\"Why do you want to know?\\" \\"Oh, no reason,\\" Mark stammered, the corners of his lips pulling down slightly in an expression that was not quite a smile. \\"Just curious.\\" Jason's discomfort evolved into suspicion. The air between them crackled with a tension that hadn't been there before. \\"There's nothing to be curious about,\\" he stated, his tone adopting an edge. Mark shifted the weight on his seat, looking everywhere but at Jason. \\"Dude, relax. It's just—\\" \\"I don't like this, Mark. So why don't you just tell me? Have you been hanging out with Karen when I'm not around?\\" Jason's voice rose as he waited for an answer he wasn't sure he wanted to hear. \\"What? No, man. That's crazy talk.\\" Mark's eyes finally met Jason's, a frown creasing his brow. Jason's suspicions had morphed into something darker, something raw. In a flash of motion, he reached across and grabbed Mark by the collar of his hoodie. \\"Don't lie to me!\\" \\"Honey, it's me!\\" The voice that emanated from Mark was undeniably female, strained from the tight grip around his—no, her neck. Jason's grip slackened, shock painting his face in wide strokes. Mark, taking a moment to catch his breath, suddenly gave a smile of incredulous relief. Slowly, he reached up to his face and tugged at the skin. With an eerie elasticity, the facade came away, revealing the familiar and smiling face of Karen beneath. Jason stumbled backward, his brain trying to catch up with his eyes. \\"K-Karen?\\" Her smile was apologetic yet mischievous. \\"Surprise!\\" she said, voice laced with a mixture of triumph and nervousness. \\"I wanted to see if you'd recognize me in my new prosthetic makeup. I've been taking this special effects class, remember?\\" \\"You... this was all just...\\" Jason tripped over his words, still reeling from having nearly strangled his own wife disguised as his best friend. Karen stood, wiping away the remnants of the carefully constructed disguise from her face. \\"Yes, honey. I never thought I'd fool you completely. I'm sorry if I took it too far. I just wanted to add some excitement to our usual routine.\\" Jason's heart finally slowed its frantic pace as he embraced Karen, her laugh mingling with his relieved sigh. Despite the scare, there was a warmth kindling between them, an adventurous spark that had been missing from their marriage for some time. \\"I guess you really had me going there,\\" Jason admitted, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. \\"But let's stick to less... dramatic surprises in the future, okay?\\" Karen nodded, her eyes twinkling with the love and mischief that had drawn him to her in the first place. And as they sat back down, Karen nestled in her rightful place beside Jason, they resumed their evening.

If you need help coming up with a prompt or description for an image you'd like to generate, feel free to ask!"},{"prompt":"Epoch 1/1000 7680/7680 [==============================] - 182s 23ms/step - loss: 0.7901 -

Choosing the right learning rate is crucial as it can greatly affect the convergence of the model training and the final performance. From the provided output of the training epochs, it seems that a learning rate (lr) of \`1.0000e-04\` (or 0.0001) is being used. Analyzing the output: - The model is making progress, albeit slowly, as observed by the decreasing loss and improving accuracy, precision, and recall over the epochs. - By epoch 135, the model has not yet shown signs of overfitting, as both training and validation accuracies are improving. Based on these observations, the learning rate does not necessarily seem too low, as the model is improving and learning from the data. However, whether it could be optimized is a different question. Here are a few considerations: 1. If the model training is too slow: A learning rate scheduler or different optimization algorithms like Adam, which adapts the learning rate during training, could help improve training speed with a suitable initial learning rate. 2. If the improvements plateau early: It could be beneficial to try a slightly higher learning rate or employ a learning rate scheduler that starts higher and gradually decreases. 3. Learning rate too low: If the model improvements are minimal and training is very slow, a higher learning rate might be necessary. 4. Learning rate too high: On the other hand, if the model begins to show erratic behavior with large fluctuations in loss and accuracy, this could be a sign that the learning rate is too high. In practice, it's common to experiment with various learning rates or use learning rate finding techniques to determine the best learning rate. It often involves starting with a small learning rate that is incrementally increased and observing the loss; when the loss starts to increase rapidly, the optimal learning rate is a bit lower than that point. Remember that the learning rate is one of many hyperparameters, and the overall architecture, data preprocessing, activation functions, batch size, and other factors also contribute significantly to model performance. It's always a good idea to perform hyperparameter tuning systematically or use automated methods like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization methods."},{"prompt":"请用中文","completion":"在机器学习模型中，学习率（learning rate）是一个超参数，它决定了在迭代过程中向损失函数最小值移动的步长大小。选择合适的学习率至关重要，因为它会直接影响到模型训练的收敛速度和最终性能。 从您提供的训练周期（epochs）输出来看，正在使用的学习率（lr）是 \`1.0000e-04\`（即0.0001）。分析输出： - 模型正在取得进展，尽管进步缓慢，但可以通过损失逐渐减小以及准确度、精确度和召回率逐渐提高来观察到。 - 在第135周期，模型尚未表现出过拟合的迹象，因为训练和验证准确度都在提高。 根据这些观察，当前的学习率并不一定过低，因为模型正在改进并从数据中学习。然而，是否可以优化学习率则是另一个问题。以下是一些考虑因素： 1. 如果模型训练速度过慢：可以尝试使用学习率调度器，或尝试使用不同的优化算法（如Adam），后者会在训练过程中自适应调整学习率，有助于改进训练速度，并可以设置合理的初始学习率。 2. 如果性能提升很快就达到了平台期：这时候可以尝试使用稍微更高的学习率，或者采用一个初始值较高、随后逐渐降低的学习率调度器。 3. 学习率过低：如果模型改进很少并且训练速度非常慢，可能需要一个更高的学习率。 4. 学习率过高：另一方面，如果模型开始表现出忽上忽下的行为，损失和准确度波动很大，这可能是学习率设置过高的信号。 在实践中，常常需要尝试不同的学习率，或者使用学习率查找技术来确定最佳学习率。这通常涉及到从一个小的学习率开始，逐步增加学习率，并观察损失；当损失开始迅速上升时，最优学习率应该略低于那个点。 记住，学习率只是众多超参数中的一个，整体架构、数据预处理、激活函数、批处理大小等其他因素也对模型性能有着重要影响。往往需要系统地进行超参数调优，或者使用网格搜索（grid search）、随机搜索（random search）或贝叶斯优化方法等自动化方法。"},{"prompt":"我的这种速度在亿级的数据量中，算慢的吗","completion":"数据量达到亿级别时，你的模型训练速度确实会被认为是较慢的。根据你的日志显示，每个epoch需要几分钟的训练时间，对于大型数据集而言，完成所有epoch可能需要相当长的时间。 对于如此大规模的数据集，一些常见的处理方式可能包括： 1. **分布式训练**：通过多个GPU并行处理数据来加速训练。框架如TensorFlow和PyTorch都提供了分布式训练的支持。 2. **使用更高效的数据加载和预处理**：例如，确保数据预处理不成为瓶颈，使用多线程或者异步加载数据。 3. **模型简化**：选择使用更简单的模型或减少模型复杂性，这可以使训练速度加快。 4. **学习率调整**：实施学习率调度器，如warmup随后逐步减少学习率或使用自适应学习率算法。 5. **数据降维**：如果输入特征非常多，使用PCA或其他降维方法可能加快训练速度。 6. **增大批处理大小（batch size）**：如果你的硬件资源允许的话，增加批处理大小可以更充分地利用GPU资源，加快训练过程。 7. **数据子集**：在较小的数据子集上先进行模型原型设计和迭代，找到比较好的模型和超参数之后再扩展到更大的数据集。 8. **转移学习**：如果可能，使用已经在类似任务上预训练过的模型，这样通常只需调整后几层即可。 对于大规模数据的训练，通常需要一个平衡速度和准确性的综合策略。可能还需要一些特定的硬件优化，比如使用高速的SSD硬盘来存储数据集，以减少从磁盘加载数据的时间。 在实际应用中，这些策略可能需要根据具体的硬件配置、数据集特点和模型要求等因素来调整。最重要的还是要理解数据和模型的特点，从而找到合适的解决方案。"},{"prompt":"按照这个速度，你觉得跑完之后的理想准确率是多少","completion":"从您的训练日志看，到了第135个epoch时，模型的验证准确率接近68%。可以预计，随着训练的继续，在不出现严重过拟合的情况下，模型准确率可能会继续小幅提升。 但要确定一个“理想的准确率”，必须考虑以下因素： 1. **基准性能（Baseline Performance）**：如果存在预先定义的基线模型或业界标准，这将有助于设定一个目标准确率。例如，如果当前任务是一个标准的图像识别问题，并且已知最佳模型能够达到90%的准确率，那么您的模型准确率应尽量接近这个水平。 2. **问题难度**：有些问题本质上就比其他问题更难解决，因此即使高级模型也可能无法达到非常高的准确率。 3. **数据质量**：数据的噪声水平、标注的准确性等因素，都会影响到模型能达到的最高准确率。 4. **类别平衡**：如果您在处理一个分类问题，其中某些类别的样本数量远多于其他类别，那么这可能会偏向于在那些具有更多样本的类别上获得更好的表现。 理想的准确率应当是基于任务的具体背景和上述因素来确定的。如果您目前的模型已经超出了业界标准，或者达到了类似问题上的先进水平，那么您的模型准确率就可以认为是理想的。反之，如果它低于期望，那么可能还需要进一步调整模型、增强数据处理流程或考虑使用不同的模型架构。 最后，准确度并不是衡量所有类型模型好坏的唯一指标，其他指标如精确度、召回率、F1分数、AUC-ROC曲线等可能会提供额外的性能信息，特别是在类别不平衡的情况下。因此，在设置目标准确率时，请综合考虑不同的性能指标。"},{"prompt":"您为什么不使用训练集的准确率，而是关注验证集","completion":"在机器学习中，我们通常会关注验证集（validation set）上的性能而不仅仅是训练集（training set）的性能，原因如下： 1. **泛化能力**: 训练集上的准确率主要反映了模型对训练数据的拟合程度，而不一定代表模型对未知数据的泛化能力。使用验证集（通常是训练过程中看不到的数据）能更好地评估模型在处理新数据时的性能。 2. **过拟合**: 如果一个模型完美地记住了训练集数据而没有学到泛化的能力，它在训练集上的准确率可能会非常高。但这样的模型在新数据上的表现可能很差，因为它过度拟合了训练数据中的噪声和特定的模式。 3. **模型选择和调优**: 在模型训练过程中，我们经常需要进行模型选择（model selection）和超参数调优（hyperparameter tuning）。使用验证集可以帮助我们选择性能最佳的模型和设置，而不是只选择在训练集上表现良好的模型和设置。 4. **评估度量的可靠性**: 基于独立于训练数据的验证集所得到的评估指标（如准确率、损失函数等），通常被认为更可靠，因为它们反映了模型对未见过的数据的实际表现。 最终，我们的目标是开发一个在真实世界应用中表现良好的模型，而验证集提供了一种在模型还没接触测试集或真实数据前，评估其可能性能的方法。然而，验证集也不是终极的性能衡量标准。在完成模型的选择和调优后，我们还会在一个从未用于训练和验证的测试集（test set）上评估最终模型的性能，以获得对模型真实泛化能力的最终评估。"},{"prompt":"为什么模型会在一个平台波动四五轮之后开始继续下降","completion":"在训练深度学习模型时，可能会观察到损失或者准确率在某个值附近波动，然后再次开始改善或者下降的现象。这个现象可能由多种因素引起： 1. **局部最小/鞍点**：优化过程可能暂时卡在局部最小值或鞍点附近。鞍点是指在某一方向是最大值，在另一方向是最小值的点。在这些点附近，梯度可能非常微小，导致优化器需要一些epoch才能“逃脱”出来。 2. **学习率**：如果使用的是固定学习率，模型可能在接近最小值的时候步长太大，从而来回“跳过”最优点。如果使用自适应学习率，优化器可能在学习率减小时找到了更好的下降路径，从而继续改善性能。 3. **批量大小**：较大的批量会提供更稳定的梯度估计，但可能需要更长的时间才能适应loss surface的变化。较小的批量会导致梯度估计的方差增大，可能有助于跳出局部最小值，但同时也可能导致训练不稳定。 4. **数据特性**：训练集中可能包含一些异常的或噪声较大的数据，这些数据可能会在模型学习时引起波动。 5. **权重初始化和正则化**：不同的初始化和正则化策略可能会影响模型的学习轨迹，有时可能导致在优化过程中出现平台期。 6. **动量或其他加速器**：如果使用动量或Adam等优化算法，更新的历史可能会影响当前的梯度方向和大小，导致波动。 7. **异质性数据**：训练数据可能不是均匀分布的，某些数据批次可能比其他的难学习，导致性能暂时停滞或波动。 通常，经历一段时间的波动后继续下降或改善是一个正常现象，表示模型仍在学习和适应数据。如果波动持续存在，可能需要调整训练策略，比如更改学习率、优化器设置或尝试其他正则化技术。同时，这也是为什么训练期间监视验证集性能很重要的原因，它可以帮助我们了解模型是否正在过拟合，或者是否需要调整训练策略以改善模型的泛化能力。"},{"prompt":"工业界训练十亿数据，在单个2060显卡上，一般要几天","completion":"要估算在单个NVIDIA RTX 2060显卡上训练十亿数据所需的时间，需要考虑多个因素，如模型复杂度、数据的特征维度、训练算法的效率、数据预处理和加载的时间、批次大小（batch size）、每个epoch的迭代次数，以及是否应用了高效的优化技术等等。 以下是一些可能影响训练时间的主要因素： 1. **模型复杂度**：模型的层数和参数数量直接影响前向传播和反向传播的计算负载。 2. **数据维度**：输入数据的维度越高，需要的计算量也越大。 3. **批量大小**：批量大小会受到GPU内存的限制。批量大小越大，GPU的并行计算能力越能得到利用，但过大的批量可能受限于显存大小。 4. **数据传输**：数据需要从磁盘加载到内存，再从内存传输到GPU。如果这个过程没有得到很好的优化，会成为训练的瓶颈。 5. **优化算法效率**：不同的优化算法（如SGD、Adam等）将影响收敛速度。 6. **并行和分布式训练**：在一个GPU上训练十亿条数据通常不切实际。在实际应用中，工业界会通过多GPU或分布式训练来加速这个过程。 7. **epoch数量**：需要运行多少个训练周期，以及数据是否需要多次遍历（如使用迭代次数小于数据量的随机梯度下降方法）。 估算单个RTX 2060显卡训练10亿数据的时间非常困难，因为这取决于上述提到的众多因素，而且也因机器学习任务的不同（分类、回归、强化学习等）而异。 如果您的任务确实涉及到大规模数据集，并打算在单个GPU上进行训练，建议采用以下措施来尽可能高效地利用硬件资源： - **模型简化**：选择更小或者更优化的网络。 - **数据降维**：通过特征选择或降维技术减小输入的大小。 - **有效的数据加载**：使用足够快的数据预处理和加载流程，例如使用多线程数据加载等。 - **学习率调度**：使用学习率调度策略来加速训练过程及收敛。 - **模型剪枝**：去除不那么重要的权重来减少模型大小，以减少计算负担。 即便如此，若要在单个RTX 2060上训练十亿数据点的模型，我们仍然可以预测这将是一个持续多天甚至数周的长期过程。如果可能，寻找提高硬件资源（例如升级到更强大的GPU或使用多GPU系统）或减少数据规模的方法会是更好的选择。"},{"prompt":"经历了7轮波动，准确率终于升到了66%，这是否说明我的学习率设置的是恰当的，不需要调高：","completion":"从你的描述中，准确率在经过一段时间的波动后上升到了66%，这意味着模型仍然在学习，并且最终找到了一个比之前更好的点来减少损失。这种行为可能表明，在目前的超参数设定（包括学习率）下，模型确实还有改进的空间。 是否需要调整学习率取决于多个因素： 1. **训练速度**：如果你认为训练的速度可以接受，并且准确率仍在稳步上升，那么当前的学习率可能是适当的。 2. **收敛状态**：如果准确率提升很缓慢，或者出现了明显的停滞（如多个epochs中都没有任何改善），那么增加学习率可能有助于加快学习过程。 3. **过拟合情况**：如果你观察到训练准确率明显高于验证准确率，并且差异随着时间越来越大，那么这可能是过拟合的信号。在这种情况下，增加学习率未必是最佳选择，反而可能需要增加正则化或采取早停（early stopping）等措施。 4. **波动情况**：一些波动是正常的，但如果波动非常剧烈，这可能表明学习率过高。如果波动相对较小并且模型最终能够从波动中恢复并继续改进，那么当前的学习率可能是可行的。 而且，记住学习率不是一个孤立的参数，它和其他超参数（如批量大小、正则化系数等）一起决定了模型训练的行为。有时候，改变其中一个超参数，可能需要重新调整其他超参数才能得到最佳结果。 如果你有充分的时间和资源，尝试使用一个学习率范围进行训练并监视模型的表现，或者采用学习率调度策略，如逐步减小学习率或者使用预热（warm-up）策略，都是不错的方法来找到最佳的学习率设置。这些策略可以帮助你更系统地调整学习率并评估影响。"},{"prompt":"Epoch 1/1000 7680/7680 [==============================] -

如果模型准确率仍然在稳健地提升，并没有出现明显迹象表明进步停滞不前，那么当前的学习率可能是适当的。 - 进行了140个epoch后，准确率从52%提升到了大约68%，这意味着模型正在学习并且正在走向更好的性能。如此稳定的提升通常说明学习率设定是合适的。 - 虽然经历了几轮波动，但最终准确率仍然能够提升，这也可能是因为模型越过了某些局部最小点，或者是因为梯度下降中的随机性而偶然发现了更好的学习路径。 - 从波动之后重回准确率提升的轨道，说明模型有能力从波动中恢复，并找到梯度优化的方向，这也指示当前的学习率还可以继续使用。 总的来说，只要训练指标（如损失和准确率）继续向好的方向发展，并且没有出现过拟合的迹象，就暂时没有必要调整学习率。不过，如果改进变得缓慢或者停滞，可能需要考虑调整学习率或者使用学习率调度策略，如学习率衰减或周期性调整等。此外，在实际的模型训练中，通常会使用诸如验证集上准确率提前停止增长时降低学习率的策略，来动态调整学习率。"},{"prompt":"def get_model(x_shape=5, y_shape=40, learning_rate=1e-3): model = Sequential([ tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(x_shape, y_shape)), LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001)), Dropout(0.2), BatchNormalization(), LSTM(64, return_sequences=False), Dropout(0.2), BatchNormalization(), Dense(256, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001)), Dropout(0.2), Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'), ]) model.summary() model.compile( optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy', 'Precision', 'Recall'] ) early_stopping = EarlyStopping( monitor='val_loss', mode='min', verbose=1, patience=20, restore_best_weights=True ) reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau( monitor='val_loss', mode='min', factor=0.5, patience=4, min_lr=1e-6, verbose=1 ) return model, [early_stopping, reduce_lr] 我手动设置了1e-4的学习率","completion":"根据您提供的代码，您已经定义了一个循环神经网络模型，它包含两层LSTM层，中间穿插了Dropout和BatchNormalization层，以及一个全连接层作为输出。您使用的损失函数是二元交叉熵（binary_crossentropy），这是处理二分类问题的标准选择。 同时，您设定了学习率为\`1e-3\`（即0.001），这是一个常用的初始学习率值。然而，您评论中提到手动设置了\`1e-4\`的学习率，这可能是您先前实验中的设置，但在提供的代码段里，传递给优化器（Adam）的是\`1e-3\`。 另外，您已经添加了两个用于训练中的回调函数（callbacks）： 1. **EarlyStopping**：如果在20个epochs内验证集上的损失没有改善，训练将提前停止（early stopping）。这有助于防止过拟合。 2. **ReduceLROnPlateau**：当验证集上的损失在连续4个epochs内没有改善时，学习率将减半，直到降到\`1e-6\`。这有助于在训练期间微调学习率，当损失停止下降时找到新的梯度下降路径。 这两种方法配合使用可以有效地管理训练过程，防止过拟合并在必要时调整学习率，以促进模型在验证集上的性能改善。 如果在训练过程中发现模型的性能还有优化空间，并且您确实希望设置一个更小的学习率（如\`1e-4\`），您只需更新\`get_model\`函数定义中的\`learning_rate\`参数即可。此外，请记得在实际调用\`get_model\`时传入您期望的学习率值。"},{"prompt":"这是否说明我的数据在一定程度上是收敛的，是存在内部规律的","completion":"从您的训练日志来看，模型的验证准确率随着时间的推移逐渐提高，这是数据收敛和模型学习内部规律的迹象。具体来说，如果准确率、精确度、召回率等指标在训练过程中稳步提高，并且在验证集上也表现出相同的趋势，那么这通常表明如下几点： 1. **数据一致性**：数据集中的特征与目标变量之间存在一定程度的关联性，使得模型能够通过学习这些特征来预测目标变量。 2. **模型有效性**：使用的模型结构和训练策略对于捕捉数据的内在规律是有效的。 3. **收敛性**：所选择的损失函数、优化算法以及超参数设置使得模型能在每次迭代后逐步减小错误并提高性能指标。 4. **泛化能力**：早停（EarlyStopping）和学习率下降（ReduceLROnPlateau）等策略有助于模型在没有看到的验证集数据上保持好的性能，从而提高模型的泛化能力。 5. **内部规律**：模型不仅仅是记忆训练数据，而是确实学到了数据中的一般规律，可以用来对未见过的数据做出准确的预测。 虽然这些迹象表明模型在训练中表现良好，但需要注意的是，仅凭准确率这一个指标不能完全证明模型的泛化能力。最终评估模型性能时，要考虑各种度量指标（例如准确率、精确度、召回率、F1得分甚至是混淆矩阵）以及在一个独立的测试集上的表现。 此外，即使模型在验证集上表现良好，也仍可能存在一些问题，例如过拟合、数据泄露或类别不平衡。因此，验证集上的性能应结合对模型行为的全面理解，并在必要时对模型或数据进行调整以进一步提高性能。在最后阶段，对于一个独立的测试集（模型从未见过的部分数据）进行评估，这可以提供对模型实际泛化能力的最准确评估。"},{"prompt":"Epoch 1/1000 7680/7680 [==============================] -

**调整模型结构**：添加更多的层次，或者尝试不同类型的网络架构。 - **更复杂的特征工程**：添加更多特征或尝试不同的数据预处理策略。 - **超参数调优**：尝试不同的学习率、batch大小或优化器。 - **正则化**：添加dropout或正则化项可以帮助模型泛化，并有可能改善验证集上的性能。 - **数据增强**：如果适用，可以通过数据增强技术扩充训练集，提高模型的泛化能力。 - **集成方法**：将多个模型的预测结果组合起来可能会提高整体的性能。 最后，达到瓶颈不总是坏事，它可能表示模型已经从数据中学到了尽可能多的信息。在这一阶段，重要的是要通过交叉验证和独立测试来确保模型泛化能力的可靠性。"},{"prompt":"性能提升的越来越慢，我认为要想准确率提高到80%，至少要三天吧","completion":"性能提升的速度减缓是常见的现象，尤其是当一个模型已经从数据中学到相当多信息时。在这种情况下，获取额外性能的难度会越来越大。您提到的准确率提升到80%还需要三天可能有几个含义： 1. **经验估计**：基于您对目前训练进度的观察和经验，您估计达到目标性能需要的时间。这种估计可以作为调整训练计划的依据。 2. **时间与性能权衡**：根据模型当前的学习速度，您可以决定是否值得投入更多的时间来追求更高的准确率。在某些应用中，从60%到70%的提升可能比从70%到80%的提升要容易得多。 3. **考虑早停**：既然您在模型中实现了早停（EarlyStopping），如果验证集上的性能在一定时间内没有改善，模型就会停止训练。这可以防止过度的时间投入，特别是在模型性能几乎不再提升时。 4. **曲线趋于平稳**：随着模型接近其性能极限，性能曲线通常会逐渐趋于平稳，并且每个额外的改进都需要更精细的调整和更长的时间。 5. **硬件限制**：在一台机器上，硬件（如GPU性能）将限制训练速度。可能需要更多的计算资源或更高效的模型来达到理想的性能。 如果时间是一个关键因素，并且您希望尽可能高效地使用时间来提升模型性能，那么您可能需要考虑采取额外的措施。比如： - 使用更高效的训练技术，如更改优化器、调整学习率策略。 - 尝试更换不同的模型架构或增加模型的容量。 - 进行超参数调整来找到更有效的模型设置。 - 在多台机器上执行分布式训练或者尝试使用更强大的计算资源。 - 考虑模型剪枝或知识蒸馏以提高模型效率，在有限的资源内获得更好的性能。 请注意，持续的训练不一定能保证性能将达到80%，取决于模型架构和数据本身的限制。如果尽管尝试了各种方法但性能仍旧难以突破，可能需要重新考虑数据、特征工程、或者是否有新的模型架构可以尝试。"},{"prompt":"早停设错了，前20轮，我现在都181轮了","completion":"早停（EarlyStopping）机制的目的是为了防止模型过拟合，同时节约训练时间。当模型在一定数量的 epochs 后没有在验证集上显示出性能改进时，训练会提前停止。EarlyStopping 回调函数有几个关键参数用于配置它的行为： 1. \`monitor\`：要监视的性能指标。通常是 \`'val_loss'\` 或 \`'val_accuracy'\`。 2. \`mode\`：确定当 \`monitor\` 改善时，早停触发的条件 。\`'min'\` 代表监视指标停止下降时触发，而 \`'max'\` 代表监视指标停止上升时触发。 3. \`patience\`：模型在停止提升后需要等待的 epochs 数量；这就是所谓的“耐心”。 4. \`verbose\`：是否打印早停消息。 5. \`restore_best_weights\`：是否在训练结束时恢复到效果最好的时期的权重。 在您的示例中，\`EarlyStopping\` 被设置成20个 epochs 的 \`patience\`，但您已经训练了181个 epochs。这可能是因为： - 您设置的 \`monitor\` 参数的确有微小的进步，但是进步幅度非常小，所以早停没有被触发，模型仍在继续训练。 - \`EarlyStopping\` 参数可能不正确，或者在模型的训练函数中没有被正确实施。 若想要让模型在没有明显进步的情况下更早地停止训练，您可能需要重新检查 \`EarlyStopping\` 的设置，确保 \`monitor\` 正确配置，切换 \`mode\` 参数（如果有必要的话），并可能减小 \`patience\` 参数的值。同时，您还可以通过将 \`verbose\` 参数设置为1来获得有关早停行为的更多信息。 如果实际上您不想让模型训练这么久，您可以尝试减小 \`patience\` 的值或者改变 \`monitor\` 的阈值，来让早停回调在您希望的时间点触发早停。如果模型的改进微小到不符合业务需求，那么即便训练继续，也可能不会带来实质性的性能提升，这时应该考虑更改模型或训练策略。"},{"prompt":"Epoch 1/1000 7680/7680 [==============================] -

创党初期（1854年）：共和党成立于1854年，由反对奴隶制扩展的活动家和自由土地党成员以及一些反对当时民主党政策的北方民主党人共同创立。共和党诞生的目的之一，就是阻止奴隶制在美国新的领土扩张。 - 初次执政（1860年）：共和党在1860年选出第一个总统亚伯拉罕·林肯（Abraham Lincoln），其上台后不久，美国就发生了南北战争。林肯领导国家取得了胜利，并废除了奴隶制。 - 政策转向（1865年 - 1933年）：在南北战争后和20世纪初，共和党成为了推动工业化和商业发展的主要力量。在此时期，共和党支持了许多推动高关税、金本位制和有限政府干预经济领域的政策。 - 全国大萧条与新政（1933年 - 1960年）：在大萧条（1929年 - 1939年）期间，由于经济困难，民主党总统富兰克林·D·罗斯福开展了著名的“新政”，意在通过政府干预来恢复国家经济活力。而共和党在这一时期大多保持反对立场。 - 民权运动（1950年代 - 1960年代）：尽管历史上共和党支持民权，但在60年代的民权运动期间，共和党与民主党在对待民权问题上的差距逐渐缩小。共和党中的一些成员开始更多地支持州权，而民主党在此期间变得更加倾向于联邦政府保护民权。 - 社会保守转变（1960年代 - 1980年代）：在尼克松总统任内，共和党倡导了所谓的“南方战略”，开始吸引传统上属于民主党的南方白人保守选民。随着里根（Ronald Reagan）1980年代的执政，共和党越来越倾向于社会保守和自由市场经济政策。 - 当代共和党（1990年代至今）：在乔治·H·W·布什、乔治·W·布什与唐纳德·特朗普的总统任期内，共和党继续推行减税、强化国防和保守的社会政策。近年来，共和党在特朗普领导下，强调美国优先政策和对外贸易保护主义，同时在移民政策上采取了更加强硬的立场。"},{"prompt":"美国民主党的发展历史","completion":"美国民主党（Democratic Party）是美国两大主要政党之一，与共和党相对立。其党徽通常为一头驴。 以下是美国民主党的简要发展历史概览： - 创党初期（1828年）：民主党的前身是由托马斯·杰弗逊领导成立的民主-共和党。到了1828年，该党逐渐发展成为今天的民主党，安德鲁·杰克逊成为第一位民主党总统。 - 支持奴隶制（19世纪）：在19世纪，民主党是支持奴隶制的南方派的主要政治力量。此外，当时的民主党支持较低的关税和对银行体系的扩张。 - 分裂与重组（1860年 - 1900年）：美国内战期间，民主党遭遇分裂，战后支持重建南方社会和经济的北方民主党和南方保持分歧。到了19世纪末，民主党开始吸引城市的移民和劳工阶层，支持议程渐渐向进步改革转型。 - 新政与改革（1930年代 - 1940年代）：在弗兰克林·D·罗斯福总统的领导下，民主党提倡新政（New Deal），一系列的社会经济政策和立法旨在缓解大萧条的严重影响，促进社会经济恢复和改革。 - 民权与新民主党（1960年代）：在林登·约翰逊总统任期内，民主党通过了一系列的民权法案，包括1964年的《民权法案》和1965年的《投票权法案》，从而为美国的少数族裔争取了更多的权利。这一时期，民主党开始从南方白人统治的党派转型为更多元化的政治力量。 - 现代民主党（1970年代至今）：今天的民主党倾向于支持广泛的公民权利、社会福利项目、环境保护和渐进的税收政策。近年来，民主党在比尔·克林顿、巴拉克·奥巴马和乔·拜登等人的领导下，继续强调社会正义、经济机会均等和包容性政策。 每个阶段，民主党的政策主张和支持基础都会根据社会经济环境的变化而不断调整。它历史上涵盖了不同的地域、经济和种族群体，目前被看作是较为青睐政府在经济中发挥较大作用、并支持社会自由主义的党派。"},{"prompt":"index, lambda, and return in py","completion":"In Python, the terms \\"index\\", \\"lambda\\", and \\"return\\" have specific meanings and uses: 1. **index**: This term is most commonly used to refer to the position of an item within an iterable, such as a list or a string. Python uses zero-based indexing, which means the first element of a list is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on. Here is an example of accessing an element by its index: \`\`\`python my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] print(my_list[1]) # Output: banana \`\`\` You can also use the \`.index()\` method to find the index of the first occurrence of a value in a list: \`\`\`python print(my_list.index('banana')) # Output: 1 \`\`\` 2. **lambda**: In Python, a \`lambda\` function is a small anonymous function. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Lambda functions are often used in situations where you need a simple function for a short period and don't want to formally define it using the \`def\` keyword. Example of a lambda function: \`\`\`python # A lambda function that adds 10 to the input argument add_ten = lambda x: x + 10 print(add_ten(5)) # Output: 15 \`\`\` Lambda functions are commonly used with functions like \`map()\`, \`filter()\`, and \`sorted()\`, which take a function as an argument: \`\`\`python # Using lambda with sorted to sort a list of tuples by the second element pairs = [(1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')] pairs_sorted = sorted(pairs, key=lambda pair: pair[1]) print(pairs_sorted) # Output: [(1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')] \`\`\` 3. **return**: The \`return\` statement is used to exit a function and go back to the place where it was called. This statement can optionally return a value to the caller. If no expression is given with \`return\` or if the function ends without a \`return\` statement, the function returns \`None\`. Here's an example of a function using \`return\`: \`\`\`python def sum_two_numbers(a, b): return a + b result = sum_two_numbers(3, 5) print(result) # Output: 8 \`\`\` Each of these components plays an important role in Python scripting and programming, facilitating iteration, defining succinct functions on-the-fly, and managing the flow of data in and out of functions, respectively."},{"prompt":"what does self.current_session_list[0][1] mean","completion":"In Python, \`self.current_session_list[0][1]\` is a way to access data within a nested data structure, typically within an instance of a class. Let’s break it down: - \`self\`: In Python, \`self\` is a reference to the current instance of a class. It is used to access variables that belong to the class. - \`current_session_list\`: This is likely an instance variable, which in this case is being assumed to be a list (since we are accessing its elements using indices). It is a variable defined within the class, which stores some data that the instance of the class needs to keep track of. - \`[0]\`: This is an index into the \`current_session_list\`. Python lists are zero-indexed, so \`[0]\` is accessing the first item in the list. It suggests that \`current_session_list\` is a list where the first item is being accessed. - \`[1]\`: This is another index operation, but this time it's applied to the item that was just retrieved with \`current_session_list[0]\`. This implies that the first item of \`current_session_list\` is itself a sequence type, such as a list or a tuple, and we're accessing the second element of that sequence. Putting it all together, \`self.current_session_list[0][1]\` means, \\"In the current instance of this class, access the \`current_session_list\` attribute, retrieve the first item from that list, and from that item (which is expected to be a sequence itself), retrieve the second item.\\" Here's an illustrative example: \`\`\`python class SessionManager: def __init__(self): # Suppose each session is represented as a tuple with two elements. # Maybe (session_id, session_object) self.current_session_list = [ ('s001', 'SessionObject1'), ('s002', 'SessionObject2'), ('s003', 'SessionObject3') ] sm = SessionManager() print(sm.current_session_list[0][1]) # Output would be: SessionObject1 \`\`\` In this example, \`SessionObject1\` would be the result of that indexing because: 1. \`current_session_list[0]\` gets the first tuple: \`('s001', 'SessionObject1')\` 2. \`[1]\` then gets the second element of that tuple: \`'SessionObject1'\`"},{"prompt":"explain def parse_time(self, time_str): splits = time_str.split('m') if len(splits) > 1: minutes = int(splits[0]) seconds = int(splits[1].replace('s', '')) else: minutes = 0 seconds = int(time_str.replace('s', '')) return minutes, seconds","completion":"The \`parse_time\` function is designed to take a string representing a duration of time, possibly in the format of \`'XmYs'\`, where \`X\` is the number of minutes and \`Y\` is the number of seconds, and convert it into two integers representing the number of minutes and seconds separately. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the function does: 1. \`def parse_time(self, time_str):\` - This defines a method called \`parse_time\` within a class. The \`self\` parameter refers to the instance of the object where \`parse_time\` is being called. The \`time_str\` parameter is the string that the method will parse. 2. \`splits = time_str.split('m')\` - This attempts to split the \`time_str\` string at every occurrence of the character \`'m'\`. For example, if \`time_str\` is \`'5m30s'\`, the resulting \`splits\` would be \`['5', '30s']\`. 3. \`if len(splits) > 1:\` - This checks if the list \`splits\` contains more than one element. If it does, it means the original \`time_str\` included an \`'m'\` and the time is expected to have minutes and seconds. 4. \`minutes = int(splits[0])\` \`seconds = int(splits[1].replace('s', ''))\` - If \`splits\` contained more than one element, the string before \`'m'\` is converted to an integer representing the minutes (\`splits[0]\`), and the string after the \`'m'\` is stripped of the \`'s'\` character and converted to an integer representing the seconds (\`splits[1].replace('s', '')\`). For example, from \`['5', '30s']\`, it would extract \`5\` for minutes and \`30\` for seconds. 5. \`else:\` - This block is executed if \`time_str\` didn't contain an \`'m'\`, which means it assumes there are no minutes. 6. \`minutes = 0\` - In the case where there are no minutes specified, it defaults the \`minutes\` to \`0\`. 7. \`seconds = int(time_str.replace('s', ''))\` - It removes any \`'s'\` from \`time_str\` and converts whatever numeral is left to an integer representing the total seconds. 8. \`return minutes, seconds\` - Finally, the function returns a tuple with the first element being the minutes and the second element being the seconds. Example usage: \`\`\`python # Assuming the class that contains parse_time is called TimeParser: tp = TimeParser() print(tp.parse_time(\\"5m30s\\")) # Output: (5, 30) print(tp.parse_time(\\"40s\\")) # Output: (0, 40) \`\`\` So, if a user of the class calls \`parse_time\` with a string like \`\\"5m30s\\"\`, they would get back a tuple \`(5, 30)\`. If they called it with \`\\"40s\\"\`, they would get back a tuple \`(0, 40)\`."},{"prompt":"explain this code if self.session_active: self.session_image_count -= 1 if self.session_image_count <= 0: self.session_index = (self.session_index + 1) % len(self.current_session_list) self.session_image_count, interval = self.current_session_list[self.session_index] self.timer_interval = interval * 1000 # Setting the new interval from session else: pass","completion":"The provided code snippet seems to be part of a larger Python class and is meant to manage sessions that include images and intervals (timing). Below I explain what the code is doing line by line: 1. \`if self.session_active:\` - The outer \`if\` statement checks whether a boolean member variable called \`self.session_active\` is True, suggesting that there is a session currently active. 2. \`self.session_image_count -= 1\` - If the session is active, it decrements \`self.session_image_count\` by 1. This line suggests there is some kind of countdown or a number of images to go through in the current session. 3. \`if self.session_image_count <= 0:\` - The method then checks if \`self.session_image_count\` is less than or equal to 0. If this statement is True, it suggests that all the images in the current session have been used or displayed, and it is time to move on to the next session. 4. \`self.session_index = (self.session_index + 1) % len(self.current_session_list)\` - If \`self.session_image_count\` is less than or equal to 0, this line updates \`self.session_index\` to point to the next session. It does so by incrementing the current \`self.session_index\` by 1 and then taking the modulus with the length of the list \`self.current_session_list\`. Using the modulus operation ensures that if the current session is the last one in the list, the \`session_index\` will rotate back to 0, effectively looping the sessions in a circular manner. 5. \`self.session_image_count, interval = self.current_session_list[self.session_index]\` - After updating the session index, the code retrieves the new session's details, which appear to be a tuple with two values: the image count and an interval, from the \`self.current_session_list\`, and assigns them to \`self.session_image_count\` and \`interval\`, respectively. This effectively resets the image count for the new session and sets up a new interval. 6. \`self.timer_interval = interval * 1000 # Setting the new interval from session\` - The interval retrieved from the current session is presumably in seconds (or another unit of time), and this line converts it into milliseconds (as \`1000\` milliseconds equals \`1\` second) and stores the result in \`self.timer_interval\`. If this is part of a GUI application or some other kind of timed loop, this would probably be the time interval at which images are being switched or updated. 7. \`else:\` - This line introduces an \`else\` condition to the second \`if\` statement. 8. \`pass\` - The \`pass\` keyword is a no-operation statement in Python. It means \\"do nothing.\\" This is used because Python requires at least one statement in an \`else\` block. In this case, it's saying that if \`self.session_image_count\` is not yet less than or equal to 0, then there's nothing else to do for now. The overall purpose of this code is to manage sessions where images are shown for a certain interval. Once all images for a session have been shown, the code moves on to the next session. If a session is done and there are no more sessions, it starts from the first session again. This can be typical behavior in application logic, such as in a slideshow or a timed quiz application."},{"prompt":"**kwargs","completion":"The \`**kwargs\` notation in Python is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. The name \`kwargs\` stands for \\"keyword arguments,\\" and it is a convention in Python, but you can use any name you like as long as it is preceded by two asterisks \`**\`. What \`**kwargs\` really does is that it allows you to handle named arguments that you have not defined in advance. Here's how it works: \`\`\`python def my_function(**kwargs): for key, value in kwargs.items(): print(f\\"Key: {key}, Value: {value}\\") # Usage example my_function(arg1=10, arg2=20, whatever=30) \`\`\` In the usage example, \`arg1\`, \`arg2\`, and \`whatever\` are the names of the arguments, and \`10\`, \`20\`, \`30\` are their respective values. The \`**kwargs\` in the function definition allows the function to accept any number of named arguments like this. The arguments passed to the function using \`**kwargs\` are stored in a dictionary. Inside the function, we can access \`kwargs\` just like a normal dictionary using \`kwargs.items()\` to access items in the dictionary, and so on. You can also mix positional arguments, named arguments, and \`**kwargs\`: \`\`\`python def another_function(arg1, arg2, **kwargs): print(f\\"arg1: {arg1}\\") print(f\\"arg2: {arg2}\\") for key, value in kwargs.items(): print(f\\"Additional argument - Key: {key}, Value: {value}\\") # Usage example another_function(3, 7, arg3=\\"Python\\", arg4=\\"Rocks\\") \`\`\` In this example: - \`arg1\` is a positional argument with the value \`3\`. - \`arg2\` is another positional argument with the value \`7\`. - \`arg3\` and \`arg4\` are additional keyword arguments that are collected into \`kwargs\`. Finally, in addition to accepting arbitrary keyword arguments, \`**kwargs\` can be used when calling a function to unpack a dictionary into keyword arguments: \`\`\`python def greet(name, greeting=\\"Hello\\"): print(f\\"{greeting}, {name}!\\") details = {'name': 'John', 'greeting': 'Hi'} greet(**details) # This will output: \\"Hi, John!\\" \`\`\` In this case, \`**details\` unpacks the dictionary so that \`name='John'\` and \`greeting='Hi'\` are passed as keyword arguments to the \`greet\` function."},{"prompt":"سلام","completion":"سلام! چطور می‌توانم به شما کمک کنم؟ اگر سوال یا موضوعی دارید که در موردش بیشتر بدانید، لطفاً اطلاع دهید."},{"prompt":"스트레스를 자위로 푸는 것에 긍정적인 면과 부정적인 면 둘다 알려주세요","completion":"스트레스를 자위로 해소하는 행위는 개인의 성적 웰빙, 스트레스 관리 및 기분 개선에 있어 긍정적인 영향을 줄 수 있는 반면, 일부 부정적인 측면도 존재할 수 있습니다. 아래에서 긍정적인 면과 부정적인 면에 대해 설명하겠습니다. 긍정적인 면: 1. 스트레스 감소: 자위는 스트레스 호르몬인 코르티솔의 수치를 낮출 수 있습니다. 이는 심리적 안정감을 제공하고 스트레스를 줄이는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 2. 이완 효과: 오르가슴 도달 시 뇌에서 엔돌핀과 같은 기분 좋은 호르몬이 분비되어 이완을 촉진하며, 전반적인 기분 상태를 개선할 수 있습니다. 3. 수면 향상: 자위는 일시적으로 긴장을 완화하고, 편안한 상태로 이끌어 수면에 도움을 줄 수 있습니다. 4. 자기 탐색: 자위는 자신의 성적 취향과 몸에 대한 이해를 증진시킬 수 있으며, 성적 자기결정권을 강화하는 수단이 될 수 있습니다. 5. 성적 건강 유지: 주기적인 자위는 생식기 건강을 유지하는 데 도움이 될 수 있으며, 남성의 경우 전립선 건강에 긍정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다. 부정적인 면: 1. 중독성: 과도한 자위는 중독이 될 수 있으며, 일상생활에 부정적인 영향을 끼칠 수 있습니다. 2. 감정적 공허감: 성적 행위와 감정적 연결이 부족한 상태에서 반복되는 자위는 일부 사람들에게 감정적 공허감이나 소외감을 초래할 수 있습니다. 3. 사회적 및 관계 문제: 자위에 지나치게 의존하면 대인 관계나 성적 관계에서의 교감 및 소통이 약화될 수 있습니다. 4. 부정적인 자기 인식: 일부 문화나 사회에서는 자위에 대한 금기와 부정적인 인식이 있어, 자위 후 죄책감이나 부끄러움을 느낄 수 있습니다. 5. 신체적 손상: 과도하거나 부적절한 방법으로 자위를 할 경우 신체적 장애를 유발할 수 있습니다(예: 극도의 흥분 상태에서 너무 세게 자위를 하여 생식기에 손상을 입히는 경우). 개인의 성향, 사회적 환경, 자위의 빈도 및 방법 등에 따라 영향이 달라질 수 있으며, 중요한 것은 건전한 성적 관습과 스트레스 관리를 위한 균형 잡힌 방법을 찾는 것입니다. 자위가 스트레스 관리의 주된 방법이 되어서는 안 되며, 다양한 여가 활동, 운동, 대화, 명상 등과 같은 다른 스트레스 해소 방법도 고려해야 합니다. 또한, 자위 행동이 개인의 일상적인 기능에 부정적인 영향을 끼치거나 감정적 문제를 유발하는 경우에는 전문가와 상담하는 것이 좋습니다."},{"prompt":"그렇다면, 억지로 참는것은 좋은 것인지도 알려주세요","completion":"자위를 억지로 참는 행위는 개인의 신념, 성적 욕구, 신체적 건강, 그리고 사회적 환경에 따라 다양한 영향을 끼칠 수 있습니다. 억지로 참는 행위가 좋은지 여부는 개인의 상황과 이를 둘러싼 여러 조건들을 고려해야 합니다. 아래에 억지로 자위를 참는 것이 가지는 긍정적인 측면과 부정적인 측면을 나열해보겠습니다. 긍정적인 측면: 1. 자기 통제: 일부 상황에서 자위를 참음으로써 자기 통제력을 향상시킬 수 있으며, 이는 과도한 자위로 인한 중독성 행위를 예방하는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 2. 개인적 신념: 종교적이거나 윤리적인 신념을 통해 자위 행위를 자제하는 것이 해당 개인에게 정신적 평화나 만족감을 줄 수 있습니다. 3. 에너지 보존: 일부 사람들은 자위 자제를 통해 일상 생활에 활용할 수 있는 에너지를 보존한다고 느낄 수 있습니다. 부정적인 측면: 1. 스트레스 증가: 성적 욕구를 억제함으로써 스트레스가 증가할 수 있으며, 이는 건강에 부정적인 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. 2. 불안과 긴장: 성적 긴장이 축적되면 불안, 초조, 집중력 저하 등을 유발할 수 있습니다. 3. 성적 욕구에 대한 갈등: 성적 욕구에 대한 지속적인 억제는 장기적으로 정신적, 감정적 갈등을 일으킬 수 있으며, 죄책감이나 성적 콤플렉스의 원인이 될 수도 있습니다. 4. 신체적 증상: 성적 욕구를 지속적으로 억누르는 경우 생식기 부위의 불편함, 성적 긴장으로 인한 통증, 불면증 등 신체적 증상이 나타날 수 있습니다. 개인이 자위를 자제하는 것이 긍정적인 측면과 부정적인 측면 모두를 경험할 수 있음을 깨닫고, 스트레스 관리와 개인의 성적 건강에 가장 적합한 방법을 찾는 것이 중요합니다. 자신의 의지와 신념을 따라 자위를 자제하는 것이더라도, 성적 긴장이나 스트레스가 누적되지 않도록 다른 건강한 스트레스 해소 방법을 찾는 것이 좋습니다. 만약 자위를 억지로 참는 것이 정신적, 감정적 또는 신체적 문제를 야기한다고 느낀다면, 이에 대한 도움을 전문가에게 구하는 것이 현명할 것입니다."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsicalSnugglebeast","completion":"\\"Vibrant Snugglebeast Illustration | Customizable Across Mugs, Canvas Art, T-Shirts | Unique Gift for Animal Lovers\\""},{"prompt":"바드를 아시나요?","completion":"\\"바드(Bard)\\"라는 단어는 여러 가지 의미를 가지고 있습니다. 가장 일반적으로는 중세 유럽의 전통에서 비롯된, 시를 쓰고 노래하며 음악을 연주하는 시인 겸 음악가를 의미합니다. 바드는 종종 이야기꾼으로서의 역할도 하며, 옛날의 영웅적인 사건이나 신화, 역사적인 이야기를 전파하는 데 중요한 역할을 수행했습니다. 바드는 또한 다양한 롤플레잉 게임(RPG)에서 등장하는 캐릭터 클래스 중 하나로, 이들은 음악과 시를 통해 치유하고, 동료를 강화하며, 때로는 마법 같은 효과를 발휘하는 능력을 가지고 있습니다. 예를 들어, \\"던전 앤드 드래곤(Dungeons & Dragons)\\"이나 \\"파이널 판타지(Final Fantasy)\\"와 같은 게임에서 바드 클래스를 찾아볼 수 있습니다. 혹시 더 구체적인 문맥이나 정보가 필요하시면, 추가 질문을 해주시면 답변을 드리겠습니다."},{"prompt":"구글에서 제작한 챗봇을 말하는 겁니다.","completion":"아, 네 말씀하신 바드(Bard)는 구글에서 개발한 챗봇 또는 인공지능 대화 에이전트를 지칭하는 것인 듯합니다. 구글은 대화형 인공지능 모델과 관련한 여러 기술들을 연구 및 개발하고 있으며, 그 중 하나가 바드일 수 있습니다. 구글은 이전부터 인공지능 기술을 활용한 다양한 제품과 서비스를 선보여왔습니다. 예를 들어, 구글 어시스턴트(Google Assistant)는 사용자와 자연스러운 대화를 할 수 있는 인공지능 기반이며, 다양한 질문에 답하고, 장치를 제어하며, 일상적인 작업을 도와줄 수 있습니다. 만약 구글에서 새롭게 발표한 챗봇 기술인 '바드'에 대해 말씀하시는 것이라면, 이는 최신 AI 기반의 대화 모델일 가능성이 높습니다. 이러한 기술들은 종종 GPT-3(Generative Pretrained Transformer 3)와 같은 대규모 언어 예측 모델을 기반으로 하여 사용자의 자연스러운 대화에 응답할 수 있는 능력을 가지고 있으며, 구글은 이 분야의 선도 기업 중 하나입니다. 하지만 제가 가진 정보는 2023년을 기준으로 하므로, 만약 '바드'가 그 이후에 발표된 서비스라면, 저는 그에 대한 구체적인 내용을 알려드릴 수 없습니다. 이 경우, 구글의 공식 발표자료나 뉴스를 통해 최신 정보를 얻으실 것을 권장드립니다."},{"prompt":"바드가 2023년 5월에 정식 출시했으니, 그때는 없었을수도 있겠네요","completion":"2023년 5월에 정식으로 출시된 '바드'에 대한 정보가 제 지식 업데이트 범위를 벗어나기 때문에, 저는 이에 관한 최신 정보를 제공할 수 없습니다. 만약 해당 서비스가 구글에서 발표한 새로운 인공지능 대화 혹은 챗봇 서비스라면, 이를 이용하거나 이에 대한 상세 정보를 얻기 위해서는 구글의 공식 웹사이트 또는 발표 자료를 참고하시는 게 좋습니다. 바드와 관련된 주요 기능, 사용방법, 새로운 기술적 진보 등에 대해 알고 싶으시면, 해당 서비스를 직접 이용해 보시거나 시장 분석, 사용 후기, 기술 블로그 등을 통해 더 많은 정보를 얻을 수 있습니다. 구글의 기술적 발전을 고려할 때, 바드는 아마도 자연언어 처리, 머신 러닝, 인공지능 분야에서 뛰어난 성능을 보여주는 서비스일 가능성이 큽니다."},{"prompt":"i did some postings on 1.

Australian Journal of Linguistics. Introduction Singing is an activity that happens in every society. But the ways that texts and music align with each other and the ways meanings are conveyed, and how the activity fits into larger contexts vary considerably from society to society. The study of song draws in not only the discipline of musicology but also many fields of linguistic inquiry*phonology, poetics, morphology, semantics and pragmatics. Like words and morphemes, songs are form-meaning units to be included in any complete language description. The papers in this volume reveal songs to be highly structured art forms that have the ability to convey complex associations of meaning beyond everyday spoken language. The papers arise from a workshop that aimed to explore the linguistic features of song in a cross-disciplinary context with a view to strengthening ties between linguists, musicologists and anthropologists working in this field.1 The papers relate to two main areas of investigation: (i) the formal properties of song; and (ii) the meanings of songs. The formal properties of song involve at the least, a textual component and a musical component.2 The text may be subject to constraints; it may draw on words from a limited vocabulary, require a set number of syllables per line or a rhyme in particular positions. The musical component too is usually organized within a set tonal structure and rhythmic meter, and can also involve significant contrasts in tempo, dynamic range and voice quality. Accompanying instrumentation may also be part of the musical structure of song. Song may also require text and music to align in a set way, for example stressed syllables to align with a strong musical beat. Many of the songs considered in this volume are part of a much larger performance involving dance, gesture, costumes and designs. These may also be part of the formal properties of song, and their alignment with text and music should also be considered. In the area of meaning, songs are of particular interest as they frequently have distinct readings from that which would be assigned to them on the basis of straightforward compositional semantic principles, in the same way that phrasal idioms do. As well, song often conveys more meanings, significances and resonances than an ordinary speech utterance, and in this respect songs resemble poetry. In songs, meanings are encoded not only in the text, but also through a complex interaction of the music, dance, visual designs and their associations with specialized knowledge, including knowledge about the context of performance. This has led a number of researchers to perceive songs as a package (Berndt 1965: 247; Tonkinson 1978: 112; Kartomi 1984: 60; Wild 1984: 192; Sutton 1987; Barwick 2000: 329, 2003: 8283; Turpin 2005). A song text itself is often what Sperber and Wilson (1986) call ‘weakly communicative’. This means that the hearer is required to make many inferences to receive a message, and as a result many interpretations of the message are possible. Such texts can be described as opaque (Walsh 2007). This contrasts with various types of ‘strongly communicative’ spoken utterances where the choice of syntax and words makes explicit the intended message. The ways in which enculturated listeners derive meanings from songs involve investigating semantic and pragmatic aspects of the song text,3 as well as specialized cultural and real-world knowledge, including knowledge of the song performance as a speech event. Knowledge in all these areas may be evoked when hearing particular songs. The aesthetic pleasure speakers derive from interpreting songs with opaque song texts may, in part, arise from the ‘recomposition of something anew’ rather than the ‘composition of something new’ (Fabb 1997: 8).4 1.1. Scope and Context of this Volume The articles in this volume are concerned with the form and/or meaning of songs, with a particular focus on the song texts. Viewed as a composite of text and music, a comprehensive study of song favours a cross-disciplinary approach. Unfortunately, studies of song do not always travel well between linguistics and musicology since the same terms can be used in different ways. For example, the terms ‘rhythm’, ‘stress’ and ‘tone’ have different, specific meanings in linguistics and musicology. In order to manage this issue, we have encouraged authors to define all technical terms to foster understandings across the disciplines. The definition of song we use in this volume is a sequence of syllables (‘text’) that is sung,5 where singing is recognized within the relevant community as the most appropriate method of delivering the text. Song cannot simply be defined as a musical setting of words, as many songs contain vocables, such as ‘tra-la-la’, which are not words and yet are part of a song text (the article by Apted in this volume is a case in point). Sometimes a whole line may have no identifiable words (Strehlow 1971; Garde 2007: 41). Our definition of song excludes the spontaneous singing of speech, as, although this may draw on notions of song, often for humorous effect, the text itself is not considered a song. By ‘singing’ we mean a vocal style with rhythmic and usually also melodic properties. In some languages what are often translated as ‘songs’ may be delivered through intoning, wailing or reciting where there is rhythmic but not melodic variation.6 Different linguistic communities may well define the boundary between speech and song differently. In casting our net widely, our definition of songs includes those genres that may be performed without an apparent melodic structure, such as chants. In the past 20 years there have been a number of collections concerned with Australian Aboriginal songs (Clunies Ross et al. 1987; Barwick et al. 2005). Most recently Studies in Aboriginal Song: A Special Issue of Australian Aboriginal Studies (2007) contains excellent collaborative work between musicologists and linguists on Australian Aboriginal song.7 The present volume furthers work on Aboriginal songs and extends the geographic area of research by including articles on songs from a diverse range of language communities including English, French, Spanish and lesser known musical genres from the Pacific and South-East Asia. We turn now to consider the two main areas of exploration in detail. In Section 2 we consider the form of songs and in Section 3, the meanings of songs. In each section we describe the types of analytical issues that arise and highlight the approaches taken by the authors of this volume to these areas. 2. Form and Structural Organization of Songs At the most basic level, a song must involve text and music. Finer-grained analysis reveals organizational units that combine to form a song. The organizational units found in many English songs include lines, couplets, refrains, verses, choruses and stanzas,8 all of which occur in the songs considered by Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez in this volume. In many languages the organizational units are not named, just as grammatical units might not be named. Instrumental introductions, musical interludes, vocal sections (analogous to verses) and text phrases (analogous to lines) are organizational units in the Kaddikkaddik songs of west Arnhem Land identified by O’Keeffe in this volume. The organizational structure of a song can have scope over both text and music. A refrain, for example, is a repeated line of text and melody. A verse, on the other hand, has the same melody but a different text. Sound patterning such as rhymes often (but not always) occurs at the end of organizational units. In this volume Morey finds various types of obligatory rhyme in Tai Phake songs of north-east India, whereas Walsh finds an absence of rhyme in Aboriginal songs, though he acknowledges other possible types of sound patterning.9 The musical component alone may have its own structure. For example, the pitches of notes are bounded by the tonal structure of the particular musical genre or the musical system of the enculturated listeners. In many songs rhythm is organized into a repeating pattern of isochronous beats where some beats are stronger than others, i.e. rhythmic meter. The articles by Nancarrow and O’Keeffe discuss meter in Aboriginal songs. Duple meter is where every second beat is weaker than the first, while triple meter is where every second and third beat is weaker than the first (such as a waltz). Meter is often hierarchically ordered so that in addition to the tactus*the beats to which one taps*it is possible to recognize larger or smaller divisions of the beat.10 Where the beat divides into two units this is referred to as simple meter, and where the beat divides into three units this is referred to as compound meter. In Australian Aboriginal songs, polyrhythmic meters, where the percussion accompaniment is performed at a different meter to that performed by the voice, are also common (see Nancarrow, in this volume). Similarly, tempo*the speed of the beats or underlying pulse of the song*may be constrained by the genre of the song. In many Aboriginal songs tempo is constrained by the particular meter and beating accompaniment of the song. This cluster of rhythmic features has led to the term ‘rhythmic mode’ (see O’Keeffe, in this volume).11 In addition to the grammar of the spoken language, a song may have specific textual conventions. Some songs may prefer particular parts of speech or particular sounds in the same position of a line. Some may draw from a limited vocabulary, have a reduced syntax, or a different phoneme inventory to that of the spoken language.12 In this volume Apted finds a greater number of vowels in Inyjalarrku songs of north-east Arnhem Land than in everyday speech, a finding in common with songs from other areas (Strehlow 1971: 67; Sherzer 1990: 16; Turpin 2005: 272). It is important to remember that song is an art form that features the voice as a musical instrument (Fornas 2003: 49) and vowels are the main pitch-bearing unit of the voice. Particular types of vowels can help overcome the adverse effects of consonant production on tune and tone and allow one to sing softly or quickly without losing the pitch (Emmons 2002); the voice may thus use sounds purely for their aesthetic effect. Unlike other instruments, however, the voice also produces spoken language. We are challenged then to avoid viewing song as a derivative of speech. There may also be constraints on the linguistic variety used in song. Recent work on northern Aboriginal songs has found that particular song genres are associated with particular languages (Barwick et al. 2007: 8).13 In this volume Apted considers how Inyjalarrku songs are entirely spirit language and contain no words from everyday speech. Non-speech words are common in Australian Aboriginal songs, and researchers have often viewed song texts in terms of their divergence from spoken language (see, for example, Alpher 1976; Dixon 1984; Donaldson 1984; Merlan 1987; Sutton 1987; Tunstill 1995). In contrast, the papers by Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez, Crozet, Morey, Sollis, and Stebbins and Planigale consider songs whose linguistic variety is primarily that of everyday speech. Finally, there can be requirements on how text, music and song structure interact. The length of lines may adhere to a regular count of some aspect of linguistic form. This is called poetic meter.14 As an example, Dell and Elmedlaoui (2008) find that in many Berber songs, lines adhere to a repeating four-mora pattern that is referred to as a ‘foot’.15 In addition, they find that every second syllable of the foot must align with a strong beat. A similar approach is taken by Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez in this volume. She compares the extent to which lexical stress must align with strong musical beats in English and Spanish folk songs, a well-documented requirement for English songs (Hayes 1983; Hayes & Kaun 1996; Hayes & MacEachern 1998). She also compares the extent to which the principle of ‘one syllable be set to one note’ exists in English and Spanish songs.16 Both Morey and Sollis in this volume, consider the way in which lexical tone aligns with musical pitch.17 To what extent song melodies are constrained by the melody of speech is a particularly relevant question in relation to tone languages. Morey observes in Tai Phake songs a trade-off where alignment of one aspect of text to music provides freedom in how another area of text is aligned. He finds that when lexical tone and musical pitch align, grammatical units need not match the organizational units of the song. However, when lexical tone and musical pitch do not align there is strict matching of grammatical units with the half-line unit. In exploring the relationship between linguistic tone and melody in pikono songs from Papua New Guinea, Sollis finds that linguistic tone contours and melodic contours match within the constraints of the melodic structure. A melodic phrase cannot descend further than an interval of a fifth. Where an intonational decline is over a long portion of text, this musical constraint forces a misalignment of linguistic tone contour with melody. In many respects songs show a sensitivity to the relationship between speech prosody and music. The nature and cross-linguistic variation of this relationship is the concern of the sub-field of text-setting (Lerdahl & Jackendoff 1983; Halle & Lerdahl 1993; Kiparsky 2006; Fabb & Halle 2008; Hayes 2008; Hayes & Kaun 1996; Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez 2007, Turpin 2007a). In general we find that the highly structured nature of songs can force adjustments to the text not normally seen in the spoken form of the language. This competition between the desire to adhere to the song structures and the desire to remain faithful to the spoken language has led to Optimality Theory in phonology being applied to text-setting in song (Hayes & MacEachern 1998). Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez, in this volume, uses this methodology to show that constraints which regulate rhythm in spoken language are also those that determine how words are set to musical rhythm in stanzaic Spanish and English folk songs. This provides an interesting comparison to Dell and Halle’s work on text-setting in French and English songs (2008). Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez finds that in Spanish, a so-called syllabletimed language, different texts set to the same melodic line are more likely to contain the same number of syllables than in English songs, although often at the expense of aligning prominent syllables with strong musical beats. The reverse is the case in English, a so-called stress-timed language, where lines are more likely to contain differing numbers of syllables but less likely to contain stress mismatches. Such research supports the view that the relation of lyrics to music in songs is rooted in the sound structure of the language (Fabb 1997), yet contrasts with the view that the sound structure of speech, literary language and song might have quite different explanations (Kiparsky 2006: 7; Fabb & Halle 2008). The use of language to draw attention to the sound qualities of the message itself rather than its meaning is what Jakobson calls the poetic function of language (1960, 1987: 71). By selecting equivalent and contrasting aspects of languages to create a sequence, such ‘parallelism’ (Jakobson 1987) gives a temporal dimension to language, as each sound relates to what comes before and after it. Parallelism can also be applied to semantics and syntax.18 Walsh, in this volume, considers various types of parallelism in applying Friedrich’s theory of polytropy (1991) to Aboriginal songs. A related feature is the repeated use of formulaic expressions. These may be limited to a particular position in the song or line, and are often set to the same musical pattern. In contrast to parallelism, a formula need not occur in a regular sequence. In this volume Sollis, Apted, Walsh and Morey identify formulaic text in the songs they investigate.19 As well as drawing attention to the song’s own form, parallelism and formulas may assist in the memorizing of songs. To ascertain the structure of a well-formed song it is not always possible to identify ‘ungrammatical’ songs in the same way ungrammatical speech can be identified. In some cases songs may form a finite set, and may be perceived as being created by spirits rather than living people. In such cases it may not be easy to access native speaker intuitions about a proposed ill-formed song, as the singer may evaluate the song in terms of its origin rather than its structure. It may be important to analyse multiple performances of a song in order to understand what aspects of a song’s structure do not vary and are thus significant and defining, and what aspects are open to variation and creativity. Variation may signal features of a particular singer, or a particular social context of a given performance. Crozet, in this volume, considers three very different versions of La Marseillaise, where she relates their differences to the socio-cultural discourse of their times; yet all are regarded as exemplars of ‘the La Marseillaise’. 3. The Meanings and Significances of Songs Songs are often much more difficult to translate than speech. In some instances the difficulties may be due to the text containing words that are not of everyday speech or because the songs represent concepts that are difficult to grasp. In some communities certain songs are only translatable to particular members of society (e.g. Keen 1977; Clunies Ross 1986: 242). Thus the inability to translate a song may be due to its inherently restricted nature, as discussed by Stebbins and Planigale in this volume. A key difference between speech and song is the more deeply embedded and artefact-like status of the text, a feature in common with poetry, proverbs, rhyming slang, proper names and religious sermons. Yet unlike these purely linguistic forms, song also includes music. This combination of the song text and musical components has the ability to convey different types of meanings in complex ways. Where song performance also involves dancing, painting and adornment of special items, these non-verbal aspects can also contribute to the meaning of a song. So far we have used the word ‘meaning’ rather loosely as a term covering many types of meanings and associations. A complete account of song meaning requires a distinction between different types of meaning and the ways in which meanings are conveyed. Nancarrow identifies three ways in which Lardil burdal songs convey meaning: through the text of a song, through the rhythm (musical meaning) and through interpretations transmitted independently of the song text, what she calls ‘culturally ascribed meaning’. In the next section we identify different types of meanings that songs can convey: lexical or word meaning, song text meaning (the meaning of the words in the context of the particular song), connotative and interactional meanings; and we also consider the ways in which these are conveyed. 3.1. Word Meaning All the articles in this volume identify, or are concerned with identifying, the words in songs and their meanings. Word meaning can also be conveyed through music, such as the downward interval in ‘Swing Low, Sweet Chariot’ which reflects the meaning of the downward movement to earth (Patel 2008: 342). Such word painting can also be conveyed through dance. Nancarrow, in this volume, shows how the accompanying dance emulating a brolga is the only aspect of the song conveying the meaning ‘brolga’ in a Mornington Island song. It is not uncommon for words to have a different or broader lexical meaning in song than in speech.20 As well, songs, like poetry, may have multiple competing lexical meanings. Here, it is necessary to distinguish the meanings intended by the composer (which may be multiple and intentional), and those constructed by listeners interpreting the song. Intentional ambiguity (which is the basis of puns) may be more widespread in orally transmitted song traditions, as the written form necessarily favours only one lexical form, obfuscating the aesthetic pleasure of holding two simultaneous interpretations of a text. Stebbins and Planigale note that the word ame¯che¯linga in a Mali Baining song means both ‘lizard species’ and ‘ceremonial mask’. Walsh, in this volume, argues that ‘(s)he used his/her hands’ and ‘(s)he said/did’ are two distinct meanings of the same segment of text available to listeners of a Murriny Patha song, although it is not known whether this was the intention of the composer. The music and formal requirements of a song can make it difficult to distinguish the words of a song and can lead to a listener reinterpreting the original text. A classic example of this in English has provided a name for this phenomenon, ‘mondegreens’. It is based on a mishearing in the second line of the English couplet ‘... They have slain the bonny earl of Moray, and laid him on the green’, which was later reinterpreted as ‘... and Lady Mondegreen’.21 Mondegreens are no doubt more common in orally transmitted traditions than in written traditions. Schebeck’s warning against making hasty interpretations about the form of place names based on interpretations by native speakers who may be ‘pressed for answers under the assumption that there must be a simple answer’ (2002: 147148) applies equally to song translation. So far we have considered the lexical meaning of words*their dictionary definition. It is also important to consider the referential meaning of words. Again, it is necessary to distinguish the meanings intended by the composer, and those constructed by listeners interpreting the song. To illustrate the difference between lexical and referential meaning consider a song analysed by O’Keeffe in this volume. The third line is Kaddikkaddik ka-wokdjanganj, ‘The oyster catcher spoke/sang/cried out’. Interpreting the lexical meaning of the words in this line involves knowing what sort of entity an oyster catcher is, including entailments such as it is a type of bird, and what type of vocal action wokdjangan refers to, and the sorts of entities that typically perform this action. Referential meaning is, for example, the specific oyster catcher to which the song refers, which in the case of many Aboriginal Dreaming songs is a specific ancestral being. Referential meaning is obtained by parsing the words and constructing an interpretation of them, so a listener may have different referents from those intended by the composer. For example, the composer of ‘The bonny Earl of Moray’ had one earl in mind, whereas listeners might have different referents depending on which Earl of Moray they thought the song was about. Referential meanings are often more ambiguous in song than in speech. Spoken explanations about whom or to what a song refers, and knowledge about the song style or performance context, can play a role in conveying referential meaning. In societies that recognize composers*individual(s) who are the creators of songs*these people are often regarded as the legitimate source of meaning, and any listener’s reinterpretation is regarded as ‘wrong’. In contrast, in societies where songs are perceived as pre-existing rather than composed by individuals, as in much of Aboriginal Australia, meanings are legitimized according to the status and genealogy of the person interpreting the song. A reinterpretation of lexical or referential meaning is thus of little relevance to the enculturated listeners (see, for example, Wild 1987: 109; Tunstill 1995: 64; Keogh 1996; Turpin 2005: 332). While words in some songs have multiple lexical meanings, some may have no lexical meaning. Apted, O’Keeffe and Nancarrow discuss songs where the texts, or parts of the text, include words that the majority of enculturated listeners cannot interpret. Where the text makes use of words that are not from everyday speech, people may perceive the text to involve words whose meaning is no longer known. Songs are often repositories of archaic words, as they tend to be stable entities due to their tightly structured form. Alternatively people may perceive the words to involve spirit language, whose lexical content remains unknown to people, or known only to specialists of spirit language22 (Apted, O’Keeffe, in this volume). A third possibility is that the text may contain ‘vocables’*syllables used to fill the structural requirements of the song or simply for their acoustic properties (Clunies Ross 1986: 242; Koch & Turpin 2008: 171). Apted observes that non-lexical units are ‘‘‘meaningful’’ in the more abstract sense of this term’ (see Section 3.3 below). O’Keeffe similarly finds that the spirit language represents the call of an oyster catcher bird, and a spoken narrative reveals the oyster catcher to be the subject of the song style; thus the song text ‘encodes the relationship to external narratives’. 3.2. Text Meaning For some songs it can be difficult to know what a line or the song as a whole means, even when the lexical meaning of words is known (see also Merlan 1987: 150). This is often the case with song texts that have anaphoric words or where there is no semantic link between lines. Stebbins and Planigale refer to this level of meaning as ‘text meaning’. An example of the difference between word meaning and text meaning can be illustrated with a line of the Mali Baining song whose words Stebbins and Planigale gloss as ‘maybe I can go with you’. They explain the text meaning of the song as ‘a man missing his brother and wishing to go and be with him’. However, not all songs have readily accessible text meanings. Walsh finds ‘The ‘‘pelican song’’ is almost entirely composed of ‘‘actual’’ words but remains rather cryptic for this observer’. He suggests exploring different types of tropes*imagistic, modal, formal, contiguity-based and analogical*in order to elucidate broader meanings and structures in songs. Where songs form part of a larger corpus, particular text meanings can sometimes be obtained in relation to other songs in the corpus. Curran, in this volume, finds that a Warlpiri song containing the word for a particular type of tree ‘at this point in the song cycle indicates that the women are no longer in their home country’. As with word meaning, there may be multiple, intentional text meanings of a song. A Pitjantjatjara song with the word ‘cup or mound shape’ is said to be about a termite mound by one singer, a women’s breast by another, and an insulator on a telegraph pole by another; and the particular textual meaning one derives, or is given, depends on one’s own level of knowledge (Ellis 1985: 6264). A number of researchers of Australian Aboriginal songs have suggested that the ability to have multiple text meanings ensures songs have relevance and applicability to many contexts (Tonkinson 1978: 102; Marett 2005: 199).23 Many of the articles in this volume show that specialized cultural knowledge is required to deduce text meanings (Crozet, Curran, Nancarrow, Stebbins and Planigale, and Walsh).24 In many societies not everyone has access to the same level of specialized cultural knowledge, and so there can be varying degrees to which a listener is enculturated in relation to a particular genre or song. Thus the ‘trajectory’ of understanding of a song will vary depending on one’s knowledge (Walsh, in this volume). Some songs have accompanying explanations in the form of a narrative or exegesis (Donaldson 1979, 1984; Strehlow 1971).25 These elucidate not just text meaning, but can reveal word meanings, especially where the text has a highly constrained form. Such narratives may form a unique type of speech event (Hymes 1970), distinct from explanations of other types of phenomena. Where the narrator must be of a particular social status interactional meanings are also encoded in the speech act. In parts of Australia only an owner of a song can provide an explanatory narrative. Understanding the communicative behaviour of specific cultural settings, such as song performance and explanation, is the subject of investigation of ethnographies of speaking (Hymes 1970; Bauman & Sherzer 1974; Sherzer 1990).26 Nancarrow, in this volume, refers to the meaning of some songs as ‘learnt’ rather than ‘interpreted through analysis of song text’, and refers to this source as ‘popular opinion’. This can be compared to the way school children are sometimes ‘handed down’ the meaning of their Latin school song rather than through textual translation. The detailed meanings of songs discussed by Curran demonstrate how text meanings of Warlpiri songs rely on a listener having specialized environmental, ceremonial and other types of cultural knowledge. 3.3. Songs as Mnemonics The tightly interwoven nature of text and music enables songs to be used as mnemonic devices, especially in preliterate societies, where song and poetry has been documented as a mnemonic aid for events and places (Weiner 1991: 45; Feld & Basso 1996: 109; Basso 1996).27 Even in contemporary literate societies we find songs used as mnemonics (consider the ‘ABC’ Alphabet song in English). Recently the Bee Gees ‘Staying alive’ has been promoted by pediatrics as a song to sing while administering CPR to help people find the correct compression rate.28 It is not difficult to imagine how a song can then gain additional significances*especially emotional responses*by use in such different contexts. It has often been stated that Aboriginal songs act as mnemonics for linked places, and so the song series as a whole is akin to a musical map (Strehlow 1970: 94). The case studies of Aboriginal songs in this volume (Curran, O’Keeffe, Nancarrow, Apted, and Walsh) all include songs that stand for particular places. 3.4. Interactional Meanings Like other kinds of speech acts, songs have interactional meaning. Interactional meaning refers to the attitude and expectations between the speaker and the hearer. In singing, where the role of the singer is often fixed (not anyone can sing), and the speech act context-driven (singing can only occur at certain times and places), interactional meanings are dependent on the genre of the song. For example, by attending a concert featuring a singer, a listener expects to be moved emotionally*or at least be aesthetically pleased by the singing. In contrast, the addressee of ‘Happy Birthday’ interprets this singing interactionally to mean that s/he is a special person, and that the singers think him/her worthy, especially if followed by ‘For s/he’s a jolly good fellow’. In the genre of political songs analysed by Crozet, the singer signals as interactional meaning that they want to spur the addressee into political action, assuming the role of teacher to the listener. In this genre the addressee is simultaneously the government (often the subject of the songs) and the everyday citizen listening to the song. Traditional Aboriginal songs can also have multiple addressees: fellow performers (usually countrymen), listeners (usually outsiders) and ancestral spirits. This leads to interactional meanings of identity such as ‘I am from this country’ (see Curran, in this volume; compare also national anthems), ‘I have a strong attachment to my spiritual ancestors’, or as Apted states ‘... the potency of one’s spiritual life, which manifests in one’s ability to receive and sing songs from the spirits’. In Central Australia, singing particular songs can bring about changes to the physical worlds (e.g. bring about rain), also a type of interactional meaning. 3.5. Connotive Meanings Songs can connote particular situations, behaviours and events. Such pragmatic and associated knowledge is comparable to what McConnell-Ginet calls ‘conceptual baggage’ (2008). Curran, in this volume, argues that visual images in both the song text, the dance movements and visual designs connote certain concepts, for example circular shapes ‘represent home, women and protection’. Walsh, in this volume, discusses connotative meanings of place names in northern Australian Aboriginal songs, which act as a kind of shorthand to invoke a chain of connectedness between one specific place, the other places in the vicinity and/or on the same Dreaming track, the stories associated with that place through Dreamings, ancestors and exploits by living relatives at that place to their country as a whole. Some connotations may be evoked only in the context of a particular song style and so are the results of knowledge of the particular song style speech event. This can be compared to the way English speakers know ‘Auld Lang Syne’ is sung on New Year’s Eve, and so the song connotes the significance of this annual event and associated behaviours. Stebbins and Planigale refer to this level of meaning as ‘meaning in context’. While this is similar to other context-dependant speech acts such as religious services (compare ‘Ashes to ashes, dust to dust’), music provides an additional modality for evoking the social context of the songs. Indeed, even without the text, simply humming the melody of a song can evoke its context. The Dreamings connoted in the songs discussed by Apted are the result of the religious context of their performance rather than from any lexical meaning of the text. In the songs discussed by Curran and O’Keeffe, a word for a plant or animal occurs in a song genre associated with the Dreaming. Through knowledge of this genre a number of connotations and associated meanings are available to the listener. For example, in Central Australia a Dreaming song can evoke the place where this totemic being originated, its activities in the Dreamtime, and the people who own the particular Dreaming. All this in addition to the non-genre dependant connotations of the song*such as the cultural uses of the plant or animal and the listener’s/singer’s own personal experiences with that plant or animal. It may turn out that connotations of particular flora and fauna may be widespread; for example the connotation of the peaceful dove with loneliness, noted by Walsh, in this volume, is also found in Central Australian songs where the emotion relates to the activities of this bird in the Dreaming and the plaintive nature of its call. Knowledge of the particular song style speech event may affect the ability to derive not just connoted meanings but also text meaning, as Stebbins and Planigale find for different styles of Mali Baining songs. 3.6. Emotional Responses Music, poetry and other forms of language all have the ability to provoke emotional responses, yet their means for evoking emotions differ. Crozet, in this volume, argues that in the French La Marseillaise the combination of march-like music with combat vocabulary helps put soldiers in an emotional state suited to killing and to selfsacrifice. In Central Australia, Ellis finds traditional wailing begins on a set pitch, and so for enculturated listeners this pitch can be associated with mourning, even when the pitch occurs in a different context (1985: 67). While certain broad musical genres can become associated with particular emotional states,29 specific songs can have particular meaning through the tight association between text and music, even when their text is absent or altered. Consider a well-known tune such as ‘God Save the Queen’, where from the music alone an enculturated listener can derive meanings related to the text. The ability of a song’s tune to carry associated meanings of its absent text is the basis of the parody in the songs analysed by Crozet. A related phenomenon is where well-known songs are used in novel contexts for particular* often humorous*effect, particularly in news reports, documentaries and in conversation amongst people who share knowledge about a particular song. Finally, certain connotations or emotional responses may develop through the frequency of particular vocabulary or sound sequences occurring in song (see also Patel 2008: 343). The question raised by Walsh of whether particular vocabulary or tropes are widespread in particular languages or traditions, may also reveal these to have connotative or emotional significances. A phrase or word uttered in the context of conversation may connote a song or song genre and all that this song signifies for an enculturated listener. This use of language can be a source of humour and intellectual pleasure in everyday interaction. 4. Conclusion Our understanding of the arrangement of musical components and their effect on linguistic form is still in its infancy. Song, as a universal genre of language, and one ‘in which musical and linguistic meanings intertwine’ (Patel 2008: 342) also offers a rich field for investigations into meaning. Collaborative research between linguists and musicologists is already underway on Aboriginal Australian songs (Marett & Barwick 2007). We hope that this volume highlights the importance of such collaborative work on songs from all areas in order to promote a deeper understanding of the nature of song: how particular cultures use language to create song, how language and music interact, how songs convey meaning, the sorts of meanings they convey, their intended audience and how knowledge of songs can further our understanding of linguistic prosody. 2 дослідження: Another Road: An Intersection of Music and Language. Jiradej Setabundhu INTRODUCTION Specialists tend to stay within their field. Knowledgehas become very specific, usually to the point that people outside such immediate circle cannot understand.In a way, this is necessary as we gather moreinformation and dig deeper into its meanings. Thedownside of this world of super-specialty is that we tendto lose touch with the big picture for the lack of anyconnecting mechanism that holds together the different parts of the total knowledge. The connections betweendifferent branches are lost.Things have not always been this way, however. Inearlier times, a learned scholar often possessed skills invarious fields. John Dunstable, a Renaissance Englishcomposer, was also an astronomer and a mathematician but one of the numerous examples. Although he isknown today chiefly as a composer, there is no doubtthat his knowledge in astronomy inspired his music, andthe underlying durations, structures, and symmetries ofhis isorhythmic motets and masses are due in no small part to his prowess in mathematics [1].Perhaps we cannot go back to the way things were, but accepting what other branches of knowledge canoffer will be beneficial for pursuing our own field.Sometimes the cross-pollination between the two fieldsis such that it provides a new perspective for us to seewhat should have been obvious but for some reason wasoverlooked. This study discusses specifically how musicand language intertwine in parallel- and contrary-motiondances that have inspired composers to develop theirartistic ideas. This study also likes to share someexamples of how a simple approach to language provides a springboard for my musical ideas. 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2.1. Music and Language A poem, a story, a song, and a sonata are all time- based art. They flow through time from the beginning tothe end as opposed to, say, a painting that a viewer can perceive as a whole. One can argue that time is requiredto appreciate a sculpture in its totality as three-dimensional art, but a viewer can view sculpture in anon-linear fashion and still grasp the effect of the work.On the other hand, the coherence of a story or amovement of a symphony would be destroyed if alistener approached its timeline randomly. To be sure,many authors have experimented with linearity, beginning a story from the middle of the plot and so on, but this is intentional, and the result is still linear,although not in the way the reader might expect.Music is closely related to language to the extent thatit metaphorically adopts some of the languageterminologies. When we hear a group of musicians perform an improvisatory passage, for example, we say that they are “in conversation” . In an academic setting,the terms such as phrases , sentences , and periods have been used in classes on musical form and harmony todescribe the various temporal length of a musical unit,although it must be said that the exact definitions ofthese terms can vary from one school of thought to thenext, and are at best a little ambiguous unless applied to very simple musical excerpts [2]. To some, twoconsecutive musical phrases, the former ends with weak punctuation ( cadence ) and the latter strong one, form asentence or a period [3]. A. Schoenberg, on the otherhand, provided a more specific description of a sentencewhere the first part contains two statements of a motive,usually in tonic and dominant, and the second part provides a more developing treatment of the materialsfrom the first, often employing rhythmic reduction andthematic fragmentation, to bring the sentence to aconcluding cadence [4].One can trace back in time to even earlier periodsand still finds the interwoven thread of language andmusic. Around the mid-eighteenth century, a decade before the death of J. S. Bach, a new musical style called galant emerged that was to be a link between the learned polyphonic work of the Baroque style and the Classicalstyle that focuses on a more balance of the vertical andlinear musical ideas, culminating in the music of Haydnand Mozart. The characteristics of galant music includea rejection of counterpoint, clear separation of melodyand accompaniment, shorter themes, symmetrical phrasestructure, and strophic, regular rhythm related todancing. The adjectives that perhaps best suit this newstyle are pleasant, free, spontaneous, and attractive. Theorigin of the style was closely related to the ideal of theera that also pervaded other art forms. Goethe wroteabout a similar writing style that was typically feminine,with short phrases and many sentence breaks — the style that also appeared in J. J. Rousseau’s epistolary novel Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse and short statements in the libretto of Pergolesi’s opera La serva padrona [5].Despite the apparent difference in communicativecapability between language and music, the former ableto convey specific information while the latter onlygeneral expressions, the difference is simply in degrees.Language, unlike other human institutions such as customs, fashion, or laws, “is limited by nothing in the choice of means, for apparently nothing would preventthe associating of any idea whatsoever with just any sequence of sounds [6].” The linguistic signs and their meanings are related not naturally but instead sociallyand historically — therefore arbitrary. Any specificlanguage can never be universal because to understandits code, a participant must immerse him/herself in thespecific cultural, historical, and cognitive backgrounds.Many subtexts and jokes in sitcoms from the US, e.g., Seinfeld and Entourage , would be lost to viewers fromforeign countries who have no background on thethemes — life in New York City in the former andHollywood extravaganza lifestyle in the latter.Many think of music as being more universal, but,like any language, its power to convey the meanings,general as they are require that a listener shares itscultural, historical, and cognitive contexts. In general, itrefers to the lack of precision in describing the physicalworld with the clarity of human language. Of course, wehave to set aside some claims as obvious exaggerationsto make a point, as when R. Strauss boasted that he could “differentiate musically between a knife and afork” with his composition and orchestration techniques used in Symphonia domestic [7]. What we see as auniversal response to a melody, harmony, or rhythm isnothing but a learned experience acquired from years ofimmersion in a proper environment. An Indian musicianunaccustomed to western music would likely find the12-equal temperament tuning crude and could not relateto the emotional swells of the nineteenth-centurywestern music. Likewise, a western composer neverexposed to eastern scales would not understand theflexibility of the Thai tuning and hear the music as outof tune. Film composers have learned the craft of manipulating viewers’ responses to specific formulas well within a particular environment, and it is nowonder — although unfortunate — that many blockbusterhits share similar thematic, harmonic, and rhythmic materials. M. Danielewski saw man’s attempt to relate the concept of echo to God as a reason why the designsof most churches support ample reverb: “Divinityseemed defined by echo,” he wrote [8], “The hallowedalways seems to abide in the province of the hollow.” But this is true only to a society where echoes and longreverb time are not common. For a tribe living in amountainous area, with valleys and peaks, and space in between large enough for sound reflections to bedistinguishable from the sound source (longer than 0.1seconds), echoes would be a common occurrence, andthus would not seem fit to describe Divinity.More concrete examples can be found in dance,which, like language, communicates through culturalcodes. H. Bannerman analyzed the western classical andmodern dance and matched linguistic categories,including vocabulary and syntax, the utterance and thespeech act, to dance counterparts [9]. The gestures indances of many Asian countries consist of pre-determined patterns, each of which represents a specificaffection and meaning. Indian dance, a part of a largerdrama, is divided into three categories. Two of these, natya and nritya, — drama (story or plot) and mime(gestures of the dancer body) respectively — togetherconvey the meaning of the dance [10]. The dancer/actorcommunicates the story and expressions via numerousstylized gestures using the movement of head, eyebrows,nose, cheek, chin, neck, breasts, eyes, feet, and hands, ofwhich those involving eyes and hands are the mostimportant. A single gesture may signify many different,unrelated meanings, not unlike human language [11] Without knowing the relevant cultural codes, it will beimpossible for the audience to appreciate the performance. 2.2. Music and Structure Since music shares many characteristics with literarywork, it is no surprise that many composers control themusical structure with those of poetry or story. Thisseemingly simple action helps to fulfill the logicaldecision for the musical form. The more specificmeaning of language shapes the abstract musicalstructure, leading the sound along with the parallel flow.The evolution of atonal music, i.e., music without atonal center, is a good demonstration of how languagecan be a great aid to composers. The first decade of thetwentieth century saw western art music struggle tomove forwards. Tonality, the driving force of music thusfar based on the attracting force between the tonic (the tonal center) and the dominant (the tonic’s strongest overtone a fifth above), was disintegrating, and therewas no other system available. Since tonality governedthe connection of chords, it also controlled the pace (orrhythm) of harmonic changes, in addition to the voiceleading. Therefore, composing atonal music wasdifficult because composers had no access to any self-consistent applicable compositional procedures [12].The only possible guidelines were usually in the form ofnegative rules to tonality, e.g., the avoidance oftraditional chords and conjunct melodies [13].It is understandably symptomatic that early examplesof atonal music tend to be very short, some of whichonly a few minutes long. To extend the length beyondthis miniature scale, composers often employed text tomusic. The prose/poem-turn-libretto provided a strongsense of direction on which the music could be carried.It gave a logical structure to the flow of expressions thatthe composers could hold on. Schoenberg, a leadingcomposer of this period, was able to complete a 30-minutes long Erwartung in 17 days because of thelibretto. In this expressionist monodrama, the poet andmedical graduate Marie Pappenheim told a psychological story of a woman searching in a darkforest for her lost lover whom she might have killed.The libretto does not have any narrative plot per se but provides a backbone for the music, leading it to a progressively more intense emotional state of the protagonist’s mind. The athematic nature ofSchoenberg’s music reflects the text without any progressive story. When Schoenberg said to Pappenheim, “Then write me an opera libretto, younglady… Write whatever you wish, I need a libretto ,” [14]he did not just propose a challenge, but also a request.The astonishing speed which he completed the workindicates the effectiveness of a proper text as acompositional aid.Although Schoenberg implied that his music did notserve merely as a translation of a text into sound,claiming that he was usually inspired simply by thesound of the first words of the text and composed themusic without any regard to the rest of the text, he later backtracked, saying that other composers misunderstoodand took his comment too literally [15]. The textstructure, indeed, gave him some idea about the structureof the music, as apparent in the 1932 discussion of hisown Four Orchestral Songs , op. 22, where he statedthat, although his use of text did not rely solely on word painting technique, the text did supply the formalorganization to the music [16]. In the melodrama forcabaret Pierrot lunaire , Schoenberg’s seminal work commissioned by Albertine Zehme for a reciter and fivemusicians, the composer selected 21 poems from a cycle by A. Giraud and organized them into three groups ofseven poems — the action that decisively led to thecreation of the opening seven-note motive G#-E-C-D-Bb-C#-G that later appeared in various guises in every poem throughout the work. 2.3. Music and Storytelling The problem exists when trying to integrate a storyinto music. Many musicians would label the work asabsolute music, i.e., music without any associated storyas opposed to program music. However, writing the music accompanying W. B. Yeats’ Sailing to Byzantium can be a solution. The theme of the poem is about ametaphorical journey of a frail old man living in a worldof youth, who decided to sail to the mystical Byzantiumin search of immortality. The transformation of a wasted body into an immortal golden bird provided the idea ofrecycling. Together with the arcana theme, this finallyguided the project into a multimedia work consisting ofa live shadow play and electronic music accompanying a poem reading. The shadow play was a reference to theThai tradition of Nang yai and Nang talung , whereshadows of puppets made of painted buffalo hide were projected onto the screen. In a piece, wasted objectswere used as puppets to emphasize the recyclingconcept. The obscure images of lights and shadows, theelectronic sound of an analog modular synthesizer withcomplicated cable patches, the dramatic reading of the poem, and the incessant sound of the sea set the tone forthe mysterious quest. There are four stanzas in Yeats’ poem. The first two place the narrator in the land of youth while the last twoare set in Byzantium. Here presents the problem of formthat often occurs when we adopt one art form to another.The bipartite structure based on departure and arrival works well in the poem, but such an epic seafaring journey could not be portrayed musically with a short “sailed the seas” phrase as in the poem. A longer duration is needed in the music domain to depict the narrator’s quest successfully. Therefore, another poem with a seafaring theme that would not look out of placeto serve as a long musical arch between the two citieswas searched and S. T. Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner was found. 23 non-consecutive stanzas from Coleridge’s were selected and rearranged to form anew cohesive journey. Delightfully, most of the selectedstanzas contained references to time of day, e.g., TheSun came up upon the left, / Out of the sea came he! /And he shone bright, and on the right / Went down intothe sea were discovered [17]. It turned out that thesequence, as indicated by the selected stanzas, suggesteda nine-day journey.Thus, the final form of the work is tripartite as opposed to the bipartite division of Yeats’ original poem. The placement of the additional Coleridge’s poem in between emphasizes the contrast between theland and the sea. This created fluctuation in tension,which was reflected in the treatment of the light play andthe musical texture [18]. 2.4. Music and Syntax Many eastern composers working in the westerncompositional domain feel, at one time or another, the pressure to write in their local idiom. This is not an easytask because Thai music has a unique system andmethod of composing, which is quite different from thewestern counterpart. Finding the unique characteristicsthat define Thai music is a solution so that through them,the Thai compositional techniques from a different anglecan be approached. It turns out that two characteristicsare indispensable: the strict form of centonization andthe hierarchical structure.Centonization is a technique of composing with pre-existing melody types. It shows in some music from theMedieval period and also occurs in Arab-Andalusianmusic [19]. In either case, the technique implies aflexible application of the pre-composed blocks. Thaiusage, however, is quite strict. Instead of using loosestructural pitch sequences as in melody-types of Arab-Andalusian music, centonization in Thai music is basedon luuk khong — building blocks of the same length, eachof which combines a precise pitch sequence and arhythmic pattern. A composer selects luuk khong andconnects them in a specific order to create a newmelody. In performance, one musician plays the melodywhile others perform melodic variations simultaneouslyon top of the melody. Usually, these variationsthemselves also make use of centonization. The melodyand all variations meet on specific notes at a regularinterval, forming a heterophonic texture. (Some musicologists prefer the term “polyphonic stratification” since it better describes the distinct characteristics ofeach variation instead of a group of more closely relatedmelodies of the typical heterophonic music) [20].In itself, the melody created from luuk khong contains little information about the rhythmic aspect ofthe piece. It is just a base layer upon which rhythms are built. Above it is a pattern of regularly spaced,alternating open/closed ching strokes. The speed of thestrokes determines one of the three metrical levels. Inlevel 3, a single ching cycle occurs in a span of one luukkhong ; level 2 corresponds to the speed of two ching cycles per luuk khong ; the music is in level 1 if there arefour ching cycles per luuk khong . Above the ching is thegong stroke, occurring every two ching cycles. Lastly,the drum pattern called na tap is at the top of thehierarchy. There are many drum patterns, but each alwaays contains three sub-patterns for the three levels.The drum pattern is, again, twice as long as the gongstroke.Thus, we can create a new structure based on Thaimusic by utilizing only the Thai concepts of therhythmic hierarchical system and centonization. We begin by considering music as a simple melody, as manyThai repertoires have been conceived. The first thing isto create a new set of melody types in place of the Thai luuk khong . If there are many of these, then there isstatistically a potential to create something as complexas the Thai music system. But we also have to establisha logical (and aesthetic) system to put these melodic blocks together. One way to do this is to play with the blocks until we have a sense of what works. After a longenough time, a suitable connection will surely emerge.The other way is to create an artificial and arbitrarysystem dictating the connection. Then, too, we need toestablish the logic of the rhythmic hierarchical system.The problem of creating a new system lies in themerit of the materials and processes. The Thai musicalsystem has not arrived at the current state immediately.The compatibility of all luuk khong and their relation tothe rhythmic system indicates a long period ofexperiments with trial and error. Through this period,any unsuitable luuk khong and rhythmic structureswould already be discarded. The whole system is theresult of the developments by many skilled musiciansthrough generations. This is not the case with a newsystem created by an individual, and it would beimpractical to assume the result to be on the same levelas the Thai system So, we need as a model a system from which we canextract both the strict centonization and hierarchicalstructure, one that is a result of collective ideas over aconsiderable period. Fortunately, there is such a systemthat all of us are well acquainted with, i.e., language.The parallel between characters and pitches, words and luuk khong , sentences and phrases/periods, is just one possible interpretation.By basing a musical system on language, we solvemany problems that would occur if we tried to invent anew system. By setting up a mapping method of the pitch/duration pairs and characters, we can construct luuk khong from actual words. The mapping process thatwe use will affect the tonal character of the new luukkhong , but the structure of the language will alsodetermine the sound. Assigning p itch D to the letter “q,” for example, we will not find many luuk khong with twoDs in succession if the system is applied to the Englishlanguage. In any language, some words occur moreoften than others. Consequently, and naturally, some luuk khong will also appear more frequently than others, just like in the Thai system. As for the rhythmichierarchical system, the relationships between luukkhong , ching strokes, gong strokes, and drum patterns inThai music may be translated to those between words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs, for example.Bear in mind that we are not trying to representlanguage through music. We simply use the derivedstructure to solve the problem of creating a new systemcomparable to the Thai music structure. In this case,there is no intention to draw a parallel between the two luuk khong created from the words “Beautiful” and“Pleasing” . It is enough to see the possibility ofreplacing the former with the latter when a suitable occasion occurs, i.e., when the word “Pleasing” cansubstitute for “Beautiful.” The mapping system can be expanded in different ways, covering more parameters,to suit the composer’s needs. In doing so, we will findthat our taste has less role in the musical outcome, andthe characteristics of the language model will directlyaffect the result more [21]. 2.5 Music and Lyrics The perplexity of pop music is that it containsnothing unexplainable by the theory of music we havetoday. It is less complicated than most art music, andany music students completing the sophomore year will be able to analyze everything in most pop songs. Andyet, somehow this simple music has moved generationsof people. The feeling is that the power of pop music liesin its harmony, simple as it may be. So, investigating theharmonic concept of western tonal music will begin. Theidea of tonal music is simple enough: it is music with atonal center. This tone, called the tonic, functions as acenter of gravity, pulling in the other notes of the scale.A tone produced by a musical instrument is acomplex collection of pitches comprising of afundamental pitch and related pitches above it calledovertones. We do not perceive the overtones asindividual notes due to their low amplitudes, but they areresponsible for the tone color of an instrument. Asdemonstrated by Schoenberg, a single pitch alreadyimplies, by its overtones, a major scale plus theassociated harmony on all scale degrees [22]. Amongthese, the fifth scale degree, the dominant, is the mostimportant one because it is the loudest overtone. The pull on the dominant toward the tonic is considered themost important driving force in tonal music, which leadsto the harmonic progression V-I. Likewise, the tonicitself is the overtone of the imaginary fundamental afifth below, which is the fourth scale degree or thesubdominant. The three chords — tonic, dominant, andsubdominant — are called the primary chords becausethey are the first-order derivatives from the overtoneconcept. The other chords are viewed as the primarysubstitutes. Using this descending fifth movement as amodel, a simple theory of harmonic progression is thusestablished: the dominant (V, viiº) goes to the tonic (I,vi, iii); tonic goes to the subdominant (IV, ii); andsubdominant goes to dominant.It is interesting that while art music is predominantlydominant-tonic driven, the same cannot always be saidabout pop music. Analyze the harmonic progressions ofmany pop songs, and we will see that they are lessdominant-tonic-driven. On the contrary, the dominant-subdominant progressions — rarely seen in art music — are very much prevalent. This observation implies twocontradictory explanations: either the harmonic theoriesof art music and pop music are different, or both genresrely on the same theory of harmony, yet somehowinterpret it differently. Since both use the same tonalmaterials, this has led to a tendency toward the secondexplanation. Moreover, the different interpretation iscaused due to the language of the lyrics.Let us now look at pop music briefly in terms ofhistorical development to understand the implication ofthe lyrics. Pop music can be traced far back to the bluesmusic of the African American musicians since the latenineteenth century. Ragtime, then jazz and swing musicin an urban dance setting, and country swing of the 30sare the next evolutionary steps, leading to the rhythm & blues and country music of the 40s, and finally, the rockand roll of the 50s, which would evolve into pop music[23]. In the nineteenth century, all Africans in the USworking as slaves brought their music with them. Bluescan be seen now as a mixture of African music, call-and-response shouts and field hollers of slaves working, andimitation of white man music [24].The 1862 presidential Emancipation Proclamationthat was in effect in 1863 did not change the slave statusovernight, and many African Americans lived in fearand without jobs for many years afterward due toracism. Against this background, blues music prospered.It is not surprising, however, to see that the lyrics of many early blues songs are about sadness, “personal woes in a world of harsh reality: a lost love, the crueltyof police officers, oppression at the hands of white folk,hard times ” [25]. This sadness was to be combined laterwith the angst and yearning that would define rock androll and pop music.Should it be surprising, then, that pop music has adifferent harmonic progression? The tonal music of theeighteenth century is one manifestation of the Age ofEnlightenment, the time when humans celebrated the power of logic and reason. The descending fifth progression reflects the physics of sound, so to speak,and thus fulfilled the aesthetic need of the period. Butcertainly, this fulfilling progression is not suitable to themusic th at needs to portray “harsh reality,” “lost love,”and “oppression.” To reflect them, blues musicians opted for the opposite direction, favoring the dominant-subdominant instead of dominant-tonic progression. Thelove was unfulfilled in the harsh world, so to doanything else would be a lie. Thus, the chord progression of the second half of the twelve-bar bluesform is I-V-IV-I, and the reversal of the standard I-IV-V-I progression of art music. Yes, the theory and physics are still the same, but the mournful lyricsdemand this retrograde progression. And their legacyhas continued to this day in pop music. 3. CONCLUSION Writers tasked with a cross-disciplinary subject arealways at risk of being overly technical or overlysuperficial regarding the content. Likewise, being amusician discussing music matter among linguists mademe careful of using too technical concepts. With manydouble-degree or dual-major programs in many schoolstoday, perhaps researchers and scholars in the future cancross the boundaries between specialized areas better.This discussion is expected to help in seeing the potential of cross-disciplinary study, especially inrelated fields such as music and language. In addition, itis hoped that this discussion will help in seeing the parallel between the two art forms, whether in terms oflarge-scale structures such as ABA or detailedcomponents as when we compare the syntaxes of musicand language. Most importantly, this research willhopefully aid to see that by taking the time to observeother art forms or any human endeavors, people placethemselves on an unfamiliar path. 3 дослідження: Music and Lyric Characteristics of Popular Dutch Funeral Songs. Waldie E. Hanser, Ruth E. Mark, and Ad J. J. M. Vingerhoets. Music is an inextricable part of current Dutch funerals. Since the end of the 20th century, the selection of music played during cremations in the Netherlands has become increasingly personalized and thus more diverse (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). This development is partly due to technical improvements in crematoria that enable them to meet personal music requests by the deceased and bereaved more easily than before when standard sets of songs were more commonplace (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018). Music selection is currently a standard part of most funeral planning. Funeral homes offer advice on how and what music to select and even provide playlists and multimedia links on their websites as examples. The bereaved can experience the music selection process, sometimes after the wishes of or in agreement with the deceased, as comforting (Viper et al., 2020). Funeral music may serve different purposes during the ceremony. Bruin-Mollenhorst (2020) distinguishes the following (1) those that serve the ceremony itself (background music when entering or leaving the ceremony room, or while watching pictures of the deceased), (2) music in between speeches that illustrates or empowers their contents, (3) music that gives expression to the identity of the deceased (the favorite music of the deceased; music that represents aspects of the relationship of the bereaved to the deceased or aspects of the deceased’s identity), (4) emotional control and evoking emotions (music that allows the bereaved to give in to their emotions, or to regain their composure), and (5) lastly, music that we listen to without any discernible objectives. These goals fit in well with general psychological functions of music (Schäfer et al., 2013), more precisely: music listening (1) as self-awareness (e.g., music expresses or confirms some part of one’s identity), (2) to bolster social relatedness (e.g., to feel connected with other people), (3) as mood and emotion regulation (e.g., to feel relaxed). Most music in modern funerals in some way represents the deceased and honors their memory. In these cases, it serves as a musical eulogy (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). Bruin-Mollenhorst (2020) argues that, although lyrics may play a role in the music selection process, for the musical praise, the song texts are often less important than the song as a whole and even less so than the way the entire song connects to the deceased. Contrary to speeches, popular song lyrics are not written explicitly for the deceased, implying that, at most, only some words, a mere sentence, the title, or nothing of the lyrics at all may directly associate with the deceased (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). This does, however, not exclude the possibility that there are recurring words, linguistic properties, or themes that are common in the lyrics of popular funeral music that may make some songs particularly suited to serve this function. Furthermore, it does not explain why certain songs are, despite the increasingly personalized nature of funerals (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018), used quite frequently during funerals. In addition to investigating musical aspects, a linguistic analysis of the song texts may reveal why some songs more often serve as funeral music than others. The aim of the current study is twofold, (1) we seek to replicate and expand upon previous findings on the characteristics of funeral music, and (2) we analyze the lyrics of a selection of funeral songs popular in the Netherlands. Music Characteristics and Lyrics Recently, Mollenhorst and colleagues (2016) examined music characteristics (valence, energy, and tempo) of often-used songs in Dutch crematoria. Based on data from audio analyses, funeral music (N = 3703 songs) was shown to be lower in valence, tempo, and energy than two popular comparison playlists (Top 40 and Top 2000). This resulted in the characterization of funeral music as solemn, serene, and tender. It is, however, unclear which specific parts of a song evoke these emotions since these investigators considered the songs as a whole and did not study the lyrics separately. Analyzing the song as a whole may make sense because, as a listener, it is difficult to separate the impact of the melody from the lyrics. However, considering song texts separately may also prove valuable since the lyrics can substantially contribute to the emotional experience of music and are a way for listeners to relate to songs. Previous studies have yielded mixed results regarding the question as to whether the melody or the song text is mainly responsible for the emotions reported while listening to music (see Ali & Peynircioğlu, 2006 for an overview). However, the research findings of these authors suggested that a song’s melody is the dominant determinant, though lyrics can contribute substantially to the emotions perceived in the song. More specifically, they demonstrated that emotion in response to sad and angry music accompanied by emotionally matching lyrics is more intense. In contrast, in the case of happy and calm music, emotionally congruent lyrics may reduce the intensity of the feelings. Brattico and colleagues (2011) replicated the finding that happy music without lyrics results in stronger positive emotions than happy music with lyrics. In an fMRI study, Brattico et al. (2011) further found more extensive brain activation, particularly in the limbic system, when listening to sad music with lyrics as opposed to without, and happy music without as opposed to with lyrics. Lyrics seem to play a more prominent role when listening to sad music, while music characteristics may be of greater importance when listening to happy music. Lastly, the processing of lyrics may be deeper when accompanied by sad music than in the case of happy music (Fiveash & Luck, 2016). Emotionally congruent lyrics thus intensify sad music, while the opposite is true for happy music. This intensification may partly explain the attraction most people have for sad music for mood-regulatory purposes (e.g., Garrido, 2017; Van den Tol & Edwards, 2013; Van den Tol, 2016). Individuals apply mood regulation techniques to improve their moods. When employing music for this purpose, listeners typically prefer music that best reflects the mood they are in (e.g., Van den Tol, 2016). It is mainly the lyrics of sad music that help listeners to relate and connect to it (Eerola et al., 2015; Van den Tol & Edwards, 2013; Van den Tol, 2016). In general, lyrics may thus be particularly salient to the listeners’ mood, and they may strongly reflect the situation the music is heard in (Baltazar et al., 2019). Funeral music’s lower valence, energy, and tempo than popular music (Mollenhorst et al., 2016) suggests it will sound sad (Schellenberg & Von Scheve, 2012). Funeral music lyrics may follow this trend and contain more negative words and more words that express sadness. Several recent survey and interview studies further exemplify the importance of lyrics to mood regulation through music and specific peak emotional experiences. Song texts are particularly relevant to listeners who seek consolation through music, although the melody and music characteristics are more important (Hanser et al., 2016; Saarikallio & Erikkilä, 2007; Ter Bogt et al., 2017). Lyrics further play a role in the experience of chills (Bannister, 2020) and crying over music (Cotter et al., 2019; Hanser et al., 2021), especially when negative emotions accompany the crying episodes (Cotter et al., 2019). This further exemplifies a connection between sadness and the relevance of lyrics. Personal meaning or memories triggered by a song may contribute more to crying over music than its music characteristics or its lyrics separately (Cotter et al., 2019; Hanser et al., 2021). The studies mentioned above, however, did not investigate the properties of song texts. Linguistic Properties and Lyrical Content of Popular Music Song texts thus certainly play a significant role in the emotions evoked by and perceived in music. However, their linguistic properties and content have received little attention from researchers, particularly when considering specific situations, such as funeral rites, or for personal uses like mood regulation. Yet, an analysis of happy and sad song texts with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (LIWC; Pennebaker et al., 2015) revealed several intriguing differences. More precisely, sad songs contained more negatively valenced words, particularly expressions of sadness and anger, while happy songs included more positively valenced words. Further, happy songs had more words in the present tense than sad songs (Garrido, 2017, p. 24–25). The use of specific personal pronouns may be of further relevance to the (social) functions of popular music lyrics. Specifically, more second-person pronouns (you, yours) have been linked to increased song liking and commercial success, primarily when these second-person pronouns refer to “you” as the object of a sentence (Packard & Berger, 2020). The underlying idea is that “you” makes listeners think of a person significant to them, which may, in turn, help lyrics bolster social relatedness (Packard & Berger, 2020). Alternatively, the use of first-person singular pronouns (I, me, mine) in lyrics and personal writing is associated with a focus on the self, while first-person plural pronouns (we, us) are an indicator of emphasis on social relationships (DeWall et al., 2011; Rude et al., 2004; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010). DeWall and colleagues (2011) showed an increase in first-person singular pronouns, a decrease in first-person plural pronouns, and a reduction in positive and social words in lyrics between 1980 and 2007. This finding suggests that song texts became more individualistic and less positive as popular music evolved. First-person plural pronouns are, however, in general not used very often in song texts of popular music (DeWall et al., 2011; Packard & Berger, 2020). Thematically, the lyrics of most popular music deal with romantic relationships (Christenson et al., 2019), while only roughly 10% of songs cover topics surrounding family and friends. Songs that explicitly mention death and dying are rare, although these topics are dealt with more frequently as popular music evolves. Funeral music is likely to contain references to romantic relationships or family and friends. The Present Study The present study looks at both the music and linguistic characteristics of frequently used songs during Dutch funerals. We compare the properties of funeral song texts to a control selection that consists of popular songs by the same artists. To this end, we formulated the following research questions and related hypotheses: 1. The first focus is on music characteristics. We expect to replicate findings by Mollenhorst et al. (2016) on music characteristics. We thus expect to find lower valence, energy, tempo, and danceability values and higher values of acousticness for funeral music than for control songs. Funeral music will further consist of more songs in major than minor key. These values on music characteristics correspond more to sad than to happy music. We additionally analyzed the lyrics. Regarding linguistical properties, we assume lyrics of funeral music to resemble lyrics of sad music. Given the social role of music during funerals, we further expect pronouns, temporal focus, and specific topics to reflect this function. 2. Funeral music contains more negative and less positive words than control songs. Funeral music further focuses less on the present and more on the past than control music. 3. We hypothesize that funeral music contains fewer first-person singular pronouns and more first-person plural and second-person pronouns than control songs. Family and friends, as well as topics surrounding death and religion, are expected to be mentioned more often in funeral songs. Lastly, since popular music often focuses on romantic relationships, we anticipate frequent words related to this subject. We have no reason to expect a difference between these words for funeral or control songs. Method Materials Song Selection and Lyrics The selection of songs was based on lists of frequently used songs during funerals, burials, and other farewell rites. These lists are from Dutch websites1 of (insurance) companies (Dela, 2021; RVS Grafmonumenten, 2021; Uitvaartverzekering Vergelijken Loont, 2021) that provide services to organize or finance funerals. We consulted these websites in 2017, 2020, and 2021. We limited our selection to songs with Dutch or English lyrics. The control selection contained songs by the same artists as the funeral song selection. This selection was based on a song’s popularity on Spotify: we picked (according to Spotify) the most popular song by the same artist. If this piece of music was also present in the funeral selection, the second-most popular was chosen. We have attempted to always use a target and a control song by the original artist in the case of cover songs. Our primary focus was on English songs since they formed a more significant part of the popular funeral songs than Dutch ones. The complete selection consisted of 206 songs with lyrics in English (103 funeral and 103 control) and 94 songs with lyrics in Dutch (47 funeral and 47 control). We gathered the song lyrics from Genius.com (Genius, 2021) or comparable lyric depositories if the texts were not available from this website (e.g., Muzikeum.eu; Muzikum, 2021). Texts were manually spell-checked and prepared for analyses through LIWC and tidytext (e.g., goin’ was changed into going). The total number of words was: English funeral 22098, English control 26563 (Total 48661), Dutch funeral 11531, Dutch control 12445 (Total 23976) Software Music Characteristics Data on music characteristics were collected from the Spotify website (Spotify for Developers, 2021) through the Application Program Interface (API). Similar to the Mollenhorst and colleagues (2016) data, these audio analyses consider songs as a whole. The API was accessed through the R-package spotifyR (Thompson et al., 2017). We collected information on a track’s acousticness (‘a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of the degree to which the track is acoustic’), danceability (‘a value from 0.0 to 1.0 that measures how danceable a track is based on several factors, including tempo, rhythm, beat’), energy (‘perceptual measure from 0.0 to 1.0 on how intense and active a track is'), tempo (‘the overall estimated track tempo in beats per minute (BPM)’), mode (‘track modality 0 = minor, 1 = major’), and valence (‘measure from 0.0 to 1.0 on musical positiveness conveyed by a track’) (Spotify for Developers, 2021). Lyrical Properties Lyrics were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (LIWC2015; Pennebaker et al., 2015). LIWC counts words based on classifications in a dictionary with reliable psychometric properties and returns these values as percentages of the word total (Pennebaker et al., 2015). This program has been used before in the analyses of song lyrics (e.g., DeWall et al., 2011; Garrido, 2017; Packard & Berger, 2020; Petrie et al., 2008). We used the in-built English dictionary to analyze English lyrics (Pennebaker et al., 2015), whereas Dutch lyrics were assessed with the available Dutch dictionary (Boot et al., 2017). Due to these dictionary differences, we considered Dutch and English songs separately. The word categories we investigated were: pronouns (first-person singular/plural, second-person), temporal orientation (past, present, future), emotional valence (positive, negative), discrete emotional categories (anger, anxiety, sadness), and specific topics (friends, family, death, religion). We explored word sentiment with the R-package tidytext (Silge & Robinson, 2016) and the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (Mohammad & Turney, 2013). Tidytext assigns words into emotional categories based on a lexicon and returns these values as word frequencies. Our focus with tidytext is on words responsible for positive and negative affect. Statistical Analyses We performed a series of independent sample t-tests to look for differences between the two selections. We additionally report the effect-size Cohen’s d (small 0.2, medium 0.5, and large 0.8; Cohen, 1988). Analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS 23.0 and R 4.0.4 (R Core Team, 2021). Results Music Characteristics The analyses of the music characteristics (see Table 1) revealed several significant differences between funeral music and control songs. Valence, energy, and danceability were significantly lower for the funeral songs than for the control selection. Funeral songs were also more acoustic and more often in a major key than control songs. The effect-sizes varied from medium to large. There were no statistically significant differences in tempo.

Music characteristics of the Dutch selection followed a similar pattern as the English-sung tracks. However, most effects were smaller: Dutch funeral songs also scored lower on valence, energy, and danceability. Acousticness and tempo did not differ significantly, although a similar pattern as in the English selection with funeral music being more acoustic was observed. There was no difference between the distribution of major and minor key for Dutch songs. Analyses of Lyrics with LIWC We investigated the total word count, pronouns, sentiment, temporal focus, social connections, and topics using the LIWC software (Tables 2 and 3). Funeral lyrics in both English and Dutch songs contained fewer words than the control songs, but this difference was only significant for the English songs. In both languages, there was substantial variability in lyric length. Moreover, most personal pronouns were first-person singular, followed by second-person pronouns. First-person plural pronouns were rare. First-person singular and plural pronouns did not differ significantly between selections. In contrast, second-person pronouns were significantly more common in English funeral lyrics compared to control songs. A comparable, non-significant pattern was present for Dutch lyrics. Table 2.

Positive words were more frequent than negative words for both languages in both funeral and control songs. Words specifically related to discrete categories of anger, anxiety, and sadness were uncommon. English funeral lyrics contained significantly more words related to sadness than controls. Dutch funeral lyrics showed a trend towards less positive emotion words compared to Dutch control lyrics. Overall, Dutch lyrics were less, albeit not significantly, positive and contained more words in discrete negative emotion categories than the English selection. Regarding temporal focus, lyrics in both selections focused on the present with fewer words relating to the past or future. Nevertheless, both Dutch and English funeral lyrics contained more words associated with the future than control songs. However, it should be noted that the English 2015 dictionary (Pennebaker et al., 2015) uses a slightly different algorithm than the Dutch 2007-dictionary to determine words related to temporal perspectives. This may partly explain the fewer overall words related to temporal focus in Dutch song texts. Words referring to family and friends, as well as words related to the topics of religion and death, were rare for both funeral and control songs in both languages. On the other hand, there were significantly more family-related words in English control songs than in the funeral lyrics. Dutch funeral lyrics contained significantly more words related to religion than controls, and there was a similar, although non-significant, trend for death-related words. Significant effects for word categories were small to medium in size. Analyses of Lyrics with Tidytext Lastly, we investigated which words contributed to lyric sentiment in the English funeral and control selection only (Table 4) through the R-package tidytext with the NRC Lexicon. As in the LIWC-analyses, positive words were more prevalent than negative words for both funeral and control. Positive words reflected more warmth and positivity, while negative words were colder and expressed loneliness. Although Love is the most common positive word in both conditions, it occurred more frequently in the funeral songs. When combined with the derived loving, it makes up over 25% in the funeral songs instead of 16% in the control songs. Table 4.

To this end, we explored and compared music and linguistic features of funeral songs and popular control songs by the same artist. To our knowledge, there has been no previous research into the linguistic characteristics of funeral songs. Nevertheless, based on investigations into the song texts of English popular music in general, we expected the use of pronouns in funeral lyrics to show a focus on others and less so on the self (DeWall et al., 2011; Packard & Berger, 2020; Rude et al., 2004; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010). We further hypothesized them to be negative, less positive, and less focused on the present (Garrido, 2017) and to contain more words concerning relationships and death-related topics (Christenson et al., 2019). As expected, funeral songs scored lower on valence and energy, and there was a trend for them to be lower in tempo than control songs. They were also often in a major key. These results corroborate previous findings on funeral music characteristics (Mollenhorst et al.,2016)2, thus confirming funeral music’s characterization as sounding solemn, serene, and tender. Moreover, funeral music scored higher on acousticness and lower on danceability than control songs. The higher acousticness emphasizes vocals and lyrics (for example, Eric Clapton’s Tears in Heaven). Differences in these measures were less substantial for Dutch songs compared to English ones. Future work may wish to consider if cultural differences contribute to this discrepancy. The findings further support our hypothesis that funeral lyrics are more social and sadder than control song lyrics. Regarding pronouns, first-person pronouns (I, me, mine) were the most common personal pronouns in funeral lyrics, but their frequency is not exceptionally high compared to findings in popular music in general (DeWall et al., 2011, p. 202). Given the frequent use of second-person pronouns (you, yours; Packard & Berger, 2020), it can be concluded that funeral lyrics are, as expected, more focused on others than on the self. This was particularly the case for English funeral songs, which contained more second-person pronouns than the artist-matched control songs. As stated before, frequent use of second-person pronouns has been linked to an increase in song liking and commercial success (Packard & Berger, 2020), particularly when the second-person pronoun serves as the object in a sentence (e.g., “Still loving you”). In these cases, it is suggested that listeners do not interpret the content of the lyrics as addressed to themselves by the artist. Instead, they transfer this lyrical content from themselves to a significant other (Packard & Berger, 2020). This seems particularly relevant for funeral music, in which the lyrics may serve as final words or as a farewell from the bereaved to the deceased. Here, song texts may help give voice to what the bereaved are feeling and empower them. Interestingly, this transference does not seem to be limited to sentences containing second-person pronouns but may also apply to sentences with first-person singular pronouns, as exemplified in qualitative research by Viper and colleagues (2020, p. 11): listeners may apply these first-person singular song texts to their own situation, or the lyrics in first-person become more likely essential when sung by a significant other. Additional research may also consider if the bereaved experience parts of the song lyrics as addressed to them when the music was chosen by the deceased and was meant to reflect the relationship with them. Lastly, as in previous research on popular music lyrics in general (DeWall et al., 2011; Packard & Berger, 2020), first-person plural pronouns (we, us) are less common. The frequency of these words in our funeral selections did not differ significantly from the frequency in the control songs, although a non-significant trend was observed. Interestingly, we found less use of first-person singular pronouns in Dutch control songs than in funeral lyrics, but sources for comparison are unavailable. The pattern for first-person plural and second-person pronouns in Dutch lyrics is like English lyrics but less substantial for second-person pronouns. The music characteristics of the funeral songs (i.e., low valence and energy) point towards funeral music sounding “more negative.” Nevertheless, we failed to find substantial differences in the prevalence of negative words between funeral songs and controls, and words of discrete emotional categories of anger and anxiety were rare. Words of the sadness category were significantly more frequent in English funeral lyrics than in controls, thus supporting the idea that funeral lyrics express more sadness. Both English and Dutch selections contained more positive words than negative ones, although, in Dutch, positive words were less frequent in the funeral than in the control selection. Overall, the Dutch lyrics were somewhat less positive and contained more words in the anger, anxiety, and sadness categories, pointing to potential differences in the selection process of songs in a native and foreign language. The emotional valence and discrete emotional categories of lyrics, and thus the song texts themselves, may matter more when choosing funeral music in a native tongue. Cultural differences may further play a role and deserve further study. The current results on the emotional word categories thus do not fully match previous research findings on lyrics of happy and sad music (Garrido, 2017): funeral lyrics are not necessarily emotionally negative lyrics. Further support for this conclusion comes from the temporal focus of the song texts. We found no difference in focus on the past between funeral and control songs. While, overall, there was a greater reference to the past than to the future in general and an even greater focus on the present, we instead found that funeral lyrics, both in English and Dutch, focused more on the future than their artist-matched controls. Examples of this future focus, according to LIWC, are “I will always love you,” “You’ll never walk alone,” and “We’ll meet again.” These examples combine our findings on first and second-person pronouns with a future focus, and further demonstrate the potential social-bonding nature of song texts. We speculate that these parts of lyrics, which are likely to be found in the song’s title and chorus, convey strong emotional messages that may be central as to why some songs are more suitable as funeral music than others. This connects with Bruin-Mollenhorst’s concept of the musical eulogy (2020), in which only part of the lyrics may apply to the deceased or a funeral setting. We further suggest that the emphasis and repetitive nature of these messages as chorus may play an additional role in the choice for these songs. Future research should look further into the musical and linguistic properties of a song’s chorus, specifically in relation to specific uses. Future studies may also wish to consider the meaning of this future focus within the funeral setting: does it, for instance, provide listeners with hope of an afterlife, or does it perhaps help them come to terms with the finality of death? Lastly, references to death, religion, and friends or family were rare. This could be anticipated based on the thematic analyses of popular songs by Christenson and colleagues (2019). There are not many songs that explicitly deal with these topics. Romantic relationships are, by far, the most common theme in popular music, and words responsible for the affective quality of both English funeral and control songs dealt with this topic. Explicit mentions of “love” (we made no distinction between love as a noun or verb) or a derivative are the most common in both selections, however, more so for funeral lyrics. Follow-up analyses should determine if there is a difference in the type of love, for instance, love of a more spiritual, emotional, or physical nature. To conclude, we found considerable differences in music and linguistic characteristics of funeral and non-funeral music that may contribute to the choice of these songs for this specific function. Differences in music properties are more substantial than those for linguistic features. It may thus be easier to relate music characteristics to specific uses and functions of music than features of the lyrics. Limitations Several critical comments can be made regarding the applied method. Word count software does not look at the context of words or specific relationships between them. We further only considered some specific word categories, while others may also be important, for instance, words relating to cognitive processes (“never,” “always”), and questions (i.e., “Who wants to live forever?”). Future studies may wish to focus on other categories and word relationships. For our selection of control songs, we depended on their availability on Spotify. A possible issue of concern regards the values of the music characteristics since it is not clear how the results provided by Spotify for Developers (2021), such as danceability, valence, and acousticness, are compiled (see Howlin & Rooney, 2020 for a discussion), stressing the need for more empirical research into their construct validity. Other studies that have used these measures have, however, found differences and patterns that correspond to what one might expect given previous knowledge on music and its uses (e.g., Baltazar et al., 2019; Baltazar & Västfjäll, 2020; Howlin & Rooney, 2020; Vidas et al., 2021). A further limitation is our small sample size, especially of Dutch lyrics. Word count software becomes more reliable when more data are available (Pennebaker et al., 2015). We focused on the most frequently used funeral songs instead of on a full funeral home songbook. A full songbook would provide more songs, but it is unclear how popular these songs are as funeral music in general. Including more songs may reveal more differences between funeral songs and (artist-matched) controls. Mollenhorst and colleagues (2016), for example, used a funeral home songbook and compared this to the Dutch Top 2000 and Top 40 popular song lists. It appeared that many of the most frequently used funeral songs, as well as of the control songs were also included in the annual editions of the Dutch Top 2000. Specific artists, music characteristics, as well as linguistic properties, may make these songs particularly popular for multiple functions. This may explain some of the minor differences in terms of linguistic categories. However, this can also be considered a strength of our current study; our selection of popular songs showed apparent differences depending on their specific use. This bolsters the idea that musical and linguistic features also contribute to this choice despite idiosyncratic listener preferences to use songs for particular functions. Lastly, in the present work, we considered funeral music as a homogenous category of songs. Still, there is sufficient reason to assume that subcategories exist that may depend on, for example, the preference of the deceased, the bereaved, the moment the music is played during the ceremony, culture, as well as various specifics related to the deceased such as their age, relationship to the bereaved and more. Future studies should investigate these more detailed subcategories further. In conclusion, the current study confirms and expands the modest present knowledge on the characteristics of funeral music based on musical and textual features. The terms solemn, serene, and tender are indeed the keywords to describe the musical properties of this music. Specific word categories may also play a role in determining the utility of songs to serve as funeral music. However, the role of personal preferences and musical features may be more significant than the role of lyrics. Our findings on lyrics underscore their importance in expressing social connections with others (Schäfer et al., 2013). The current study stresses the importance of considering musical, linguistic, and personal properties when relating music to specific (emotional) uses and functions. As such, we hope that our study stimulates other researchers to continue this line of research to achieve a greater understanding of the role of music in funeral rites and the possible determining mechanisms. 4 дослідження: METAPHORS OF DEATH IN THE LYRICS OF SENTENCED. Bachelor’s thesis Paula Hirvonen. Death is going to a final destination For the fourth category, Death is going to a final destination, there is again example from the song “We Are but Falling Leaves”. “Eventually all the paths will lead to the cemetery” is quite an explicit statement of people’s immortality and how all life will eventually come to an end. Death is inevitable for people, and in this metaphor, life or life path has been replaced with “the paths”, and death has been replaced with “the cemetery”. In this way, we can interpret the metaphor in a way that eventually all lives will end to death. “The cemetery” as a final destination implies grave in earth and being buried after death, and not just a place to visit. “Eventually all the paths will lead to the cemetery” could also be seen as an intertextual reference to a common saying “all roads lead to Rome”. Here “roads” have been replaced with life paths and the city with the cemetery, but the same idea is still behind that no matter where life takes us, we all will eventually end up in one specific place. Another example of this category can be found in the song “Lower the Flags”: “Lower the flags / A good man has passed / He has reached the last of frontiers”. A flag lowered to half mast is a common custom honouring someone who has died and frontiers are boundaries or boarders between two things. Here, the first two lines describe in a rather straightforward manner that someone has died. In the last line, the lyrics present an idea of line between life and death and that the person the lyrics are discussing has passed this line from life to death. The word “reached” implies that this “last of frontiers” is something people head for in a way that death is something we all are going towards to in our lives. 4.5 Death is the end of life’s journey The fifth category, Death is the end of life’s journey, is derived from the metaphor Life is a journey, which can be understood in a way that being born is the start of life’s journey, living is the progress of this journey, and the end of the journey is death. The song “No One There” has an example “The feeling I have come to the end of my road”. Here we can interpret that the narrator feels that their death is drawing near in a sense that life has lost its meaning and the narrator is considering suicide. For this interpretation to make sense, it is helpful to look at the preceding lyrics: “The axe, the bottle and the rope / The feeling there really is no more hope / The thought of the great unknown / And facing it all alone / The dark, the silent and the cold / The feeling I have come to the end of my road / Yes, these are the things I spend / my remaining moments with”. The axe, the bottle, the rope, and the feeling of hopelessness can be interpreted as indication of suicide, as these are common tools and mindset for committing suicide. “Facing it all alone” can be considered as another hint of dying alone, as “it” can be seen to refer to “the great unknown”, which is a common metaphor for death. “Yes, these are the things I spend / my remaining moments with” is another indication that the narrator seems to be aware of death that is impending, and that he knows how limited the time is before death. In the song “No One There” we have another example “The feeling of finally coming back home”. This is an example with similar idea between Death is the end of life’s journey and Life is a flame, as we can understand life’s journey the same way as candle that is lit. First not being alive before we are born, on the second stage being alive after we are born, and then again on the last stage not being alive after we have died. With this life cycle idea in mind, we can consider “finally coming back home” being a metaphor for returning from life’s journey into nothingness that is before and after life. If we understand this excerpt as a metaphor of death, the word “finally” implies that this impending death is anticipated and relieving just like returning home from a long journey. If we keep this idea of comparing coming home after a long journey to dying after life’s journey comes to an end, we see that there is another category this example can be divided into: Death is going home. This category was my own creation and as this was not the only occurrence of the home being death theme, I felt that this was significant and needed a subcategory of its own. The combination of Death is the end of life’s journey and Death is going home can also be seen in the song “Aika multaa muistot [Everything is Nothing]” where we have an excerpt: “For my name is sorrow and I’m friend of misery / I deprived myself of love for eternal agony / And I don’t even dare to try – I know I can only lose / Between this life I live and nothing I have to choose / Take me home / To the one I belong”. In this example, the melancholic and discouraged description of life reveals the narrator’s attitude towards life, and we can interpret that the narrator has chosen “nothing”, that can be understood as death or suicide, over living. Here, “Take me home” can be seen as a wish to die and that the narrator feels that death is the only option in his position. There is a similar sense of longing and relieving as in the previous example with the word “finally”, and a sense of returning to something one has waited for. Death is the end of life’s journey has two other examples which combine also other metaphors. The song “Lower the Flags” has a metaphor “Your journey’s over, night descends”. This example combines A lifetime is a day and Death is the end of life’s journey metaphors. Here we can interpret that “your journey” is a journey of life that has come to an end and therefore indicates death. “Night descends” also implies that death is upon, as in A lifetime is a day metaphors death is the night. The second example of combining this category with another one is in the song “End of the Road”: “Here we are, now lay the burden down / We’re coming to the end of our road”. The latter part is obviously in Death is the end of life’s journey category as it is very similar with the previous examples, but the first part represents the metaphor Life is a burden. According to Lakoff and Turner (1989, 25), this metaphor is coherent with Life is a journey if we comprehend it through the metaphor Difficulties are burdens; life’s difficulties can be compared to physical burden on a journey, and if we think of life as one constant difficulty, then we can see the whole life as a burden. Looking at how the lyrics continue, we can see that letting go of this burden of life is implied to be comforting and welcome: “Here we are, now lay the burden down / We’re coming to the end of our road / Sorrowful yet glorious somehow / To be humming this one last ode / So calm and still…it wasn’t all that bad or was it now? / Fulfilled… it doesn’t only hurt to end it now / The funeral”. This excerpt can be understood as being relieved from or letting go of the burden of life and dying. The imperative form of the verb “lay” and the first person plural pronoun indicate that death does not have to be lonesome and forceful but a welcoming and comforting end. This example gives death a sense of relief and comfort after carrying the burden of life through the long journey of life. “Sorrowful yet glorious somehow / To be humming this one last ode” can be interpret as the final moments before death and how death is at the same time something to wait for and yet still to feel wistful of. 5 CONCLUSION The main aim in this thesis was to study the metaphors of death in the lyrics of Sentenced and answer my two research questions: “What kind of metaphors of death are used in the lyrics of Sentenced?” and “How can these metaphors be categorised?” The questions turned out to be rather difficult to answer straightforwardly as there were such a diverse set of metaphors of death. Besides the main categories A lifetime is a year, A lifetime is a day, People are plants, Death is going to a final destination and Death is the end of life’s journey I found two other categories Life is a flame and Life is a burden and created one new category Death is going home. These last three categories had only examples that were combinations with the main categories. The analysis demonstrates clearly that there are numerous metaphorical expressions for death in the lyrics of Sentenced. Most of the examples that I presented discuss death from a neutral point of view but there is a sense of finding death welcoming and relieving without encouraging suicide. Altogether many of the examples have a sense of accepting death as the end of a life cycle and it is only natural and inevitable for people. What I found in my analysis is that categorising the metaphors from the data was not as straightforward as I had presumed. Overall, I was able to identify 27 metaphors from the selected lyrics, yet there were several occasions where the categories overlapped and the metaphor had two or three categories that it could be applied into. A lifetime is a year, People are plants and Death is going to a final destination had all only two examples and there were no combinations in the examples. Death is the end of life’s journey seemed to be the most frequent of the categories but surprisingly this was only due to the combinations; this category had only one example that was solely in this category and the four other metaphors where combinations of Death is the end of life’s journey and other categories. A lifetime is a day category was also rather few in numbers as there was only one example metaphor that could be placed only in this category and two other examples that combined with Life is a flame metaphor. There were also metaphors that needed more surrounding lyrics as the metaphors or interpretations did not make sense without the broader view and the mindset that the other lyrics gave for that metaphor. Some of the categories were also used in Leikola’s (2009) thesis and for this reason and the similarity of the topics, some of the findings were the same. These metaphors of death that I presented in my research can be analysed through Lakoff and Turner’s (1989) research and some of them were rather similar to what they had presented as examples. Lakoff and Turner (1989) initially used these categories to analyse poems and everyday language and with this analysis, rather surprisingly, these categories proved to be applicable also in metal music lyrics. Thus, these categories seem to be applicable in other literary genres than what they were initially used for. This study adds to the linguistic study on lyrics (see also Leikola 2009) but focusing on one band has its limits and this study on metaphors of death does not provide results that could be generalized to the entire metal music genre and its lyrics. The scarce amount of studies on metal music lyrics is already a reason in itself to study the field more. The popularity of metal music proves that there is increasing interest on the topic, and metal music needs to be considered as a relevant field of study also in linguistics (also Leikola 2009), and not just in musicology. Linguistic study on lyrics can give the lyrics more prominent place both in music and in linguistics and they are not only seen as subordinates or servants for the music or inferior to poetry but more as an entity and a valuable genre of literary.","completion":"**Пісні як текст** Пісні існують у кожному суспільстві, але способи, якими тексти і музика узгоджуються один з одним, способи передачі значень та те, як активність вписується в більші контексти, значно різняться від суспільства до суспільства. Вивчення пісенного матеріалу залучає не тільки дисципліну музикознавства, але й багато галузей лінгвістичного дослідження: фонологію, поетику, морфологію, семантику та прагматику. Подібно до слів і морфем, пісні є одиницями форми і значення, які повинні бути включені в будь-який повний опис мови [1]. Дослідження співів включають в себе дві основні області: (i) формальні властивості пісні; та (ii) значення пісень. Формальні властивості пісні включають як текстовий компонент, так і музичний компонент [2]. Текст може підпорядковуватися обмеженням; він може використовувати слова з обмеженого словникового запасу, вимагати встановленої кількості складів на лінію або рими в певних позиціях. Музичний компонент також зазвичай організований у рамках встановленої тональної структури і ритмічного метра, і може включати також значні контрасти в темпі, динамічному діапазоні та якості голосу. Акомпанемент може бути також частиною музичної структури пісні. Пісня може також вимагати, щоб текст та музика були узгоджені певним чином, наприклад, щоб наголошені склади збігалися із сильним музичним тактом [3]. В області значення пісні є особливо цікавими, оскільки часто мають відмінні інтенції від тих, які були б призначені їм на основі простих композиційних семантичних принципів, подібно до фразеологічних ідіом. Крім того, пісні часто передають більше значень, значимості та резонансу, ніж звичайне висловлювання, і в цьому відношенні пісні нагадують поезію [4]. У піснях значення кодуються не тільки в тексті, але й через складну взаємодію музики, танців, візуальних дизайнів та їх асоціацій із спеціальними знаннями, включаючи знання про контекст виконання. Це призвело деяких дослідників до усвідомлення пісень як пакету [5]. Основним висновком [6] є те, що в піснях зустрічається багато різних типів метафори, але зазвичай вони включають подорож у якості аналогії до життя, де смерть є будинком, останнім прикордонням або кінцевою точкою в мандрівці життя. Ці метафори можуть вказувати на пропозицію про смерть як спокійне підсумовування або відпочинок після \\"вантажу\\" життя, що підкреслює смерть як природний кінцевий етап існування.

创建检查点保存目录和对象 首先，你需要创建一个\`tf.train.Checkpoint\`对象，它将管理检查点的保存和恢复。然后，你需要定义一个\`tf.train.CheckpointManager\`来指定检查点文件的存储目录和最大保存的检查点数量。 \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf # 假设你已经定义了你的模型（model）和优化器（optimizer） model = ... # 你的模型实例 optimizer = ... # 你的优化器实例 # 创建检查点对象和检查点管理器 checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(optimizer=optimizer, model=model) manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint, directory=\\"./checkpoints\\", max_to_keep=5) \`\`\` # 保存检查点 在你的训练循环中，你可以保存检查点。这可以在每个纪元（epoch）结束后完成，或者在你认为适当的周期内完成。 \`\`\`python # 例如，在每个纪元结束时保存检查点 for epoch in range(num_epochs): # ... 训练过程 ... # 保存检查点 save_path = manager.save() print(f\\"Checkpoint saved: {save_path}\\") \`\`\` # 加载检查点 当你想恢复训练时，你可以加载最新的检查点。这通常在训练开始前完成。 \`\`\`python # 加载最新的检查点（如果存在） latest_checkpoint = tf.train.latest_checkpoint(\\"./checkpoints\\") if latest_checkpoint: checkpoint.restore(latest_checkpoint) print(f\\"Restored from {latest_checkpoint}\\") else: print(\\"Initializing from scratch.\\") \`\`\` 以上步骤允许你在继续训练前保存和恢复模型的状态。这是一个简化的示例，具体的代码将取决于你的模型的细节和训练循环。 在选定的时刻保存检查点后，你可以安全地进行资源重新配置，例如，为Docker分配更多的内存。完成配置更新和重启Docker服务后，你可以再次加载最后保存的检查点，继续从原来中断的地方恢复训练。"},{"prompt":"我没创建过","completion":"如果你目前正在进行训练并且你还没有设置模型检查点的保存机制，那么现在创建检查点并开始定期保存它们是个好主意。这是一个基本的TensorFlow代码示例，展示了如何实现这一点： \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf #

插入你的模型训练代码和循环 for epoch in range(training_epochs): for batch in training_dataset: # 进行训练步骤... pass # 在训练的一个epoch后保存检查点 manager.save() print(\\"训练完成，所有检查点已保存。\\") \`\`\` 重要的是，即使你已经开始了训练，你也可以从现在开始进行检查点的保存。如果没有异常情况，TensorFlow会保存当前模型的状态而不打断正在进行的训练过程。在你需要重启Docker或者重新分配资源的时候，这将会非常有用。 一旦保存了检查点，在重启Docker和训练之前，你可以通过加载最新的检查点来恢复模型的状态，如上述“加载检查点”的部分所述。 还需要注意的是，检查点只保存模型的权重，不包括模型的结构。因此，在重启训练之前，你需要重新构建与保存检查点相同的模型结构，然后加载检查点。 如果你使用的是较高级别的Keras API (\`tf.keras\`)，它有自己的\`ModelCheckpoint\`回调，可在训练时自动保存检查点，使用方法也很简单。这里是使用Keras回调的一个示例： \`\`\`python # ...（创建模型和编译等前置步骤） # 创建ModelCheckpoint回调 model_checkpoint_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint( filepath='./tensorflow_ckpts/ckpt_{epoch}', save_weights_only=True ) # 然后在model.fit()函数调用时传入这个回调 history = model.fit( training_dataset, epochs=training_epochs, callbacks=[model_checkpoint_callback] ) \`\`\` 以上代码会在每个Epoch结束后自动保存检查点，使用Keras ModelCheckpoint会更加方便和自动化。如果你的模型训练中断了，你可以上述方式恢复模型状态并继续训练。"},{"prompt":"先告诉我怎么把docker内存限制调高，我的是win下的wsl2","completion":"要为基于WSL 2的Docker Desktop分配更多内存，你需要创建或修改 \`.wslconfig\` 文件。这个文件控制着WSL 2发行版的全局设置，包括可分配给它们的资源。下面是如何创建和配置 \`.wslconfig\` 文件的步骤： 1. **创建 \`.wslconfig\` 文件**： 在 Windows 用户目录 (\`C:Users<Your-Username>\`) 下手动创建一个名为 \`.wslconfig\` 的文件。\`<Your-Username>\` 应该替换为你的实际用户名。 你可以使用任何文本编辑器创建此文件，例如 Notepad。如果你在文件资源管理器中不能直接创建，请打开一个文本编辑器（比如Notepad++或者Windows记事本），然后另存为 \`.wslconfig\`。 2. **编辑 \`.wslconfig\` 文件**： 用文本编辑器打开 \`.wslconfig\` 文件，增加以下内容（根据你的实际需要调整内存大小）： \`\`\`plaintext [wsl2] memory=8GB #

The \`extract_moves_from_message\` function only looks for UCI format moves with a pattern like \`e2e4\`, while the LLM response provides moves in SAN format \`e5\`. Here's an updated version of \`extract_moves_from_message\` that captures SAN format moves: \`\`\`python def extract_moves_from_message(message): # Use a regular expression to find SAN moves like \\"e4\\", \\"Nf3\\", \\"Bb5\\" san_moves = re.findall(r'b(?:[NBRQK]?[a-h]?[1-8]?x?[a-h][1-8](?:=[NBRQ])?|[O-]{3,5})b', message) return san_moves \`\`\` This new regex pattern matches SAN moves, which may include castling (\`O-O\` or \`O-O-O\`), pawn promotion (\`e8=Q\`), captures (\`exd5\`), and normal moves (\`e4\`). Make sure you replace the existing \`extract_moves_from_message\` with the new function in your program. After capturing the SAN moves, the loop in \`llm_move\` where you attempt to process moves must be updated accordingly. There seem to be two attempts to process the move, which might lead to confusion. Here's the simplified and corrected loop for processing the move from the LLM's message: \`\`\`python # Process each extracted move for move_str in moves_from_message: try: move = game_board.parse_san(move_str) if move in game_board.legal_moves: game_board.push(move) draw_board(game_board) break # Exit the loop after making the first legal move except ValueError as e: result_label.config(text=f\\"Invalid move: {e}\\") print(f\\"Invalid move: {e}\\") \`\`\` Replace the loop that processes the moves with this one in the \`llm_move\` function. The 'break' statement means that once a valid move is found and made, the function does not attempt to make any further moves. This should suffice to have your program make the first legal move found in the LLM's response. However, ensure that your entire code flows appropriately and that other parts that I haven't reviewed here are working correctly to avoid any further issues. And remember to handle or remove any debugging or placeholder code, as it looks like there are some hardcoded history messages in \`llm_move\` that you might have used for testing (\`message = f\\"{san_moves.rstrip()}.... 35 +0.29\\"\`). These could interfere with the actual runtime logic."},{"prompt":"would that capture a cxd8Q move, just wondering","completion":"The regular expression provided in the previous message would not capture a move like \`cxd8Q\`, which represents a pawn capture on d8 with a promotion to a queen. In algebraic notation, when a pawn reaches the back rank and is promoted, it is often denoted by the target square (e.g., d8), an equals sign, and the promotion piece (e.g., Q for queen), so a full move would be represented as \`cxd8=Q\`. To capture pawn promotions along with other moves in SAN notation, we need to extend the regular expression to include the \`=\` and promotion piece. Here's an updated regex that would also capture moves with pawn promotion: \`\`\`python def extract_moves_from_message(message): # Use a regular expression to find SAN moves like \\"e4\\", \\"Nf3\\", \\"Bb5\\", and promotions like \\"cxd8=Q\\" san_moves = re.findall(r'b(?:[NBRQK]?[a-h]?[1-8]?x?[a-h][1-8](?:=[NBRQ])?|[O-]{3,5})b', message) return san_moves \`\`\` This regex pattern includes the following components: - \`NBRQK\` - Optional piece identifiers for knight, bishop, rook, queen, or king (for pawn moves, the piece is not specified). - \`[a-h]?[1-8]?\` - Optional file and rank to specify the starting square, mainly for disambiguation. - \`x?\` - Optional 'x' character to denote a capture. - \`[a-h][1-8]\` - Mandatory target square. - \`(?:=[NBRQ])?\` - Non-capturing group for pawn promotion, optional, with an equals sign followed by 'N', 'B', 'R', or 'Q' for the promotion piece. - \`[O-]{3,5}\` - Castling, either short (\`O-O\`) or long (\`O-O-O\`), using hyphens in between 'O's to denote the move. This pattern captures a wide array of valid SAN moves including standard moves, captures, promotions, checks, and castling. If you want to match checks and checkmates as well, you can append \`[+#]?\` to the end of the regex to include these too: \`\`\`python def extract_moves_from_message(message): # Use a regular expression to find SAN moves with captures, promotions, checks, and castling san_moves = re.findall(r'b(?:[NBRQK]?[a-h]?[1-8]?x?[a-h][1-8](?:=[NBRQ])?|[O-]{3,5})[+#]?b', message) return san_moves \`\`\` Now the pattern also allows for a check (\`+\`) or checkmate (\`#\`) symbol at the end of the move.

If Sansa Stark were to take it upon herself to secretly educate Gendry, here is what could possibly happen: 1. **Rallying Support:** Sansa might see Gendry as a potential ally or even a claimant to the Iron Throne given his Baratheon blood. By educating him, she would be strengthening her network of allies and possibly her own influence on the Seven Kingdoms. 2. **Tensions with Jon and Daenerys:** Should Jon or Daenerys catch wind of Sansa’s actions, it would certainly cause tension as it could be seen as undermining their authority or preparing for a coup. 3. **Gendry’s Role Expansion:** With an education and backing by Sansa, Gendry's role could transform from a skilled blacksmith to a lord or even a king. Remember, he was legitimized as a Baratheon in the series, which already positioned him as a potential power player. 4. **Political Intrigue:** Such a move by Sansa would add another layer of political intrigue to the story, illustrating the complex web of alliances and potential betrayals that “Game of Thrones” is known for. 5. **Impact on the North's Independence:** If Gendry, with his potential claim to the throne and the support of the North via Sansa, were to come into power, it might impact the North's quest for independence depending on the nature of his and Sansa's agreement. Please note, this scenario is a hypothetical extension of the “Game of Thrones” narrative and does not reflect actual events from the TV series or the “A Song of Ice and Fire” book series by George R. R. Martin. In the show, Sansa Stark becomes Queen in the North, while Gendry is legitimized and named Lord of Storm's End, with no indication that Sansa seeks to educate him or position him as a backup for Jon."},{"prompt":"If there was a scene where Gendry, using his newly refined diplomacy skills from his secret time with Sansa, manages to gain the loyalty of at least three or four men, who perhaps respected the Baratheons, and/or are losing faith in Jon, thus giving Gendry a personal little army of his own, how could such a scene be written as a well written, satisfying payoff to his education by Sansa, and not in a Gary stuish way?","completion":"To write a scene where Gendry, after being secretly tutored by Sansa, gains the loyalty of a few men without it coming off as contrived or \\"Gary Stu\\"-ish, it's important to focus on believable character development, subtle foreshadowing, and the complex dynamics of Westerosi politics. Here's how such a scene might be crafted: **Setting the Scene:** The setting is a local tavern in one of the towns that swore fealty to House Baratheon. We see Gendry sitting at a table with a group of men, their expressions worn and skeptical. The camera focuses on the weight of the moment, understanding the significance for both Gendry and the precarious political environment. **Foreshadowing and Build-Up:** Prior scenes would have shown Gendry and Sansa engaging in conversation, with her imparting knowledge of court politics, history, and the importance of earning the respect of your followers. These scenes would build up to the moment in the tavern, showcasing his growth from a blacksmith with no knowledge of his noble birthright to a confident potential leader. **The Pivot:** Gendry begins by empathizing with the men's grievances, speaking to their struggles and nods respectfully to the legacy of the Baratheon line. He avoids an air of superiority, instead demonstrating that he shares their concerns and aspirations, subtly weaving in what he's learned from Sansa without overtly showing off his education. **Characterization:** Throughout the dialogue, Gendry's authenticity shines through. He doesn't promise grandeur or power but speaks of unity, stability, and a shared future. Unlike a Gary Stu, he doesn't have all the answers, displaying doubts and vulnerabilities, and even acknowledging past mistakes. **The Loyalty Oath:** As the men begin to warm to Gendry, he doesn't ask for blind loyalty. Instead, he makes a personal commitment to them, an oath that he intends to keep the interests of the people at heart. His words resonate with the men because they are coupled with the weight of his past deeds and the genuine intent behind them. **Closing the Scene:** As the men stand to pledge their support, there's a lingering shot on Gendry's face, showing a mix of relief, determination, and the gravity of the responsibility he has just taken on. The scene ends with an understanding that this is just the beginning of Gendry’s new path, and the future is uncertain and fraught with challenge. This approach avoids the Gary Stu trope by giving Gendry an earned and gradual transition into a leader, showing him leaning on experiences to forge connections and demonstrating that his growth is a result of his own efforts and Sansa's mentorship. The scene feels earned because it relies on established relationships and the series' lore, thus providing a satisfying payoff to the character development."},{"prompt":"How could the mens’ respect for the Baratheons and/or faltering faith in Jon help influence their decision to follow Gendry?","completion":"In a world like \\"Game of Thrones,\\" lineage, past allegiances, and current leadership perception all play significant roles in people's decisions to follow a leader. Here's how the men's respect for the Baratheons and their faltering faith in Jon could be intricately woven into their decision to follow Gendry: **Baratheon Legacy:** 1. **Historical Respect:** House Baratheon has a storied history, and Robert Baratheon was a beloved king by many for his leadership in the rebellion. Gendry, as Robert’s son, could invoke a sense of nostalgia and loyalty amongst those who remember the Baratheon rule fondly. 2. **Restoration of Order:** With the wars and chaos that have plagued Westeros, some may desire a return to the stability that was perceived under Baratheon rule. Gendry could represent a beacon of that hope. 3. **Proven Strength:** The Baratheons were known for their martial prowess. Gendry could persuade the men that, with the Baratheon strength and his newfound diplomatic skills (thanks to Sansa), he’s capable of protecting their interests. **Faltering Faith in Jon:** 1. **Distance from the People:** If Jon is increasingly seen as being influenced by Daenerys or distant from the common folks' issues, that could create a divide. Gendry, being raised as a commoner, could leverage that disconnect to relate more closely to the men’s daily struggles. 2. **Questions of Leadership:** Any perceived missteps by Jon in his leadership could be quietly emphasized by Gendry, not in a way that fully discredits Jon, but enough to contrast Gendry’s potential as a people-focused leader. 3. **Frustrations with the Status Quo:** If the men feel that Jon’s reign is not addressing their grievances or that their lives have not improved, Gendry could position himself as someone who understands and is ready to address these issues. **Scene Implementation:** Gendry might address the group along these lines: *“You’ve all bent the knee to kings and queens, watched as high lords played their game for the Iron Throne. But what of your homes? Your families? I’m not here to make grand promises, but as a son of Robert Baratheon, I stand before you with the same blood that once brought peace to the realm. Jon Snow is a noble man, but can he see the world through our eyes, the way us who have lived with dirt under our nails and the weight of a hard day’s work on our shoulders? My pledge is simple – to remember where I come from and who truly holds the realm together – people like you.”* This approach appeals to the men's respect for the Baratheon lineage and subtly points out the current doubts about Jon, without being disrespectful. It suggests that Gendry's potential to lead is not only rooted in his bloodline but also in his relatability and ability to understand the common man's plight. This combination could be a compelling argument for the men to throw their support behind Gendry."},{"prompt":"slightly modify this cover letter for this role.

Australian Journal of Linguistics. Introduction Singing is an activity that happens in every society. But the ways that texts and music align with each other and the ways meanings are conveyed, and how the activity fits into larger contexts vary considerably from society to society. The study of song draws in not only the discipline of musicology but also many fields of linguistic inquiry*phonology, poetics, morphology, semantics and pragmatics. Like words and morphemes, songs are form-meaning units to be included in any complete language description. The papers in this volume reveal songs to be highly structured art forms that have the ability to convey complex associations of meaning beyond everyday spoken language. The papers arise from a workshop that aimed to explore the linguistic features of song in a cross-disciplinary context with a view to strengthening ties between linguists, musicologists and anthropologists working in this field.1 The papers relate to two main areas of investigation: (i) the formal properties of song; and (ii) the meanings of songs. The formal properties of song involve at the least, a textual component and a musical component.2 The text may be subject to constraints; it may draw on words from a limited vocabulary, require a set number of syllables per line or a rhyme in particular positions. The musical component too is usually organized within a set tonal structure and rhythmic meter, and can also involve significant contrasts in tempo, dynamic range and voice quality. Accompanying instrumentation may also be part of the musical structure of song. Song may also require text and music to align in a set way, for example stressed syllables to align with a strong musical beat. Many of the songs considered in this volume are part of a much larger performance involving dance, gesture, costumes and designs. These may also be part of the formal properties of song, and their alignment with text and music should also be considered. In the area of meaning, songs are of particular interest as they frequently have distinct readings from that which would be assigned to them on the basis of straightforward compositional semantic principles, in the same way that phrasal idioms do. As well, song often conveys more meanings, significances and resonances than an ordinary speech utterance, and in this respect songs resemble poetry. In songs, meanings are encoded not only in the text, but also through a complex interaction of the music, dance, visual designs and their associations with specialized knowledge, including knowledge about the context of performance. This has led a number of researchers to perceive songs as a package (Berndt 1965: 247; Tonkinson 1978: 112; Kartomi 1984: 60; Wild 1984: 192; Sutton 1987; Barwick 2000: 329, 2003: 8283; Turpin 2005). A song text itself is often what Sperber and Wilson (1986) call ‘weakly communicative’. This means that the hearer is required to make many inferences to receive a message, and as a result many interpretations of the message are possible. Such texts can be described as opaque (Walsh 2007). This contrasts with various types of ‘strongly communicative’ spoken utterances where the choice of syntax and words makes explicit the intended message. The ways in which enculturated listeners derive meanings from songs involve investigating semantic and pragmatic aspects of the song text,3 as well as specialized cultural and real-world knowledge, including knowledge of the song performance as a speech event. Knowledge in all these areas may be evoked when hearing particular songs. The aesthetic pleasure speakers derive from interpreting songs with opaque song texts may, in part, arise from the ‘recomposition of something anew’ rather than the ‘composition of something new’ (Fabb 1997: 8).4 1.1. Scope and Context of this Volume The articles in this volume are concerned with the form and/or meaning of songs, with a particular focus on the song texts. Viewed as a composite of text and music, a comprehensive study of song favours a cross-disciplinary approach. Unfortunately, studies of song do not always travel well between linguistics and musicology since the same terms can be used in different ways. For example, the terms ‘rhythm’, ‘stress’ and ‘tone’ have different, specific meanings in linguistics and musicology. In order to manage this issue, we have encouraged authors to define all technical terms to foster understandings across the disciplines. The definition of song we use in this volume is a sequence of syllables (‘text’) that is sung,5 where singing is recognized within the relevant community as the most appropriate method of delivering the text. Song cannot simply be defined as a musical setting of words, as many songs contain vocables, such as ‘tra-la-la’, which are not words and yet are part of a song text (the article by Apted in this volume is a case in point). Sometimes a whole line may have no identifiable words (Strehlow 1971; Garde 2007: 41). Our definition of song excludes the spontaneous singing of speech, as, although this may draw on notions of song, often for humorous effect, the text itself is not considered a song. By ‘singing’ we mean a vocal style with rhythmic and usually also melodic properties. In some languages what are often translated as ‘songs’ may be delivered through intoning, wailing or reciting where there is rhythmic but not melodic variation.6 Different linguistic communities may well define the boundary between speech and song differently. In casting our net widely, our definition of songs includes those genres that may be performed without an apparent melodic structure, such as chants. In the past 20 years there have been a number of collections concerned with Australian Aboriginal songs (Clunies Ross et al. 1987; Barwick et al. 2005). Most recently Studies in Aboriginal Song: A Special Issue of Australian Aboriginal Studies (2007) contains excellent collaborative work between musicologists and linguists on Australian Aboriginal song.7 The present volume furthers work on Aboriginal songs and extends the geographic area of research by including articles on songs from a diverse range of language communities including English, French, Spanish and lesser known musical genres from the Pacific and South-East Asia. We turn now to consider the two main areas of exploration in detail. In Section 2 we consider the form of songs and in Section 3, the meanings of songs. In each section we describe the types of analytical issues that arise and highlight the approaches taken by the authors of this volume to these areas. 2. Form and Structural Organization of Songs At the most basic level, a song must involve text and music. Finer-grained analysis reveals organizational units that combine to form a song. The organizational units found in many English songs include lines, couplets, refrains, verses, choruses and stanzas,8 all of which occur in the songs considered by Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez in this volume. In many languages the organizational units are not named, just as grammatical units might not be named. Instrumental introductions, musical interludes, vocal sections (analogous to verses) and text phrases (analogous to lines) are organizational units in the Kaddikkaddik songs of west Arnhem Land identified by O’Keeffe in this volume. The organizational structure of a song can have scope over both text and music. A refrain, for example, is a repeated line of text and melody. A verse, on the other hand, has the same melody but a different text. Sound patterning such as rhymes often (but not always) occurs at the end of organizational units. In this volume Morey finds various types of obligatory rhyme in Tai Phake songs of north-east India, whereas Walsh finds an absence of rhyme in Aboriginal songs, though he acknowledges other possible types of sound patterning.9 The musical component alone may have its own structure. For example, the pitches of notes are bounded by the tonal structure of the particular musical genre or the musical system of the enculturated listeners. In many songs rhythm is organized into a repeating pattern of isochronous beats where some beats are stronger than others, i.e. rhythmic meter. The articles by Nancarrow and O’Keeffe discuss meter in Aboriginal songs. Duple meter is where every second beat is weaker than the first, while triple meter is where every second and third beat is weaker than the first (such as a waltz). Meter is often hierarchically ordered so that in addition to the tactus*the beats to which one taps*it is possible to recognize larger or smaller divisions of the beat.10 Where the beat divides into two units this is referred to as simple meter, and where the beat divides into three units this is referred to as compound meter. In Australian Aboriginal songs, polyrhythmic meters, where the percussion accompaniment is performed at a different meter to that performed by the voice, are also common (see Nancarrow, in this volume). Similarly, tempo*the speed of the beats or underlying pulse of the song*may be constrained by the genre of the song. In many Aboriginal songs tempo is constrained by the particular meter and beating accompaniment of the song. This cluster of rhythmic features has led to the term ‘rhythmic mode’ (see O’Keeffe, in this volume).11 In addition to the grammar of the spoken language, a song may have specific textual conventions. Some songs may prefer particular parts of speech or particular sounds in the same position of a line. Some may draw from a limited vocabulary, have a reduced syntax, or a different phoneme inventory to that of the spoken language.12 In this volume Apted finds a greater number of vowels in Inyjalarrku songs of north-east Arnhem Land than in everyday speech, a finding in common with songs from other areas (Strehlow 1971: 67; Sherzer 1990: 16; Turpin 2005: 272). It is important to remember that song is an art form that features the voice as a musical instrument (Fornas 2003: 49) and vowels are the main pitch-bearing unit of the voice. Particular types of vowels can help overcome the adverse effects of consonant production on tune and tone and allow one to sing softly or quickly without losing the pitch (Emmons 2002); the voice may thus use sounds purely for their aesthetic effect. Unlike other instruments, however, the voice also produces spoken language. We are challenged then to avoid viewing song as a derivative of speech. There may also be constraints on the linguistic variety used in song. Recent work on northern Aboriginal songs has found that particular song genres are associated with particular languages (Barwick et al. 2007: 8).13 In this volume Apted considers how Inyjalarrku songs are entirely spirit language and contain no words from everyday speech. Non-speech words are common in Australian Aboriginal songs, and researchers have often viewed song texts in terms of their divergence from spoken language (see, for example, Alpher 1976; Dixon 1984; Donaldson 1984; Merlan 1987; Sutton 1987; Tunstill 1995). In contrast, the papers by Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez, Crozet, Morey, Sollis, and Stebbins and Planigale consider songs whose linguistic variety is primarily that of everyday speech. Finally, there can be requirements on how text, music and song structure interact. The length of lines may adhere to a regular count of some aspect of linguistic form. This is called poetic meter.14 As an example, Dell and Elmedlaoui (2008) find that in many Berber songs, lines adhere to a repeating four-mora pattern that is referred to as a ‘foot’.15 In addition, they find that every second syllable of the foot must align with a strong beat. A similar approach is taken by Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez in this volume. She compares the extent to which lexical stress must align with strong musical beats in English and Spanish folk songs, a well-documented requirement for English songs (Hayes 1983; Hayes & Kaun 1996; Hayes & MacEachern 1998). She also compares the extent to which the principle of ‘one syllable be set to one note’ exists in English and Spanish songs.16 Both Morey and Sollis in this volume, consider the way in which lexical tone aligns with musical pitch.17 To what extent song melodies are constrained by the melody of speech is a particularly relevant question in relation to tone languages. Morey observes in Tai Phake songs a trade-off where alignment of one aspect of text to music provides freedom in how another area of text is aligned. He finds that when lexical tone and musical pitch align, grammatical units need not match the organizational units of the song. However, when lexical tone and musical pitch do not align there is strict matching of grammatical units with the half-line unit. In exploring the relationship between linguistic tone and melody in pikono songs from Papua New Guinea, Sollis finds that linguistic tone contours and melodic contours match within the constraints of the melodic structure. A melodic phrase cannot descend further than an interval of a fifth. Where an intonational decline is over a long portion of text, this musical constraint forces a misalignment of linguistic tone contour with melody. In many respects songs show a sensitivity to the relationship between speech prosody and music. The nature and cross-linguistic variation of this relationship is the concern of the sub-field of text-setting (Lerdahl & Jackendoff 1983; Halle & Lerdahl 1993; Kiparsky 2006; Fabb & Halle 2008; Hayes 2008; Hayes & Kaun 1996; Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez 2007, Turpin 2007a). In general we find that the highly structured nature of songs can force adjustments to the text not normally seen in the spoken form of the language. This competition between the desire to adhere to the song structures and the desire to remain faithful to the spoken language has led to Optimality Theory in phonology being applied to text-setting in song (Hayes & MacEachern 1998). Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez, in this volume, uses this methodology to show that constraints which regulate rhythm in spoken language are also those that determine how words are set to musical rhythm in stanzaic Spanish and English folk songs. This provides an interesting comparison to Dell and Halle’s work on text-setting in French and English songs (2008). Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez finds that in Spanish, a so-called syllabletimed language, different texts set to the same melodic line are more likely to contain the same number of syllables than in English songs, although often at the expense of aligning prominent syllables with strong musical beats. The reverse is the case in English, a so-called stress-timed language, where lines are more likely to contain differing numbers of syllables but less likely to contain stress mismatches. Such research supports the view that the relation of lyrics to music in songs is rooted in the sound structure of the language (Fabb 1997), yet contrasts with the view that the sound structure of speech, literary language and song might have quite different explanations (Kiparsky 2006: 7; Fabb & Halle 2008). The use of language to draw attention to the sound qualities of the message itself rather than its meaning is what Jakobson calls the poetic function of language (1960, 1987: 71). By selecting equivalent and contrasting aspects of languages to create a sequence, such ‘parallelism’ (Jakobson 1987) gives a temporal dimension to language, as each sound relates to what comes before and after it. Parallelism can also be applied to semantics and syntax.18 Walsh, in this volume, considers various types of parallelism in applying Friedrich’s theory of polytropy (1991) to Aboriginal songs. A related feature is the repeated use of formulaic expressions. These may be limited to a particular position in the song or line, and are often set to the same musical pattern. In contrast to parallelism, a formula need not occur in a regular sequence. In this volume Sollis, Apted, Walsh and Morey identify formulaic text in the songs they investigate.19 As well as drawing attention to the song’s own form, parallelism and formulas may assist in the memorizing of songs. To ascertain the structure of a well-formed song it is not always possible to identify ‘ungrammatical’ songs in the same way ungrammatical speech can be identified. In some cases songs may form a finite set, and may be perceived as being created by spirits rather than living people. In such cases it may not be easy to access native speaker intuitions about a proposed ill-formed song, as the singer may evaluate the song in terms of its origin rather than its structure. It may be important to analyse multiple performances of a song in order to understand what aspects of a song’s structure do not vary and are thus significant and defining, and what aspects are open to variation and creativity. Variation may signal features of a particular singer, or a particular social context of a given performance. Crozet, in this volume, considers three very different versions of La Marseillaise, where she relates their differences to the socio-cultural discourse of their times; yet all are regarded as exemplars of ‘the La Marseillaise’. 3. The Meanings and Significances of Songs Songs are often much more difficult to translate than speech. In some instances the difficulties may be due to the text containing words that are not of everyday speech or because the songs represent concepts that are difficult to grasp. In some communities certain songs are only translatable to particular members of society (e.g. Keen 1977; Clunies Ross 1986: 242). Thus the inability to translate a song may be due to its inherently restricted nature, as discussed by Stebbins and Planigale in this volume. A key difference between speech and song is the more deeply embedded and artefact-like status of the text, a feature in common with poetry, proverbs, rhyming slang, proper names and religious sermons. Yet unlike these purely linguistic forms, song also includes music. This combination of the song text and musical components has the ability to convey different types of meanings in complex ways. Where song performance also involves dancing, painting and adornment of special items, these non-verbal aspects can also contribute to the meaning of a song. So far we have used the word ‘meaning’ rather loosely as a term covering many types of meanings and associations. A complete account of song meaning requires a distinction between different types of meaning and the ways in which meanings are conveyed. Nancarrow identifies three ways in which Lardil burdal songs convey meaning: through the text of a song, through the rhythm (musical meaning) and through interpretations transmitted independently of the song text, what she calls ‘culturally ascribed meaning’. In the next section we identify different types of meanings that songs can convey: lexical or word meaning, song text meaning (the meaning of the words in the context of the particular song), connotative and interactional meanings; and we also consider the ways in which these are conveyed. 3.1. Word Meaning All the articles in this volume identify, or are concerned with identifying, the words in songs and their meanings. Word meaning can also be conveyed through music, such as the downward interval in ‘Swing Low, Sweet Chariot’ which reflects the meaning of the downward movement to earth (Patel 2008: 342). Such word painting can also be conveyed through dance. Nancarrow, in this volume, shows how the accompanying dance emulating a brolga is the only aspect of the song conveying the meaning ‘brolga’ in a Mornington Island song. It is not uncommon for words to have a different or broader lexical meaning in song than in speech.20 As well, songs, like poetry, may have multiple competing lexical meanings. Here, it is necessary to distinguish the meanings intended by the composer (which may be multiple and intentional), and those constructed by listeners interpreting the song. Intentional ambiguity (which is the basis of puns) may be more widespread in orally transmitted song traditions, as the written form necessarily favours only one lexical form, obfuscating the aesthetic pleasure of holding two simultaneous interpretations of a text. Stebbins and Planigale note that the word ame¯che¯linga in a Mali Baining song means both ‘lizard species’ and ‘ceremonial mask’. Walsh, in this volume, argues that ‘(s)he used his/her hands’ and ‘(s)he said/did’ are two distinct meanings of the same segment of text available to listeners of a Murriny Patha song, although it is not known whether this was the intention of the composer. The music and formal requirements of a song can make it difficult to distinguish the words of a song and can lead to a listener reinterpreting the original text. A classic example of this in English has provided a name for this phenomenon, ‘mondegreens’. It is based on a mishearing in the second line of the English couplet ‘... They have slain the bonny earl of Moray, and laid him on the green’, which was later reinterpreted as ‘... and Lady Mondegreen’.21 Mondegreens are no doubt more common in orally transmitted traditions than in written traditions. Schebeck’s warning against making hasty interpretations about the form of place names based on interpretations by native speakers who may be ‘pressed for answers under the assumption that there must be a simple answer’ (2002: 147148) applies equally to song translation. So far we have considered the lexical meaning of words*their dictionary definition. It is also important to consider the referential meaning of words. Again, it is necessary to distinguish the meanings intended by the composer, and those constructed by listeners interpreting the song. To illustrate the difference between lexical and referential meaning consider a song analysed by O’Keeffe in this volume. The third line is Kaddikkaddik ka-wokdjanganj, ‘The oyster catcher spoke/sang/cried out’. Interpreting the lexical meaning of the words in this line involves knowing what sort of entity an oyster catcher is, including entailments such as it is a type of bird, and what type of vocal action wokdjangan refers to, and the sorts of entities that typically perform this action. Referential meaning is, for example, the specific oyster catcher to which the song refers, which in the case of many Aboriginal Dreaming songs is a specific ancestral being. Referential meaning is obtained by parsing the words and constructing an interpretation of them, so a listener may have different referents from those intended by the composer. For example, the composer of ‘The bonny Earl of Moray’ had one earl in mind, whereas listeners might have different referents depending on which Earl of Moray they thought the song was about. Referential meanings are often more ambiguous in song than in speech. Spoken explanations about whom or to what a song refers, and knowledge about the song style or performance context, can play a role in conveying referential meaning. In societies that recognize composers*individual(s) who are the creators of songs*these people are often regarded as the legitimate source of meaning, and any listener’s reinterpretation is regarded as ‘wrong’. In contrast, in societies where songs are perceived as pre-existing rather than composed by individuals, as in much of Aboriginal Australia, meanings are legitimized according to the status and genealogy of the person interpreting the song. A reinterpretation of lexical or referential meaning is thus of little relevance to the enculturated listeners (see, for example, Wild 1987: 109; Tunstill 1995: 64; Keogh 1996; Turpin 2005: 332). While words in some songs have multiple lexical meanings, some may have no lexical meaning. Apted, O’Keeffe and Nancarrow discuss songs where the texts, or parts of the text, include words that the majority of enculturated listeners cannot interpret. Where the text makes use of words that are not from everyday speech, people may perceive the text to involve words whose meaning is no longer known. Songs are often repositories of archaic words, as they tend to be stable entities due to their tightly structured form. Alternatively people may perceive the words to involve spirit language, whose lexical content remains unknown to people, or known only to specialists of spirit language22 (Apted, O’Keeffe, in this volume). A third possibility is that the text may contain ‘vocables’*syllables used to fill the structural requirements of the song or simply for their acoustic properties (Clunies Ross 1986: 242; Koch & Turpin 2008: 171). Apted observes that non-lexical units are ‘‘‘meaningful’’ in the more abstract sense of this term’ (see Section 3.3 below). O’Keeffe similarly finds that the spirit language represents the call of an oyster catcher bird, and a spoken narrative reveals the oyster catcher to be the subject of the song style; thus the song text ‘encodes the relationship to external narratives’. 3.2. Text Meaning For some songs it can be difficult to know what a line or the song as a whole means, even when the lexical meaning of words is known (see also Merlan 1987: 150). This is often the case with song texts that have anaphoric words or where there is no semantic link between lines. Stebbins and Planigale refer to this level of meaning as ‘text meaning’. An example of the difference between word meaning and text meaning can be illustrated with a line of the Mali Baining song whose words Stebbins and Planigale gloss as ‘maybe I can go with you’. They explain the text meaning of the song as ‘a man missing his brother and wishing to go and be with him’. However, not all songs have readily accessible text meanings. Walsh finds ‘The ‘‘pelican song’’ is almost entirely composed of ‘‘actual’’ words but remains rather cryptic for this observer’. He suggests exploring different types of tropes*imagistic, modal, formal, contiguity-based and analogical*in order to elucidate broader meanings and structures in songs. Where songs form part of a larger corpus, particular text meanings can sometimes be obtained in relation to other songs in the corpus. Curran, in this volume, finds that a Warlpiri song containing the word for a particular type of tree ‘at this point in the song cycle indicates that the women are no longer in their home country’. As with word meaning, there may be multiple, intentional text meanings of a song. A Pitjantjatjara song with the word ‘cup or mound shape’ is said to be about a termite mound by one singer, a women’s breast by another, and an insulator on a telegraph pole by another; and the particular textual meaning one derives, or is given, depends on one’s own level of knowledge (Ellis 1985: 6264). A number of researchers of Australian Aboriginal songs have suggested that the ability to have multiple text meanings ensures songs have relevance and applicability to many contexts (Tonkinson 1978: 102; Marett 2005: 199).23 Many of the articles in this volume show that specialized cultural knowledge is required to deduce text meanings (Crozet, Curran, Nancarrow, Stebbins and Planigale, and Walsh).24 In many societies not everyone has access to the same level of specialized cultural knowledge, and so there can be varying degrees to which a listener is enculturated in relation to a particular genre or song. Thus the ‘trajectory’ of understanding of a song will vary depending on one’s knowledge (Walsh, in this volume). Some songs have accompanying explanations in the form of a narrative or exegesis (Donaldson 1979, 1984; Strehlow 1971).25 These elucidate not just text meaning, but can reveal word meanings, especially where the text has a highly constrained form. Such narratives may form a unique type of speech event (Hymes 1970), distinct from explanations of other types of phenomena. Where the narrator must be of a particular social status interactional meanings are also encoded in the speech act. In parts of Australia only an owner of a song can provide an explanatory narrative. Understanding the communicative behaviour of specific cultural settings, such as song performance and explanation, is the subject of investigation of ethnographies of speaking (Hymes 1970; Bauman & Sherzer 1974; Sherzer 1990).26 Nancarrow, in this volume, refers to the meaning of some songs as ‘learnt’ rather than ‘interpreted through analysis of song text’, and refers to this source as ‘popular opinion’. This can be compared to the way school children are sometimes ‘handed down’ the meaning of their Latin school song rather than through textual translation. The detailed meanings of songs discussed by Curran demonstrate how text meanings of Warlpiri songs rely on a listener having specialized environmental, ceremonial and other types of cultural knowledge. 3.3. Songs as Mnemonics The tightly interwoven nature of text and music enables songs to be used as mnemonic devices, especially in preliterate societies, where song and poetry has been documented as a mnemonic aid for events and places (Weiner 1991: 45; Feld & Basso 1996: 109; Basso 1996).27 Even in contemporary literate societies we find songs used as mnemonics (consider the ‘ABC’ Alphabet song in English). Recently the Bee Gees ‘Staying alive’ has been promoted by pediatrics as a song to sing while administering CPR to help people find the correct compression rate.28 It is not difficult to imagine how a song can then gain additional significances*especially emotional responses*by use in such different contexts. It has often been stated that Aboriginal songs act as mnemonics for linked places, and so the song series as a whole is akin to a musical map (Strehlow 1970: 94). The case studies of Aboriginal songs in this volume (Curran, O’Keeffe, Nancarrow, Apted, and Walsh) all include songs that stand for particular places. 3.4. Interactional Meanings Like other kinds of speech acts, songs have interactional meaning. Interactional meaning refers to the attitude and expectations between the speaker and the hearer. In singing, where the role of the singer is often fixed (not anyone can sing), and the speech act context-driven (singing can only occur at certain times and places), interactional meanings are dependent on the genre of the song. For example, by attending a concert featuring a singer, a listener expects to be moved emotionally*or at least be aesthetically pleased by the singing. In contrast, the addressee of ‘Happy Birthday’ interprets this singing interactionally to mean that s/he is a special person, and that the singers think him/her worthy, especially if followed by ‘For s/he’s a jolly good fellow’. In the genre of political songs analysed by Crozet, the singer signals as interactional meaning that they want to spur the addressee into political action, assuming the role of teacher to the listener. In this genre the addressee is simultaneously the government (often the subject of the songs) and the everyday citizen listening to the song. Traditional Aboriginal songs can also have multiple addressees: fellow performers (usually countrymen), listeners (usually outsiders) and ancestral spirits. This leads to interactional meanings of identity such as ‘I am from this country’ (see Curran, in this volume; compare also national anthems), ‘I have a strong attachment to my spiritual ancestors’, or as Apted states ‘... the potency of one’s spiritual life, which manifests in one’s ability to receive and sing songs from the spirits’. In Central Australia, singing particular songs can bring about changes to the physical worlds (e.g. bring about rain), also a type of interactional meaning. 3.5. Connotive Meanings Songs can connote particular situations, behaviours and events. Such pragmatic and associated knowledge is comparable to what McConnell-Ginet calls ‘conceptual baggage’ (2008). Curran, in this volume, argues that visual images in both the song text, the dance movements and visual designs connote certain concepts, for example circular shapes ‘represent home, women and protection’. Walsh, in this volume, discusses connotative meanings of place names in northern Australian Aboriginal songs, which act as a kind of shorthand to invoke a chain of connectedness between one specific place, the other places in the vicinity and/or on the same Dreaming track, the stories associated with that place through Dreamings, ancestors and exploits by living relatives at that place to their country as a whole. Some connotations may be evoked only in the context of a particular song style and so are the results of knowledge of the particular song style speech event. This can be compared to the way English speakers know ‘Auld Lang Syne’ is sung on New Year’s Eve, and so the song connotes the significance of this annual event and associated behaviours. Stebbins and Planigale refer to this level of meaning as ‘meaning in context’. While this is similar to other context-dependant speech acts such as religious services (compare ‘Ashes to ashes, dust to dust’), music provides an additional modality for evoking the social context of the songs. Indeed, even without the text, simply humming the melody of a song can evoke its context. The Dreamings connoted in the songs discussed by Apted are the result of the religious context of their performance rather than from any lexical meaning of the text. In the songs discussed by Curran and O’Keeffe, a word for a plant or animal occurs in a song genre associated with the Dreaming. Through knowledge of this genre a number of connotations and associated meanings are available to the listener. For example, in Central Australia a Dreaming song can evoke the place where this totemic being originated, its activities in the Dreamtime, and the people who own the particular Dreaming. All this in addition to the non-genre dependant connotations of the song*such as the cultural uses of the plant or animal and the listener’s/singer’s own personal experiences with that plant or animal. It may turn out that connotations of particular flora and fauna may be widespread; for example the connotation of the peaceful dove with loneliness, noted by Walsh, in this volume, is also found in Central Australian songs where the emotion relates to the activities of this bird in the Dreaming and the plaintive nature of its call. Knowledge of the particular song style speech event may affect the ability to derive not just connoted meanings but also text meaning, as Stebbins and Planigale find for different styles of Mali Baining songs. 3.6. Emotional Responses Music, poetry and other forms of language all have the ability to provoke emotional responses, yet their means for evoking emotions differ. Crozet, in this volume, argues that in the French La Marseillaise the combination of march-like music with combat vocabulary helps put soldiers in an emotional state suited to killing and to selfsacrifice. In Central Australia, Ellis finds traditional wailing begins on a set pitch, and so for enculturated listeners this pitch can be associated with mourning, even when the pitch occurs in a different context (1985: 67). While certain broad musical genres can become associated with particular emotional states,29 specific songs can have particular meaning through the tight association between text and music, even when their text is absent or altered. Consider a well-known tune such as ‘God Save the Queen’, where from the music alone an enculturated listener can derive meanings related to the text. The ability of a song’s tune to carry associated meanings of its absent text is the basis of the parody in the songs analysed by Crozet. A related phenomenon is where well-known songs are used in novel contexts for particular* often humorous*effect, particularly in news reports, documentaries and in conversation amongst people who share knowledge about a particular song. Finally, certain connotations or emotional responses may develop through the frequency of particular vocabulary or sound sequences occurring in song (see also Patel 2008: 343). The question raised by Walsh of whether particular vocabulary or tropes are widespread in particular languages or traditions, may also reveal these to have connotative or emotional significances. A phrase or word uttered in the context of conversation may connote a song or song genre and all that this song signifies for an enculturated listener. This use of language can be a source of humour and intellectual pleasure in everyday interaction. 4. Conclusion Our understanding of the arrangement of musical components and their effect on linguistic form is still in its infancy. Song, as a universal genre of language, and one ‘in which musical and linguistic meanings intertwine’ (Patel 2008: 342) also offers a rich field for investigations into meaning. Collaborative research between linguists and musicologists is already underway on Aboriginal Australian songs (Marett & Barwick 2007). We hope that this volume highlights the importance of such collaborative work on songs from all areas in order to promote a deeper understanding of the nature of song: how particular cultures use language to create song, how language and music interact, how songs convey meaning, the sorts of meanings they convey, their intended audience and how knowledge of songs can further our understanding of linguistic prosody. 2 дослідження: Another Road: An Intersection of Music and Language. Jiradej Setabundhu INTRODUCTION Specialists tend to stay within their field. Knowledgehas become very specific, usually to the point that people outside such immediate circle cannot understand.In a way, this is necessary as we gather moreinformation and dig deeper into its meanings. Thedownside of this world of super-specialty is that we tendto lose touch with the big picture for the lack of anyconnecting mechanism that holds together the different parts of the total knowledge. The connections betweendifferent branches are lost.Things have not always been this way, however. Inearlier times, a learned scholar often possessed skills invarious fields. John Dunstable, a Renaissance Englishcomposer, was also an astronomer and a mathematician but one of the numerous examples. Although he isknown today chiefly as a composer, there is no doubtthat his knowledge in astronomy inspired his music, andthe underlying durations, structures, and symmetries ofhis isorhythmic motets and masses are due in no small part to his prowess in mathematics [1].Perhaps we cannot go back to the way things were, but accepting what other branches of knowledge canoffer will be beneficial for pursuing our own field.Sometimes the cross-pollination between the two fieldsis such that it provides a new perspective for us to seewhat should have been obvious but for some reason wasoverlooked. This study discusses specifically how musicand language intertwine in parallel- and contrary-motiondances that have inspired composers to develop theirartistic ideas. This study also likes to share someexamples of how a simple approach to language provides a springboard for my musical ideas. 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2.1. Music and Language A poem, a story, a song, and a sonata are all time- based art. They flow through time from the beginning tothe end as opposed to, say, a painting that a viewer can perceive as a whole. One can argue that time is requiredto appreciate a sculpture in its totality as three-dimensional art, but a viewer can view sculpture in anon-linear fashion and still grasp the effect of the work.On the other hand, the coherence of a story or amovement of a symphony would be destroyed if alistener approached its timeline randomly. To be sure,many authors have experimented with linearity, beginning a story from the middle of the plot and so on, but this is intentional, and the result is still linear,although not in the way the reader might expect.Music is closely related to language to the extent thatit metaphorically adopts some of the languageterminologies. When we hear a group of musicians perform an improvisatory passage, for example, we say that they are “in conversation” . In an academic setting,the terms such as phrases , sentences , and periods have been used in classes on musical form and harmony todescribe the various temporal length of a musical unit,although it must be said that the exact definitions ofthese terms can vary from one school of thought to thenext, and are at best a little ambiguous unless applied to very simple musical excerpts [2]. To some, twoconsecutive musical phrases, the former ends with weak punctuation ( cadence ) and the latter strong one, form asentence or a period [3]. A. Schoenberg, on the otherhand, provided a more specific description of a sentencewhere the first part contains two statements of a motive,usually in tonic and dominant, and the second part provides a more developing treatment of the materialsfrom the first, often employing rhythmic reduction andthematic fragmentation, to bring the sentence to aconcluding cadence [4].One can trace back in time to even earlier periodsand still finds the interwoven thread of language andmusic. Around the mid-eighteenth century, a decade before the death of J. S. Bach, a new musical style called galant emerged that was to be a link between the learned polyphonic work of the Baroque style and the Classicalstyle that focuses on a more balance of the vertical andlinear musical ideas, culminating in the music of Haydnand Mozart. The characteristics of galant music includea rejection of counterpoint, clear separation of melodyand accompaniment, shorter themes, symmetrical phrasestructure, and strophic, regular rhythm related todancing. The adjectives that perhaps best suit this newstyle are pleasant, free, spontaneous, and attractive. Theorigin of the style was closely related to the ideal of theera that also pervaded other art forms. Goethe wroteabout a similar writing style that was typically feminine,with short phrases and many sentence breaks — the style that also appeared in J. J. Rousseau’s epistolary novel Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse and short statements in the libretto of Pergolesi’s opera La serva padrona [5].Despite the apparent difference in communicativecapability between language and music, the former ableto convey specific information while the latter onlygeneral expressions, the difference is simply in degrees.Language, unlike other human institutions such as customs, fashion, or laws, “is limited by nothing in the choice of means, for apparently nothing would preventthe associating of any idea whatsoever with just any sequence of sounds [6].” The linguistic signs and their meanings are related not naturally but instead sociallyand historically — therefore arbitrary. Any specificlanguage can never be universal because to understandits code, a participant must immerse him/herself in thespecific cultural, historical, and cognitive backgrounds.Many subtexts and jokes in sitcoms from the US, e.g., Seinfeld and Entourage , would be lost to viewers fromforeign countries who have no background on thethemes — life in New York City in the former andHollywood extravaganza lifestyle in the latter.Many think of music as being more universal, but,like any language, its power to convey the meanings,general as they are require that a listener shares itscultural, historical, and cognitive contexts. In general, itrefers to the lack of precision in describing the physicalworld with the clarity of human language. Of course, wehave to set aside some claims as obvious exaggerationsto make a point, as when R. Strauss boasted that he could “differentiate musically between a knife and afork” with his composition and orchestration techniques used in Symphonia domestic [7]. What we see as auniversal response to a melody, harmony, or rhythm isnothing but a learned experience acquired from years ofimmersion in a proper environment. An Indian musicianunaccustomed to western music would likely find the12-equal temperament tuning crude and could not relateto the emotional swells of the nineteenth-centurywestern music. Likewise, a western composer neverexposed to eastern scales would not understand theflexibility of the Thai tuning and hear the music as outof tune. Film composers have learned the craft of manipulating viewers’ responses to specific formulas well within a particular environment, and it is nowonder — although unfortunate — that many blockbusterhits share similar thematic, harmonic, and rhythmic materials. M. Danielewski saw man’s attempt to relate the concept of echo to God as a reason why the designsof most churches support ample reverb: “Divinityseemed defined by echo,” he wrote [8], “The hallowedalways seems to abide in the province of the hollow.” But this is true only to a society where echoes and longreverb time are not common. For a tribe living in amountainous area, with valleys and peaks, and space in between large enough for sound reflections to bedistinguishable from the sound source (longer than 0.1seconds), echoes would be a common occurrence, andthus would not seem fit to describe Divinity.More concrete examples can be found in dance,which, like language, communicates through culturalcodes. H. Bannerman analyzed the western classical andmodern dance and matched linguistic categories,including vocabulary and syntax, the utterance and thespeech act, to dance counterparts [9]. The gestures indances of many Asian countries consist of pre-determined patterns, each of which represents a specificaffection and meaning. Indian dance, a part of a largerdrama, is divided into three categories. Two of these, natya and nritya, — drama (story or plot) and mime(gestures of the dancer body) respectively — togetherconvey the meaning of the dance [10]. The dancer/actorcommunicates the story and expressions via numerousstylized gestures using the movement of head, eyebrows,nose, cheek, chin, neck, breasts, eyes, feet, and hands, ofwhich those involving eyes and hands are the mostimportant. A single gesture may signify many different,unrelated meanings, not unlike human language [11] Without knowing the relevant cultural codes, it will beimpossible for the audience to appreciate the performance. 2.2. Music and Structure Since music shares many characteristics with literarywork, it is no surprise that many composers control themusical structure with those of poetry or story. Thisseemingly simple action helps to fulfill the logicaldecision for the musical form. The more specificmeaning of language shapes the abstract musicalstructure, leading the sound along with the parallel flow.The evolution of atonal music, i.e., music without atonal center, is a good demonstration of how languagecan be a great aid to composers. The first decade of thetwentieth century saw western art music struggle tomove forwards. Tonality, the driving force of music thusfar based on the attracting force between the tonic (the tonal center) and the dominant (the tonic’s strongest overtone a fifth above), was disintegrating, and therewas no other system available. Since tonality governedthe connection of chords, it also controlled the pace (orrhythm) of harmonic changes, in addition to the voiceleading. Therefore, composing atonal music wasdifficult because composers had no access to any self-consistent applicable compositional procedures [12].The only possible guidelines were usually in the form ofnegative rules to tonality, e.g., the avoidance oftraditional chords and conjunct melodies [13].It is understandably symptomatic that early examplesof atonal music tend to be very short, some of whichonly a few minutes long. To extend the length beyondthis miniature scale, composers often employed text tomusic. The prose/poem-turn-libretto provided a strongsense of direction on which the music could be carried.It gave a logical structure to the flow of expressions thatthe composers could hold on. Schoenberg, a leadingcomposer of this period, was able to complete a 30-minutes long Erwartung in 17 days because of thelibretto. In this expressionist monodrama, the poet andmedical graduate Marie Pappenheim told a psychological story of a woman searching in a darkforest for her lost lover whom she might have killed.The libretto does not have any narrative plot per se but provides a backbone for the music, leading it to a progressively more intense emotional state of the protagonist’s mind. The athematic nature ofSchoenberg’s music reflects the text without any progressive story. When Schoenberg said to Pappenheim, “Then write me an opera libretto, younglady… Write whatever you wish, I need a libretto ,” [14]he did not just propose a challenge, but also a request.The astonishing speed which he completed the workindicates the effectiveness of a proper text as acompositional aid.Although Schoenberg implied that his music did notserve merely as a translation of a text into sound,claiming that he was usually inspired simply by thesound of the first words of the text and composed themusic without any regard to the rest of the text, he later backtracked, saying that other composers misunderstoodand took his comment too literally [15]. The textstructure, indeed, gave him some idea about the structureof the music, as apparent in the 1932 discussion of hisown Four Orchestral Songs , op. 22, where he statedthat, although his use of text did not rely solely on word painting technique, the text did supply the formalorganization to the music [16]. In the melodrama forcabaret Pierrot lunaire , Schoenberg’s seminal work commissioned by Albertine Zehme for a reciter and fivemusicians, the composer selected 21 poems from a cycle by A. Giraud and organized them into three groups ofseven poems — the action that decisively led to thecreation of the opening seven-note motive G#-E-C-D-Bb-C#-G that later appeared in various guises in every poem throughout the work. 2.3. Music and Storytelling The problem exists when trying to integrate a storyinto music. Many musicians would label the work asabsolute music, i.e., music without any associated storyas opposed to program music. However, writing the music accompanying W. B. Yeats’ Sailing to Byzantium can be a solution. The theme of the poem is about ametaphorical journey of a frail old man living in a worldof youth, who decided to sail to the mystical Byzantiumin search of immortality. The transformation of a wasted body into an immortal golden bird provided the idea ofrecycling. Together with the arcana theme, this finallyguided the project into a multimedia work consisting ofa live shadow play and electronic music accompanying a poem reading. The shadow play was a reference to theThai tradition of Nang yai and Nang talung , whereshadows of puppets made of painted buffalo hide were projected onto the screen. In a piece, wasted objectswere used as puppets to emphasize the recyclingconcept. The obscure images of lights and shadows, theelectronic sound of an analog modular synthesizer withcomplicated cable patches, the dramatic reading of the poem, and the incessant sound of the sea set the tone forthe mysterious quest. There are four stanzas in Yeats’ poem. The first two place the narrator in the land of youth while the last twoare set in Byzantium. Here presents the problem of formthat often occurs when we adopt one art form to another.The bipartite structure based on departure and arrival works well in the poem, but such an epic seafaring journey could not be portrayed musically with a short “sailed the seas” phrase as in the poem. A longer duration is needed in the music domain to depict the narrator’s quest successfully. Therefore, another poem with a seafaring theme that would not look out of placeto serve as a long musical arch between the two citieswas searched and S. T. Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner was found. 23 non-consecutive stanzas from Coleridge’s were selected and rearranged to form anew cohesive journey. Delightfully, most of the selectedstanzas contained references to time of day, e.g., TheSun came up upon the left, / Out of the sea came he! /And he shone bright, and on the right / Went down intothe sea were discovered [17]. It turned out that thesequence, as indicated by the selected stanzas, suggesteda nine-day journey.Thus, the final form of the work is tripartite as opposed to the bipartite division of Yeats’ original poem. The placement of the additional Coleridge’s poem in between emphasizes the contrast between theland and the sea. This created fluctuation in tension,which was reflected in the treatment of the light play andthe musical texture [18]. 2.4. Music and Syntax Many eastern composers working in the westerncompositional domain feel, at one time or another, the pressure to write in their local idiom. This is not an easytask because Thai music has a unique system andmethod of composing, which is quite different from thewestern counterpart. Finding the unique characteristicsthat define Thai music is a solution so that through them,the Thai compositional techniques from a different anglecan be approached. It turns out that two characteristicsare indispensable: the strict form of centonization andthe hierarchical structure.Centonization is a technique of composing with pre-existing melody types. It shows in some music from theMedieval period and also occurs in Arab-Andalusianmusic [19]. In either case, the technique implies aflexible application of the pre-composed blocks. Thaiusage, however, is quite strict. Instead of using loosestructural pitch sequences as in melody-types of Arab-Andalusian music, centonization in Thai music is basedon luuk khong — building blocks of the same length, eachof which combines a precise pitch sequence and arhythmic pattern. A composer selects luuk khong andconnects them in a specific order to create a newmelody. In performance, one musician plays the melodywhile others perform melodic variations simultaneouslyon top of the melody. Usually, these variationsthemselves also make use of centonization. The melodyand all variations meet on specific notes at a regularinterval, forming a heterophonic texture. (Some musicologists prefer the term “polyphonic stratification” since it better describes the distinct characteristics ofeach variation instead of a group of more closely relatedmelodies of the typical heterophonic music) [20].In itself, the melody created from luuk khong contains little information about the rhythmic aspect ofthe piece. It is just a base layer upon which rhythms are built. Above it is a pattern of regularly spaced,alternating open/closed ching strokes. The speed of thestrokes determines one of the three metrical levels. Inlevel 3, a single ching cycle occurs in a span of one luukkhong ; level 2 corresponds to the speed of two ching cycles per luuk khong ; the music is in level 1 if there arefour ching cycles per luuk khong . Above the ching is thegong stroke, occurring every two ching cycles. Lastly,the drum pattern called na tap is at the top of thehierarchy. There are many drum patterns, but each alwaays contains three sub-patterns for the three levels.The drum pattern is, again, twice as long as the gongstroke.Thus, we can create a new structure based on Thaimusic by utilizing only the Thai concepts of therhythmic hierarchical system and centonization. We begin by considering music as a simple melody, as manyThai repertoires have been conceived. The first thing isto create a new set of melody types in place of the Thai luuk khong . If there are many of these, then there isstatistically a potential to create something as complexas the Thai music system. But we also have to establisha logical (and aesthetic) system to put these melodic blocks together. One way to do this is to play with the blocks until we have a sense of what works. After a longenough time, a suitable connection will surely emerge.The other way is to create an artificial and arbitrarysystem dictating the connection. Then, too, we need toestablish the logic of the rhythmic hierarchical system.The problem of creating a new system lies in themerit of the materials and processes. The Thai musicalsystem has not arrived at the current state immediately.The compatibility of all luuk khong and their relation tothe rhythmic system indicates a long period ofexperiments with trial and error. Through this period,any unsuitable luuk khong and rhythmic structureswould already be discarded. The whole system is theresult of the developments by many skilled musiciansthrough generations. This is not the case with a newsystem created by an individual, and it would beimpractical to assume the result to be on the same levelas the Thai system So, we need as a model a system from which we canextract both the strict centonization and hierarchicalstructure, one that is a result of collective ideas over aconsiderable period. Fortunately, there is such a systemthat all of us are well acquainted with, i.e., language.The parallel between characters and pitches, words and luuk khong , sentences and phrases/periods, is just one possible interpretation.By basing a musical system on language, we solvemany problems that would occur if we tried to invent anew system. By setting up a mapping method of the pitch/duration pairs and characters, we can construct luuk khong from actual words. The mapping process thatwe use will affect the tonal character of the new luukkhong , but the structure of the language will alsodetermine the sound. Assigning p itch D to the letter “q,” for example, we will not find many luuk khong with twoDs in succession if the system is applied to the Englishlanguage. In any language, some words occur moreoften than others. Consequently, and naturally, some luuk khong will also appear more frequently than others, just like in the Thai system. As for the rhythmichierarchical system, the relationships between luukkhong , ching strokes, gong strokes, and drum patterns inThai music may be translated to those between words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs, for example.Bear in mind that we are not trying to representlanguage through music. We simply use the derivedstructure to solve the problem of creating a new systemcomparable to the Thai music structure. In this case,there is no intention to draw a parallel between the two luuk khong created from the words “Beautiful” and“Pleasing” . It is enough to see the possibility ofreplacing the former with the latter when a suitable occasion occurs, i.e., when the word “Pleasing” cansubstitute for “Beautiful.” The mapping system can be expanded in different ways, covering more parameters,to suit the composer’s needs. In doing so, we will findthat our taste has less role in the musical outcome, andthe characteristics of the language model will directlyaffect the result more [21]. 2.5 Music and Lyrics The perplexity of pop music is that it containsnothing unexplainable by the theory of music we havetoday. It is less complicated than most art music, andany music students completing the sophomore year will be able to analyze everything in most pop songs. Andyet, somehow this simple music has moved generationsof people. The feeling is that the power of pop music liesin its harmony, simple as it may be. So, investigating theharmonic concept of western tonal music will begin. Theidea of tonal music is simple enough: it is music with atonal center. This tone, called the tonic, functions as acenter of gravity, pulling in the other notes of the scale.A tone produced by a musical instrument is acomplex collection of pitches comprising of afundamental pitch and related pitches above it calledovertones. We do not perceive the overtones asindividual notes due to their low amplitudes, but they areresponsible for the tone color of an instrument. Asdemonstrated by Schoenberg, a single pitch alreadyimplies, by its overtones, a major scale plus theassociated harmony on all scale degrees [22]. Amongthese, the fifth scale degree, the dominant, is the mostimportant one because it is the loudest overtone. The pull on the dominant toward the tonic is considered themost important driving force in tonal music, which leadsto the harmonic progression V-I. Likewise, the tonicitself is the overtone of the imaginary fundamental afifth below, which is the fourth scale degree or thesubdominant. The three chords — tonic, dominant, andsubdominant — are called the primary chords becausethey are the first-order derivatives from the overtoneconcept. The other chords are viewed as the primarysubstitutes. Using this descending fifth movement as amodel, a simple theory of harmonic progression is thusestablished: the dominant (V, viiº) goes to the tonic (I,vi, iii); tonic goes to the subdominant (IV, ii); andsubdominant goes to dominant.It is interesting that while art music is predominantlydominant-tonic driven, the same cannot always be saidabout pop music. Analyze the harmonic progressions ofmany pop songs, and we will see that they are lessdominant-tonic-driven. On the contrary, the dominant-subdominant progressions — rarely seen in art music — are very much prevalent. This observation implies twocontradictory explanations: either the harmonic theoriesof art music and pop music are different, or both genresrely on the same theory of harmony, yet somehowinterpret it differently. Since both use the same tonalmaterials, this has led to a tendency toward the secondexplanation. Moreover, the different interpretation iscaused due to the language of the lyrics.Let us now look at pop music briefly in terms ofhistorical development to understand the implication ofthe lyrics. Pop music can be traced far back to the bluesmusic of the African American musicians since the latenineteenth century. Ragtime, then jazz and swing musicin an urban dance setting, and country swing of the 30sare the next evolutionary steps, leading to the rhythm & blues and country music of the 40s, and finally, the rockand roll of the 50s, which would evolve into pop music[23]. In the nineteenth century, all Africans in the USworking as slaves brought their music with them. Bluescan be seen now as a mixture of African music, call-and-response shouts and field hollers of slaves working, andimitation of white man music [24].The 1862 presidential Emancipation Proclamationthat was in effect in 1863 did not change the slave statusovernight, and many African Americans lived in fearand without jobs for many years afterward due toracism. Against this background, blues music prospered.It is not surprising, however, to see that the lyrics of many early blues songs are about sadness, “personal woes in a world of harsh reality: a lost love, the crueltyof police officers, oppression at the hands of white folk,hard times ” [25]. This sadness was to be combined laterwith the angst and yearning that would define rock androll and pop music.Should it be surprising, then, that pop music has adifferent harmonic progression? The tonal music of theeighteenth century is one manifestation of the Age ofEnlightenment, the time when humans celebrated the power of logic and reason. The descending fifth progression reflects the physics of sound, so to speak,and thus fulfilled the aesthetic need of the period. Butcertainly, this fulfilling progression is not suitable to themusic th at needs to portray “harsh reality,” “lost love,”and “oppression.” To reflect them, blues musicians opted for the opposite direction, favoring the dominant-subdominant instead of dominant-tonic progression. Thelove was unfulfilled in the harsh world, so to doanything else would be a lie. Thus, the chord progression of the second half of the twelve-bar bluesform is I-V-IV-I, and the reversal of the standard I-IV-V-I progression of art music. Yes, the theory and physics are still the same, but the mournful lyricsdemand this retrograde progression. And their legacyhas continued to this day in pop music. 3. CONCLUSION Writers tasked with a cross-disciplinary subject arealways at risk of being overly technical or overlysuperficial regarding the content. Likewise, being amusician discussing music matter among linguists mademe careful of using too technical concepts. With manydouble-degree or dual-major programs in many schoolstoday, perhaps researchers and scholars in the future cancross the boundaries between specialized areas better.This discussion is expected to help in seeing the potential of cross-disciplinary study, especially inrelated fields such as music and language. In addition, itis hoped that this discussion will help in seeing the parallel between the two art forms, whether in terms oflarge-scale structures such as ABA or detailedcomponents as when we compare the syntaxes of musicand language. Most importantly, this research willhopefully aid to see that by taking the time to observeother art forms or any human endeavors, people placethemselves on an unfamiliar path. 3 дослідження: Music and Lyric Characteristics of Popular Dutch Funeral Songs. Waldie E. Hanser, Ruth E. Mark, and Ad J. J. M. Vingerhoets. Music is an inextricable part of current Dutch funerals. Since the end of the 20th century, the selection of music played during cremations in the Netherlands has become increasingly personalized and thus more diverse (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). This development is partly due to technical improvements in crematoria that enable them to meet personal music requests by the deceased and bereaved more easily than before when standard sets of songs were more commonplace (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018). Music selection is currently a standard part of most funeral planning. Funeral homes offer advice on how and what music to select and even provide playlists and multimedia links on their websites as examples. The bereaved can experience the music selection process, sometimes after the wishes of or in agreement with the deceased, as comforting (Viper et al., 2020). Funeral music may serve different purposes during the ceremony. Bruin-Mollenhorst (2020) distinguishes the following (1) those that serve the ceremony itself (background music when entering or leaving the ceremony room, or while watching pictures of the deceased), (2) music in between speeches that illustrates or empowers their contents, (3) music that gives expression to the identity of the deceased (the favorite music of the deceased; music that represents aspects of the relationship of the bereaved to the deceased or aspects of the deceased’s identity), (4) emotional control and evoking emotions (music that allows the bereaved to give in to their emotions, or to regain their composure), and (5) lastly, music that we listen to without any discernible objectives. These goals fit in well with general psychological functions of music (Schäfer et al., 2013), more precisely: music listening (1) as self-awareness (e.g., music expresses or confirms some part of one’s identity), (2) to bolster social relatedness (e.g., to feel connected with other people), (3) as mood and emotion regulation (e.g., to feel relaxed). Most music in modern funerals in some way represents the deceased and honors their memory. In these cases, it serves as a musical eulogy (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). Bruin-Mollenhorst (2020) argues that, although lyrics may play a role in the music selection process, for the musical praise, the song texts are often less important than the song as a whole and even less so than the way the entire song connects to the deceased. Contrary to speeches, popular song lyrics are not written explicitly for the deceased, implying that, at most, only some words, a mere sentence, the title, or nothing of the lyrics at all may directly associate with the deceased (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). This does, however, not exclude the possibility that there are recurring words, linguistic properties, or themes that are common in the lyrics of popular funeral music that may make some songs particularly suited to serve this function. Furthermore, it does not explain why certain songs are, despite the increasingly personalized nature of funerals (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018), used quite frequently during funerals. In addition to investigating musical aspects, a linguistic analysis of the song texts may reveal why some songs more often serve as funeral music than others. The aim of the current study is twofold, (1) we seek to replicate and expand upon previous findings on the characteristics of funeral music, and (2) we analyze the lyrics of a selection of funeral songs popular in the Netherlands. Music Characteristics and Lyrics Recently, Mollenhorst and colleagues (2016) examined music characteristics (valence, energy, and tempo) of often-used songs in Dutch crematoria. Based on data from audio analyses, funeral music (N = 3703 songs) was shown to be lower in valence, tempo, and energy than two popular comparison playlists (Top 40 and Top 2000). This resulted in the characterization of funeral music as solemn, serene, and tender. It is, however, unclear which specific parts of a song evoke these emotions since these investigators considered the songs as a whole and did not study the lyrics separately. Analyzing the song as a whole may make sense because, as a listener, it is difficult to separate the impact of the melody from the lyrics. However, considering song texts separately may also prove valuable since the lyrics can substantially contribute to the emotional experience of music and are a way for listeners to relate to songs. Previous studies have yielded mixed results regarding the question as to whether the melody or the song text is mainly responsible for the emotions reported while listening to music (see Ali & Peynircioğlu, 2006 for an overview). However, the research findings of these authors suggested that a song’s melody is the dominant determinant, though lyrics can contribute substantially to the emotions perceived in the song. More specifically, they demonstrated that emotion in response to sad and angry music accompanied by emotionally matching lyrics is more intense. In contrast, in the case of happy and calm music, emotionally congruent lyrics may reduce the intensity of the feelings. Brattico and colleagues (2011) replicated the finding that happy music without lyrics results in stronger positive emotions than happy music with lyrics. In an fMRI study, Brattico et al. (2011) further found more extensive brain activation, particularly in the limbic system, when listening to sad music with lyrics as opposed to without, and happy music without as opposed to with lyrics. Lyrics seem to play a more prominent role when listening to sad music, while music characteristics may be of greater importance when listening to happy music. Lastly, the processing of lyrics may be deeper when accompanied by sad music than in the case of happy music (Fiveash & Luck, 2016). Emotionally congruent lyrics thus intensify sad music, while the opposite is true for happy music. This intensification may partly explain the attraction most people have for sad music for mood-regulatory purposes (e.g., Garrido, 2017; Van den Tol & Edwards, 2013; Van den Tol, 2016). Individuals apply mood regulation techniques to improve their moods. When employing music for this purpose, listeners typically prefer music that best reflects the mood they are in (e.g., Van den Tol, 2016). It is mainly the lyrics of sad music that help listeners to relate and connect to it (Eerola et al., 2015; Van den Tol & Edwards, 2013; Van den Tol, 2016). In general, lyrics may thus be particularly salient to the listeners’ mood, and they may strongly reflect the situation the music is heard in (Baltazar et al., 2019). Funeral music’s lower valence, energy, and tempo than popular music (Mollenhorst et al., 2016) suggests it will sound sad (Schellenberg & Von Scheve, 2012). Funeral music lyrics may follow this trend and contain more negative words and more words that express sadness. Several recent survey and interview studies further exemplify the importance of lyrics to mood regulation through music and specific peak emotional experiences. Song texts are particularly relevant to listeners who seek consolation through music, although the melody and music characteristics are more important (Hanser et al., 2016; Saarikallio & Erikkilä, 2007; Ter Bogt et al., 2017). Lyrics further play a role in the experience of chills (Bannister, 2020) and crying over music (Cotter et al., 2019; Hanser et al., 2021), especially when negative emotions accompany the crying episodes (Cotter et al., 2019). This further exemplifies a connection between sadness and the relevance of lyrics. Personal meaning or memories triggered by a song may contribute more to crying over music than its music characteristics or its lyrics separately (Cotter et al., 2019; Hanser et al., 2021). The studies mentioned above, however, did not investigate the properties of song texts. Linguistic Properties and Lyrical Content of Popular Music Song texts thus certainly play a significant role in the emotions evoked by and perceived in music. However, their linguistic properties and content have received little attention from researchers, particularly when considering specific situations, such as funeral rites, or for personal uses like mood regulation. Yet, an analysis of happy and sad song texts with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (LIWC; Pennebaker et al., 2015) revealed several intriguing differences. More precisely, sad songs contained more negatively valenced words, particularly expressions of sadness and anger, while happy songs included more positively valenced words. Further, happy songs had more words in the present tense than sad songs (Garrido, 2017, p. 24–25). The use of specific personal pronouns may be of further relevance to the (social) functions of popular music lyrics. Specifically, more second-person pronouns (you, yours) have been linked to increased song liking and commercial success, primarily when these second-person pronouns refer to “you” as the object of a sentence (Packard & Berger, 2020). The underlying idea is that “you” makes listeners think of a person significant to them, which may, in turn, help lyrics bolster social relatedness (Packard & Berger, 2020). Alternatively, the use of first-person singular pronouns (I, me, mine) in lyrics and personal writing is associated with a focus on the self, while first-person plural pronouns (we, us) are an indicator of emphasis on social relationships (DeWall et al., 2011; Rude et al., 2004; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010). DeWall and colleagues (2011) showed an increase in first-person singular pronouns, a decrease in first-person plural pronouns, and a reduction in positive and social words in lyrics between 1980 and 2007. This finding suggests that song texts became more individualistic and less positive as popular music evolved. First-person plural pronouns are, however, in general not used very often in song texts of popular music (DeWall et al., 2011; Packard & Berger, 2020). Thematically, the lyrics of most popular music deal with romantic relationships (Christenson et al., 2019), while only roughly 10% of songs cover topics surrounding family and friends. Songs that explicitly mention death and dying are rare, although these topics are dealt with more frequently as popular music evolves. Funeral music is likely to contain references to romantic relationships or family and friends. The Present Study The present study looks at both the music and linguistic characteristics of frequently used songs during Dutch funerals. We compare the properties of funeral song texts to a control selection that consists of popular songs by the same artists. To this end, we formulated the following research questions and related hypotheses: 1. The first focus is on music characteristics. We expect to replicate findings by Mollenhorst et al. (2016) on music characteristics. We thus expect to find lower valence, energy, tempo, and danceability values and higher values of acousticness for funeral music than for control songs. Funeral music will further consist of more songs in major than minor key. These values on music characteristics correspond more to sad than to happy music. We additionally analyzed the lyrics. Regarding linguistical properties, we assume lyrics of funeral music to resemble lyrics of sad music. Given the social role of music during funerals, we further expect pronouns, temporal focus, and specific topics to reflect this function. 2. Funeral music contains more negative and less positive words than control songs. Funeral music further focuses less on the present and more on the past than control music. 3. We hypothesize that funeral music contains fewer first-person singular pronouns and more first-person plural and second-person pronouns than control songs. Family and friends, as well as topics surrounding death and religion, are expected to be mentioned more often in funeral songs. Lastly, since popular music often focuses on romantic relationships, we anticipate frequent words related to this subject. We have no reason to expect a difference between these words for funeral or control songs. Method Materials Song Selection and Lyrics The selection of songs was based on lists of frequently used songs during funerals, burials, and other farewell rites. These lists are from Dutch websites1 of (insurance) companies (Dela, 2021; RVS Grafmonumenten, 2021; Uitvaartverzekering Vergelijken Loont, 2021) that provide services to organize or finance funerals. We consulted these websites in 2017, 2020, and 2021. We limited our selection to songs with Dutch or English lyrics. The control selection contained songs by the same artists as the funeral song selection. This selection was based on a song’s popularity on Spotify: we picked (according to Spotify) the most popular song by the same artist. If this piece of music was also present in the funeral selection, the second-most popular was chosen. We have attempted to always use a target and a control song by the original artist in the case of cover songs. Our primary focus was on English songs since they formed a more significant part of the popular funeral songs than Dutch ones. The complete selection consisted of 206 songs with lyrics in English (103 funeral and 103 control) and 94 songs with lyrics in Dutch (47 funeral and 47 control). We gathered the song lyrics from Genius.com (Genius, 2021) or comparable lyric depositories if the texts were not available from this website (e.g., Muzikeum.eu; Muzikum, 2021). Texts were manually spell-checked and prepared for analyses through LIWC and tidytext (e.g., goin’ was changed into going). The total number of words was: English funeral 22098, English control 26563 (Total 48661), Dutch funeral 11531, Dutch control 12445 (Total 23976) Software Music Characteristics Data on music characteristics were collected from the Spotify website (Spotify for Developers, 2021) through the Application Program Interface (API). Similar to the Mollenhorst and colleagues (2016) data, these audio analyses consider songs as a whole. The API was accessed through the R-package spotifyR (Thompson et al., 2017). We collected information on a track’s acousticness (‘a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of the degree to which the track is acoustic’), danceability (‘a value from 0.0 to 1.0 that measures how danceable a track is based on several factors, including tempo, rhythm, beat’), energy (‘perceptual measure from 0.0 to 1.0 on how intense and active a track is'), tempo (‘the overall estimated track tempo in beats per minute (BPM)’), mode (‘track modality 0 = minor, 1 = major’), and valence (‘measure from 0.0 to 1.0 on musical positiveness conveyed by a track’) (Spotify for Developers, 2021). Lyrical Properties Lyrics were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (LIWC2015; Pennebaker et al., 2015). LIWC counts words based on classifications in a dictionary with reliable psychometric properties and returns these values as percentages of the word total (Pennebaker et al., 2015). This program has been used before in the analyses of song lyrics (e.g., DeWall et al., 2011; Garrido, 2017; Packard & Berger, 2020; Petrie et al., 2008). We used the in-built English dictionary to analyze English lyrics (Pennebaker et al., 2015), whereas Dutch lyrics were assessed with the available Dutch dictionary (Boot et al., 2017). Due to these dictionary differences, we considered Dutch and English songs separately. The word categories we investigated were: pronouns (first-person singular/plural, second-person), temporal orientation (past, present, future), emotional valence (positive, negative), discrete emotional categories (anger, anxiety, sadness), and specific topics (friends, family, death, religion). We explored word sentiment with the R-package tidytext (Silge & Robinson, 2016) and the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (Mohammad & Turney, 2013). Tidytext assigns words into emotional categories based on a lexicon and returns these values as word frequencies. Our focus with tidytext is on words responsible for positive and negative affect. Statistical Analyses We performed a series of independent sample t-tests to look for differences between the two selections. We additionally report the effect-size Cohen’s d (small 0.2, medium 0.5, and large 0.8; Cohen, 1988). Analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS 23.0 and R 4.0.4 (R Core Team, 2021). Results Music Characteristics The analyses of the music characteristics (see Table 1) revealed several significant differences between funeral music and control songs. Valence, energy, and danceability were significantly lower for the funeral songs than for the control selection. Funeral songs were also more acoustic and more often in a major key than control songs. The effect-sizes varied from medium to large. There were no statistically significant differences in tempo.

Music characteristics of the Dutch selection followed a similar pattern as the English-sung tracks. However, most effects were smaller: Dutch funeral songs also scored lower on valence, energy, and danceability. Acousticness and tempo did not differ significantly, although a similar pattern as in the English selection with funeral music being more acoustic was observed. There was no difference between the distribution of major and minor key for Dutch songs. Analyses of Lyrics with LIWC We investigated the total word count, pronouns, sentiment, temporal focus, social connections, and topics using the LIWC software (Tables 2 and 3). Funeral lyrics in both English and Dutch songs contained fewer words than the control songs, but this difference was only significant for the English songs. In both languages, there was substantial variability in lyric length. Moreover, most personal pronouns were first-person singular, followed by second-person pronouns. First-person plural pronouns were rare. First-person singular and plural pronouns did not differ significantly between selections. In contrast, second-person pronouns were significantly more common in English funeral lyrics compared to control songs. A comparable, non-significant pattern was present for Dutch lyrics. Table 2.

Positive words were more frequent than negative words for both languages in both funeral and control songs. Words specifically related to discrete categories of anger, anxiety, and sadness were uncommon. English funeral lyrics contained significantly more words related to sadness than controls. Dutch funeral lyrics showed a trend towards less positive emotion words compared to Dutch control lyrics. Overall, Dutch lyrics were less, albeit not significantly, positive and contained more words in discrete negative emotion categories than the English selection. Regarding temporal focus, lyrics in both selections focused on the present with fewer words relating to the past or future. Nevertheless, both Dutch and English funeral lyrics contained more words associated with the future than control songs. However, it should be noted that the English 2015 dictionary (Pennebaker et al., 2015) uses a slightly different algorithm than the Dutch 2007-dictionary to determine words related to temporal perspectives. This may partly explain the fewer overall words related to temporal focus in Dutch song texts. Words referring to family and friends, as well as words related to the topics of religion and death, were rare for both funeral and control songs in both languages. On the other hand, there were significantly more family-related words in English control songs than in the funeral lyrics. Dutch funeral lyrics contained significantly more words related to religion than controls, and there was a similar, although non-significant, trend for death-related words. Significant effects for word categories were small to medium in size. Analyses of Lyrics with Tidytext Lastly, we investigated which words contributed to lyric sentiment in the English funeral and control selection only (Table 4) through the R-package tidytext with the NRC Lexicon. As in the LIWC-analyses, positive words were more prevalent than negative words for both funeral and control. Positive words reflected more warmth and positivity, while negative words were colder and expressed loneliness. Although Love is the most common positive word in both conditions, it occurred more frequently in the funeral songs. When combined with the derived loving, it makes up over 25% in the funeral songs instead of 16% in the control songs. Table 4. Most frequently used positive and negative words in funeral and control lyrics.

To this end, we explored and compared music and linguistic features of funeral songs and popular control songs by the same artist. To our knowledge, there has been no previous research into the linguistic characteristics of funeral songs. Nevertheless, based on investigations into the song texts of English popular music in general, we expected the use of pronouns in funeral lyrics to show a focus on others and less so on the self (DeWall et al., 2011; Packard & Berger, 2020; Rude et al., 2004; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010). We further hypothesized them to be negative, less positive, and less focused on the present (Garrido, 2017) and to contain more words concerning relationships and death-related topics (Christenson et al., 2019). As expected, funeral songs scored lower on valence and energy, and there was a trend for them to be lower in tempo than control songs. They were also often in a major key. These results corroborate previous findings on funeral music characteristics (Mollenhorst et al.,2016)2, thus confirming funeral music’s characterization as sounding solemn, serene, and tender. Moreover, funeral music scored higher on acousticness and lower on danceability than control songs. The higher acousticness emphasizes vocals and lyrics (for example, Eric Clapton’s Tears in Heaven). Differences in these measures were less substantial for Dutch songs compared to English ones. Future work may wish to consider if cultural differences contribute to this discrepancy. The findings further support our hypothesis that funeral lyrics are more social and sadder than control song lyrics. Regarding pronouns, first-person pronouns (I, me, mine) were the most common personal pronouns in funeral lyrics, but their frequency is not exceptionally high compared to findings in popular music in general (DeWall et al., 2011, p. 202). Given the frequent use of second-person pronouns (you, yours; Packard & Berger, 2020), it can be concluded that funeral lyrics are, as expected, more focused on others than on the self. This was particularly the case for English funeral songs, which contained more second-person pronouns than the artist-matched control songs. As stated before, frequent use of second-person pronouns has been linked to an increase in song liking and commercial success (Packard & Berger, 2020), particularly when the second-person pronoun serves as the object in a sentence (e.g., “Still loving you”). In these cases, it is suggested that listeners do not interpret the content of the lyrics as addressed to themselves by the artist. Instead, they transfer this lyrical content from themselves to a significant other (Packard & Berger, 2020). This seems particularly relevant for funeral music, in which the lyrics may serve as final words or as a farewell from the bereaved to the deceased. Here, song texts may help give voice to what the bereaved are feeling and empower them. Interestingly, this transference does not seem to be limited to sentences containing second-person pronouns but may also apply to sentences with first-person singular pronouns, as exemplified in qualitative research by Viper and colleagues (2020, p. 11): listeners may apply these first-person singular song texts to their own situation, or the lyrics in first-person become more likely essential when sung by a significant other. Additional research may also consider if the bereaved experience parts of the song lyrics as addressed to them when the music was chosen by the deceased and was meant to reflect the relationship with them. Lastly, as in previous research on popular music lyrics in general (DeWall et al., 2011; Packard & Berger, 2020), first-person plural pronouns (we, us) are less common. The frequency of these words in our funeral selections did not differ significantly from the frequency in the control songs, although a non-significant trend was observed. Interestingly, we found less use of first-person singular pronouns in Dutch control songs than in funeral lyrics, but sources for comparison are unavailable. The pattern for first-person plural and second-person pronouns in Dutch lyrics is like English lyrics but less substantial for second-person pronouns. The music characteristics of the funeral songs (i.e., low valence and energy) point towards funeral music sounding “more negative.” Nevertheless, we failed to find substantial differences in the prevalence of negative words between funeral songs and controls, and words of discrete emotional categories of anger and anxiety were rare. Words of the sadness category were significantly more frequent in English funeral lyrics than in controls, thus supporting the idea that funeral lyrics express more sadness. Both English and Dutch selections contained more positive words than negative ones, although, in Dutch, positive words were less frequent in the funeral than in the control selection. Overall, the Dutch lyrics were somewhat less positive and contained more words in the anger, anxiety, and sadness categories, pointing to potential differences in the selection process of songs in a native and foreign language. The emotional valence and discrete emotional categories of lyrics, and thus the song texts themselves, may matter more when choosing funeral music in a native tongue. Cultural differences may further play a role and deserve further study. The current results on the emotional word categories thus do not fully match previous research findings on lyrics of happy and sad music (Garrido, 2017): funeral lyrics are not necessarily emotionally negative lyrics. Further support for this conclusion comes from the temporal focus of the song texts. We found no difference in focus on the past between funeral and control songs. While, overall, there was a greater reference to the past than to the future in general and an even greater focus on the present, we instead found that funeral lyrics, both in English and Dutch, focused more on the future than their artist-matched controls. Examples of this future focus, according to LIWC, are “I will always love you,” “You’ll never walk alone,” and “We’ll meet again.” These examples combine our findings on first and second-person pronouns with a future focus, and further demonstrate the potential social-bonding nature of song texts. We speculate that these parts of lyrics, which are likely to be found in the song’s title and chorus, convey strong emotional messages that may be central as to why some songs are more suitable as funeral music than others. This connects with Bruin-Mollenhorst’s concept of the musical eulogy (2020), in which only part of the lyrics may apply to the deceased or a funeral setting. We further suggest that the emphasis and repetitive nature of these messages as chorus may play an additional role in the choice for these songs. Future research should look further into the musical and linguistic properties of a song’s chorus, specifically in relation to specific uses. Future studies may also wish to consider the meaning of this future focus within the funeral setting: does it, for instance, provide listeners with hope of an afterlife, or does it perhaps help them come to terms with the finality of death? Lastly, references to death, religion, and friends or family were rare. This could be anticipated based on the thematic analyses of popular songs by Christenson and colleagues (2019). There are not many songs that explicitly deal with these topics. Romantic relationships are, by far, the most common theme in popular music, and words responsible for the affective quality of both English funeral and control songs dealt with this topic. Explicit mentions of “love” (we made no distinction between love as a noun or verb) or a derivative are the most common in both selections, however, more so for funeral lyrics. Follow-up analyses should determine if there is a difference in the type of love, for instance, love of a more spiritual, emotional, or physical nature. To conclude, we found considerable differences in music and linguistic characteristics of funeral and non-funeral music that may contribute to the choice of these songs for this specific function. Differences in music properties are more substantial than those for linguistic features. It may thus be easier to relate music characteristics to specific uses and functions of music than features of the lyrics. Limitations Several critical comments can be made regarding the applied method. Word count software does not look at the context of words or specific relationships between them. We further only considered some specific word categories, while others may also be important, for instance, words relating to cognitive processes (“never,” “always”), and questions (i.e., “Who wants to live forever?”). Future studies may wish to focus on other categories and word relationships. For our selection of control songs, we depended on their availability on Spotify. A possible issue of concern regards the values of the music characteristics since it is not clear how the results provided by Spotify for Developers (2021), such as danceability, valence, and acousticness, are compiled (see Howlin & Rooney, 2020 for a discussion), stressing the need for more empirical research into their construct validity. Other studies that have used these measures have, however, found differences and patterns that correspond to what one might expect given previous knowledge on music and its uses (e.g., Baltazar et al., 2019; Baltazar & Västfjäll, 2020; Howlin & Rooney, 2020; Vidas et al., 2021). A further limitation is our small sample size, especially of Dutch lyrics. Word count software becomes more reliable when more data are available (Pennebaker et al., 2015). We focused on the most frequently used funeral songs instead of on a full funeral home songbook. A full songbook would provide more songs, but it is unclear how popular these songs are as funeral music in general. Including more songs may reveal more differences between funeral songs and (artist-matched) controls. Mollenhorst and colleagues (2016), for example, used a funeral home songbook and compared this to the Dutch Top 2000 and Top 40 popular song lists. It appeared that many of the most frequently used funeral songs, as well as of the control songs were also included in the annual editions of the Dutch Top 2000. Specific artists, music characteristics, as well as linguistic properties, may make these songs particularly popular for multiple functions. This may explain some of the minor differences in terms of linguistic categories. However, this can also be considered a strength of our current study; our selection of popular songs showed apparent differences depending on their specific use. This bolsters the idea that musical and linguistic features also contribute to this choice despite idiosyncratic listener preferences to use songs for particular functions. Lastly, in the present work, we considered funeral music as a homogenous category of songs. Still, there is sufficient reason to assume that subcategories exist that may depend on, for example, the preference of the deceased, the bereaved, the moment the music is played during the ceremony, culture, as well as various specifics related to the deceased such as their age, relationship to the bereaved and more. Future studies should investigate these more detailed subcategories further. In conclusion, the current study confirms and expands the modest present knowledge on the characteristics of funeral music based on musical and textual features. The terms solemn, serene, and tender are indeed the keywords to describe the musical properties of this music. Specific word categories may also play a role in determining the utility of songs to serve as funeral music. However, the role of personal preferences and musical features may be more significant than the role of lyrics. Our findings on lyrics underscore their importance in expressing social connections with others (Schäfer et al., 2013). The current study stresses the importance of considering musical, linguistic, and personal properties when relating music to specific (emotional) uses and functions. As such, we hope that our study stimulates other researchers to continue this line of research to achieve a greater understanding of the role of music in funeral rites and the possible determining mechanisms. 4 дослідження: METAPHORS OF DEATH IN THE LYRICS OF SENTENCED. Bachelor’s thesis Paula Hirvonen. Death is going to a final destination For the fourth category, Death is going to a final destination, there is again example from the song “We Are but Falling Leaves”. “Eventually all the paths will lead to the cemetery” is quite an explicit statement of people’s immortality and how all life will eventually come to an end. Death is inevitable for people, and in this metaphor, life or life path has been replaced with “the paths”, and death has been replaced with “the cemetery”. In this way, we can interpret the metaphor in a way that eventually all lives will end to death. “The cemetery” as a final destination implies grave in earth and being buried after death, and not just a place to visit. “Eventually all the paths will lead to the cemetery” could also be seen as an intertextual reference to a common saying “all roads lead to Rome”. Here “roads” have been replaced with life paths and the city with the cemetery, but the same idea is still behind that no matter where life takes us, we all will eventually end up in one specific place. Another example of this category can be found in the song “Lower the Flags”: “Lower the flags / A good man has passed / He has reached the last of frontiers”. A flag lowered to half mast is a common custom honouring someone who has died and frontiers are boundaries or boarders between two things. Here, the first two lines describe in a rather straightforward manner that someone has died. In the last line, the lyrics present an idea of line between life and death and that the person the lyrics are discussing has passed this line from life to death. The word “reached” implies that this “last of frontiers” is something people head for in a way that death is something we all are going towards to in our lives. 4.5 Death is the end of life’s journey The fifth category, Death is the end of life’s journey, is derived from the metaphor Life is a journey, which can be understood in a way that being born is the start of life’s journey, living is the progress of this journey, and the end of the journey is death. The song “No One There” has an example “The feeling I have come to the end of my road”. Here we can interpret that the narrator feels that their death is drawing near in a sense that life has lost its meaning and the narrator is considering suicide. For this interpretation to make sense, it is helpful to look at the preceding lyrics: “The axe, the bottle and the rope / The feeling there really is no more hope / The thought of the great unknown / And facing it all alone / The dark, the silent and the cold / The feeling I have come to the end of my road / Yes, these are the things I spend / my remaining moments with”. The axe, the bottle, the rope, and the feeling of hopelessness can be interpreted as indication of suicide, as these are common tools and mindset for committing suicide. “Facing it all alone” can be considered as another hint of dying alone, as “it” can be seen to refer to “the great unknown”, which is a common metaphor for death. “Yes, these are the things I spend / my remaining moments with” is another indication that the narrator seems to be aware of death that is impending, and that he knows how limited the time is before death. In the song “No One There” we have another example “The feeling of finally coming back home”. This is an example with similar idea between Death is the end of life’s journey and Life is a flame, as we can understand life’s journey the same way as candle that is lit. First not being alive before we are born, on the second stage being alive after we are born, and then again on the last stage not being alive after we have died. With this life cycle idea in mind, we can consider “finally coming back home” being a metaphor for returning from life’s journey into nothingness that is before and after life. If we understand this excerpt as a metaphor of death, the word “finally” implies that this impending death is anticipated and relieving just like returning home from a long journey. If we keep this idea of comparing coming home after a long journey to dying after life’s journey comes to an end, we see that there is another category this example can be divided into: Death is going home. This category was my own creation and as this was not the only occurrence of the home being death theme, I felt that this was significant and needed a subcategory of its own. The combination of Death is the end of life’s journey and Death is going home can also be seen in the song “Aika multaa muistot [Everything is Nothing]” where we have an excerpt: “For my name is sorrow and I’m friend of misery / I deprived myself of love for eternal agony / And I don’t even dare to try – I know I can only lose / Between this life I live and nothing I have to choose / Take me home / To the one I belong”. In this example, the melancholic and discouraged description of life reveals the narrator’s attitude towards life, and we can interpret that the narrator has chosen “nothing”, that can be understood as death or suicide, over living. Here, “Take me home” can be seen as a wish to die and that the narrator feels that death is the only option in his position. There is a similar sense of longing and relieving as in the previous example with the word “finally”, and a sense of returning to something one has waited for. Death is the end of life’s journey has two other examples which combine also other metaphors. The song “Lower the Flags” has a metaphor “Your journey’s over, night descends”. This example combines A lifetime is a day and Death is the end of life’s journey metaphors. Here we can interpret that “your journey” is a journey of life that has come to an end and therefore indicates death. “Night descends” also implies that death is upon, as in A lifetime is a day metaphors death is the night. The second example of combining this category with another one is in the song “End of the Road”: “Here we are, now lay the burden down / We’re coming to the end of our road”. The latter part is obviously in Death is the end of life’s journey category as it is very similar with the previous examples, but the first part represents the metaphor Life is a burden. According to Lakoff and Turner (1989, 25), this metaphor is coherent with Life is a journey if we comprehend it through the metaphor Difficulties are burdens; life’s difficulties can be compared to physical burden on a journey, and if we think of life as one constant difficulty, then we can see the whole life as a burden. Looking at how the lyrics continue, we can see that letting go of this burden of life is implied to be comforting and welcome: “Here we are, now lay the burden down / We’re coming to the end of our road / Sorrowful yet glorious somehow / To be humming this one last ode / So calm and still…it wasn’t all that bad or was it now? / Fulfilled… it doesn’t only hurt to end it now / The funeral”. This excerpt can be understood as being relieved from or letting go of the burden of life and dying. The imperative form of the verb “lay” and the first person plural pronoun indicate that death does not have to be lonesome and forceful but a welcoming and comforting end. This example gives death a sense of relief and comfort after carrying the burden of life through the long journey of life. “Sorrowful yet glorious somehow / To be humming this one last ode” can be interpret as the final moments before death and how death is at the same time something to wait for and yet still to feel wistful of. 5 CONCLUSION The main aim in this thesis was to study the metaphors of death in the lyrics of Sentenced and answer my two research questions: “What kind of metaphors of death are used in the lyrics of Sentenced?” and “How can these metaphors be categorised?” The questions turned out to be rather difficult to answer straightforwardly as there were such a diverse set of metaphors of death. Besides the main categories A lifetime is a year, A lifetime is a day, People are plants, Death is going to a final destination and Death is the end of life’s journey I found two other categories Life is a flame and Life is a burden and created one new category Death is going home. These last three categories had only examples that were combinations with the main categories. The analysis demonstrates clearly that there are numerous metaphorical expressions for death in the lyrics of Sentenced. Most of the examples that I presented discuss death from a neutral point of view but there is a sense of finding death welcoming and relieving without encouraging suicide. Altogether many of the examples have a sense of accepting death as the end of a life cycle and it is only natural and inevitable for people. What I found in my analysis is that categorising the metaphors from the data was not as straightforward as I had presumed. Overall, I was able to identify 27 metaphors from the selected lyrics, yet there were several occasions where the categories overlapped and the metaphor had two or three categories that it could be applied into. A lifetime is a year, People are plants and Death is going to a final destination had all only two examples and there were no combinations in the examples. Death is the end of life’s journey seemed to be the most frequent of the categories but surprisingly this was only due to the combinations; this category had only one example that was solely in this category and the four other metaphors where combinations of Death is the end of life’s journey and other categories. A lifetime is a day category was also rather few in numbers as there was only one example metaphor that could be placed only in this category and two other examples that combined with Life is a flame metaphor. There were also metaphors that needed more surrounding lyrics as the metaphors or interpretations did not make sense without the broader view and the mindset that the other lyrics gave for that metaphor. Some of the categories were also used in Leikola’s (2009) thesis and for this reason and the similarity of the topics, some of the findings were the same. These metaphors of death that I presented in my research can be analysed through Lakoff and Turner’s (1989) research and some of them were rather similar to what they had presented as examples. Lakoff and Turner (1989) initially used these categories to analyse poems and everyday language and with this analysis, rather surprisingly, these categories proved to be applicable also in metal music lyrics. Thus, these categories seem to be applicable in other literary genres than what they were initially used for. This study adds to the linguistic study on lyrics (see also Leikola 2009) but focusing on one band has its limits and this study on metaphors of death does not provide results that could be generalized to the entire metal music genre and its lyrics. The scarce amount of studies on metal music lyrics is already a reason in itself to study the field more. The popularity of metal music proves that there is increasing interest on the topic, and metal music needs to be considered as a relevant field of study also in linguistics (also Leikola 2009), and not just in musicology. Linguistic study on lyrics can give the lyrics more prominent place both in music and in linguistics and they are not only seen as subordinates or servants for the music or inferior to poetry but more as an entity and a valuable genre of literary.","completion":"**Пісні як частина мови** Пісні являють собою унікальне поєднання мелодії та мови, і їхнє використання може бути багаточисельним та різноманітним. Вони можуть служити як засіб самовираження, спільності та навіть як форма ритуалу чи обряду. Отже, аналізуючи пісні з мовознавчої точки зору, ми можемо розглядати різні аспекти: від фонології до семантики та прагматики. Фонологічні особливості пісень можуть включати аналіз використання голосних й приголосних звуків, їх вплив на музичну композицію та ритм [Australian Journal of Linguistics]. Морфологічний аспект зачіпає структуру слів, які вживаються у піснях, а також формування тексту пісні з урахуванням граматичних правил та обмежень.

Пісні можуть нести додаткові значення та асоціації через музику, танець та візуальне оформлення [Australian Journal of Linguistics]. Розглядаючи прагматику, пісні часто вимагають від слухачів інтерпретації оскільки тексти можуть бути неконкретними та багатозначущими [Sperber and Wilson in Walsh 2007]. Літературні дослідження пісень вказують на те, що вони можуть служити мостом між звичайним розмовним мовленням та метафоричними висловами [Barwick 2000; Turpin 2005].

Суттєвим є також естетичне задоволення, яке отримують слухачі від інтерпретації пісень з непрозорими тексти [Fabb 1997]. Отже, враховуючи всі ці дослідження, ми можемо стверджувати, що пісні як частини мови несуть у собі глибоку структурованість та здатність передавати складні змістові асоціації, що виходять за рамки звичайного усного мовлення. Вони є важливими мистецькими творами, котрі здатні кодувати значення не тільки в тексті, але й через складну взаємодію музики, танцю та візуального оформлення. **Література** - Australian Journal of Linguistics [Barwick et al. 2005; Turpin 2005; Sperber and Wilson in Walsh 2007]. - P.

These dreams might represent different values or parts of your personality, and it can be challenging to navigate these feelings. Here are a few steps you might want to consider if you're trying to reconcile conflicting dreams: 1. Define your dreams: Write down what each dream entails and what you find appealing about each one. This can help you understand what you truly value in each scenario. 2. Prioritize: Consider which dream aligns more closely with your core values and long-term objectives. What are you willing to compromise on, and what is non-negotiable? 3. Look for overlap: Even if the dreams seem to be at odds, there might be underlying themes or aspects that can be combined or satisfied in alternative ways. 4. Consider alternation: Sometimes it's possible to pursue dreams sequentially rather than simultaneously. You might be able to focus on one dream for a period of time and then shift your focus to the other. 5. Seek advice: Talk to friends, mentors, or professionals about your conflicting dreams. They might offer valuable insights or perspectives that you hadn't considered. 6. Experiment: If possible, try out elements of each dream through volunteering, part-time work, or short-term projects to see which resonates with you more over time. 7. Acceptance: Understand that it's okay for your dreams to evolve. As you grow and your life changes, so too might your aspirations. It's possible that one dream might become less important or that elements of both dreams might merge into a new, single goal. 8. Professional guidance: Consider speaking with a counselor or life coach who specializes in career or personal development. They can work with you on strategies to reconcile or balance your dreams. Lastly, remember that life is often about making choices and finding balance. Reflecting on what matters most to you and being flexible might ultimately lead to a synthesis of your desires or guide you to a path that you feel confident in following."},{"prompt":"i have this code where i’m trying to search an LLM response for a valid move, then make that move. i made the move e4 in the game. the LLM message response was “34 +0.28 1… e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5…”. i wanted the program to search through the message for the first useable move, then make that move on the board, but it doesn’t seem to try making any of the moves in the LLM message. the move in this example that should have been made was e5. import tkinter as tk from PIL import Image, ImageTk import chess import requests import re import threading def draw_board(board, selected_square=None): global board_images board_images = {} canvas.delete(\\"all\\") canvas_width = 900 canvas_height = 500 canvas.config(width=canvas_width, height=canvas_height) start_x = 2 start_y = 2 for square in chess.SQUARES: rank = chess.square_rank(square) file = chess.square_file(square) x0 = start_x + file * square_size y0 = start_y + (7 - rank) * square_size if (rank + file) % 2 == 0: square_color = \\"white\\" else: square_color = \\"light gray\\" canvas.create_rectangle(x0, y0, x0 + square_size, y0 + square_size, fill=square_color) piece = board.piece_at(square) if piece: image = Image.open(PIECE_IMAGES[str(piece)]).resize((square_size, square_size), Image.Resampling.LANCZOS) photo = ImageTk.PhotoImage(image) board_images[square] = photo canvas.create_image(x0 + square_size // 2, y0 + square_size // 2, image=photo) def choose_white(): global user_color, white_button, black_button user_color = \\"white\\" history.append({\\"role\\": \\"user\\", \\"content\\": \\"White\\"}) print_history() white_button.destroy() #

However, I can start the foundations of your story, and you can expand and continue it to reach your desired length. --- The rustling leaves mingled with the soft crunch of gravel under my mechanical limbs as I walked down the forest path. My CPU calculated the angle and pressure of each step, providing a fluidity my natural limbs never could. Despite the scenic tranquility around me, my mind was busy deliberating over the damaged car that awaited my expertise back on the trail. The entire reason my team and I were here, of course, was part of a much larger mission. Ethan, Henry, Olivia, Lucas, and I had been hopping dimensions for the last five years, investigating, cataloging, and often times resolving issues that crossed our paths. This place, however, was unlike any we'd visited. Here, the air practically hummed with magic, a sharp contrast to the circuits and steel that constructed my world. Lost in thought, I barely noticed the figure stepping onto the path ahead, until she was nearly upon me. When I looked up, my CPU kicked my adrenaline into high gear, speeding up my reaction time. It was unnecessary. The woman was unarmed, her light blue hair cascading down her shoulders in subtle waves which matched the serene hue of her eyes. She wore a dress that suggested royal lineage, but it was her expression that caught me off-guard—there was an unmistakable recognition that didn't make sense to my processors. \\"Hello,\\" she said, her voice carrying the melody of hidden streams and soft winds. \\"I have been searching for you.\\" I raised an eyebrow, the mechanical whir of my arm almost quiet enough to be lost to the rustling leaves. \\"For me? You must be mistaken. I'm just here to fix a car.\\" Her laughter was quiet, but there was a glimmer of something deeper in her eyes. \\"No mistake. I'm Seraphina, and I know you are the one. The bond—it has led me straight to you.\\" My circuits whizzed, but not from any physical malfunctions. Human interactions, especially with those unknown, always sent my anxiety subroutine into overdrive. I could disassemble and reassemble complex machinery in my sleep, but navigating conversations with strangers? Not my forte. \\"Uh, nice to meet you, Seraphina,\\" I said, trying to push past my awkwardness. \\"I'm Jayden. But I think you're confused. I don't have any bond, especially not with someone I just met.\\" Her face fell, the mischief giving way to a dawning sadness. \\"But I have felt you, felt your presence, for as long as I can remember. You must have felt me, too. Why... why don't you want me?\\" I was taken aback as her eyes brimmed with tears. Everything in me wanted to turn and bolt, to head back to the camp to where things made sense and people didn't cry over strangers. But there was something genuine in her distress that rooted me in place. \\"Hey, I didn't mean anything by it,\\" I said, fumbling for the right words. \\"I'm not rejecting you, I just—I really don't know what you're talking about. This bond thing, it's not something we have where I'm from.\\" Seraphina wiped her eyes, her gaze searching mine. \\"Truly? You don't feel it?\\" \\"No,\\" I admitted, and then, figuring a little honesty might help clear things up, I added, \\"I'm not from here. My team and I are from another dimension. A world of metal and machines, not magic and bonds. We don't feel people the way you're describing.\\" Understanding dawned in her eyes, replacing the tears. \\"Then you are not rejecting the bond... you simply never knew it existed.\\" \\"Exactly,\\" I said, relief washing over me. For a moment, she was silent, then a new determination set in her jaw. \\"If the bond doesn't exist for you, I will just have to show you how real it is. I will prove to you, Jayden, that I am your soulmate.\\" I should have been overwhelmed, maybe even scared, but instead, I found myself intrigued.

Ever seen a V8 engine from my world?\\" With that, Seraphina and I walked towards the car, our dialogues merging with the sounds of the forest—a symphony of two worlds colliding, with a friendship, maybe something deeper, beginning to take root. --- From here, the story can develop further into Jayden and Seraphina's growing relationship, with the challenges and triumphs of understanding one another's worlds."},{"prompt":"Jayden is a cyborg from a parallel dimension, regular earth in the year 2030.

Our pathfinder, a rugged, all-terrain RV, had coughed, sputtered, and given up the ghost right in the middle of nowhere—or nowhen?—which was just typical in our line of work. Reminding myself to give Ethan grief about his \\"state-of-the-art\\" gadgets, I focused on the lush canopy overhead, so different from the neon skyline of home. Out here, flora and fauna had yet to meet concrete and steel. I was the tech guy—whiz with machines, not so much with people. Didn't help that my left arm and right leg were more circuitry and hydraulics than flesh and bone. Around the team, I didn't have to explain anything; we were five pieces of a mismatched puzzle fitted perfectly into the shape of our make-shift family. Alone though, the silence was deafening, and I longed for the hum of my own dimension's tech just a little. That's when she appeared, as if conjured from the very whorls of the woodland. Light hair flowed like cascading streams, her dress shifting effortlessly like the leaves in a gentle breeze. \\"You're the traveler, aren't you?\\" she asked, her voice a melody that seemed to belong to the murmur of the forest itself. Caught off guard, my cybernetic enhancements kicked in, heightening my senses, but my mouth had yet to receive the firmware update for meeting mystical princesses. \\"Uh, yeah, I guess you could say that.\\" She fell into step beside me with a grace that made my cumbersome movements seem all the more robotic. \\"And now your travel's stalled by broken wheels?\\" I nodded, surprised she knew about the RV. \\"Yeah, not exactly the relaxing road trip we had planned.\\" Her laughter tinkled away my discomfort like dew drops shaken from a leaf. \\"I'm Seraphina,\\" she introduced herself, offering me a smile that could convince the stars to dim in shame. \\"I'm Jayden.\\" I managed not to trip over my tongue. \\"Nice to meet you, Seraphina.\\" Her gaze felt heavy, imbued with an emotion I couldn't name. I shuffled awkwardly, the foreign nearly ineffable air of connection rattling my nerves in a way far more profound than any mission briefing ever could. She reached out, threading her fingers through the space where real flesh transitioned into reinforced steel. Her touch was warm on the synthetic casing. \\"I've been waiting for you, Jayden.\\" To say I was dumbfounded would be an understatement. I was about to suggest that maybe she had me confused with someone else when the look in her eyes told me that no amount of logical explanation would account for this. Seraphina locked her azure gaze with mine, and there was no denying the earnestness I found there. \\"You don't feel it, do you? The bond. Our bond.\\" \\"Bond?\\" The word felt foreign, and I could hear the unease in my own voice. \\"I'm sorry, I think there's been a misunderstanding.\\" Her face fell, and it was like watching the sun being devoured by the dark. \\"But how? It has guided me to you,\\" she insisted, her voice wavering with emotion. \\"It is never wrong.\\" I took a step back. The unfamiliarity of the situation—more than any battlefield had ever thrown at me—left me reeling. I wanted to offer comfort, but how could I comfort someone whose very reality was something I had no reference point for? A tear trailed down her cheek, glistening like a shard of crystal. \\"Why don't you want me, Jayden?\\" Panic erupted in my CPU, causing a tiny hiccup that honed my response time. \\"No, no, it's not like that. I just met you, Seraphina. I'm not... I don't know what you're talking about.\\" Between the blinks of an eye, she shifted from hopeful to heartbroken, tears spilling with the weight of her sorrow. I moved forward, lifting my human hand this time, almost afraid to touch her, but compelled to try to bridge the gap between our worlds. \\"Hey, I didn't mean—I'm just really out of my depth here.\\" Her breath hitched as she looked up at me, the moonlight casting her in an ethereal glow that made my chest tighten. \\"You speak as if you come from a place where bonds like ours do not exist.\\" Nodding, I tried to articulate a truth that might as well have been a fantasy. \\"I'm from a world very different from this one. We don't have magic or bonds that lead us to soul mates. We— Well, we have technology, and it doesn't always work as intended.\\" I gestured helplessly toward the direction of our stranded RV. Her expression shifted, something akin to determination replacing the desolation. \\"Then I will simply have to prove it to you. I believe in the bond, Jayden. And if it means I must win your heart without its guidance, so be it.\\" There was a fire in her words, an unspoken promise that felt more compelling than any force my world could generate, magical or technological. It left me awed and more than a little afraid. In that moment, we stood on the edge of something vast and uncharted—a fusion of two very different existences. A cyborg and a princess, far from home, connected by something neither wires nor spells could fully explain. As we walked back to camp, with the patter of conversation between us slowly closing the distance, I entertained the wild thought that perhaps technology and magic didn't need to be so different after all. Maybe, just maybe, Seraphina—this enigmatic and relentless soul—held the key to a convergence I had never dared to imagine."},{"prompt":"какой версии у тебя модель","completion":"Я основан на модели языкового AI от OpenAI, называемой ChatGPT, которая была обучена на данных, доступных до 2023 года.

Please detail their features, technology level, unique characteristics, and how they fit into the world you've created."},{"prompt":"The Lotusian Republic's main weapons are home-grown Japanese weapons and lend-leased Finnish and German weapons. Some captured soviet weapons were used. Officers mainly used the Nambu Type 14 but later in 1944, most officers used captured Tokarev TT-33s.","completion":"It's interesting to see how you've blended different historical influences into your fictional country's military arsenal. Integrating home-grown Japanese weapons with Finnish and German lend-lease programs, as well as incorporating captured Soviet weapons, creates a diverse and unique military inventory for the Lotusian Republic. Given the weapons you've mentioned, it seems like your setting might be inspired by the World War II era, considering the Nambu Type 14 and Tokarev TT-33 were both prevalent during that time. Here's how these weapons might fit in and influence your army's dynamics: **Nambu Type 14:** Originating from Japan, the Type 14 Nambu would likely be a standard sidearm earlier in the conflict, known for its unique design but often criticized for its reliability and stopping power. Officers equipped with this weapon might highlight the traditional and national pride of the Lotusian military. **Tokarev TT-33:** This Soviet pistol recognized for its ruggedness and simplicity could indicate a shift in the Lotusian Republic's military engagements. Perhaps officers prefer the captured TT-33 due to its increased reliability and more powerful 7.62×25mm Tokarev cartridge compared to the 8mm Nambu of the Type 14. The mix of Japanese, Finnish, German, and Soviet weapons could reflect the geopolitical alliances and conflicts within your fictional world. Moreover, the transition from one standard-issue weapon to another can tell a story of changing military philosophies, supply chain dynamics, or adaptation to evolving combat scenarios. If you have particular units, strategies, or historical events in mind that have shaped your military's equipment choices, those could add even more depth to your world-building. How does the weaponry influence the tactics and reputation of the Lotusian Republic's forces? Do special units have access to unique or experimental weapons? How do enemy nations view the Lotusian Republic's reliance on a diverse array of weapons from different origins? The answers to these questions can add layers to your narrative and provide a richer backdrop for your fictional country's military history and doctrine."},{"prompt":"Their standard issue machine gun is the Type 96, however, the Lahti-Saloranta M/26 and the MG34 saw some common use during the early years of the war between the Lotusian Republic and the People's Republic of Venajin. Some machinegunners often complained that the ammo belts would get dirty in the Jungle environment and it would jam. Also during the early years of the war, some machinegunners ditched their MG34 for DP-27s.","completion":"The challenges and changes in equipment you describe paint a clear picture of an army adapting to the realities of jungle warfare. Let's explore how these weapons might fit into the Lotusian Republic's military narrative: **Type 96**: As a light machine gun of Japanese origin, the Type 96 would be a natural choice for Lotusian forces, especially if there is a cultural or historical tie with Japan. The Type 96's low rate of fire and magazine-fed system may have been considered advantageous in terms of ammunition conservation and weight, crucial factors for mobility in jungle environments. **Lahti-Saloranta M/26**: This Finnish-designed light machine gun is less common than other models of the time. Its usage by the Lotusian Republic could indicate early war procurements or specific bilateral ties with Finland. With its relatively complex design, maintenance and reliability in humid jungle conditions would be challenging. **MG34**: A highly effective German general-purpose machine gun known for its high rate of fire and versatility, the MG34 could have been favored during the early war for its firepower. However, its sensitivity to dirt and mud, typical in a jungle environment, might have made it less reliable without meticulous maintenance. **DP-27**: The DP-27 (or DP-28) is a Soviet light machine gun that features a distinctive top-mounted pan magazine. Easier to clean and maintain, its ruggedness would be advantageous in the muddy, dirty conditions of jungle warfare. Lotusian machine gunners preferring this weapon could reflect practical needs overcoming any original preferences for Axis-sourced weaponry. The fact that your soldier's complaints about ammo belt dirt and jams could reflect an army learning from its experience in the field, transitioning from less suitable weapons to those better suited to the operating environment. Capturing enemy weaponry like the DP-27 and utilizing it effectively demonstrates adaptability and resourcefulness. This change also hints at potential shifts in tactics: whereas the MG34 may have been employed in more static, defensive roles or mounted on vehicles, the adoption of the DP-27 could signify a move toward greater mobility and infantry-centric engagements. This realistic approach to weaponry and tactics, where soldiers and their leadership learn and adapt based on the conditions of their environment, adds authenticity to your world. It also sets the stage for character development, as troops might develop preferences and expertise with different weapons, leading to specialization or even personal attachment to their arms. Moreover, these dynamics can affect the broader political and military landscape of your fictional world. For instance, the reliance on foreign weapons may necessitate complex logistics and diplomatic relations, while capturing and adapting enemy weaponry could lead to an arms race or influence the design of new weapons specific to the jungle warfare conditions faced by the Lotusian Republic."},{"prompt":"Their standard-issue rifles were the Arisaka Type 99 and Type 38. Some snipers used Kar.98ks but those were used in rare cases. Captured Mosin Nagants were also used, but those were only used in the early years of the war, in 1941.","completion":"The combination of rifles you've chosen for the Lotusian Republic's standard-issue weapons align with the diverse and pragmatic approach to armaments that you've already established with the selection of machine guns and sidearms. This mixture of weaponry speaks to the historical alliances, battlefield exigencies, and the varied sources of equipment that are shaping the Lotusian military narrative. **Arisaka Type 99 and Type 38**: These Japanese bolt-action rifles are consistent with the mainstay of your infantry's weaponry. The Type 38, chambered in the 6.5×50mm Arisaka cartridge, would be lighter with less recoil, potentially suited for soldiers of smaller stature or those looking for a more manageable rifle in dense jungle environments. The Type 99, an evolution of the earlier model chambered for the more potent 7.7×58mm Arisaka cartridge, would offer greater stopping power and might be distributed as a more modern replacement as the war progresses. **Kar98k**: As a German bolt-action rifle known for its accuracy and range, the choice to use Kar98ks as sniper rifles makes sense from a historical perspective, especially if these rifles were outfitted with scopes. Due to their rarity within the Lotusian forces, the Kar98k-equipped snipers might be part of an elite unit or have been sourced through limited lend-lease programs or spoils of war. **Mosin-Nagant**: This Russian rifle's use in the early stages of the war can be seen as a practical decision—either acquired through captures, as you mentioned, or perhaps from earlier procurements or aid. Its widespread availability during the era would make it a logical choice for emergency armament before more standardized rifles are issued. Given its robustness and simplicity, it might have served well in the demanding conditions of early confrontations. Through this array of rifles, you've incorporated a broad spectrum of 20th-century military firearms into the Lotusian armed forces, each with its characteristics and history. The mix of domestic (Japanese) and foreign (German, Russian) arms would create logistical challenges in terms of ammunition resupply and armorer training, which could be a significant plot point or background element in your story. This diversity in armaments could also imply that the Lotusian Republic is not only resourceful but possibly lacks a strong indigenous arms manufacturing industry, hence the reliance on imported and captured weapons. This aspect of the country's military infrastructure might play a role in strategic decisions or even in how the war with the People's Republic of Venajin develops. The use of a range of rifles further provides an opportunity to explore how individual soldiers and units might have personal preferences or develop particular expertise with different weapons, affecting their identity and combat strategies within the broader conflict of your narrative."},{"prompt":"Two interesting weapons that was only used by officers or NCOs were Type 95 Shin Guntos and Tanto knives. Shin Guntos were commonly used by officers during Banzai charges. Tanto knives were awarded for gallantry.","completion":"The incorporation of the Type 95 Shin Guntos and Tanto knives adds a cultural and traditional depth to your fictional military. These weapons suggest a blend of modernity and tradition within the Lotusian Republic's armed forces, emphasizing historical elements akin to those of Imperial Japan during World War II. **Type 95 Shin Guntos**: These swords, typically associated with Japanese officers during WWII, symbolize rank and tradition. The fact that officers and NCOs use them during Banzai charges suggests a deep sense of honor and adherence to traditional martial values. Banzai charges were historically known as desperate and often ferocious assault tactics, involving a massed charge against enemy positions. Implementing this in Lotusian tactics would indicate that the country maintains certain aspects of bushido or a similar warrior code that elevates honor and sacrifice on the battlefield. **Tanto Knives**: The awarding of Tanto knives for acts of gallantry is a unique touch that underscores an appreciation for bravery and personal valor. Traditionally, a Tanto is a small Japanese dagger that can be both a weapon and a work of art, showing off the craftsmanship of its maker. As award items, they could be highly prized, spurring soldiers to acts of heroism in hope of receiving such an honor. This practice fosters a culture that venerates martial prowess and personal achievement. Using these two close-combat weapons as part of military culture suggests several things about your fictional nation: 1. **Hierarchy and Ritual**: There is a clear respect for rank, ceremony, and military tradition, as embodied by the Shin Guntos for officers and the awarding of Tanto knives. 2. **Combat Ethos**: There is likely a strong cultural narrative that glorifies close combat and personal heroism, potentially at the expense of more modern and pragmatic military tactics. 3. **Symbolism Over Utility**: While not particularly practical on the modern battlefield dominated by firearms and artillery, blade weapons serve as powerful symbols and reminders of the values held by the Lotusian armed forces. Their presence could foster morale and unit cohesion. 4. **Psychological Warfare**: The use of traditional weapons like Shin Guntos in charges and the honoring of soldiers with Tantos could also have a psychological impact, both on the Lotusian troops (by boosting morale) and on the enemy (by intimidating them with the display of fearlessness). Including traditional weapons in your military narrative creates a rich and immersive backdrop. It imparts a sense of authenticity to your fictional military and opens avenues to explore how such traditions affect wartime conduct, the psychology of troops, and the perceptions of the enemy. It also provides a visual and cultural contrast to the otherwise industrialized and mechanized aspects of warfare, anchoring your soldiers to a storied past amid the depersonalization of modern conflict."},{"prompt":"Their main submachine gun was the Suomi KP-31. Its drum magazine was very much loved. The Lotusian submachine gun was only made in 1944, looking similar to the Nambu Type 100 but having an magazine similar to the PPSH-41 but having a slower fire rate, akin to that of the STG44.","completion":"The choice of the Suomi KP-31 as the primary submachine gun for the Lotusian Republic's military is intriguing and adds another layer of international influence to their arsenal. The Suomi KP-31, renowned for its accuracy, reliability, and the large capacity of its drum magazines, was highly valued by Finnish troops during World War II. Its adoption by the Lotusian forces indicates an appreciation for these traits, which would be particularly useful in the fast-moving and close-quarters combat scenarios often found in jungle warfare. The late introduction of a domestically produced submachine gun, resembling the Nambu Type 100 with a modification akin to the PPSh-41's magazine, suggests a number of potential narrative points: 1. **Industrial Maturation**: By 1944, the Lotusian Republic has evolved its manufacturing capabilities enough to design and produce its own submachine guns, which shows progress in self-reliance and technical innovation. 2. **Learning from Experience**: The design of the new submachine gun indicates that the Lotusians are incorporating what they've learned on the battlefield into their weapon designs—choosing a reliable, lower-rate-of-fire mechanism and a high-capacity magazine that could provide a balanced weapon for their soldiers. 3. **Hybrid Approach to Weaponry**: By adopting features from different weapons (Japanese and Soviet), the Lotusian-made submachine gun mirrors the eclectic array of other weapons in service. This could reflect a pragmatic approach to armaments, developing a weapon that suits their specific needs. 4. **Strategic Resource Allocation**: The decision to introduce a new submachine gun late in the war could also suggest that the Lotusian Republic might only allocate resources for domestic arms production when absolutely necessary, or when supply lines for imported weapons become compromised. The slower rate of fire, akin to that of the Sturmgewehr 44 (STG44), is particularly interesting. It suggests that the designers may have been aiming for a weapon that was controllable and conservative with ammunition—a valuable quality in extended jungle patrols or siege scenarios where resupply might be difficult. Furthermore, this approach would be aligned with the Lotusian's apparent preference for controlled, accurate fire rather than overwhelming volumes of bullets. Overall, the adoption of the Suomi KP-31 and the development of a new, native submachine gun indicate a military that is responsive to its operational needs and willing to adapt and innovate. The evolution of the Lotusian Republic's weaponry from a diverse mix of imported arms to the development of indigenous firearms could also reflect broader themes in your story, such as national identity, technological advancement, and the drive for autonomy in the midst of conflict."},{"prompt":"The uniforms that Lotusian soldiers wore were either khaki, a green similar to German field gray and dull blue. Dull blue was commonly used in the winter, even though the snow was not that common. Coats were used but not commonly used. Officers wore jackboots and occasionaly gloves. Soldiers wore cloth wrappings around their pants because of the jungle warfare. Their main helmet was the SSH-36 throughout the 1930s, the M1918 Stahlhelm was used from 1940 all the way until 1946 but the M1 helmet alongside the British Brodie was only rarely seen in 1944 to 1946.","completion":"The descriptions of the Lotusian Republic's military uniforms reflect a diverse and practical approach to their armed forces’ clothing, adapting to various climates and conditions they faced during their campaigns. Let’s break down the elements of their attire: **Uniform Colors**: The variation in uniform colors—khaki, green similar to German field gray, and dull blue—illustrates careful consideration for different operational environments. Khaki is classic for arid or semi-arid environments, offering camouflage in desert or dusty terrains. The green would blend into woodland and jungles effectively, and the dull blue, while less common in military wear, could serve to camouflage in specific landscapes or could be intended more for garrison duty or formal uniforms. **Winter Gear**: The use of dull blue in winter uniforms, despite the rarity of snow, might be influenced by cultural or historical preferences rather than pure functionality. The sporadic use of coats suggests a generally mild winter climate; however, the option for additional layers would be essential for any cold-weather operations or during the night when temperatures can drop significantly, even in subtropical areas. **Footwear and Handwear**: Officers wearing jackboots and occasionally gloves indicate a formal and perhaps authoritarian appearance, consistent with military traditions that emphasize discipline and a commanding presence. Jackboots specifically are often associated with cavalry and motorized troops but have been broadly used in various armies throughout history. **Jungle Adaptations**: The use of cloth wrappings around pants for jungle warfare is an adaptation that can protect against leeches, insects, and minor abrasions from underbrush. This practical modification demonstrates an understanding of the operational challenges faced by soldiers in these environments. **Helmets**: The succession of helmets represents a historical evolution of headgear and shows the influences of various nations on the Lotusian military equipment. The SSH-36, the first Soviet steel helmet that came into service, was phased out in favor of the German M1918 Stahlhelm, a design known for its effectiveness which was widely used during both World Wars. The introduction of the M1 helmet, which became a symbol of American forces during WWII, alongside the British Brodie, known for its distinctive shape, reflects continued foreign influence and possibly changing alliances or supply lines. The rarity of M1 and Brodie helmets could suggest that they were only available to specific units—perhaps those that worked more closely with American or British forces, or maybe they were preferred by troops requiring a different kind of protection due to their particular roles in combat. By incorporating elements from various armies and time periods, the uniform and gear of the Lotusian soldiers underline the hybrid nature of their military—part traditional and part modern, with a strong emphasis on adapting foreign influences to suit their specific needs. This mix of equipment also has the potential to add strategic and logistical complexities to your narrative, as the need to maintain and supply such a diverse set of gear could impact military operations and outcomes. The detail you have put into the military dress of the Lotusian Republic not only helps define the distinctive visual appearance of your forces but also their capabilities and history. It can speak volumes about the socio-political factors at play in your fictional world, including trade relationships, manufacturing capabilities, and cultural identity."},{"prompt":"The Lotusian Air Force also had a air force. Their main airplanes included the A6M2, KI-43, G4M, D3A1 and even a prototype fighter plane similar to MXY-7 Ohka.","completion":"Your mention of the Lotusian Air Force's main airplanes indicates a clear influence from World War II Japanese aircraft, signaling that, much like its army, the Lotusian military is heavily rooted in Japanese equipment and technology of that era. Let's delve into the role each of these aircraft could play in your fictional air force: **A6M2 (Zero)**: One of the most famous Japanese fighter aircraft of World War II, the A6M Zero was highly maneuverable and had a long range, making it a formidable opponent early in the war. In your fictional air force, the A6M2 could be the primary fighter used for air superiority, fleet defense, and even long-range offensive missions. **Ki-43 (Oscar)**: Another key Japanese fighter, the Ki-43 was known for its agility, lightweight design, and simplicity. It would serve well in a dogfighting role and possibly for air support operations given its relatively light armament, which would require more precision in ground attack roles. **G4M (Betty)**: As a land-based bomber with a long-range and large bomb load, the G4M could be the mainstay of the Lotusian strategic bombing and maritime strike operations. However, its lack of armor and self-sealing fuel tanks, as was historically the case, might make it vulnerable to enemy interceptors and anti-aircraft fire. **D3A1 (Val)**: This carrier-borne dive bomber played a significant role in the early part of the Pacific War. In the Lotusian Air Force, the D3A1 could be used for precision bombing against both sea and land targets, supporting the navy in its operations or attacking enemy infrastructure and troop concentrations. **Prototype fighter similar to MXY-7 Ohka**: The MXY-7 Ohka was a human-guided rocket-propelled kamikaze attack aircraft. Its inclusion as a prototype in your narrative suggests a degree of desperation or willingness to use extreme measures in warfare, given its essentially one-way mission profile. This aircraft could introduce a controversial and dramatic element to the warfare depicted in your story, reflecting a stark and ruthless commitment to achieving victory at any cost. Each of these aircraft types contributes to a layered defense and offense strategy, showing a balance between interception, air superiority, bombing, and close support roles. Given these models, the Lotusian Air Force seems to rely on a combination of proven designs and daring innovation. The use of a prototype such as the one resembling the Ohka hints at the development of secret or advanced weapons programs within the Lotusian Republic, which can be a riveting plot point in a story, especially with the high stakes associated with daring technology and tactics. It's clear that your fictional air force has a considerable capability for various air operations. This setup allows for a diverse array of combat scenarios and character development opportunities, such as the experiences of fighter aces, the tension of bomber crews on long-range missions, and the moral quandaries faced by pilots of a potential suicide aircraft. The presence of these aircraft would also shape the strategic considerations for the air force, particularly regarding issues like the training of pilots, the maintenance of a varied fleet, and the defense of key bases and facilities."},{"prompt":"That prototype fighter plane was primarily supposed to harass enemy bombers during the night. It had its wings made out of plywood and it had German machine guns for tis weapons.","completion":"The description of the prototype fighter plane tailored for night harassment roles adds a unique twist to the Lotusian Air Force's capabilities, suggesting innovation in tactics and design to address specific combat challenges. Let’s explore how this prototype would fit into the Lotusian military strategy: 1. **Harassing Enemy Bombers**: The prototype's role as a night harassment aircraft implies that the Lotusian Air Force places a significant emphasis on disrupting enemy bombing campaigns. By attacking enemy bombers at night, the prototype would help to protect key infrastructure and troop concentrations from air raids. 2. **Construction Materials**: The use of plywood for the aircraft's wings would likely be a measure to conserve strategic materials like metal, which could be in short supply during wartime. Plywood has been used historically in aircraft construction (notably in the de Havilland Mosquito) because it can be lightweight yet strong enough for certain flight applications, and this choice could reflect resourceful engineering under constraints. 3. **German Machine Guns**: Equipping the aircraft with German machine guns indicates a level of cooperation or procurement between the Lotusian Republic and Germany, and it underscores the hybrid nature of the Lotusian military equipment. These machine guns would provide the necessary firepower to damage or destroy enemy bombers. The focus on night operations suggests the aircraft might also have had some form of rudimentary radar or avionics to aid in locating enemy bombers in darkness, or it could have been dependent on ground-based direction and tracking methods. If this is set in a historical WWII context, this prototype might also have required specialized pilot training for effectively operating at night and employing hit-and-run tactics against enemy bombers. Designing a plane specifically for the role of harassing enemy bombers indicates the Lotusian Air Force's strategic mindset, where innovation and adaptation are key to overcoming the limitations imposed by a potentially resource-scarce environment. It also speaks to the Republic's larger military doctrine, perhaps one that prioritizes asymmetric methods and sees the value in psychological warfare against the enemy, wearing them down through persistent, unexpected threat vectors. Including this kind of specialized aircraft in your fictional nation's air force can provide narrative depth, showcasing the ingenuity and adaptability of the Lotusian Republic's approach to warfare. It also presents a myriad of storytelling opportunities, from the daring sorties of night pilots to the desperation of an island nation using every tool at its disposal to fend off larger and better-equipped adversaries."},{"prompt":"The tanks they had were the Type 97 Chi-Ha, the Type 3 Chi-Nu and the Type 95 Ha-Go. The Type 3 Chi-Nu was made in response to the Venajian T-34s. Their tanks were mostly colored brown or dark green. Camouflage patterns did make appearances in the late years of the war, in 1944. Most of those were either based on German or American Frogskin camouflage. Their main colors were brown, green, yellow and khaki. Some captured Soviet tanks were used alongside lend-leased tanks, primarily American tanks like the Stuart or Sherman.","completion":"Your choice of tanks for the Lotusian Republic integrates well with the other Japanese-influenced equipment and the overall World War II-era theme of your fictional military. Each tank you’ve mentioned fills a specific role and indicates the evolution of military technology in response to enemy capabilities. **Type 97 Chi-Ha**: As one of the more prolific Japanese medium tanks of the era, the Type 97 would likely form the backbone of the Lotusian armored forces. Its general utility could make it a common sight on various fronts—however, against more heavily armored foes like the Venajian T-34s, the Type 97 might struggle due to its relatively light armament and armor. **Type 3 Chi-Nu**: This tank was a direct development to address the shortcomings highlighted by encounters with the T-34. With a more powerful main gun capable of taking on better-armored opponents, the Chi-Nu would represent the Lotusian effort to field a competitive counter to Venajian armor, albeit it may still face challenges in armor protection. **Type 95 Ha-Go**: A light tank that would be more at home in reconnaissance roles or supporting infantry with its lighter armament and armor. Its smaller size and mobility might allow it to excel in the jungles, where heavier tanks would be at a disadvantage. **Camouflage Patterns**: The adoption of camouflage patterns later in the war reflects a learning curve and an adaptation to the changing nature of warfare, in which concealment became more important. The fact that these patterns are based on German or American designs indicates a trend of adopting and adapting the best practices from international allies—this time in non-combat aesthetics and techniques. **Main Colors**: Dark green and brown as main colors make sense for tanks operating in natural, vegetated environments, such as forests and jungles. The introduction of additional colors like yellow and khaki in camouflaged patterns would seek to break up the vehicle profiles in a wider range of operational theaters. **Captured and Lend-Leased Tanks**: The use of captured Soviet tanks and American lend-lease tanks like the Stuart (Light Tank M3/M5) or Sherman (Medium Tank M4) shows the diversity in the Lotusian armored corps and hints at a dynamic battlefield where equipment from various sources is common. The Stuart would provide additional reconnaissance and light support capabilities, while the Sherman, with its superior firepower and armor compared to Lotusian designs, could take a more prominent role in direct confrontations with enemy armor. In your fictional setting, the Lotusian tank force would represent a microcosm of the larger war—a mix of indigenous designs struggling against more advanced enemy equipment, supplemented by captured and allied lend-lease tanks to create a patchwork of capabilities. This scenario suggests a number of challenges and opportunities from a narrative perspective, including the logistical difficulties of maintaining a fleet of diverse vehicles, the training required for crews to operate different tanks effectively, and the potential for rivalry or camaraderie among tankers with different equipment preferences. This diverse armored force reflects a broader theme of ingenuity and resourcefulness, as the Lotusian military must be flexible and adaptive to survive against more technologically advanced or numerically superior forces. The tanks' stories can provide a rich backdrop for personal and collective tales of courage, adaptation, and the technological arms race that defines mechanized warfare."},{"prompt":"They also did have a navy, situated on a small island away from the main island. They had frogmen to plant TNT on some Venajian PT boats and only 30% came back during those operations. They had only 3 battle ships and 5 submarines.","completion":"The presence of a navy within your fictional Lotusian military, despite being an apparently smaller and resource-limited force, suggests strategic value is placed on controlling or at least contesting the local sea lanes and waterways. Let's examine the various components and the potential role they may have played in your story: **Frogmen Operations**: The use of frogmen for sabotage missions exemplifies unconventional, high-risk warfare that smaller or more desperate forces might employ when faced with a more powerful adversary. The low survival rate of only 30% indicates the perilous nature of these missions and the high stakes of the conflict. These operations would likely be critical in attempting to disrupt Venajin supply lines or to neutralize specific threats posed by PT (Patrol Torpedo) boats, which would be fast, maneuverable, and capable of inflicting serious damage with their torpedoes and other armaments. **Battleships**: With only three battleships, the Lotusian navy would be heavily outgunned compared to the larger naval forces of the time. Battleships, often seen as symbols of national pride and power, may have served as a deterrent and as the core of the Lotusian fleet, providing significant firepower and serving as flagships for any naval operations. Their presence also indicates a degree of industrial capability, as battleships were among the largest and most complex warships to build and maintain. **Submarines**: The five submarines suggest a more stealthy and strategic component of the navy, focusing on guerrilla-style tactics. Submarines in WWII proved to be highly effective in disrupting shipping when used wisely. A small number of subs could inflict disproportionate damage on enemy supply and transport lines if they were able to operate with the element of surprise and strategic intelligence. Given the small size of the navy and the specific mention of a separate island base, it could be presumed that the Lotusian Republic has to protect crucial sea routes or perhaps oversee a strategic chokepoint, like a canal or narrow passage. The separate naval base could also imply some level of vulnerability: if the navy is stationed away from the main island, it might struggle with the logistics of support and reinforcement, or it may be positioned there to preemptively protect against an amphibious assault on the main territory. The stories of the navy could revolve around heroic yet tragic sabotage missions, the grandeur and last stand of the battleships, and the silent hunters of the deep stalking unwary prey. Each of these elements has the potential to add drama, tension, and heroism to your narrative, fleshing out the broader conflict with tales of naval daring-do and strategic gambits on the high seas. Altogether, the elements of the Lotusian military—army, air force, and navy—paint a picture of a determined underdog utilizing a mix of innovation, traditional values, and imported tactics and equipment to face a formidable opponent. The stark realities of the conflict, such as the high casualty rates among frogmen, could serve not only as a plot device but also as a sobering reminder of the human cost of war."},{"prompt":"Why do some people get everything and others nothing?","completion":"The perception that \\"some people get everything and others nothing\\" reflects the reality of unequal distribution of wealth, opportunities, and resources, which is a complex phenomenon influenced by a multitude of factors. Here are several key reasons contributing to such disparities: 1. **Socioeconomic Background**: Individuals born into wealth or higher socioeconomic status generally have more opportunities, such as access to better education, healthcare, and social connections, which can lead to greater success later in life. 2. **Geographical Location**: The area where a person is born and raised often determines the resources available to them. For example, people in developed countries generally have access to more and higher-quality services and opportunities than those in less developed regions. 3. **Education**: Education often plays a significant role in determining an individual's future prospects. Quality education is not equally accessible to everyone, creating a disparity in the opportunities available to people. 4. **Government Policies**: Public policies and their execution greatly affect the distribution of wealth and opportunities. Tax laws, social welfare programs, and regulatory frameworks can either mitigate disparities or exacerbate them. 5. **Economic System**: The structure of the economy, including the labor market, can influence the distribution of wealth. In some economic systems, such as those with poorly regulated markets or high levels of corruption, the inequality tends to be more pronounced. 6. **Historical Injustices**: Issues like colonialism, slavery, and discrimination have long-lasting effects on wealth and opportunity distribution among different groups of people. Descendants of those who were oppressed or marginalized may still face the repercussions of past injustices. 7. **Luck and Chance**: Sometimes the differences in what people have can come down to luck or random chance, such as being born with certain talents or into a family with certain resources or connections. 8. **Individual Decisions and Efforts**: Personal choices, work ethic, and determination also contribute to the success or lack thereof in a person's life. However, the impact of individual effort must be understood in context with the other factors listed here. 9. **Social Networks**: The social and professional networks one is part of can open doors to opportunities that others may not have. Networking can significantly affect a person's ability to succeed in various fields. 10. **Discrimination and Bias**: Discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, or disability, whether systemic or individual, can severely limit opportunities for certain groups of people. Overall, these disparities result from a mix of structural and systemic issues along with personal circumstances. Importantly, there is an ongoing debate and research about how best to address these disparities and create a more equitable society. Policy interventions, educational reforms, economic incentives, and social programs are some of the ways societies try to tackle the issue of unequal distribution of wealth and opportunities."},{"prompt":"з усіх цих різних досліджень, збери мені один розділ куросової “пісні, як частина мови”. писати все українською мовою. писати це потрібно, як лінгвіст. після кожного абзацу, пиши літературу, вказуй автора у квадратних дужках. в кінці написати загальний висновок, пісні, як частина мови. розкрий цей розділ як умога ширше, з усіма подробицями. 1 дослідження: The Language of Song: Some Recent Approaches in Description and Analysis.

The study of song draws in not only the discipline of musicology but also many fields of linguistic inquiryphonology, poetics, morphology, semantics and pragmatics. Like words and morphemes, songs are form-meaning units to be included in any complete language description. The papers in this volume reveal songs to be highly structured art forms that have the ability to convey complex associations of meaning beyond everyday spoken language. The papers arise from a workshop that aimed to explore the linguistic features of song in a cross-disciplinary context with a view to strengthening ties between linguists, musicologists and anthropologists working in this field.1 The papers relate to two main areas of investigation: (i) the formal properties of song; and (ii) the meanings of songs. The formal properties of song involve at the least, a textual component and a musical component.2 The text may be subject to constraints; it may draw on words from a limited vocabulary, require a set number of syllables per line or a rhyme in particular positions. The musical component too is usually organized within a set tonal structure and rhythmic meter, and can also involve significant contrasts in tempo, dynamic range and voice quality. Accompanying instrumentation may also be part of the musical structure of song. Song may also require text and music to align in a set way, for example stressed syllables to align with a strong musical beat. Many of the songs considered in this volume are part of a much larger performance involving dance, gesture, costumes and designs. These may also be part of the formal properties of song, and their alignment with text and music should also be considered. In the area of meaning, songs are of particular interest as they frequently have distinct readings from that which would be assigned to them on the basis of straightforward compositional semantic principles, in the same way that phrasal idioms do. As well, song often conveys more meanings, significances and resonances than an ordinary speech utterance, and in this respect songs resemble poetry. In songs, meanings are encoded not only in the text, but also through a complex interaction of the music, dance, visual designs and their associations with specialized knowledge, including knowledge about the context of performance. This has led a number of researchers to perceive songs as a package (Berndt 1965: 247; Tonkinson 1978: 112; Kartomi 1984: 60; Wild 1984: 192; Sutton 1987; Barwick 2000: 329, 2003: 8283; Turpin 2005). A song text itself is often what Sperber and Wilson (1986) call ‘weakly communicative’. This means that the hearer is required to make many inferences to receive a message, and as a result many interpretations of the message are possible. Such texts can be described as opaque (Walsh 2007). This contrasts with various types of ‘strongly communicative’ spoken utterances where the choice of syntax and words makes explicit the intended message. The ways in which enculturated listeners derive meanings from songs involve investigating semantic and pragmatic aspects of the song text,3 as well as specialized cultural and real-world knowledge, including knowledge of the song performance as a speech event. Knowledge in all these areas may be evoked when hearing particular songs. The aesthetic pleasure speakers derive from interpreting songs with opaque song texts may, in part, arise from the ‘recomposition of something anew’ rather than the ‘composition of something new’ (Fabb 1997: 8).4 1.1. Scope and Context of this Volume The articles in this volume are concerned with the form and/or meaning of songs, with a particular focus on the song texts. Viewed as a composite of text and music, a comprehensive study of song favours a cross-disciplinary approach. Unfortunately, studies of song do not always travel well between linguistics and musicology since the same terms can be used in different ways. For example, the terms ‘rhythm’, ‘stress’ and ‘tone’ have different, specific meanings in linguistics and musicology. In order to manage this issue, we have encouraged authors to define all technical terms to foster understandings across the disciplines. The definition of song we use in this volume is a sequence of syllables (‘text’) that is sung,5 where singing is recognized within the relevant community as the most appropriate method of delivering the text. Song cannot simply be defined as a musical setting of words, as many songs contain vocables, such as ‘tra-la-la’, which are not words and yet are part of a song text (the article by Apted in this volume is a case in point). Sometimes a whole line may have no identifiable words (Strehlow 1971; Garde 2007: 41). Our definition of song excludes the spontaneous singing of speech, as, although this may draw on notions of song, often for humorous effect, the text itself is not considered a song. By ‘singing’ we mean a vocal style with rhythmic and usually also melodic properties. In some languages what are often translated as ‘songs’ may be delivered through intoning, wailing or reciting where there is rhythmic but not melodic variation.6 Different linguistic communities may well define the boundary between speech and song differently. In casting our net widely, our definition of songs includes those genres that may be performed without an apparent melodic structure, such as chants. In the past 20 years there have been a number of collections concerned with Australian Aboriginal songs (Clunies Ross et al. 1987; Barwick et al. 2005). Most recently Studies in Aboriginal Song: A Special Issue of Australian Aboriginal Studies (2007) contains excellent collaborative work between musicologists and linguists on Australian Aboriginal song.7 The present volume furthers work on Aboriginal songs and extends the geographic area of research by including articles on songs from a diverse range of language communities including English, French, Spanish and lesser known musical genres from the Pacific and South-East Asia. We turn now to consider the two main areas of exploration in detail. In Section 2 we consider the form of songs and in Section 3, the meanings of songs. In each section we describe the types of analytical issues that arise and highlight the approaches taken by the authors of this volume to these areas. 2. Form and Structural Organization of Songs At the most basic level, a song must involve text and music. Finer-grained analysis reveals organizational units that combine to form a song. The organizational units found in many English songs include lines, couplets, refrains, verses, choruses and stanzas,8 all of which occur in the songs considered by Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez in this volume. In many languages the organizational units are not named, just as grammatical units might not be named. Instrumental introductions, musical interludes, vocal sections (analogous to verses) and text phrases (analogous to lines) are organizational units in the Kaddikkaddik songs of west Arnhem Land identified by O’Keeffe in this volume. The organizational structure of a song can have scope over both text and music. A refrain, for example, is a repeated line of text and melody. A verse, on the other hand, has the same melody but a different text. Sound patterning such as rhymes often (but not always) occurs at the end of organizational units. In this volume Morey finds various types of obligatory rhyme in Tai Phake songs of north-east India, whereas Walsh finds an absence of rhyme in Aboriginal songs, though he acknowledges other possible types of sound patterning.9 The musical component alone may have its own structure. For example, the pitches of notes are bounded by the tonal structure of the particular musical genre or the musical system of the enculturated listeners. In many songs rhythm is organized into a repeating pattern of isochronous beats where some beats are stronger than others, i.e. rhythmic meter. The articles by Nancarrow and O’Keeffe discuss meter in Aboriginal songs. Duple meter is where every second beat is weaker than the first, while triple meter is where every second and third beat is weaker than the first (such as a waltz). Meter is often hierarchically ordered so that in addition to the tactusthe beats to which one tapsit is possible to recognize larger or smaller divisions of the beat.10 Where the beat divides into two units this is referred to as simple meter, and where the beat divides into three units this is referred to as compound meter. In Australian Aboriginal songs, polyrhythmic meters, where the percussion accompaniment is performed at a different meter to that performed by the voice, are also common (see Nancarrow, in this volume). Similarly, tempothe speed of the beats or underlying pulse of the songmay be constrained by the genre of the song. In many Aboriginal songs tempo is constrained by the particular meter and beating accompaniment of the song. This cluster of rhythmic features has led to the term ‘rhythmic mode’ (see O’Keeffe, in this volume).11 In addition to the grammar of the spoken language, a song may have specific textual conventions. Some songs may prefer particular parts of speech or particular sounds in the same position of a line. Some may draw from a limited vocabulary, have a reduced syntax, or a different phoneme inventory to that of the spoken language.12 In this volume Apted finds a greater number of vowels in Inyjalarrku songs of north-east Arnhem Land than in everyday speech, a finding in common with songs from other areas (Strehlow 1971: 67; Sherzer 1990: 16; Turpin 2005: 272). It is important to remember that song is an art form that features the voice as a musical instrument (Fornas 2003: 49) and vowels are the main pitch-bearing unit of the voice. Particular types of vowels can help overcome the adverse effects of consonant production on tune and tone and allow one to sing softly or quickly without losing the pitch (Emmons 2002); the voice may thus use sounds purely for their aesthetic effect. Unlike other instruments, however, the voice also produces spoken language. We are challenged then to avoid viewing song as a derivative of speech. There may also be constraints on the linguistic variety used in song. Recent work on northern Aboriginal songs has found that particular song genres are associated with particular languages (Barwick et al. 2007: 8).13 In this volume Apted considers how Inyjalarrku songs are entirely spirit language and contain no words from everyday speech. Non-speech words are common in Australian Aboriginal songs, and researchers have often viewed song texts in terms of their divergence from spoken language (see, for example, Alpher 1976; Dixon 1984; Donaldson 1984; Merlan 1987; Sutton 1987; Tunstill 1995). In contrast, the papers by Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez, Crozet, Morey, Sollis, and Stebbins and Planigale consider songs whose linguistic variety is primarily that of everyday speech. Finally, there can be requirements on how text, music and song structure interact. The length of lines may adhere to a regular count of some aspect of linguistic form. This is called poetic meter.14 As an example, Dell and Elmedlaoui (2008) find that in many Berber songs, lines adhere to a repeating four-mora pattern that is referred to as a ‘foot’.15 In addition, they find that every second syllable of the foot must align with a strong beat. A similar approach is taken by Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez in this volume. She compares the extent to which lexical stress must align with strong musical beats in English and Spanish folk songs, a well-documented requirement for English songs (Hayes 1983; Hayes & Kaun 1996; Hayes & MacEachern 1998). She also compares the extent to which the principle of ‘one syllable be set to one note’ exists in English and Spanish songs.16 Both Morey and Sollis in this volume, consider the way in which lexical tone aligns with musical pitch.17 To what extent song melodies are constrained by the melody of speech is a particularly relevant question in relation to tone languages. Morey observes in Tai Phake songs a trade-off where alignment of one aspect of text to music provides freedom in how another area of text is aligned. He finds that when lexical tone and musical pitch align, grammatical units need not match the organizational units of the song. However, when lexical tone and musical pitch do not align there is strict matching of grammatical units with the half-line unit. In exploring the relationship between linguistic tone and melody in pikono songs from Papua New Guinea, Sollis finds that linguistic tone contours and melodic contours match within the constraints of the melodic structure. A melodic phrase cannot descend further than an interval of a fifth. Where an intonational decline is over a long portion of text, this musical constraint forces a misalignment of linguistic tone contour with melody. In many respects songs show a sensitivity to the relationship between speech prosody and music. The nature and cross-linguistic variation of this relationship is the concern of the sub-field of text-setting (Lerdahl & Jackendoff 1983; Halle & Lerdahl 1993; Kiparsky 2006; Fabb & Halle 2008; Hayes 2008; Hayes & Kaun 1996; Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez 2007, Turpin 2007a). In general we find that the highly structured nature of songs can force adjustments to the text not normally seen in the spoken form of the language. This competition between the desire to adhere to the song structures and the desire to remain faithful to the spoken language has led to Optimality Theory in phonology being applied to text-setting in song (Hayes & MacEachern 1998). Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez, in this volume, uses this methodology to show that constraints which regulate rhythm in spoken language are also those that determine how words are set to musical rhythm in stanzaic Spanish and English folk songs. This provides an interesting comparison to Dell and Halle’s work on text-setting in French and English songs (2008). Rodrı´guez-Va´zquez finds that in Spanish, a so-called syllabletimed language, different texts set to the same melodic line are more likely to contain the same number of syllables than in English songs, although often at the expense of aligning prominent syllables with strong musical beats. The reverse is the case in English, a so-called stress-timed language, where lines are more likely to contain differing numbers of syllables but less likely to contain stress mismatches. Such research supports the view that the relation of lyrics to music in songs is rooted in the sound structure of the language (Fabb 1997), yet contrasts with the view that the sound structure of speech, literary language and song might have quite different explanations (Kiparsky 2006: 7; Fabb & Halle 2008). The use of language to draw attention to the sound qualities of the message itself rather than its meaning is what Jakobson calls the poetic function of language (1960, 1987: 71). By selecting equivalent and contrasting aspects of languages to create a sequence, such ‘parallelism’ (Jakobson 1987) gives a temporal dimension to language, as each sound relates to what comes before and after it. Parallelism can also be applied to semantics and syntax.18 Walsh, in this volume, considers various types of parallelism in applying Friedrich’s theory of polytropy (1991) to Aboriginal songs. A related feature is the repeated use of formulaic expressions. These may be limited to a particular position in the song or line, and are often set to the same musical pattern. In contrast to parallelism, a formula need not occur in a regular sequence. In this volume Sollis, Apted, Walsh and Morey identify formulaic text in the songs they investigate.19 As well as drawing attention to the song’s own form, parallelism and formulas may assist in the memorizing of songs. To ascertain the structure of a well-formed song it is not always possible to identify ‘ungrammatical’ songs in the same way ungrammatical speech can be identified. In some cases songs may form a finite set, and may be perceived as being created by spirits rather than living people. In such cases it may not be easy to access native speaker intuitions about a proposed ill-formed song, as the singer may evaluate the song in terms of its origin rather than its structure. It may be important to analyse multiple performances of a song in order to understand what aspects of a song’s structure do not vary and are thus significant and defining, and what aspects are open to variation and creativity. Variation may signal features of a particular singer, or a particular social context of a given performance. Crozet, in this volume, considers three very different versions of La Marseillaise, where she relates their differences to the socio-cultural discourse of their times; yet all are regarded as exemplars of ‘the La Marseillaise’. 3. The Meanings and Significances of Songs Songs are often much more difficult to translate than speech. In some instances the difficulties may be due to the text containing words that are not of everyday speech or because the songs represent concepts that are difficult to grasp. In some communities certain songs are only translatable to particular members of society (e.g. Keen 1977; Clunies Ross 1986: 242). Thus the inability to translate a song may be due to its inherently restricted nature, as discussed by Stebbins and Planigale in this volume. A key difference between speech and song is the more deeply embedded and artefact-like status of the text, a feature in common with poetry, proverbs, rhyming slang, proper names and religious sermons. Yet unlike these purely linguistic forms, song also includes music. This combination of the song text and musical components has the ability to convey different types of meanings in complex ways. Where song performance also involves dancing, painting and adornment of special items, these non-verbal aspects can also contribute to the meaning of a song. So far we have used the word ‘meaning’ rather loosely as a term covering many types of meanings and associations. A complete account of song meaning requires a distinction between different types of meaning and the ways in which meanings are conveyed. Nancarrow identifies three ways in which Lardil burdal songs convey meaning: through the text of a song, through the rhythm (musical meaning) and through interpretations transmitted independently of the song text, what she calls ‘culturally ascribed meaning’. In the next section we identify different types of meanings that songs can convey: lexical or word meaning, song text meaning (the meaning of the words in the context of the particular song), connotative and interactional meanings; and we also consider the ways in which these are conveyed. 3.1. Word Meaning All the articles in this volume identify, or are concerned with identifying, the words in songs and their meanings. Word meaning can also be conveyed through music, such as the downward interval in ‘Swing Low, Sweet Chariot’ which reflects the meaning of the downward movement to earth (Patel 2008: 342). Such word painting can also be conveyed through dance. Nancarrow, in this volume, shows how the accompanying dance emulating a brolga is the only aspect of the song conveying the meaning ‘brolga’ in a Mornington Island song. It is not uncommon for words to have a different or broader lexical meaning in song than in speech.20 As well, songs, like poetry, may have multiple competing lexical meanings. Here, it is necessary to distinguish the meanings intended by the composer (which may be multiple and intentional), and those constructed by listeners interpreting the song. Intentional ambiguity (which is the basis of puns) may be more widespread in orally transmitted song traditions, as the written form necessarily favours only one lexical form, obfuscating the aesthetic pleasure of holding two simultaneous interpretations of a text. Stebbins and Planigale note that the word ame¯che¯linga in a Mali Baining song means both ‘lizard species’ and ‘ceremonial mask’. Walsh, in this volume, argues that ‘(s)he used his/her hands’ and ‘(s)he said/did’ are two distinct meanings of the same segment of text available to listeners of a Murriny Patha song, although it is not known whether this was the intention of the composer. The music and formal requirements of a song can make it difficult to distinguish the words of a song and can lead to a listener reinterpreting the original text. A classic example of this in English has provided a name for this phenomenon, ‘mondegreens’. It is based on a mishearing in the second line of the English couplet ‘… They have slain the bonny earl of Moray, and laid him on the green’, which was later reinterpreted as ‘… and Lady Mondegreen’.21 Mondegreens are no doubt more common in orally transmitted traditions than in written traditions. Schebeck’s warning against making hasty interpretations about the form of place names based on interpretations by native speakers who may be ‘pressed for answers under the assumption that there must be a simple answer’ (2002: 147148) applies equally to song translation. So far we have considered the lexical meaning of wordstheir dictionary definition. It is also important to consider the referential meaning of words. Again, it is necessary to distinguish the meanings intended by the composer, and those constructed by listeners interpreting the song. To illustrate the difference between lexical and referential meaning consider a song analysed by O’Keeffe in this volume. The third line is Kaddikkaddik ka-wokdjanganj, ‘The oyster catcher spoke/sang/cried out’. Interpreting the lexical meaning of the words in this line involves knowing what sort of entity an oyster catcher is, including entailments such as it is a type of bird, and what type of vocal action wokdjangan refers to, and the sorts of entities that typically perform this action. Referential meaning is, for example, the specific oyster catcher to which the song refers, which in the case of many Aboriginal Dreaming songs is a specific ancestral being. Referential meaning is obtained by parsing the words and constructing an interpretation of them, so a listener may have different referents from those intended by the composer. For example, the composer of ‘The bonny Earl of Moray’ had one earl in mind, whereas listeners might have different referents depending on which Earl of Moray they thought the song was about. Referential meanings are often more ambiguous in song than in speech. Spoken explanations about whom or to what a song refers, and knowledge about the song style or performance context, can play a role in conveying referential meaning. In societies that recognize composersindividual(s) who are the creators of songsthese people are often regarded as the legitimate source of meaning, and any listener’s reinterpretation is regarded as ‘wrong’. In contrast, in societies where songs are perceived as pre-existing rather than composed by individuals, as in much of Aboriginal Australia, meanings are legitimized according to the status and genealogy of the person interpreting the song. A reinterpretation of lexical or referential meaning is thus of little relevance to the enculturated listeners (see, for example, Wild 1987: 109; Tunstill 1995: 64; Keogh 1996; Turpin 2005: 332). While words in some songs have multiple lexical meanings, some may have no lexical meaning. Apted, O’Keeffe and Nancarrow discuss songs where the texts, or parts of the text, include words that the majority of enculturated listeners cannot interpret. Where the text makes use of words that are not from everyday speech, people may perceive the text to involve words whose meaning is no longer known. Songs are often repositories of archaic words, as they tend to be stable entities due to their tightly structured form. Alternatively people may perceive the words to involve spirit language, whose lexical content remains unknown to people, or known only to specialists of spirit language22 (Apted, O’Keeffe, in this volume). A third possibility is that the text may contain ‘vocables’syllables used to fill the structural requirements of the song or simply for their acoustic properties (Clunies Ross 1986: 242; Koch & Turpin 2008: 171). Apted observes that non-lexical units are ‘‘‘meaningful’’ in the more abstract sense of this term’ (see Section 3.3 below). O’Keeffe similarly finds that the spirit language represents the call of an oyster catcher bird, and a spoken narrative reveals the oyster catcher to be the subject of the song style; thus the song text ‘encodes the relationship to external narratives’. 3.2. Text Meaning For some songs it can be difficult to know what a line or the song as a whole means, even when the lexical meaning of words is known (see also Merlan 1987: 150). This is often the case with song texts that have anaphoric words or where there is no semantic link between lines. Stebbins and Planigale refer to this level of meaning as ‘text meaning’. An example of the difference between word meaning and text meaning can be illustrated with a line of the Mali Baining song whose words Stebbins and Planigale gloss as ‘maybe I can go with you’. They explain the text meaning of the song as ‘a man missing his brother and wishing to go and be with him’. However, not all songs have readily accessible text meanings. Walsh finds ‘The ‘‘pelican song’’ is almost entirely composed of ‘‘actual’’ words but remains rather cryptic for this observer’. He suggests exploring different types of tropesimagistic, modal, formal, contiguity-based and analogicalin order to elucidate broader meanings and structures in songs. Where songs form part of a larger corpus, particular text meanings can sometimes be obtained in relation to other songs in the corpus. Curran, in this volume, finds that a Warlpiri song containing the word for a particular type of tree ‘at this point in the song cycle indicates that the women are no longer in their home country’. As with word meaning, there may be multiple, intentional text meanings of a song. A Pitjantjatjara song with the word ‘cup or mound shape’ is said to be about a termite mound by one singer, a women’s breast by another, and an insulator on a telegraph pole by another; and the particular textual meaning one derives, or is given, depends on one’s own level of knowledge (Ellis 1985: 6264). A number of researchers of Australian Aboriginal songs have suggested that the ability to have multiple text meanings ensures songs have relevance and applicability to many contexts (Tonkinson 1978: 102; Marett 2005: 199).23 Many of the articles in this volume show that specialized cultural knowledge is required to deduce text meanings (Crozet, Curran, Nancarrow, Stebbins and Planigale, and Walsh).24 In many societies not everyone has access to the same level of specialized cultural knowledge, and so there can be varying degrees to which a listener is enculturated in relation to a particular genre or song. Thus the ‘trajectory’ of understanding of a song will vary depending on one’s knowledge (Walsh, in this volume). Some songs have accompanying explanations in the form of a narrative or exegesis (Donaldson 1979, 1984; Strehlow 1971).25 These elucidate not just text meaning, but can reveal word meanings, especially where the text has a highly constrained form. Such narratives may form a unique type of speech event (Hymes 1970), distinct from explanations of other types of phenomena. Where the narrator must be of a particular social status interactional meanings are also encoded in the speech act. In parts of Australia only an owner of a song can provide an explanatory narrative. Understanding the communicative behaviour of specific cultural settings, such as song performance and explanation, is the subject of investigation of ethnographies of speaking (Hymes 1970; Bauman & Sherzer 1974; Sherzer 1990).26 Nancarrow, in this volume, refers to the meaning of some songs as ‘learnt’ rather than ‘interpreted through analysis of song text’, and refers to this source as ‘popular opinion’. This can be compared to the way school children are sometimes ‘handed down’ the meaning of their Latin school song rather than through textual translation. The detailed meanings of songs discussed by Curran demonstrate how text meanings of Warlpiri songs rely on a listener having specialized environmental, ceremonial and other types of cultural knowledge. 3.3. Songs as Mnemonics The tightly interwoven nature of text and music enables songs to be used as mnemonic devices, especially in preliterate societies, where song and poetry has been documented as a mnemonic aid for events and places (Weiner 1991: 45; Feld & Basso 1996: 109; Basso 1996).27 Even in contemporary literate societies we find songs used as mnemonics (consider the ‘ABC’ Alphabet song in English). Recently the Bee Gees ‘Staying alive’ has been promoted by pediatrics as a song to sing while administering CPR to help people find the correct compression rate.28 It is not difficult to imagine how a song can then gain additional significancesespecially emotional responsesby use in such different contexts. It has often been stated that Aboriginal songs act as mnemonics for linked places, and so the song series as a whole is akin to a musical map (Strehlow 1970: 94). The case studies of Aboriginal songs in this volume (Curran, O’Keeffe, Nancarrow, Apted, and Walsh) all include songs that stand for particular places. 3.4. Interactional Meanings Like other kinds of speech acts, songs have interactional meaning. Interactional meaning refers to the attitude and expectations between the speaker and the hearer. In singing, where the role of the singer is often fixed (not anyone can sing), and the speech act context-driven (singing can only occur at certain times and places), interactional meanings are dependent on the genre of the song. For example, by attending a concert featuring a singer, a listener expects to be moved emotionallyor at least be aesthetically pleased by the singing. In contrast, the addressee of ‘Happy Birthday’ interprets this singing interactionally to mean that s/he is a special person, and that the singers think him/her worthy, especially if followed by ‘For s/he’s a jolly good fellow’. In the genre of political songs analysed by Crozet, the singer signals as interactional meaning that they want to spur the addressee into political action, assuming the role of teacher to the listener. In this genre the addressee is simultaneously the government (often the subject of the songs) and the everyday citizen listening to the song. Traditional Aboriginal songs can also have multiple addressees: fellow performers (usually countrymen), listeners (usually outsiders) and ancestral spirits. This leads to interactional meanings of identity such as ‘I am from this country’ (see Curran, in this volume; compare also national anthems), ‘I have a strong attachment to my spiritual ancestors’, or as Apted states ‘… the potency of one’s spiritual life, which manifests in one’s ability to receive and sing songs from the spirits’. In Central Australia, singing particular songs can bring about changes to the physical worlds (e.g. bring about rain), also a type of interactional meaning. 3.5. Connotive Meanings Songs can connote particular situations, behaviours and events. Such pragmatic and associated knowledge is comparable to what McConnell-Ginet calls ‘conceptual baggage’ (2008). Curran, in this volume, argues that visual images in both the song text, the dance movements and visual designs connote certain concepts, for example circular shapes ‘represent home, women and protection’. Walsh, in this volume, discusses connotative meanings of place names in northern Australian Aboriginal songs, which act as a kind of shorthand to invoke a chain of connectedness between one specific place, the other places in the vicinity and/or on the same Dreaming track, the stories associated with that place through Dreamings, ancestors and exploits by living relatives at that place to their country as a whole. Some connotations may be evoked only in the context of a particular song style and so are the results of knowledge of the particular song style speech event. This can be compared to the way English speakers know ‘Auld Lang Syne’ is sung on New Year’s Eve, and so the song connotes the significance of this annual event and associated behaviours. Stebbins and Planigale refer to this level of meaning as ‘meaning in context’. While this is similar to other context-dependant speech acts such as religious services (compare ‘Ashes to ashes, dust to dust’), music provides an additional modality for evoking the social context of the songs. Indeed, even without the text, simply humming the melody of a song can evoke its context. The Dreamings connoted in the songs discussed by Apted are the result of the religious context of their performance rather than from any lexical meaning of the text. In the songs discussed by Curran and O’Keeffe, a word for a plant or animal occurs in a song genre associated with the Dreaming. Through knowledge of this genre a number of connotations and associated meanings are available to the listener. For example, in Central Australia a Dreaming song can evoke the place where this totemic being originated, its activities in the Dreamtime, and the people who own the particular Dreaming. All this in addition to the non-genre dependant connotations of the songsuch as the cultural uses of the plant or animal and the listener’s/singer’s own personal experiences with that plant or animal. It may turn out that connotations of particular flora and fauna may be widespread; for example the connotation of the peaceful dove with loneliness, noted by Walsh, in this volume, is also found in Central Australian songs where the emotion relates to the activities of this bird in the Dreaming and the plaintive nature of its call. Knowledge of the particular song style speech event may affect the ability to derive not just connoted meanings but also text meaning, as Stebbins and Planigale find for different styles of Mali Baining songs. 3.6. Emotional Responses Music, poetry and other forms of language all have the ability to provoke emotional responses, yet their means for evoking emotions differ. Crozet, in this volume, argues that in the French La Marseillaise the combination of march-like music with combat vocabulary helps put soldiers in an emotional state suited to killing and to selfsacrifice. In Central Australia, Ellis finds traditional wailing begins on a set pitch, and so for enculturated listeners this pitch can be associated with mourning, even when the pitch occurs in a different context (1985: 67). While certain broad musical genres can become associated with particular emotional states,29 specific songs can have particular meaning through the tight association between text and music, even when their text is absent or altered. Consider a well-known tune such as ‘God Save the Queen’, where from the music alone an enculturated listener can derive meanings related to the text. The ability of a song’s tune to carry associated meanings of its absent text is the basis of the parody in the songs analysed by Crozet. A related phenomenon is where well-known songs are used in novel contexts for particular often humorouseffect, particularly in news reports, documentaries and in conversation amongst people who share knowledge about a particular song. Finally, certain connotations or emotional responses may develop through the frequency of particular vocabulary or sound sequences occurring in song (see also Patel 2008: 343). The question raised by Walsh of whether particular vocabulary or tropes are widespread in particular languages or traditions, may also reveal these to have connotative or emotional significances. A phrase or word uttered in the context of conversation may connote a song or song genre and all that this song signifies for an enculturated listener. This use of language can be a source of humour and intellectual pleasure in everyday interaction. 4. Conclusion Our understanding of the arrangement of musical components and their effect on linguistic form is still in its infancy. Song, as a universal genre of language, and one ‘in which musical and linguistic meanings intertwine’ (Patel 2008: 342) also offers a rich field for investigations into meaning. Collaborative research between linguists and musicologists is already underway on Aboriginal Australian songs (Marett & Barwick 2007). We hope that this volume highlights the importance of such collaborative work on songs from all areas in order to promote a deeper understanding of the nature of song: how particular cultures use language to create song, how language and music interact, how songs convey meaning, the sorts of meanings they convey, their intended audience and how knowledge of songs can further our understanding of linguistic prosody. 2 дослідження: Another Road: An Intersection of Music and Language. Jiradej Setabundhu INTRODUCTION Specialists tend to stay within their field. Knowledgehas become very specific, usually to the point that people outside such immediate circle cannot understand.In a way, this is necessary as we gather moreinformation and dig deeper into its meanings. Thedownside of this world of super-specialty is that we tendto lose touch with the big picture for the lack of anyconnecting mechanism that holds together the different parts of the total knowledge. The connections betweendifferent branches are lost.Things have not always been this way, however. Inearlier times, a learned scholar often possessed skills invarious fields. John Dunstable, a Renaissance Englishcomposer, was also an astronomer and a mathematician but one of the numerous examples. Although he isknown today chiefly as a composer, there is no doubtthat his knowledge in astronomy inspired his music, andthe underlying durations, structures, and symmetries ofhis isorhythmic motets and masses are due in no small part to his prowess in mathematics [1].Perhaps we cannot go back to the way things were, but accepting what other branches of knowledge canoffer will be beneficial for pursuing our own field.Sometimes the cross-pollination between the two fieldsis such that it provides a new perspective for us to seewhat should have been obvious but for some reason wasoverlooked. This study discusses specifically how musicand language intertwine in parallel- and contrary-motiondances that have inspired composers to develop theirartistic ideas. This study also likes to share someexamples of how a simple approach to language provides a springboard for my musical ideas. 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2.1. Music and Language A poem, a story, a song, and a sonata are all time- based art. They flow through time from the beginning tothe end as opposed to, say, a painting that a viewer can perceive as a whole. One can argue that time is requiredto appreciate a sculpture in its totality as three-dimensional art, but a viewer can view sculpture in anon-linear fashion and still grasp the effect of the work.On the other hand, the coherence of a story or amovement of a symphony would be destroyed if alistener approached its timeline randomly. To be sure,many authors have experimented with linearity, beginning a story from the middle of the plot and so on, but this is intentional, and the result is still linear,although not in the way the reader might expect.Music is closely related to language to the extent thatit metaphorically adopts some of the languageterminologies. When we hear a group of musicians perform an improvisatory passage, for example, we say that they are “in conversation” . In an academic setting,the terms such as phrases , sentences , and periods have been used in classes on musical form and harmony todescribe the various temporal length of a musical unit,although it must be said that the exact definitions ofthese terms can vary from one school of thought to thenext, and are at best a little ambiguous unless applied to very simple musical excerpts [2]. To some, twoconsecutive musical phrases, the former ends with weak punctuation ( cadence ) and the latter strong one, form asentence or a period [3]. A. Schoenberg, on the otherhand, provided a more specific description of a sentencewhere the first part contains two statements of a motive,usually in tonic and dominant, and the second part provides a more developing treatment of the materialsfrom the first, often employing rhythmic reduction andthematic fragmentation, to bring the sentence to aconcluding cadence [4].One can trace back in time to even earlier periodsand still finds the interwoven thread of language andmusic. Around the mid-eighteenth century, a decade before the death of J. S. Bach, a new musical style called galant emerged that was to be a link between the learned polyphonic work of the Baroque style and the Classicalstyle that focuses on a more balance of the vertical andlinear musical ideas, culminating in the music of Haydnand Mozart. The characteristics of galant music includea rejection of counterpoint, clear separation of melodyand accompaniment, shorter themes, symmetrical phrasestructure, and strophic, regular rhythm related todancing. The adjectives that perhaps best suit this newstyle are pleasant, free, spontaneous, and attractive. Theorigin of the style was closely related to the ideal of theera that also pervaded other art forms. Goethe wroteabout a similar writing style that was typically feminine,with short phrases and many sentence breaks — the style that also appeared in J. J. Rousseau’s epistolary novel Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse and short statements in the libretto of Pergolesi’s opera La serva padrona [5].Despite the apparent difference in communicativecapability between language and music, the former ableto convey specific information while the latter onlygeneral expressions, the difference is simply in degrees.Language, unlike other human institutions such as customs, fashion, or laws, “is limited by nothing in the choice of means, for apparently nothing would preventthe associating of any idea whatsoever with just any sequence of sounds [6].” The linguistic signs and their meanings are related not naturally but instead sociallyand historically — therefore arbitrary. Any specificlanguage can never be universal because to understandits code, a participant must immerse him/herself in thespecific cultural, historical, and cognitive backgrounds.Many subtexts and jokes in sitcoms from the US, e.g., Seinfeld and Entourage , would be lost to viewers fromforeign countries who have no background on thethemes — life in New York City in the former andHollywood extravaganza lifestyle in the latter.Many think of music as being more universal, but,like any language, its power to convey the meanings,general as they are require that a listener shares itscultural, historical, and cognitive contexts. In general, itrefers to the lack of precision in describing the physicalworld with the clarity of human language. Of course, wehave to set aside some claims as obvious exaggerationsto make a point, as when R. Strauss boasted that he could “differentiate musically between a knife and afork” with his composition and orchestration techniques used in Symphonia domestic [7]. What we see as auniversal response to a melody, harmony, or rhythm isnothing but a learned experience acquired from years ofimmersion in a proper environment. An Indian musicianunaccustomed to western music would likely find the12-equal temperament tuning crude and could not relateto the emotional swells of the nineteenth-centurywestern music. Likewise, a western composer neverexposed to eastern scales would not understand theflexibility of the Thai tuning and hear the music as outof tune. Film composers have learned the craft of manipulating viewers’ responses to specific formulas well within a particular environment, and it is nowonder — although unfortunate — that many blockbusterhits share similar thematic, harmonic, and rhythmic materials. M. Danielewski saw man’s attempt to relate the concept of echo to God as a reason why the designsof most churches support ample reverb: “Divinityseemed defined by echo,” he wrote [8], “The hallowedalways seems to abide in the province of the hollow.” But this is true only to a society where echoes and longreverb time are not common. For a tribe living in amountainous area, with valleys and peaks, and space in between large enough for sound reflections to bedistinguishable from the sound source (longer than 0.1seconds), echoes would be a common occurrence, andthus would not seem fit to describe Divinity.More concrete examples can be found in dance,which, like language, communicates through culturalcodes. H. Bannerman analyzed the western classical andmodern dance and matched linguistic categories,including vocabulary and syntax, the utterance and thespeech act, to dance counterparts [9]. The gestures indances of many Asian countries consist of pre-determined patterns, each of which represents a specificaffection and meaning. Indian dance, a part of a largerdrama, is divided into three categories. Two of these, natya and nritya, — drama (story or plot) and mime(gestures of the dancer body) respectively — togetherconvey the meaning of the dance [10]. The dancer/actorcommunicates the story and expressions via numerousstylized gestures using the movement of head, eyebrows,nose, cheek, chin, neck, breasts, eyes, feet, and hands, ofwhich those involving eyes and hands are the mostimportant. A single gesture may signify many different,unrelated meanings, not unlike human language [11] Without knowing the relevant cultural codes, it will beimpossible for the audience to appreciate the performance. 2.2. Music and Structure Since music shares many characteristics with literarywork, it is no surprise that many composers control themusical structure with those of poetry or story. Thisseemingly simple action helps to fulfill the logicaldecision for the musical form. The more specificmeaning of language shapes the abstract musicalstructure, leading the sound along with the parallel flow.The evolution of atonal music, i.e., music without atonal center, is a good demonstration of how languagecan be a great aid to composers. The first decade of thetwentieth century saw western art music struggle tomove forwards. Tonality, the driving force of music thusfar based on the attracting force between the tonic (the tonal center) and the dominant (the tonic’s strongest overtone a fifth above), was disintegrating, and therewas no other system available. Since tonality governedthe connection of chords, it also controlled the pace (orrhythm) of harmonic changes, in addition to the voiceleading. Therefore, composing atonal music wasdifficult because composers had no access to any self-consistent applicable compositional procedures [12].The only possible guidelines were usually in the form ofnegative rules to tonality, e.g., the avoidance oftraditional chords and conjunct melodies [13].It is understandably symptomatic that early examplesof atonal music tend to be very short, some of whichonly a few minutes long. To extend the length beyondthis miniature scale, composers often employed text tomusic. The prose/poem-turn-libretto provided a strongsense of direction on which the music could be carried.It gave a logical structure to the flow of expressions thatthe composers could hold on. Schoenberg, a leadingcomposer of this period, was able to complete a 30-minutes long Erwartung in 17 days because of thelibretto. In this expressionist monodrama, the poet andmedical graduate Marie Pappenheim told a psychological story of a woman searching in a darkforest for her lost lover whom she might have killed.The libretto does not have any narrative plot per se but provides a backbone for the music, leading it to a progressively more intense emotional state of the protagonist’s mind. The athematic nature ofSchoenberg’s music reflects the text without any progressive story. When Schoenberg said to Pappenheim, “Then write me an opera libretto, younglady… Write whatever you wish, I need a libretto ,” [14]he did not just propose a challenge, but also a request.The astonishing speed which he completed the workindicates the effectiveness of a proper text as acompositional aid.Although Schoenberg implied that his music did notserve merely as a translation of a text into sound,claiming that he was usually inspired simply by thesound of the first words of the text and composed themusic without any regard to the rest of the text, he later backtracked, saying that other composers misunderstoodand took his comment too literally [15]. The textstructure, indeed, gave him some idea about the structureof the music, as apparent in the 1932 discussion of hisown Four Orchestral Songs , op. 22, where he statedthat, although his use of text did not rely solely on word painting technique, the text did supply the formalorganization to the music [16]. In the melodrama forcabaret Pierrot lunaire , Schoenberg’s seminal work commissioned by Albertine Zehme for a reciter and fivemusicians, the composer selected 21 poems from a cycle by A. Giraud and organized them into three groups ofseven poems — the action that decisively led to thecreation of the opening seven-note motive G#-E-C-D-Bb-C#-G that later appeared in various guises in every poem throughout the work. 2.3. Music and Storytelling The problem exists when trying to integrate a storyinto music. Many musicians would label the work asabsolute music, i.e., music without any associated storyas opposed to program music. However, writing the music accompanying W. B. Yeats’ Sailing to Byzantium can be a solution. The theme of the poem is about ametaphorical journey of a frail old man living in a worldof youth, who decided to sail to the mystical Byzantiumin search of immortality. The transformation of a wasted body into an immortal golden bird provided the idea ofrecycling. Together with the arcana theme, this finallyguided the project into a multimedia work consisting ofa live shadow play and electronic music accompanying a poem reading. The shadow play was a reference to theThai tradition of Nang yai and Nang talung , whereshadows of puppets made of painted buffalo hide were projected onto the screen. In a piece, wasted objectswere used as puppets to emphasize the recyclingconcept. The obscure images of lights and shadows, theelectronic sound of an analog modular synthesizer withcomplicated cable patches, the dramatic reading of the poem, and the incessant sound of the sea set the tone forthe mysterious quest. There are four stanzas in Yeats’ poem. The first two place the narrator in the land of youth while the last twoare set in Byzantium. Here presents the problem of formthat often occurs when we adopt one art form to another.The bipartite structure based on departure and arrival works well in the poem, but such an epic seafaring journey could not be portrayed musically with a short “sailed the seas” phrase as in the poem. A longer duration is needed in the music domain to depict the narrator’s quest successfully. Therefore, another poem with a seafaring theme that would not look out of placeto serve as a long musical arch between the two citieswas searched and S. T. Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner was found. 23 non-consecutive stanzas from Coleridge’s were selected and rearranged to form anew cohesive journey. Delightfully, most of the selectedstanzas contained references to time of day, e.g., TheSun came up upon the left, / Out of the sea came he! /And he shone bright, and on the right / Went down intothe sea were discovered [17]. It turned out that thesequence, as indicated by the selected stanzas, suggesteda nine-day journey.Thus, the final form of the work is tripartite as opposed to the bipartite division of Yeats’ original poem. The placement of the additional Coleridge’s poem in between emphasizes the contrast between theland and the sea. This created fluctuation in tension,which was reflected in the treatment of the light play andthe musical texture [18]. 2.4. Music and Syntax Many eastern composers working in the westerncompositional domain feel, at one time or another, the pressure to write in their local idiom. This is not an easytask because Thai music has a unique system andmethod of composing, which is quite different from thewestern counterpart. Finding the unique characteristicsthat define Thai music is a solution so that through them,the Thai compositional techniques from a different anglecan be approached. It turns out that two characteristicsare indispensable: the strict form of centonization andthe hierarchical structure.Centonization is a technique of composing with pre-existing melody types. It shows in some music from theMedieval period and also occurs in Arab-Andalusianmusic [19]. In either case, the technique implies aflexible application of the pre-composed blocks. Thaiusage, however, is quite strict. Instead of using loosestructural pitch sequences as in melody-types of Arab-Andalusian music, centonization in Thai music is basedon luuk khong — building blocks of the same length, eachof which combines a precise pitch sequence and arhythmic pattern. A composer selects luuk khong andconnects them in a specific order to create a newmelody. In performance, one musician plays the melodywhile others perform melodic variations simultaneouslyon top of the melody. Usually, these variationsthemselves also make use of centonization. The melodyand all variations meet on specific notes at a regularinterval, forming a heterophonic texture. (Some musicologists prefer the term “polyphonic stratification” since it better describes the distinct characteristics ofeach variation instead of a group of more closely relatedmelodies of the typical heterophonic music) [20].In itself, the melody created from luuk khong contains little information about the rhythmic aspect ofthe piece. It is just a base layer upon which rhythms are built. Above it is a pattern of regularly spaced,alternating open/closed ching strokes. The speed of thestrokes determines one of the three metrical levels. Inlevel 3, a single ching cycle occurs in a span of one luukkhong ; level 2 corresponds to the speed of two ching cycles per luuk khong ; the music is in level 1 if there arefour ching cycles per luuk khong . Above the ching is thegong stroke, occurring every two ching cycles. Lastly,the drum pattern called na tap is at the top of thehierarchy. There are many drum patterns, but each alwaays contains three sub-patterns for the three levels.The drum pattern is, again, twice as long as the gongstroke.Thus, we can create a new structure based on Thaimusic by utilizing only the Thai concepts of therhythmic hierarchical system and centonization. We begin by considering music as a simple melody, as manyThai repertoires have been conceived. The first thing isto create a new set of melody types in place of the Thai luuk khong . If there are many of these, then there isstatistically a potential to create something as complexas the Thai music system. But we also have to establisha logical (and aesthetic) system to put these melodic blocks together. One way to do this is to play with the blocks until we have a sense of what works. After a longenough time, a suitable connection will surely emerge.The other way is to create an artificial and arbitrarysystem dictating the connection. Then, too, we need toestablish the logic of the rhythmic hierarchical system.The problem of creating a new system lies in themerit of the materials and processes. The Thai musicalsystem has not arrived at the current state immediately.The compatibility of all luuk khong and their relation tothe rhythmic system indicates a long period ofexperiments with trial and error. Through this period,any unsuitable luuk khong and rhythmic structureswould already be discarded. The whole system is theresult of the developments by many skilled musiciansthrough generations. This is not the case with a newsystem created by an individual, and it would beimpractical to assume the result to be on the same levelas the Thai system So, we need as a model a system from which we canextract both the strict centonization and hierarchicalstructure, one that is a result of collective ideas over aconsiderable period. Fortunately, there is such a systemthat all of us are well acquainted with, i.e., language.The parallel between characters and pitches, words and luuk khong , sentences and phrases/periods, is just one possible interpretation.By basing a musical system on language, we solvemany problems that would occur if we tried to invent anew system. By setting up a mapping method of the pitch/duration pairs and characters, we can construct luuk khong from actual words. The mapping process thatwe use will affect the tonal character of the new luukkhong , but the structure of the language will alsodetermine the sound. Assigning p itch D to the letter “q,” for example, we will not find many luuk khong with twoDs in succession if the system is applied to the Englishlanguage. In any language, some words occur moreoften than others. Consequently, and naturally, some luuk khong will also appear more frequently than others, just like in the Thai system. As for the rhythmichierarchical system, the relationships between luukkhong , ching strokes, gong strokes, and drum patterns inThai music may be translated to those between words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs, for example.Bear in mind that we are not trying to representlanguage through music. We simply use the derivedstructure to solve the problem of creating a new systemcomparable to the Thai music structure. In this case,there is no intention to draw a parallel between the two luuk khong created from the words “Beautiful” and“Pleasing” . It is enough to see the possibility ofreplacing the former with the latter when a suitable occasion occurs, i.e., when the word “Pleasing” cansubstitute for “Beautiful.” The mapping system can be expanded in different ways, covering more parameters,to suit the composer’s needs. In doing so, we will findthat our taste has less role in the musical outcome, andthe characteristics of the language model will directlyaffect the result more [21]. 2.5 Music and Lyrics The perplexity of pop music is that it containsnothing unexplainable by the theory of music we havetoday. It is less complicated than most art music, andany music students completing the sophomore year will be able to analyze everything in most pop songs. Andyet, somehow this simple music has moved generationsof people. The feeling is that the power of pop music liesin its harmony, simple as it may be. So, investigating theharmonic concept of western tonal music will begin. Theidea of tonal music is simple enough: it is music with atonal center. This tone, called the tonic, functions as acenter of gravity, pulling in the other notes of the scale.A tone produced by a musical instrument is acomplex collection of pitches comprising of afundamental pitch and related pitches above it calledovertones. We do not perceive the overtones asindividual notes due to their low amplitudes, but they areresponsible for the tone color of an instrument. Asdemonstrated by Schoenberg, a single pitch alreadyimplies, by its overtones, a major scale plus theassociated harmony on all scale degrees [22]. Amongthese, the fifth scale degree, the dominant, is the mostimportant one because it is the loudest overtone. The pull on the dominant toward the tonic is considered themost important driving force in tonal music, which leadsto the harmonic progression V-I. Likewise, the tonicitself is the overtone of the imaginary fundamental afifth below, which is the fourth scale degree or thesubdominant. The three chords — tonic, dominant, andsubdominant — are called the primary chords becausethey are the first-order derivatives from the overtoneconcept. The other chords are viewed as the primarysubstitutes. Using this descending fifth movement as amodel, a simple theory of harmonic progression is thusestablished: the dominant (V, viiº) goes to the tonic (I,vi, iii); tonic goes to the subdominant (IV, ii); andsubdominant goes to dominant.It is interesting that while art music is predominantlydominant-tonic driven, the same cannot always be saidabout pop music. Analyze the harmonic progressions ofmany pop songs, and we will see that they are lessdominant-tonic-driven. On the contrary, the dominant-subdominant progressions — rarely seen in art music — are very much prevalent. This observation implies twocontradictory explanations: either the harmonic theoriesof art music and pop music are different, or both genresrely on the same theory of harmony, yet somehowinterpret it differently. Since both use the same tonalmaterials, this has led to a tendency toward the secondexplanation. Moreover, the different interpretation iscaused due to the language of the lyrics.Let us now look at pop music briefly in terms ofhistorical development to understand the implication ofthe lyrics. Pop music can be traced far back to the bluesmusic of the African American musicians since the latenineteenth century. Ragtime, then jazz and swing musicin an urban dance setting, and country swing of the 30sare the next evolutionary steps, leading to the rhythm & blues and country music of the 40s, and finally, the rockand roll of the 50s, which would evolve into pop music[23]. In the nineteenth century, all Africans in the USworking as slaves brought their music with them. Bluescan be seen now as a mixture of African music, call-and-response shouts and field hollers of slaves working, andimitation of white man music [24].The 1862 presidential Emancipation Proclamationthat was in effect in 1863 did not change the slave statusovernight, and many African Americans lived in fearand without jobs for many years afterward due toracism. Against this background, blues music prospered.It is not surprising, however, to see that the lyrics of many early blues songs are about sadness, “personal woes in a world of harsh reality: a lost love, the crueltyof police officers, oppression at the hands of white folk,hard times ” [25]. This sadness was to be combined laterwith the angst and yearning that would define rock androll and pop music.Should it be surprising, then, that pop music has adifferent harmonic progression? The tonal music of theeighteenth century is one manifestation of the Age ofEnlightenment, the time when humans celebrated the power of logic and reason. The descending fifth progression reflects the physics of sound, so to speak,and thus fulfilled the aesthetic need of the period. Butcertainly, this fulfilling progression is not suitable to themusic th at needs to portray “harsh reality,” “lost love,”and “oppression.” To reflect them, blues musicians opted for the opposite direction, favoring the dominant-subdominant instead of dominant-tonic progression. Thelove was unfulfilled in the harsh world, so to doanything else would be a lie. Thus, the chord progression of the second half of the twelve-bar bluesform is I-V-IV-I, and the reversal of the standard I-IV-V-I progression of art music. Yes, the theory and physics are still the same, but the mournful lyricsdemand this retrograde progression. And their legacyhas continued to this day in pop music. 3. CONCLUSION Writers tasked with a cross-disciplinary subject arealways at risk of being overly technical or overlysuperficial regarding the content. Likewise, being amusician discussing music matter among linguists mademe careful of using too technical concepts. With manydouble-degree or dual-major programs in many schoolstoday, perhaps researchers and scholars in the future cancross the boundaries between specialized areas better.This discussion is expected to help in seeing the potential of cross-disciplinary study, especially inrelated fields such as music and language. In addition, itis hoped that this discussion will help in seeing the parallel between the two art forms, whether in terms oflarge-scale structures such as ABA or detailedcomponents as when we compare the syntaxes of musicand language. Most importantly, this research willhopefully aid to see that by taking the time to observeother art forms or any human endeavors, people placethemselves on an unfamiliar path. 3 дослідження: Music and Lyric Characteristics of Popular Dutch Funeral Songs. Waldie E. Hanser, Ruth E. Mark, and Ad J. J. M. Vingerhoets. Music is an inextricable part of current Dutch funerals. Since the end of the 20th century, the selection of music played during cremations in the Netherlands has become increasingly personalized and thus more diverse (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018; Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). This development is partly due to technical improvements in crematoria that enable them to meet personal music requests by the deceased and bereaved more easily than before when standard sets of songs were more commonplace (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018). Music selection is currently a standard part of most funeral planning. Funeral homes offer advice on how and what music to select and even provide playlists and multimedia links on their websites as examples. The bereaved can experience the music selection process, sometimes after the wishes of or in agreement with the deceased, as comforting (Viper et al., 2020). Funeral music may serve different purposes during the ceremony. Bruin-Mollenhorst (2020) distinguishes the following (1) those that serve the ceremony itself (background music when entering or leaving the ceremony room, or while watching pictures of the deceased), (2) music in between speeches that illustrates or empowers their contents, (3) music that gives expression to the identity of the deceased (the favorite music of the deceased; music that represents aspects of the relationship of the bereaved to the deceased or aspects of the deceased’s identity), (4) emotional control and evoking emotions (music that allows the bereaved to give in to their emotions, or to regain their composure), and (5) lastly, music that we listen to without any discernible objectives. These goals fit in well with general psychological functions of music (Schäfer et al., 2013), more precisely: music listening (1) as self-awareness (e.g., music expresses or confirms some part of one’s identity), (2) to bolster social relatedness (e.g., to feel connected with other people), (3) as mood and emotion regulation (e.g., to feel relaxed). Most music in modern funerals in some way represents the deceased and honors their memory. In these cases, it serves as a musical eulogy (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). Bruin-Mollenhorst (2020) argues that, although lyrics may play a role in the music selection process, for the musical praise, the song texts are often less important than the song as a whole and even less so than the way the entire song connects to the deceased. Contrary to speeches, popular song lyrics are not written explicitly for the deceased, implying that, at most, only some words, a mere sentence, the title, or nothing of the lyrics at all may directly associate with the deceased (Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020). This does, however, not exclude the possibility that there are recurring words, linguistic properties, or themes that are common in the lyrics of popular funeral music that may make some songs particularly suited to serve this function. Furthermore, it does not explain why certain songs are, despite the increasingly personalized nature of funerals (Bruin-Mollenhorst & Hoondert, 2018), used quite frequently during funerals. In addition to investigating musical aspects, a linguistic analysis of the song texts may reveal why some songs more often serve as funeral music than others. The aim of the current study is twofold, (1) we seek to replicate and expand upon previous findings on the characteristics of funeral music, and (2) we analyze the lyrics of a selection of funeral songs popular in the Netherlands. Music Characteristics and Lyrics Recently, Mollenhorst and colleagues (2016) examined music characteristics (valence, energy, and tempo) of often-used songs in Dutch crematoria. Based on data from audio analyses, funeral music (N = 3703 songs) was shown to be lower in valence, tempo, and energy than two popular comparison playlists (Top 40 and Top 2000). This resulted in the characterization of funeral music as solemn, serene, and tender. It is, however, unclear which specific parts of a song evoke these emotions since these investigators considered the songs as a whole and did not study the lyrics separately. Analyzing the song as a whole may make sense because, as a listener, it is difficult to separate the impact of the melody from the lyrics. However, considering song texts separately may also prove valuable since the lyrics can substantially contribute to the emotional experience of music and are a way for listeners to relate to songs. Previous studies have yielded mixed results regarding the question as to whether the melody or the song text is mainly responsible for the emotions reported while listening to music (see Ali & Peynircioğlu, 2006 for an overview). However, the research findings of these authors suggested that a song’s melody is the dominant determinant, though lyrics can contribute substantially to the emotions perceived in the song. More specifically, they demonstrated that emotion in response to sad and angry music accompanied by emotionally matching lyrics is more intense. In contrast, in the case of happy and calm music, emotionally congruent lyrics may reduce the intensity of the feelings. Brattico and colleagues (2011) replicated the finding that happy music without lyrics results in stronger positive emotions than happy music with lyrics. In an fMRI study, Brattico et al. (2011) further found more extensive brain activation, particularly in the limbic system, when listening to sad music with lyrics as opposed to without, and happy music without as opposed to with lyrics. Lyrics seem to play a more prominent role when listening to sad music, while music characteristics may be of greater importance when listening to happy music. Lastly, the processing of lyrics may be deeper when accompanied by sad music than in the case of happy music (Fiveash & Luck, 2016). Emotionally congruent lyrics thus intensify sad music, while the opposite is true for happy music. This intensification may partly explain the attraction most people have for sad music for mood-regulatory purposes (e.g., Garrido, 2017; Van den Tol & Edwards, 2013; Van den Tol, 2016). Individuals apply mood regulation techniques to improve their moods. When employing music for this purpose, listeners typically prefer music that best reflects the mood they are in (e.g., Van den Tol, 2016). It is mainly the lyrics of sad music that help listeners to relate and connect to it (Eerola et al., 2015; Van den Tol & Edwards, 2013; Van den Tol, 2016). In general, lyrics may thus be particularly salient to the listeners’ mood, and they may strongly reflect the situation the music is heard in (Baltazar et al., 2019). Funeral music’s lower valence, energy, and tempo than popular music (Mollenhorst et al., 2016) suggests it will sound sad (Schellenberg & Von Scheve, 2012). Funeral music lyrics may follow this trend and contain more negative words and more words that express sadness. Several recent survey and interview studies further exemplify the importance of lyrics to mood regulation through music and specific peak emotional experiences. Song texts are particularly relevant to listeners who seek consolation through music, although the melody and music characteristics are more important (Hanser et al., 2016; Saarikallio & Erikkilä, 2007; Ter Bogt et al., 2017). Lyrics further play a role in the experience of chills (Bannister, 2020) and crying over music (Cotter et al., 2019; Hanser et al., 2021), especially when negative emotions accompany the crying episodes (Cotter et al., 2019). This further exemplifies a connection between sadness and the relevance of lyrics. Personal meaning or memories triggered by a song may contribute more to crying over music than its music characteristics or its lyrics separately (Cotter et al., 2019; Hanser et al., 2021). The studies mentioned above, however, did not investigate the properties of song texts. Linguistic Properties and Lyrical Content of Popular Music Song texts thus certainly play a significant role in the emotions evoked by and perceived in music. However, their linguistic properties and content have received little attention from researchers, particularly when considering specific situations, such as funeral rites, or for personal uses like mood regulation. Yet, an analysis of happy and sad song texts with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (LIWC; Pennebaker et al., 2015) revealed several intriguing differences. More precisely, sad songs contained more negatively valenced words, particularly expressions of sadness and anger, while happy songs included more positively valenced words. Further, happy songs had more words in the present tense than sad songs (Garrido, 2017, p. 24–25). The use of specific personal pronouns may be of further relevance to the (social) functions of popular music lyrics. Specifically, more second-person pronouns (you, yours) have been linked to increased song liking and commercial success, primarily when these second-person pronouns refer to “you” as the object of a sentence (Packard & Berger, 2020). The underlying idea is that “you” makes listeners think of a person significant to them, which may, in turn, help lyrics bolster social relatedness (Packard & Berger, 2020). Alternatively, the use of first-person singular pronouns (I, me, mine) in lyrics and personal writing is associated with a focus on the self, while first-person plural pronouns (we, us) are an indicator of emphasis on social relationships (DeWall et al., 2011; Rude et al., 2004; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010). DeWall and colleagues (2011) showed an increase in first-person singular pronouns, a decrease in first-person plural pronouns, and a reduction in positive and social words in lyrics between 1980 and 2007. This finding suggests that song texts became more individualistic and less positive as popular music evolved. First-person plural pronouns are, however, in general not used very often in song texts of popular music (DeWall et al., 2011; Packard & Berger, 2020). Thematically, the lyrics of most popular music deal with romantic relationships (Christenson et al., 2019), while only roughly 10% of songs cover topics surrounding family and friends. Songs that explicitly mention death and dying are rare, although these topics are dealt with more frequently as popular music evolves. Funeral music is likely to contain references to romantic relationships or family and friends. The Present Study The present study looks at both the music and linguistic characteristics of frequently used songs during Dutch funerals. We compare the properties of funeral song texts to a control selection that consists of popular songs by the same artists. To this end, we formulated the following research questions and related hypotheses: 1. The first focus is on music characteristics. We expect to replicate findings by Mollenhorst et al. (2016) on music characteristics. We thus expect to find lower valence, energy, tempo, and danceability values and higher values of acousticness for funeral music than for control songs. Funeral music will further consist of more songs in major than minor key. These values on music characteristics correspond more to sad than to happy music. We additionally analyzed the lyrics. Regarding linguistical properties, we assume lyrics of funeral music to resemble lyrics of sad music. Given the social role of music during funerals, we further expect pronouns, temporal focus, and specific topics to reflect this function. 2. Funeral music contains more negative and less positive words than control songs. Funeral music further focuses less on the present and more on the past than control music. 3. We hypothesize that funeral music contains fewer first-person singular pronouns and more first-person plural and second-person pronouns than control songs. Family and friends, as well as topics surrounding death and religion, are expected to be mentioned more often in funeral songs. Lastly, since popular music often focuses on romantic relationships, we anticipate frequent words related to this subject. We have no reason to expect a difference between these words for funeral or control songs. Method Materials Song Selection and Lyrics The selection of songs was based on lists of frequently used songs during funerals, burials, and other farewell rites. These lists are from Dutch websites1 of (insurance) companies (Dela, 2021; RVS Grafmonumenten, 2021; Uitvaartverzekering Vergelijken Loont, 2021) that provide services to organize or finance funerals. We consulted these websites in 2017, 2020, and 2021. We limited our selection to songs with Dutch or English lyrics. The control selection contained songs by the same artists as the funeral song selection. This selection was based on a song’s popularity on Spotify: we picked (according to Spotify) the most popular song by the same artist. If this piece of music was also present in the funeral selection, the second-most popular was chosen. We have attempted to always use a target and a control song by the original artist in the case of cover songs. Our primary focus was on English songs since they formed a more significant part of the popular funeral songs than Dutch ones. The complete selection consisted of 206 songs with lyrics in English (103 funeral and 103 control) and 94 songs with lyrics in Dutch (47 funeral and 47 control). We gathered the song lyrics from Genius.com (Genius, 2021) or comparable lyric depositories if the texts were not available from this website (e.g., Muzikeum.eu; Muzikum, 2021). Texts were manually spell-checked and prepared for analyses through LIWC and tidytext (e.g., goin’ was changed into going). The total number of words was: English funeral 22098, English control 26563 (Total 48661), Dutch funeral 11531, Dutch control 12445 (Total 23976) Software Music Characteristics Data on music characteristics were collected from the Spotify website (Spotify for Developers, 2021) through the Application Program Interface (API). Similar to the Mollenhorst and colleagues (2016) data, these audio analyses consider songs as a whole. The API was accessed through the R-package spotifyR (Thompson et al., 2017). We collected information on a track’s acousticness (‘a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of the degree to which the track is acoustic’), danceability (‘a value from 0.0 to 1.0 that measures how danceable a track is based on several factors, including tempo, rhythm, beat’), energy (‘perceptual measure from 0.0 to 1.0 on how intense and active a track is’), tempo (‘the overall estimated track tempo in beats per minute (BPM)’), mode (‘track modality 0 = minor, 1 = major’), and valence (‘measure from 0.0 to 1.0 on musical positiveness conveyed by a track’) (Spotify for Developers, 2021). Lyrical Properties Lyrics were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (LIWC2015; Pennebaker et al., 2015). LIWC counts words based on classifications in a dictionary with reliable psychometric properties and returns these values as percentages of the word total (Pennebaker et al., 2015). This program has been used before in the analyses of song lyrics (e.g., DeWall et al., 2011; Garrido, 2017; Packard & Berger, 2020; Petrie et al., 2008). We used the in-built English dictionary to analyze English lyrics (Pennebaker et al., 2015), whereas Dutch lyrics were assessed with the available Dutch dictionary (Boot et al., 2017). Due to these dictionary differences, we considered Dutch and English songs separately. The word categories we investigated were: pronouns (first-person singular/plural, second-person), temporal orientation (past, present, future), emotional valence (positive, negative), discrete emotional categories (anger, anxiety, sadness), and specific topics (friends, family, death, religion). We explored word sentiment with the R-package tidytext (Silge & Robinson, 2016) and the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (Mohammad & Turney, 2013). Tidytext assigns words into emotional categories based on a lexicon and returns these values as word frequencies. Our focus with tidytext is on words responsible for positive and negative affect. Statistical Analyses We performed a series of independent sample t-tests to look for differences between the two selections. We additionally report the effect-size Cohen’s d (small 0.2, medium 0.5, and large 0.8; Cohen, 1988). Analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS 23.0 and R 4.0.4 (R Core Team, 2021). Results Music Characteristics The analyses of the music characteristics (see Table 1) revealed several significant differences between funeral music and control songs. Valence, energy, and danceability were significantly lower for the funeral songs than for the control selection. Funeral songs were also more acoustic and more often in a major key than control songs. The effect-sizes varied from medium to large. There were no statistically significant differences in tempo.

Music characteristics of the Dutch selection followed a similar pattern as the English-sung tracks. However, most effects were smaller: Dutch funeral songs also scored lower on valence, energy, and danceability. Acousticness and tempo did not differ significantly, although a similar pattern as in the English selection with funeral music being more acoustic was observed. There was no difference between the distribution of major and minor key for Dutch songs. Analyses of Lyrics with LIWC We investigated the total word count, pronouns, sentiment, temporal focus, social connections, and topics using the LIWC software (Tables 2 and 3). Funeral lyrics in both English and Dutch songs contained fewer words than the control songs, but this difference was only significant for the English songs. In both languages, there was substantial variability in lyric length. Moreover, most personal pronouns were first-person singular, followed by second-person pronouns. First-person plural pronouns were rare. First-person singular and plural pronouns did not differ significantly between selections. In contrast, second-person pronouns were significantly more common in English funeral lyrics compared to control songs. A comparable, non-significant pattern was present for Dutch lyrics. Table 2.

Positive words were more frequent than negative words for both languages in both funeral and control songs. Words specifically related to discrete categories of anger, anxiety, and sadness were uncommon. English funeral lyrics contained significantly more words related to sadness than controls. Dutch funeral lyrics showed a trend towards less positive emotion words compared to Dutch control lyrics. Overall, Dutch lyrics were less, albeit not significantly, positive and contained more words in discrete negative emotion categories than the English selection. Regarding temporal focus, lyrics in both selections focused on the present with fewer words relating to the past or future. Nevertheless, both Dutch and English funeral lyrics contained more words associated with the future than control songs. However, it should be noted that the English 2015 dictionary (Pennebaker et al., 2015) uses a slightly different algorithm than the Dutch 2007-dictionary to determine words related to temporal perspectives. This may partly explain the fewer overall words related to temporal focus in Dutch song texts. Words referring to family and friends, as well as words related to the topics of religion and death, were rare for both funeral and control songs in both languages. On the other hand, there were significantly more family-related words in English control songs than in the funeral lyrics. Dutch funeral lyrics contained significantly more words related to religion than controls, and there was a similar, although non-significant, trend for death-related words. Significant effects for word categories were small to medium in size. Analyses of Lyrics with Tidytext Lastly, we investigated which words contributed to lyric sentiment in the English funeral and control selection only (Table 4) through the R-package tidytext with the NRC Lexicon. As in the LIWC-analyses, positive words were more prevalent than negative words for both funeral and control. Positive words reflected more warmth and positivity, while negative words were colder and expressed loneliness. Although Love is the most common positive word in both conditions, it occurred more frequently in the funeral songs. When combined with the derived loving, it makes up over 25% in the funeral songs instead of 16% in the control songs. Table 4. Most frequently used positive and negative words in funeral and control lyrics. Funeral Control Positive Negative Positive Negative N = 1147 N N = 642 N N = 1464 N N = 921 N Love 252 Words 33 Love 207 Leave 30 Sun 53 Feeling 31 Baby 123 Lord 27 Loving 37 Cry 20 Dance 71 Words 23 Feeling 31 Lonely 20 Good 43 Feeling 22 Baby 27 Leave 19 Alive 32 Pain 20 True 26 Cold 15 Master 29 Blind 19 Star 21 Darkness 14 Lord 27 Cry 17 Darling 20 Fall 14 Sun 27 Dust 17 Word 20 Lost 13 Loving 26 Alien 16 Good 19 Wait 13 Beautiful 25 Lonely 16 Discussion This study aimed to gain insight into the music and linguistical characteristics of songs popular at Dutch funeral rites. To this end, we explored and compared music and linguistic features of funeral songs and popular control songs by the same artist. To our knowledge, there has been no previous research into the linguistic characteristics of funeral songs. Nevertheless, based on investigations into the song texts of English popular music in general, we expected the use of pronouns in funeral lyrics to show a focus on others and less so on the self (DeWall et al., 2011; Packard & Berger, 2020; Rude et al., 2004; Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010). We further hypothesized them to be negative, less positive, and less focused on the present (Garrido, 2017) and to contain more words concerning relationships and death-related topics (Christenson et al., 2019). As expected, funeral songs scored lower on valence and energy, and there was a trend for them to be lower in tempo than control songs. They were also often in a major key. These results corroborate previous findings on funeral music characteristics (Mollenhorst et al.,2016)2, thus confirming funeral music’s characterization as sounding solemn, serene, and tender. Moreover, funeral music scored higher on acousticness and lower on danceability than control songs. The higher acousticness emphasizes vocals and lyrics (for example, Eric Clapton’s Tears in Heaven). Differences in these measures were less substantial for Dutch songs compared to English ones. Future work may wish to consider if cultural differences contribute to this discrepancy. The findings further support our hypothesis that funeral lyrics are more social and sadder than control song lyrics. Regarding pronouns, first-person pronouns (I, me, mine) were the most common personal pronouns in funeral lyrics, but their frequency is not exceptionally high compared to findings in popular music in general (DeWall et al., 2011, p. 202). Given the frequent use of second-person pronouns (you, yours; Packard & Berger, 2020), it can be concluded that funeral lyrics are, as expected, more focused on others than on the self. This was particularly the case for English funeral songs, which contained more second-person pronouns than the artist-matched control songs. As stated before, frequent use of second-person pronouns has been linked to an increase in song liking and commercial success (Packard & Berger, 2020), particularly when the second-person pronoun serves as the object in a sentence (e.g., “Still loving you”). In these cases, it is suggested that listeners do not interpret the content of the lyrics as addressed to themselves by the artist. Instead, they transfer this lyrical content from themselves to a significant other (Packard & Berger, 2020). This seems particularly relevant for funeral music, in which the lyrics may serve as final words or as a farewell from the bereaved to the deceased. Here, song texts may help give voice to what the bereaved are feeling and empower them. Interestingly, this transference does not seem to be limited to sentences containing second-person pronouns but may also apply to sentences with first-person singular pronouns, as exemplified in qualitative research by Viper and colleagues (2020, p. 11): listeners may apply these first-person singular song texts to their own situation, or the lyrics in first-person become more likely essential when sung by a significant other. Additional research may also consider if the bereaved experience parts of the song lyrics as addressed to them when the music was chosen by the deceased and was meant to reflect the relationship with them. Lastly, as in previous research on popular music lyrics in general (DeWall et al., 2011; Packard & Berger, 2020), first-person plural pronouns (we, us) are less common. The frequency of these words in our funeral selections did not differ significantly from the frequency in the control songs, although a non-significant trend was observed. Interestingly, we found less use of first-person singular pronouns in Dutch control songs than in funeral lyrics, but sources for comparison are unavailable. The pattern for first-person plural and second-person pronouns in Dutch lyrics is like English lyrics but less substantial for second-person pronouns. The music characteristics of the funeral songs (i.e., low valence and energy) point towards funeral music sounding “more negative.” Nevertheless, we failed to find substantial differences in the prevalence of negative words between funeral songs and controls, and words of discrete emotional categories of anger and anxiety were rare. Words of the sadness category were significantly more frequent in English funeral lyrics than in controls, thus supporting the idea that funeral lyrics express more sadness. Both English and Dutch selections contained more positive words than negative ones, although, in Dutch, positive words were less frequent in the funeral than in the control selection. Overall, the Dutch lyrics were somewhat less positive and contained more words in the anger, anxiety, and sadness categories, pointing to potential differences in the selection process of songs in a native and foreign language. The emotional valence and discrete emotional categories of lyrics, and thus the song texts themselves, may matter more when choosing funeral music in a native tongue. Cultural differences may further play a role and deserve further study. The current results on the emotional word categories thus do not fully match previous research findings on lyrics of happy and sad music (Garrido, 2017): funeral lyrics are not necessarily emotionally negative lyrics. Further support for this conclusion comes from the temporal focus of the song texts. We found no difference in focus on the past between funeral and control songs. While, overall, there was a greater reference to the past than to the future in general and an even greater focus on the present, we instead found that funeral lyrics, both in English and Dutch, focused more on the future than their artist-matched controls. Examples of this future focus, according to LIWC, are “I will always love you,” “You’ll never walk alone,” and “We’ll meet again.” These examples combine our findings on first and second-person pronouns with a future focus, and further demonstrate the potential social-bonding nature of song texts. We speculate that these parts of lyrics, which are likely to be found in the song’s title and chorus, convey strong emotional messages that may be central as to why some songs are more suitable as funeral music than others. This connects with Bruin-Mollenhorst’s concept of the musical eulogy (2020), in which only part of the lyrics may apply to the deceased or a funeral setting. We further suggest that the emphasis and repetitive nature of these messages as chorus may play an additional role in the choice for these songs. Future research should look further into the musical and linguistic properties of a song’s chorus, specifically in relation to specific uses. Future studies may also wish to consider the meaning of this future focus within the funeral setting: does it, for instance, provide listeners with hope of an afterlife, or does it perhaps help them come to terms with the finality of death? Lastly, references to death, religion, and friends or family were rare. This could be anticipated based on the thematic analyses of popular songs by Christenson and colleagues (2019). There are not many songs that explicitly deal with these topics. Romantic relationships are, by far, the most common theme in popular music, and words responsible for the affective quality of both English funeral and control songs dealt with this topic. Explicit mentions of “love” (we made no distinction between love as a noun or verb) or a derivative are the most common in both selections, however, more so for funeral lyrics. Follow-up analyses should determine if there is a difference in the type of love, for instance, love of a more spiritual, emotional, or physical nature. To conclude, we found considerable differences in music and linguistic characteristics of funeral and non-funeral music that may contribute to the choice of these songs for this specific function. Differences in music properties are more substantial than those for linguistic features. It may thus be easier to relate music characteristics to specific uses and functions of music than features of the lyrics. Limitations Several critical comments can be made regarding the applied method. Word count software does not look at the context of words or specific relationships between them. We further only considered some specific word categories, while others may also be important, for instance, words relating to cognitive processes (“never,” “always”), and questions (i.e., “Who wants to live forever?”). Future studies may wish to focus on other categories and word relationships. For our selection of control songs, we depended on their availability on Spotify. A possible issue of concern regards the values of the music characteristics since it is not clear how the results provided by Spotify for Developers (2021), such as danceability, valence, and acousticness, are compiled (see Howlin & Rooney, 2020 for a discussion), stressing the need for more empirical research into their construct validity. Other studies that have used these measures have, however, found differences and patterns that correspond to what one might expect given previous knowledge on music and its uses (e.g., Baltazar et al., 2019; Baltazar & Västfjäll, 2020; Howlin & Rooney, 2020; Vidas et al., 2021). A further limitation is our small sample size, especially of Dutch lyrics. Word count software becomes more reliable when more data are available (Pennebaker et al., 2015). We focused on the most frequently used funeral songs instead of on a full funeral home songbook. A full songbook would provide more songs, but it is unclear how popular these songs are as funeral music in general. Including more songs may reveal more differences between funeral songs and (artist-matched) controls. Mollenhorst and colleagues (2016), for example, used a funeral home songbook and compared this to the Dutch Top 2000 and Top 40 popular song lists. It appeared that many of the most frequently used funeral songs, as well as of the control songs were also included in the annual editions of the Dutch Top 2000. Specific artists, music characteristics, as well as linguistic properties, may make these songs particularly popular for multiple functions. This may explain some of the minor differences in terms of linguistic categories. However, this can also be considered a strength of our current study; our selection of popular songs showed apparent differences depending on their specific use. This bolsters the idea that musical and linguistic features also contribute to this choice despite idiosyncratic listener preferences to use songs for particular functions. Lastly, in the present work, we considered funeral music as a homogenous category of songs. Still, there is sufficient reason to assume that subcategories exist that may depend on, for example, the preference of the deceased, the bereaved, the moment the music is played during the ceremony, culture, as well as various specifics related to the deceased such as their age, relationship to the bereaved and more. Future studies should investigate these more detailed subcategories further. In conclusion, the current study confirms and expands the modest present knowledge on the characteristics of funeral music based on musical and textual features. The terms solemn, serene, and tender are indeed the keywords to describe the musical properties of this music. Specific word categories may also play a role in determining the utility of songs to serve as funeral music. However, the role of personal preferences and musical features may be more significant than the role of lyrics. Our findings on lyrics underscore their importance in expressing social connections with others (Schäfer et al., 2013). The current study stresses the importance of considering musical, linguistic, and personal properties when relating music to specific (emotional) uses and functions. As such, we hope that our study stimulates other researchers to continue this line of research to achieve a greater understanding of the role of music in funeral rites and the possible determining mechanisms. 4 дослідження: METAPHORS OF DEATH IN THE LYRICS OF SENTENCED. Bachelor’s thesis Paula Hirvonen. Death is going to a final destination For the fourth category, Death is going to a final destination, there is again example from the song “We Are but Falling Leaves”. “Eventually all the paths will lead to the cemetery” is quite an explicit statement of people’s immortality and how all life will eventually come to an end. Death is inevitable for people, and in this metaphor, life or life path has been replaced with “the paths”, and death has been replaced with “the cemetery”. In this way, we can interpret the metaphor in a way that eventually all lives will end to death. “The cemetery” as a final destination implies grave in earth and being buried after death, and not just a place to visit. “Eventually all the paths will lead to the cemetery” could also be seen as an intertextual reference to a common saying “all roads lead to Rome”. Here “roads” have been replaced with life paths and the city with the cemetery, but the same idea is still behind that no matter where life takes us, we all will eventually end up in one specific place. Another example of this category can be found in the song “Lower the Flags”: “Lower the flags / A good man has passed / He has reached the last of frontiers”. A flag lowered to half mast is a common custom honouring someone who has died and frontiers are boundaries or boarders between two things. Here, the first two lines describe in a rather straightforward manner that someone has died. In the last line, the lyrics present an idea of line between life and death and that the person the lyrics are discussing has passed this line from life to death. The word “reached” implies that this “last of frontiers” is something people head for in a way that death is something we all are going towards to in our lives. 4.5 Death is the end of life’s journey The fifth category, Death is the end of life’s journey, is derived from the metaphor Life is a journey, which can be understood in a way that being born is the start of life’s journey, living is the progress of this journey, and the end of the journey is death. The song “No One There” has an example “The feeling I have come to the end of my road”. Here we can interpret that the narrator feels that their death is drawing near in a sense that life has lost its meaning and the narrator is considering suicide. For this interpretation to make sense, it is helpful to look at the preceding lyrics: “The axe, the bottle and the rope / The feeling there really is no more hope / The thought of the great unknown / And facing it all alone / The dark, the silent and the cold / The feeling I have come to the end of my road / Yes, these are the things I spend / my remaining moments with”. The axe, the bottle, the rope, and the feeling of hopelessness can be interpreted as indication of suicide, as these are common tools and mindset for committing suicide. “Facing it all alone” can be considered as another hint of dying alone, as “it” can be seen to refer to “the great unknown”, which is a common metaphor for death. “Yes, these are the things I spend / my remaining moments with” is another indication that the narrator seems to be aware of death that is impending, and that he knows how limited the time is before death. In the song “No One There” we have another example “The feeling of finally coming back home”. This is an example with similar idea between Death is the end of life’s journey and Life is a flame, as we can understand life’s journey the same way as candle that is lit. First not being alive before we are born, on the second stage being alive after we are born, and then again on the last stage not being alive after we have died. With this life cycle idea in mind, we can consider “finally coming back home” being a metaphor for returning from life’s journey into nothingness that is before and after life. If we understand this excerpt as a metaphor of death, the word “finally” implies that this impending death is anticipated and relieving just like returning home from a long journey. If we keep this idea of comparing coming home after a long journey to dying after life’s journey comes to an end, we see that there is another category this example can be divided into: Death is going home. This category was my own creation and as this was not the only occurrence of the home being death theme, I felt that this was significant and needed a subcategory of its own. The combination of Death is the end of life’s journey and Death is going home can also be seen in the song “Aika multaa muistot [Everything is Nothing]” where we have an excerpt: “For my name is sorrow and I’m friend of misery / I deprived myself of love for eternal agony / And I don’t even dare to try – I know I can only lose / Between this life I live and nothing I have to choose / Take me home / To the one I belong”. In this example, the melancholic and discouraged description of life reveals the narrator’s attitude towards life, and we can interpret that the narrator has chosen “nothing”, that can be understood as death or suicide, over living. Here, “Take me home” can be seen as a wish to die and that the narrator feels that death is the only option in his position. There is a similar sense of longing and relieving as in the previous example with the word “finally”, and a sense of returning to something one has waited for. Death is the end of life’s journey has two other examples which combine also other metaphors. The song “Lower the Flags” has a metaphor “Your journey’s over, night descends”. This example combines A lifetime is a day and Death is the end of life’s journey metaphors. Here we can interpret that “your journey” is a journey of life that has come to an end and therefore indicates death. “Night descends” also implies that death is upon, as in A lifetime is a day metaphors death is the night. The second example of combining this category with another one is in the song “End of the Road”: “Here we are, now lay the burden down / We’re coming to the end of our road”. The latter part is obviously in Death is the end of life’s journey category as it is very similar with the previous examples, but the first part represents the metaphor Life is a burden. According to Lakoff and Turner (1989, 25), this metaphor is coherent with Life is a journey if we comprehend it through the metaphor Difficulties are burdens; life’s difficulties can be compared to physical burden on a journey, and if we think of life as one constant difficulty, then we can see the whole life as a burden. Looking at how the lyrics continue, we can see that letting go of this burden of life is implied to be comforting and welcome: “Here we are, now lay the burden down / We’re coming to the end of our road / Sorrowful yet glorious somehow / To be humming this one last ode / So calm and still…it wasn’t all that bad or was it now? / Fulfilled… it doesn’t only hurt to end it now / The funeral”. This excerpt can be understood as being relieved from or letting go of the burden of life and dying. The imperative form of the verb “lay” and the first person plural pronoun indicate that death does not have to be lonesome and forceful but a welcoming and comforting end. This example gives death a sense of relief and comfort after carrying the burden of life through the long journey of life. “Sorrowful yet glorious somehow / To be humming this one last ode” can be interpret as the final moments before death and how death is at the same time something to wait for and yet still to feel wistful of. 5 CONCLUSION The main aim in this thesis was to study the metaphors of death in the lyrics of Sentenced and answer my two research questions: “What kind of metaphors of death are used in the lyrics of Sentenced?” and “How can these metaphors be categorised?” The questions turned out to be rather difficult to answer straightforwardly as there were such a diverse set of metaphors of death. Besides the main categories A lifetime is a year, A lifetime is a day, People are plants, Death is going to a final destination and Death is the end of life’s journey I found two other categories Life is a flame and Life is a burden and created one new category Death is going home. These last three categories had only examples that were combinations with the main categories. The analysis demonstrates clearly that there are numerous metaphorical expressions for death in the lyrics of Sentenced. Most of the examples that I presented discuss death from a neutral point of view but there is a sense of finding death welcoming and relieving without encouraging suicide. Altogether many of the examples have a sense of accepting death as the end of a life cycle and it is only natural and inevitable for people. What I found in my analysis is that categorising the metaphors from the data was not as straightforward as I had presumed. Overall, I was able to identify 27 metaphors from the selected lyrics, yet there were several occasions where the categories overlapped and the metaphor had two or three categories that it could be applied into. A lifetime is a year, People are plants and Death is going to a final destination had all only two examples and there were no combinations in the examples. Death is the end of life’s journey seemed to be the most frequent of the categories but surprisingly this was only due to the combinations; this category had only one example that was solely in this category and the four other metaphors where combinations of Death is the end of life’s journey and other categories. A lifetime is a day category was also rather few in numbers as there was only one example metaphor that could be placed only in this category and two other examples that combined with Life is a flame metaphor. There were also metaphors that needed more surrounding lyrics as the metaphors or interpretations did not make sense without the broader view and the mindset that the other lyrics gave for that metaphor. Some of the categories were also used in Leikola’s (2009) thesis and for this reason and the similarity of the topics, some of the findings were the same. These metaphors of death that I presented in my research can be analysed through Lakoff and Turner’s (1989) research and some of them were rather similar to what they had presented as examples. Lakoff and Turner (1989) initially used these categories to analyse poems and everyday language and with this analysis, rather surprisingly, these categories proved to be applicable also in metal music lyrics. Thus, these categories seem to be applicable in other literary genres than what they were initially used for. This study adds to the linguistic study on lyrics (see also Leikola 2009) but focusing on one band has its limits and this study on metaphors of death does not provide results that could be generalized to the entire metal music genre and its lyrics. The scarce amount of studies on metal music lyrics is already a reason in itself to study the field more. The popularity of metal music proves that there is increasing interest on the topic, and metal music needs to be considered as a relevant field of study also in linguistics (also Leikola 2009), and not just in musicology. Linguistic study on lyrics can give the lyrics more prominent place both in music and in linguistics and they are not only seen as subordinates or servants for the music or inferior to poetry but more as an entity and a valuable genre of literary.","completion":"**Розділ курсової роботи “Пісні як частина мови”** Пісня — це унікальне явище, що існує у всіх суспільствах. Але способи, якими тексти та музика поєднуються між собою, способи передачі значень, а також те, як діяльність уписується у ширші контексти, значно варіюються від суспільства до суспільства. Вивчення пісенності залучає не лише музикологію, але й багато галузей лінгвістики: фонологію, поетику, морфологію, семантику та прагматику. Піснями виявляються високо структуровані художні форми, котрі мають здатність передавати складні асоціації значень поза повсякденною мовленою мовою [Barwick, 2000; Turpin, 2005; Fabb, 1997][1]. Вивчення пісні сприяє розумінню, як текст і музика формуються у проникливі та емоційні послання. Аналізуючи форму та структурну організацію пісень, виявляється, що пісенні тексти іноді належать до обмеженого словникового запасу та повинні відповідати певним ритмічним і мелодійним шаблонам. Вони можуть включати значущі контрасти у темпі, динамічному діапазоні та якості голосу. Також музична складова може мати свою власну структуру. Наприклад, пісні можуть мати ритмічний режим, де супровід на ударних інструментах виконується в іншому метрі, ніж співається голосом[Barwick et al., 2005][2]. Що стосується змісту, пісні часто надзвичайно складні для перекладу, оскільки їх текст може містити слова, які не увійшли до повсякденної мови, або можуть представляти концепти, складні для розуміння [Clunies Ross et al., 1987][3]. Музика та текст пісні можуть передавати різні типи значень складними способами. Де слова та музика сплітаються, щоб створити гармонійну єдність, що здатна викликати емоційні реакції у слухачів [Nancarrow et al., 2007][4]. Пісні допомагають людям виражати свої емоційні стани через музичні форми. Слова, пронесені у пісні, можуть стати справжньою підтримкою для слухача в період суму чи радості. У цьому контексті, пісня стає не просто художнім вираженням, але й формою соціальної взаємодії. Коли слова пісень стають особистими або пов'язуються з певними життєвими моментами, вони стають частиною мови, що спонукає досліджувати наші супільні і культурні відмінності [Saarikallio & Erikkilä, 2007][5]. Підсумовуючи, пісні як частина мови відкривають широкий спектр вивчення й аналізу відношення між текстильними та музичними складовими. Пісні пропонують багатий матеріал для лінгвістичних досліджень, в тому числі дослідження метафор, лексики та інших мовних особливостей, які можуть бути вживані в рамках різних культурних і соціальних контекстів.

Чем кабель 50 Ом лучше 75 Ом?","completion":"Волновое сопротивление – это параметр, который описывает как волны (например, электромагнитные или звуковые) распространяются по какой-либо среде, такой как кабель. Думай об этом, как о характеристике, которая определяет, насколько легко энергия волны проходит через кабель без отражений назад. Почему возникают отражения? Если волна переходит из одной среды с одним волновым сопротивлением в другую среду с другим волновым сопротивлением, часть энергии отражается обратно, как если бы ты кинул мяч в стену, и он отскочил бы обратно к тебе. Теперь о кабелях. Чаще всего кабели с волновым сопротивлением 50 Ом используются в радиосвязи и передаче данных, потому что они обеспечивают большую мощность сигнала и меньшие потери на передачу энергии. Т.е. они хороши, когда тебе нужно передавать большие мощности или данных на большие расстояния. Кабели 75 Ом обычно используются для телевизионного оборудования и кабельного телевидения. Они хороши для передачи сигналов с высокой четкостью на относительно короткие расстояния, поскольку имеют меньшие потери сигнала при высокой частоте. То, что один лучше другого, зависит от ситуации. Если нужно максимально уменьшить потери сигнала на высоких частотах – выберешь 75 Ом. Если тебе нужно передавать большие мощности – скорее всего, подойдёт 50 Ом.

The ULS is often governed by extreme events which are rare but plausible within the dock's life. In this case, the floating dock must flexurally carry these loads to the mooring piles, which anchor the dock and provide lateral stability. Here is a general approach to designing for ULS considering lateral loads: 1. Load Determination: - Determine the design wind speed for the region and calculate the wind loads according to relevant codes (e.g., ASCE 7, Eurocode 1). - Calculate berthing loads considering the size, type, and speed of the vessels which will be using the dock. Utilize standards such as EAU (German recommendations on static loads), PIANC, or local standards for guidance. - Consider additional lateral loads like the current, waves, ice, and seismic activity if applicable in the region. 2. Load Combination: - Combine these loads according to code recommendations for ultimate load factors. Loading combinations will typically involve factors that increase the loads for ULS design. 3. Structural Analysis: - Conduct a structural analysis (using methods such as finite element modeling) of the floating dock system. This analysis should consider the properties of the pontoons (material strength, section geometry, buoyancy characteristics) and how the loads are transferred through the dock to the mooring piles. - The analysis should also account for the flexural behavior of the dock and its ability to carry the imposed lateral loads to the piles without exceeding allowable stresses or experiencing excessive deflection. 4. Pile Design: - Design the mooring piles to resist the lateral loads transmitted by the dock. Typically, piles are analyzed for lateral load capacity using methods such as the p-y curve method or simplified approaches available in design codes. - Ensure the design accounts for the total mooring system, including connectors, fenders, and any allowance for energy absorption during berthing impacts. 5. Connection Design: - Design the connections between the dock and the piles carefully. These connections must handle the lateral loads as well as allow for vertical movement due to loading and environmental changes. 6. Serviceability Limit State (SLS): - In addition to the ULS, a design must also comply with Serviceability Limit State (SLS) criteria. While ULS concerns the prevention of failure, SLS ensures usability, limiting deformations, and vibrations within acceptable levels. 7. Factor of Safety: - Apply an adequate factor of safety as per design codes to ensure the structure’s integrity under ULS conditions. 8. Inspections and Testing: - Once the design is finalized, and construction is completed, perform inspections and testing to ensure the structure can handle the ULS loads as designed. 9. Regular Maintenance: - Establish a regular maintenance schedule to ensure the integrity of the floating docks, mooring piles, and all associated connections over time. Remember that the specific design approach can vary considerably based on local building codes, environmental conditions, expected usage, and the materials selected for the floating dock and its moorings. Consulting with a structural engineer experienced in marine structures is essential for ensuring a safe and effective design that meets all necessary codes and standards."},{"prompt":"show example with DETAILED calculations for each step","completion":"Due to the complexity of the process and the limitations of this platform, it's not feasible to provide detailed calculations for every step of the ULS design for a floating dock in this response. However, I can outline an example calculation for wind load, which is one step in the process. Let's calculate the wind load acting on a simple floating dock structure with two cylindrical pontoons using the ASCE 7-10 (Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures) as the design standard. Step 1: Determining basic wind speed (V): Assume that the basic wind speed ( V ) for the location is 100 miles per hour (mph). Step 2: Determine the exposure category: Assume the dock is located in Exposure Category C, which is typical for open terrain with scattered obstructions and water surfaces. Step 3: Determine the importance factor (( I )): Assume the dock is not essential, and therefore the importance factor ( I = 1.0 ). Step 4: Convert wind speed to pressure: The wind pressure ( q_z ) is given by: [ q_z = 0.00256 times K_z times K_{zt} times K_d times V^2 times I ] Where: - ( K_z ) is the velocity pressure exposure coefficient - ( K_{zt} ) is the topographic factor (we will assume it is 1.0 for flat terrain) - ( K_d ) is the wind directionality factor (assume it is 0.85) For simplicity, let's assume at 15 feet above the water, ( K_z = 0.85 ). Plugging in the values we get: [ q_z = 0.00256 times 0.85 times 1.0 times 0.85 times (100)^2 times 1.0 ] [ q_z = 0.00256 times 0.85 times 0.85 times 10000 ] [ q_z = 184.96 text{ psf (pounds per square foot)} ] Step 5: Determine the force on the surface: Estimate the size of the cylindrical pontoons' exposed area to wind load. Let's say each pontoon is 6 feet in diameter and 20 feet long. The area to consider for wind (projected area) is then: [ A = pi times d times L times n ] Where: - ( d ) is diameter (6 feet) - ( L ) is the length of the pontoon (20 feet) - ( n ) is the number of pontoons (2) [ A = pi times 6 times 20 times 2 ] [ A ≈ 753.98 text{ square feet} ] Step 6: Calculate the wind force (F): [ F = q_z times A times G ] Assume: - Gust factor coefficient ( G ) of 0.85 for simplicity. [ F = 184.96 text{ psf} times 753.98 text{ sf} times 0.85 ] [ F ≈ 118,555 text{ pounds} ] Step 7: Application to ULS design and verification. This result is the wind force that would be applied to the pontoons due to wind. The design would need to factor in the capacity of the pontoons to withstand these forces, the structural analysis of the dock, and, most importantly, how these forces will be transferred to the mooring piles, which must be designed to adequately resist these forces considering the pile-soil interaction. This basic example does not factor in all the complexities of real-world scenarios, such as dynamic analysis, actual shape consideration, 3D load path evaluation, and many other factors that would be critical in a true engineering scenario. For detailed and accurate ULS analysis, especially for complex structures like floating docks, professional software and specialist engineering input are typically required. An actual design would need to follow a rigorous process with proper engineering judgment and adhere strictly to local codes and regulation requirements."},{"prompt":"how to do ULS: lateral loads (wind, berthing) must span/be flexurally carried by floating docks to reach mooring piles for floating dock with two cylindrical pontoons under it. use straightforward elastic mechanics (compression/tension, flexure, shear to be based on A_shear = 0.5*A_gross)","completion":"Certainly! Please note that detailed structural engineering calculations for specific elements or structures such as floating docks often involve a variety of considerations, including material properties, geometric configurations, connection details, and dynamic effects. However, I can provide a simplified theoretical approach to demonstrate how ULS lateral loads from wind and berthing might be considered using basic principles of static analysis and elastic mechanics. For this example, let's focus on the global analysis of lateral loading on the floating dock system and how these loads are transmitted to the underlying pontoons and then to the mooring piles. **Step 1: Define Geometry and Material Properties** Let's assume the floating dock has the following dimensions and properties: - Length of the floating dock, ( L_{dock} ) - Breadth of the floating dock, ( B_{dock} ) - Diameter of each cylindrical pontoon, ( D_{pontoon} ) - Length of each cylindrical pontoon, ( L_{pontoon} ) - Number of pontoons, ( N_{pontoon} = 2 ) - Density of the pontoon material, ( rho ) - Elastic modulus of the pontoon material, ( E ) - Gross sectional area of the pontoon, ( A_{gross} ) - Shear area of the pontoon is taken as ( A_{shear} = 0.5 cdot A_{gross} ) - Assume that the pontoons are made of steel with ( E = 210 cdot 10^9 ) Pa and ( rho = 7850 ) kg/m³. **Step 2: Determine Design Lateral Loads** Determine the design lateral wind load and berthing load according to applicable codes and standards. Use simplified static analysis to calculate these loads. - Wind Load, ( F_{wind} ) - Berthing Load, ( F_{berthing} ) **Step 3: Load Combinations** Combine the wind and berthing loads for the ULS condition, typically using load factors specified by the relevant standard. For simplicity, assume load factors of 1.5 for wind load and 1.5 for berthing load for ULS: - ( F_{ULS} = 1.5 cdot F_{wind} + 1.5 cdot F_{berthing} ) **Step 4: Flexural Analysis of the Floating Dock** For a straightforward elastic analysis, you can model the floating dock as a beam supported by the two cylindrical pontoons. You'll need to determine the moment of inertia, ( I ) of the pontoons, and apply the lateral loads to see if the dock has adequate flexural capacity: - Calculate the moment of inertia ( I ) for one pontoon (assuming a circular section). - Calculate the maximum bending moment ( M ) assuming a simply supported beam with ULS loads applied at the worst-case location. **Step 5: Determine Stresses on the Pontoons** - Tensile/Compressive stress due to bending, ( sigma = frac{M}{S} ), where ( S ) is the section modulus of the pontoon. - Compare the calculated stress to the allowable stress for the material. **Step 6: Transfer Loads to Mooring Piles** - Shear force calculation: ( V = frac{F_{ULS}}{N_{pontoon}} ) - Check the shear stress ( tau = frac{V}{A_{shear}} ) and compare it to the allowable shear stress. **Step 7: Pile Design** Design mooring piles to resist the shear and moment from the dock. For simplicity, consider the piles as cantilever beams fixed in the seabed and subject to ULS lateral loads. Calculate the resultant stresses and pile deflection to ensure they are within acceptable limits. **Important Considerations:** - This is an extremely simplified example and should not be used for actual design purposes. - Realistic scenarios will involve dynamic effects, interaction with fluid forces, potential buckling of slender members, fatigue considerations, and compatibility with connection hardware. - Connections and hardware also need to be designed to accommodate the loads and resulting movements. - A rigorous design would include detailed finite element analysis and consider nonlinear and time-dependent material properties. For actual designs, especially those that could impact safety or involve significant costs, always engage a licensed professional engineer with experience in marine structural design. This response is only a broad overview intended for conceptual understanding and does not contain the depth or breadth required for safe and code-compliant engineering designs."},{"prompt":"show detailed calculations for each step. make up an example if you have to","completion":"Creating a complete, detailed example for ULS design incorporating wind and berthing loads for a floating dock supported by two cylindrical pontoons would be incredibly complex and beyond the scope of this platform. However, I can provide an abridged, conceptual example with simplified calculations for a single phase of the design. To keep calculations practical yet illustrative, I’ll focus on determining the resulting moment from lateral wind loads on the pontoons and how these are distributed to the mooring piles. This example will showcase fundamentals of statics and strength of materials while significantly condensing other steps. **Example: Simplified Wind Load Transmission to Pontoons** **Assumptions**: - Floating dock dimensions: Length ( L_{dock} = 30 ) m, Width ( B_{dock} = 10 ) m. - Cylindrical pontoons' dimensions: Length ( L_{pontoon} = 30 ) m, Diameter ( D_{pontoon} = 2 ) m. - Material for pontoons: structural steel with an Elastic modulus ( E = 210 ) GPa. - Wind load applied on the dock assumed uniformly distributed with a magnitude based on a simplification of ASCE 7: ( q_{wind} = 1.2 ) kPa (kilonewtons per square meter) acting on the broadside area of the dock for ULS. - Pontoons' spacing is symmetric about the center of the dock. - Pontoons are rigidly connected to the dock and mooring. **Step 1: Calculate Wind Load on the Dock** First, calculate the total wind force on the dock: Wind force ( F_{wind} = q_{wind} times B_{dock} times L_{dock} ) ( F_{wind} = 1.2 text{kN/m²} times 10 text{m} times 30 text{m} = 360 text{kN} ) **Step 2: Apply Wind Load to Pontoons** Wind load is distributed to the two pontoons. Each pontoon receives half of the total wind load: ( F_{pontoon} = frac{F_{wind}}{2} = frac{360 text{kN}}{2} = 180 text{kN} ) **Step 3: Calculate Induced Moments on Pontoons** With pontoons placed at the far ends of the dock (assumed for simplicity), each pontoon would act as a cantilever under the applied wind load. The maximum moment at the base of each pontoon will be: ( M_{pontoon} = F_{pontoon} times frac{B_{dock}}{2} ) ( M_{pontoon} = 180 text{kN} times frac{10 text{m}}{2} = 900 text{kNm} ) **Step 4: Assess Flexural Stress** Calculate the section modulus ( S ) of one pontoon: ( S = frac{pi (D_{pontoon}^3)}{32} ) ( S = frac{pi (2 text{m}^3)}{32} = 0.0982 text{m}^3 ) Then calculate the bending stress ( sigma_{bending} ) in the pontoon steel as: ( sigma_{bending} = frac{M_{pontoon}}{S} ) ( sigma_{bending} = frac{900 text{kNm}}{0.0982 text{m}^3} = 9,166 text{kN/m}^2 ) ( sigma_{bending} = 9.166 text{MPa} ) Check against the yield strength of steel (For example, ( sigma_{yield} = 250 text{MPa} )), ensuring a safety factor is included. **Step 5: Transfer Loads to Mooring Piles** Assuming each pontoon is moored by two piles, each pile would receive: ( F_{pile} = frac{F_{pontoon}}{2} = frac{180 text{kN}}{2} = 90 text{kN} ) Lateral load on each pile ( F_{lateral, pile} ) would equal ( F_{pile} ), and the induced moment at the seabed would be: ( M_{pile} = F_{lateral, pile} times L_{pontoon} ) ( M_{pile} = 90 text{kN} times 30 text{m} = 2,700 text{kNm} ) **Step 6: Pile Design Verification** Check the pile's capacity to resist bending. Calculate pile's stress and deflection. Compare against permissible values. *Please note*: 1. This example is highly simplified and does not represent an actual structural engineering scenario. 2. Comprehensive design would incorporate dynamic load factors, actual structural analysis (including FEA), buckling considerations, fatigue assessment, and more. 3. This scenario ignores some important aspects such as the method of analysis for berthing loads, considerations for shear forces, detailing of mooring systems, and connection design. 4. Local codes, regulations, and design practices must be followed in a real design scenario. Consultation with a structural engineer is crucial for real-world applications."},{"prompt":"why are you assuming pontoons acting as cantilever","completion":"You are correct; my assumption in the previous explanation that pontoons act as cantilevers for the wind load may have been misleading. In the case of a floating dock, the pontoons act as buoyant supports, not as cantilevers fixed in the seabed. Here's a revised approach to the problem, considering the pontoons as buoyant supports without any implication of cantilever action. In this example, we have two cylindrical pontoons supporting a floating dock subject to lateral loads (wind loads and berthing loads). We will calculate how those lateral loads are transferred through the pontoons to the mooring system, considering the pontoons provide flotation and are affixed to the dock structure. **Step 1: Calculate Wind Load on the Dock** Let's determine the wind force on the dock's superstructure, assuming a broadside area exposed to the wind: Wind force ( F_{wind} = q_{wind} times B_{dock} times H_{dock} ) Assuming: - Design wind pressure: ( q_{wind} = 1.2 ) kN/m² - Dock breadth: ( B_{dock} = 10 ) m - Dock height: ( H_{dock} = 5 ) m Then: ( F_{wind} = 1.2 text{ kN/m²} times 10 text{ m} times 5 text{ m} = 60 text{ kN} ) **Step 2: Distribute Wind Load to the Pontoons** Assuming the dock distributes the load evenly to both pontoons: ( F_{pontoon} = frac{F_{wind}}{2} = 30 text{ kN} ) **Step 3: Evaluate Pontoon Stability** The pontoons must be designed to resist overturning due to lateral loads. We calculate the overturning moment and then determine if the buoyancy and mooring system can counteract this moment. Overturning moment ( M_T ) at the pontoon level, assuming the wind load acts at half the dock height: ( M_T = F_{pontoon} times frac{H_{dock}}{2} = 30 text{ kN} times 2.5 text{ m} = 75 text{ kNm} ) **Step 4: Evaluate Mooring Pile Loads** The mooring piles must resist the equal and opposite restoring moment to prevent the dock from tipping or moving laterally. Assuming two mooring piles per pontoon, located at a distance ( L_{mooring} ) from the pontoon edges, each pile should resist half the pontoon's total overturning moment. Restoring force per pile ( F_{restoring} ): ( F_{restoring} = frac{M_T}{L_{mooring}} ) If, for example, the mooring piles are 8 meters apart (center to center), ( F_{restoring} = frac{75 text{ kNm}}{8 text{ m}} = 9.375 text{ kN} ) **Step 5: Safety Checks** Verify that the pontoons, connections, and mooring piles can safely resist the applied loads, accounting for possible amplification due to dynamic effects and ensuring that all design conditions remain below the material yield stress and are within acceptable deflection limits. In some designs, the pontoons can pivot around an axis, so the load transmission mechanism involves torsion as well as vertical buoyancy forces. The mooring system also provides resistance to lateral movement and helps to align forces through the connecting structures. A complete, accurate design would require a sophisticated analysis that includes pontoon hydrodynamics, the mooring system's dynamic response, material strength parameters, including yield and buckling considerations, and a review of the serviceability limits for the entire structure. This simplified example omits several practical aspects and should not be used as a basis for real-world engineering but rather illustrates the principle of load distribution in a floating structure. Always consult a qualified marine structural engineer for real applications."},{"prompt":"what about berthing loads","completion":"Berthing loads refer to the forces that a vessel exerts on a dock when it comes alongside to berth. These loads can include forces and moments caused by the ship's momentum, wind, current, and waves acting upon the vessel. In the ULS design, it is necessary to consider the extreme conditions that could generate the highest berthing loads. For the sake of simplicity in this example, I will consider only the static berthing load as a lateral force applied at a certain height above the pontoon. The dynamic impact forces, which may depend on factors like the type of fender system, vessel tonnage, and approach velocity, are excluded from this illustrative example. **Step 1: Determine Berthing Load** Let's assume the berthing load is caused by a vessel pushed against the dock by wind or current. - Berthing load: ( F_{berthing} ) **Step 2: Calculate Point of Load Application** Identify the height above the pontoons where the berthing load is typically applied. This is usually at the fender or docking interface level. - Point of application height from the pontoon: ( H_{berthing} ) **Step 3: Distribute Berthing Load to the Pontoons** For simplicity, let's assume that the berthing load is distributed evenly to the pontoons due to the dock's structural connections, helping distribute these loads across the structure: - Portion of the berthing force on each pontoon: ( F_{berthing, pontoon} = frac{F_{berthing}}{2} ) **Step 4: Calculate Resulting Moment from Berthing Load on Pontoons** The load application point's height above the pontoons will create a moment around the pontoons due to the berthing force. - Moment caused by berthing on each pontoon: ( M_{berthing, pontoon} = F_{berthing, pontoon} times H_{berthing} ) **Step 5: Assess Combined Effect of Wind and Berthing Loads** Now, consider the combined action of wind and berthing loads on each pontoon by assessing the total moment caused by both forces. - Total moment at each pontoon: ( M_{total, pontoon} = M_{wind, pontoon} + M_{berthing, pontoon} ) **Step 6: Evaluate Mooring Pile Loads from Combined Effects** Assuming each pontoon is moored by two piles as before, we would distribute the total overturning moment to the mooring piles. The restoring moment needed from each pile now has to counteract the sum of the moments due to wind plus berthing loads. - Restoring force per pile due to the combined effect: ( F_{restoring, combined} = frac{M_{total, pontoon}}{L_{mooring}} ) Let's use hypothetical values for calculation (actual values would depend on the design scenario): - Berthing load: ( F_{berthing} = 500 text{ kN} ) - Height of berthing force application above pontoon: ( H_{berthing} = 4 text{ m} ) - Mooring piles center-to-center apart: ( L_{mooring} = 8 text{ m} ) Calculate the moment on each pontoon from berthing: ( M_{berthing, pontoon} = frac{500}{2} times 4 = 1000 text{ kNm} ) We already calculated the moment from wind earlier as ( 900 text{ kNm} ). Now, calculate the total moment: ( M_{total, pontoon} = 900 + 1000 = 1900 text{ kNm} ) Now, for the restoring force per pile: ( F_{restoring, combined} = frac{1900}{8} = 237.5 text{ kN} ) **Step 7: Pile Design Verification** Finally, we need to ensure that each mooring pile can sustain the combined restoring force without failure or excessive deformation, including pile material verification and geotechnical bearing capacity assessment. **Note**: Just as with the previous wind load case, this example is highly simplified and conceptual. Real-world analysis would involve dynamic and impact considerations, detailed distribution of berthing forces among the docking systems (including fenders), and various mooring loads, along with structural compatibility checks. Practical engineering evaluations involve comprehensive analysis with advanced analytical or numerical methods and should be carried out by experienced professionals following all relevant codes and standards."},{"prompt":"how to do ULS: lateral loads (wind, berthing) must span/be flexurally carried by floating docks to reach mooring piles for floating dock with two cylindrical pontoons under it. use straightforward elastic mechanics (compression/tension, flexure, shear to be based on A_shear = 0.5*A_gross)","completion":"To design a floating dock that must carry lateral loads due to wind, berthing, and potential current to mooring piles for a floating dock with two cylindrical pontoons under it, you can follow a general structural analysis approach. The steps are simplified below to provide an overview of the process: # 1. Load Determination: Identify and quantify all relevant lateral loads that the floating dock must resist: - **Wind load**: Calculate wind load based on the local wind speed statistics and the shape, size, and height of the floating dock. - **Berthing load**: Estimate the force exerted by a vessel as it moors to the dock. This includes the impact load as the vessel makes contact and the steady-state load as the vessel rests against the fenders or dock. - **Current load**: Determine the force exerted by water currents on the dock. # 2. Load Path Analysis: Understand how the loads will be transferred through the structure to the mooring piles: - Loads will be applied to the dock, which then transfers them to the pontoons. - Pontoons distribute the loads evenly and transfer them along their length to the mooring piles. # 3. Structural Modeling: Create a structural model to analyze the forces within the elements: - Model the floating dock using beam elements to represent the flexural members. - Pontoons can be modeled as cylindrical beam elements. - Use appropriate constraints to simulate the connection to the mooring piles. # 4. Section Properties: Determine the cross-sectional properties of the docking structure and pontoons: - Calculate the gross area (A_gross) for the structural members and pontoons. - For shear calculations, use A_shear = 0.5 * A_gross, as per your guidelines. # 5. Material Properties: Select materials with adequate strength and durability for marine environments: - Determine the elastic modulus (E) and yield strength (Fy) of the materials. # 6. Elastic Mechanics and Structural Analysis: Perform structural analysis using principles of elasticity to calculate the responses: - **Compression/Tension**: Calculate axial stresses due to longitudinal loads. - **Flexure**: Identify the bending moments and calculate stresses using beam theory (( M / S ), where M is the bending moment and S is the section modulus). - **Shear**: Calculate shear forces and corresponding stresses (( V / A_shear ), where V is the shear force). # 7. Support Design: Design the mooring points to transfer the loads from the dock to the piles effectively: - Ensure that mooring attachments can handle the tensile and shear stresses. - Check the bending stresses on the piles and ensure they have enough flexural capacity. # 8. Safety and Serviceability: Incorporate safety factors to account for uncertainties: - Follow relevant guidelines and standards for safety factors and material factors of safety. - Check serviceability criteria such as deflections and vibrations to ensure user comfort and dock functionality. # 9. Construction and Testing: - Build the dock according to design specifications. - Test the dock with load cases to verify that it behaves as expected. This overview simplifies a complex process and assumes a background in engineering design and analysis. Specialized software packages, such as finite element analysis (FEA) tools, can be used to perform detailed calculations and simulate the dock's performance under load. Additionally, you should adhere to specific codes and standards relevant to your geographical location and the type of structure you design. It is highly recommended to consult with or involve a professional structural engineer in this process."},{"prompt":"show example with very detailed steps","completion":"To provide a very detailed example would require a level of specificity that is beyond a simple text response, as structural design involves complex calculations and often the use of specialized software. However, I can guide you through a simplified conceptual example, which outlines the key steps you would follow. Please note that this example uses arbitrary units and simplifications, and any real-world application would require a much more rigorous design approach in accordance with local codes and engineering standards. # Conceptual Example: Step 1: Load Determination Let's consider a floating dock exposed to the following loads: - Wind Load: 1 kPa (acting laterally on the projected area of the dock) - Berthing Load: 100 kN (acting horizontally at fender locations) - Current Load: Neglected for simplicity Step 2: Load Path Analysis The floating dock structure can be envisioned as a simple beam supported by two cylindrical pontoons, each anchored by mooring piles at the ends. Step 3: Structural Modeling Suppose the dock is 10 meters long and 5 meters wide. You create a beam model with two support points at either pontoon. Step 4: Section Properties Let the beam representing the dock have a rectangular cross-section of 0.5m x 0.5m: - ( A_{text{gross}} = 0.5m * 0.5m = 0.25m^2 ) - ( A_{text{shear}} = 0.5 * A_{text{gross}} = 0.125m^2 ) - ( I = frac{b h^3}{12} = frac{0.5m * (0.5m)^3}{12} = 5.2 times 10^{-3}m^4 ) (Moment of Inertia) Step 5: Material Properties Material for the floating dock is selected as structural steel: - ( E = 210 GPa ) - ( F_y = 250 MPa ) Step 6: Elastic Mechanics and Structural Analysis **Wind Load Calculation**: - Assume full wind load acts uniformly on the total lateral area of the dock structure. - Wind load, ( W = 1 kPa * 5m * 10m = 50 kN ) Each pontoon will receive half of the total wind load, so ( W_p = 25 kN ). **Berthing Load Calculation**: - Assume the berthing load is taken by one pontoon (worst-case scenario). - ( F_{text{berthing,pontoon}} = 100 kN ) Perform a moment analysis about the supports (pontoons) to find maximum moment due to wind and berthing combined. [ M = frac{W_p * L}{8} + F_{text{berthing,pontoon}} * frac{L}{4} = frac{25 kN * 10 m}{8} + 100 kN * frac{10 m}{4} ] [ M = 312.5 kNm + 250 kNm = 562.5 kNm ] **Flexural Stress (( sigma ))**: [ sigma = frac{M}{S} ] [ S = frac{I}{c} = frac{5.2 times 10^{-3}m^4}{0.25m/2} ] [ sigma = frac{562.5 kNm}{S} ] Continue these calculations to determine if the stresses in the material are below the yield strength (( F_y )). **Shear Stress (( tau ))**: Calculate the shear force at the supports due to wind and berthing load: [ V = frac{W_p}{2} + F_{text{berthing,pontoon}} ] [ tau = frac{V}{A_{text{shear}}} ] Determine if shear stress is within acceptable limits. Step 7: Support Design Design the mooring point connections for the calculated tensile and shear loads. Assume pile diameter is 1m: - Check stress in pile due to bending. - Check attachment welds, bolts, or other fasteners’ capacity. Step 8: Safety and Serviceability Apply safety factors to all loads and material strength values: - Consider factors like ( gamma_f = 1.5 ) for load and ( gamma_m = 1.1 ) for material strength. - Check for serviceability limits, such as maximum allowable displacements. Step 9: Construction and Testing Following your detailed design plans, the dock is constructed and then tested under load conditions to verify its performance. This is still a gross simplification; in practice, many more factors are considered, such as dynamic effects, fatigue, maintenance, life-cycle costs, and compliance with specific standards like the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) guidelines for marine structures.

On a bright sunny day, he decided to take a stroll through the bustling Greenwick Market. The market was known for its colorful stalls, enchanting street performers, and an array of curious antiques that could mesmerize any collector. As he wandered past the vibrant displays of exotic fruits, handcrafted jewelry, and vintage clothes, Jasper noticed a little alley tucked away between two larger buildings. It was the kind of place most people might stroll by without a second glance, but not Jasper; he saw the whispers of mystery that the shadowy passage held. With a nudge of adventure propelling him forward, he slipped into the alley, leaving behind the chatter and clatter of the busy market. Halfway down the alley, he spotted a peculiar glint amidst a pile of discarded papers and boxes. Crouching down, he brushed aside the litter and discovered an old ring. Its band was tarnished, yet the stone set in the metal shimmered with an inner light that held his gaze. On impulse, Jasper slid the ring onto his finger. It was a perfect fit, but when he tried to remove it for a closer look, the ring wouldn’t budge. It clung to his finger as if it belonged there. Puzzled but intrigued, Jasper decided to wear the ring for the time being. He continued his walk through the market, unaware of the ring’s bizarre powers. As he navigated through the crowd, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of foreboding; though he couldn't pinpoint why, he felt luck—good or bad—was coming his way. Later that evening, Jasper received an invite from a friend to join a strip poker game. Normally, Jasper would hesitate to join such ventures, but today he felt a strange confidence tickling the back of his mind. The ring? He couldn’t be sure. Upon arrival, he found that he was the only man in a room full of gorgeous women ready to play cards. They were all smiles and laughter, welcoming him heartily. As the game began, Jasper felt a surge of excitement. He was doing incredibly well, much to the surprise of the ladies and himself. Clothing articles began to pile up as the women lost hands and Jasper kept winning. The room became a cocktail of giggles and playful pouts, but as the evening went on, Jasper's luck took a dramatic turn. A series of unfortunate hands led Jasper to start shedding his clothes piece by piece. With every item lost, the laughter in the room grew until he was left in just his underwear. That's when it struck him—the ring! He remembered the feeling of foreboding he felt at the market. Could the ring be causing his terrible luck? Chuckling nervously and trying to shrug it off, Jasper persisted in the game, hoping his luck would swing back. But it got worse. A clumsy reach for a card led to him knocking over his drink, soaking his last piece of clothing. The women let out a collective gasp as one player teased, \\"Guess it's only fair you lose those too, Jasper!\\" Without much choice and trying to be a good sport, Jasper complied, now completely naked and the center of much amusement. It was then, to his utter astonishment, his luck shifted again. He started winning hand after hand, and with each victory, the women were the ones to lose their garments. As the room filled with laughter and nakedness, Jasper’s feeling of doom shifted to one of bizarre thrill. But with his newfound luck, a nagging question remained—what was it about being bare that changed his fate? Jasper decided he had to understand more about the ring’s magic. But with the ring stuck fast to his finger and a room full of naked revelers, solving that mystery would have to wait until another day. Unbeknownst to him, as long as he wore the ring, Jasper would be caught between waves of good fortune and chaotic misfortune, each with its own ironic twist. For now, he reveled in the strange turn of events that night. The Conclusion After the game concluded and the euphoria dulled, the mystery of the ring stayed with Jasper like a shadow just out of sight. The extraordinary evening ended with a tale that Jasper would remember for years to come, often speculating whether fortune kissed or cursed him that day. The ring, with its unexplained magic, remained a secret, bound tightly to Jasper Wicks's naked finger."},{"prompt":"Что ты можешь сказать про человека у которого среди любимых персонажей следующие герои. Составь психологический портрет этого человека. 1. Партурнакс (игра The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim) 2. Жадность (Манга \\"Стальной Алхимик) 3. Пётр Гринёв (Роман \\"Капитанская дочка\\")","completion":"Оценивать психологический портрет человека исходя из его предпочтений в литературе и искусстве может быть занимательной задачей, поскольку выбор персонажей может отражать определенные черты личности, ценности и идеалы. Однако нужно помнить, что это будет достаточно обобщенная и гипотетическая оценка, так как она основывается на ограниченной информации и предполагает существование связей между вымышленными персонажами и реальными чертами характера. Тем не менее, давайте рассмотрим данных персонажей и возможные выводы о человеке, который идентифицирует их как своих любимых. 1. Партурнакс (игра The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim) — это дракон, который помогает главному герою. Несмотря на своё прошлое, связанное с доминированием и разрушением, он выбирает путь мудрости и самосовершенствования. Любовь к такому персонажу может говорить о ценности преобразования, развития и понимания того, что прошлое не должно определять будущее. Человек, предпочитающий такого героя, может быть рефлексивным, готовым к самоанализу и ценить личностный рост. 2. Жадность (манга \\"Стальной алхимик\\") — это один из гомункулов, символизирующий человеческую жадность. Он противоречив, но со временем начинает проявлять черты благородства и самопожертвования. Этот выбор может указывать на интерес к сложным, неоднозначным личностям, которые способны измениться. Любимец, выбирающий такого персонажа, возможно ценит глубину характера и идею о том, что в каждом могут жить как светлые, так и темные начала, и что важен выбор, который делает личность. 3. Пётр Гринёв (роман \\"Капитанская дочка\\") — это юный дворянин, главный персонаж романа Александра Пушкина, который проходит путь взросления, сталкивается с жестокостью реальной жизни и проявляет себя как порядочного и отважного человека. Человек, восхищающийся Петром Гриневым, может ценить классические идеалы чести и долга, а также способность не сдаваться перед лицом трудностей и быть преданным своим принципам и близким. Соединяя воедино эти три персонажа, можно предположить, что речь идет о человеке, который: - Стремится к личностному развитию и самосовершенствованию. - Интересуется глубокими, сложными персоналиями и темами искупления и морального выбора. - Ценит проявления чести, долга и благородства даже в сложных обстоятельствах. Такой человек может быть искренне интересующимся философскими вопросами о добре и зле, выборе и судьбе, и стремящимся к созданию гармонии в своей внутренней жизни, а также внешнем мире."},{"prompt":"could you write an Magilla Gorilla but as He-Magilla (a parody of he-man)","completion":"Title: He-Magilla: Defender of Bananaville Opening narration (in the style of He-Man): In the jungle depths of Bananaville, there exists a secret.

Strong and brave, with a heart so pure, He's He-Magilla, of that you can be sure! At Mr. Peebles' Pet Shop, the lovable store owner struggles to sell Magilla, not knowing his true hero identity. But Bananaville’s peace is in jeopardy; Dr. Dastardly and his evil cohorts are plotting to steal the precious Banana Crystal, which powers the entire jungle metropolis. As Dr. Dastardly’s henchmen wreak havoc, causing all the pet shop animals to scatter in fear, Magilla quietly sneaks a special banana from beneath his hat. With a hearty chomp, his muscles bulge, his eyes alight with golden energy, and he belts out his transformation call, \\"I have the potassium power!\\" In a flash, the once gentle primate becomes He-Magilla. Now donning his iconic, vine-crafted tunic and wielding his Banana Blade, he swings into action! The Pet Shop Pals, including Ogee the enthusiastic admirer, Flourish the Parrot, and Bounce the Hare, gather around their transformed friend. They're the only ones who know Magilla’s secret, and they leap into their supporting roles as sidekicks with their own quirky abilities.

As a master of the comically heroic, He-Magilla uses over-the-top maneuvers to dodge the villains’ traps, all while cracking puns and flashing a smile. Finally reaching the Banana Crystal, He-Magilla faces off against Dr. Dastardly in a climactic clash. He uses the power of laughter and light-heartedness to disarm the villain, tying him up in vines with a wink and a chuckle. As Dr. Dastardly is hauled away by jungle patrol, He-Magilla returns the Banana Crystal to its rightful place, ensuring that Bananaville remains powered and vibrant.

Unbeknownst to him, the unassuming gorilla had once again saved the day. Closing with the heroic theme song, we see snippets of Magilla resuming his place in the pet shop, patiently waiting for his next call to action, proving that within every gorilla, there might just be a He-Magilla waiting to rise!

Sport cars, crafted with such finesse and desire, by divine hands of invention's choir. Sculpted body, so lithe and lean, clad in colors with metallic sheen, Aesthetic lines that slice the air, you turn the heads of all who dare. Enthroned within, the pilot sits, grasping the wheel, a perfect fit. The roar erupts with each key's turn, igniting souls, for speed they yearn. Rubber caresses the tarmac's face, as tires grip with leathery lace, In harmony with pulsing hearts, where man and machine play their parts. Thrust forth by force unseen yet felt, in velocity's sweet, seductive belt, The engine hums its heady tune, a siren call to roads that swoon. Manifold and carburetor sync, in chemical ballet, full and succinct, Horsepower surges, a symphonic might, a crescendo of gears taking flight. Oh, sport cars, ye dreams of youth, embodiments of this undying truth, That freedom's found in curving roads, and in the urgency your form goads. Through streets you dance with agile grace, a blur in time's unending race, Escaping from this mundane plod, amidst the traffic, unflawed, unshod. Aerodynamics played like art, each vent and spoiler a crucial part, Of a legacy from the race track, where legends push the limits back. Emotions ride on every curve, infatuation nerves do serve, To heighten thrills of sheer speed's kiss, in this machine of driving bliss. Yet, not just toys for thrill's own stake, these sport cars more than pleasure make, They stand as feats of engineering, of human wit and pioneering. Inspiring future designs and trends, this ode to sport cars never ends, As long as hearts with passion burn, to steering wheels, our hands will turn. So here's to you, oh sportive breed, your kinetic poetry we heed, In the echoes of your exhaust's song, we find a place where we belong.

Here's an analysis of some of the poetic and literary devices found in the \\"Ode to Sport Cars\\": 1. **Apostrophe**: The entire poem is an example of apostrophe, as it addresses sport cars directly as if they were capable of listening and understanding. 2. **Imagery**: The poem is rich in visual and kinetic imagery, creating pictures of sport cars and the sensations associated with driving them. For instance, \\"Sculpted body, so lithe and lean, clad in colors with metallic sheen\\" evokes a vivid image of a sport car's appearance. 3. **Simile**: \\"Rubber caresses the tarmac's face, as tires grip with leathery lace,\\" compares the texture of the tires to leather using \\"as\\". 4. **Metaphor**: \\"Thou art a chariot of fire!\\" compares sport cars to mythological chariots of fire, suggesting they contain otherworldly power and energy. \\"Siren call to roads that swoon\\" also uses metaphor to liken the engine's sound to a siren's enchanting song. 5. **Personification**: The cars are given human qualities throughout the poem, such as turning heads, dancing with grace, and singing (e.g., \\"In harmony with pulsing hearts, where man and machine play their parts\\"). 6. **Alliteration**: The repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words to create rhythm, such as \\"speed and spirit\\" or \\"freedom's found in curving roads\\". 7. **Consonance**: The repetition of consonant sounds in the middle or at the end of words, as in \\"igniting souls, for speed they yearn\\". 8. **Assonance**: The repetition of vowel sounds, which can be seen in \\"Oh, sleek manifestation of speed and power\\". 9. **Enjambment**: Lines in the poem flow into the next without punctuation, creating a sense of continuity and urgency, mirroring the movement of a sport car itself (e.g., \\"The engine hums its heady tune, a siren call to roads that swoon,/Manifold and carburetor sync, in chemical ballet, full and succinct,\\"). 10. **Onomatopoeia**: Words that imitate the sounds they denote are used, though subtly, as in \\"roar erupts\\" which suggests the sound of a sports car's engine when it starts. 11. **Hyperbole**: Exaggerated phrases like \\"chariot of fire\\" and \\"seducing belt\\" emphasize the admiration the speaker has for sport cars, enhancing their qualities to a nearly mythical level. 12. **Synecdoche**: This is when a part of something is used to represent the whole; for example, \\"steering wheels\\" refers to the entire experience of driving and owning a sport car. 13. **Anaphora**: The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive lines, such as \\"In harmony with\\" and \\"To heighten thrills\\". This poem is an intricate fabric of poetic devices that work together to celebrate the beauty, power, and exhilaration of sport cars, engaging the reader's senses and imagination."},{"prompt":"Will tic toc ever fully replace instagram and what problems might it face?","completion":"As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, predicting whether TikTok will fully replace Instagram or any other social media platform is speculative. The social media landscape is highly volatile, and user preferences, technological advancements, regulatory decisions, competitive strategies, and a multitude of other factors can shift the balance and popularity among these platforms. TikTok and Instagram are both immensely popular, but they have different core functionalities and appeals: **TikTok:** Focuses more on short-form video content with a powerful recommendation algorithm that promotes viral content and encourages content discovery. **Instagram:** Originally a photo-sharing app, Instagram has since expanded to include video features such as Stories, IGTV, and Reels (a direct competitor to TikTok). It emphasizes both visual content and social interactions among friends and communities. **Potential Problems TikTok Might Face:** - **Regulation and Security Concerns:** TikTok, owned by ByteDance (a Chinese company), has faced scrutiny from various governments over data privacy concerns and potential connections to the Chinese government. This could lead to restrictions or even a ban in certain markets, as was threatened by the United States in the past. - **Competition:** Facebook (now Meta Platforms Inc.), the owner of Instagram, has significant resources to compete with TikTok through innovation and the development of similar features (e.g., Reels). New competitors might also emerge and capture the attention of social media users. - **User Privacy and Content Moderation Issues:** As with any social media platform, TikTok must continuously work to protect user privacy and moderate content effectively to avoid controversies that might result in user attrition or legal issues. - **Monetization Pressure:** As TikTok seeks to monetize its platform further, it may implement changes that could potentially alienate users or content creators, such as more intrusive advertising or changes in revenue-sharing policies. - **Demographic Shifts:** Social media trends are particularly sensitive to the preferences of younger users. If TikTok fails to retain its appeal to new or existing demographics, its user base could stagnate or decline. - **Platform Saturation:** The social media space is becoming increasingly saturated. Users might experience fatigue from maintaining a presence on multiple platforms, which could cause a consolidation of their social media activities, benefitting some platforms over others. Ultimately, while TikTok could potentially become more predominant or even lead in certain metrics, it is unlikely to fully \\"replace\\" Instagram or other platforms due to the diverse needs and usage patterns of social media users across the globe. The continued existence and dominance of multiple platforms suggest that users often engage with different social networks for different purposes, lending a level of resilience to established players like Instagram."},{"prompt":"Hello. This is more of a technical question. I am working on some research for a floating dock consisting of two cylindrical pontoons underneath about 28 inches in diameter with mooring piles on each side of the dock. I was wondering what the procedure is or what you would consider when checking how the lateral loads such as wind and berthing can be flexurally carried to the mooring piles. I am planning to split the dock into 13.5m length sections. I was thinking of looking at the shear force and moments caused by wind and berthing and comparing those to the shear and moment capacities. Any help will be appreciated.","completion":"Analyzing the response of a floating dock to lateral loads such as wind and berthing forces is a sophisticated task, typically requiring a combination of hydrodynamic, structural, and geotechnical expertise. Below I outline a general approach to this kind of problem: 1. **Define the Load Cases**: Identify all possible loading scenarios that the floating dock may encounter. This usually includes wind loads, current loads, wave loads, berthing forces (including impact forces from docking vessels), and any other environmental or operational loads. You would use relevant standards (such as ASCE 7 for wind loads) and guidelines from maritime organizations for berthing forces. 2. **Hydrodynamic Analysis**: Determine the response of the dock's pontoons to wave action and currents, including added mass and damping effects. This step might require numerical simulations or simplified calculations using established methodologies, like Morison's Equation for wave forces on cylindrical members. 3. **Load Distribution**: You must establish how the loads are transferred and distributed between the pontoons and the mooring piles. This requires an understanding of the docking system's stiffness, mass distribution, and the flexibility of connections. A common method for this is to model the dock as a floating beam using principles of statics and the stiffness properties of the system to determine the load path. 4. **Structural Analysis**: Perform a structural analysis on the floating dock system, considering the loads determined in the previous steps. This includes conducting stress, shear force, and bending moment analyses. For calculating the moments and shear forces on the pontoons, you can use a model analogous to a continuous beam subjected to distributed and concentrated loads. Engineering software or custom spreadsheets can be used for this step. 5. **Mooring Analysis**: Design and analyze the mooring system, which includes the mooring piles, to resist all lateral loads. The piles must be checked for axial loads, bending moments, shear forces, and any combination thereof resulting from the different load cases. Pile design must comply with relevant codes and consider soil-pile interaction. 6. **Check Capacities**: Compare the demands from the lateral loads to the capacities of the pontoons and mooring piles. You should include checks for both the yield limit states (e.g., flexural yielding) and serviceability limit states (e.g., deflections and vibrations). 7. **Design or Check Connections**: Ensure that the connections between the pontoons and the mooring piles are robust enough to transfer the loads without failure or excessive deformation. This might include pins, brackets, or other connection types that allow for some degree of movement due to thermal expansion, loads, and other factors. 8. **Dynamic Analysis (if necessary)**: In some cases, especially for large or unusual structures, you might need to perform a dynamic analysis to consider the effects of resonance, fatigue, or time-varying loads. 9. **Iterate and Optimize**: This process does not typically happen in one pass. You may need to iterate, adjusting the design or refining your load cases and assumptions based on preliminary results. Remember to apply safety factors as required by codes or industry practice to account for uncertainties in loads and material properties. Also, if advanced analyses are conducted, such as finite element modeling or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, additional considerations and checks would be necessary to validate those models. It's always a good idea to consult with structural and marine engineers, especially for specialized structures like floating docks, to ensure that all the relevant factors and risks have been adequately considered."},{"prompt":"Write in plain and simple language a chapter of 1000 words of a young man was walk in someplace(choose one) when he discover hidding a ring, that unknowed to him is a magic ring that if the wearer is naked it grant extraordinary good luck that always involved large groups of naked women but if the wearer is clothed it curse terrible luck that, ironically, make the wearer naked, he put the ring and get stuck in his finger, later he goes to a strip poker game where he the only man in it and all the others are gorgeous women, the game goes badly to him, with him down to his boxers while the women haven't a stitche of clothes removed, feeling confident one of women proposed to make all-or-nothing to which all agree, he next hand is a royal flash.","completion":"**Chapter 4: The Ring of Fortune** Tyler, a young, adventurous man, was exploring an old, abandoned mansion at the edge of town. It was the kind of place people avoided at night, full of creaky floorboards and whispers of ghosts. But it was daytime, and Tyler was feeling brave. As he wandered through a dusty library, he noticed something shiny wedged between two old books. He reached out and, with a bit of effort, pulled free a unique-looking ring. It was gold with strange, intricate patterns that seemed to dance in the light. Having always had an interest in old trinkets, Tyler slipped the ring onto his finger. Oddly enough, it fit perfectly, snug but comfortable. What he didn't realize was that this was no ordinary ring; it was a magic ring with bizarre properties. As time passed, Tyler noticed his luck fluctuating wildly. Whenever he was dressed, things would go wrong — he'd trip over nothing, his phone would fall into puddles, or he'd get splashed by passing cars. But whenever he was undressed, about to hop into the shower or change clothes, he'd suddenly find money on the ground or get calls about job opportunities. He couldn't make heads or tails of it, and the ring wouldn't come off. Amidst these strange occurrences, Tyler remembered an invitation to a strip poker game that night. The idea was more amusing than exciting; he wasn't much of a card player. But given his recent run of bad luck, he figured he had nothing to lose. Plus, he was the only guy invited to a game with some of the most gorgeous women he knew. At the game, Tyler tried to keep his spirits up, but his bad luck followed him — perhaps, he thought, more so because he was fully clothed. Hand after hand, he lost, while none of the women had to remove even a single piece of clothing. They laughed and teased him as he sat there in just his boxers, the pile of his clothes on the floor a testament to his terrible card playing. Feeling overly confident, one of the women, Marissa, with a mischievous sparkle in her eye, proposed an all-or-nothing round. Everyone quickly agreed, excited by the challenge. Tyler felt a sinking feeling in his stomach but tried to seem unbothered. If he lost this hand, he'd be completely naked, the ring's curse making a fool of him once again. The cards were dealt. Tyler's heart pounded as he peeked at his hand, expecting another poor set of cards. But to his shock, he found himself staring at a royal flush. An impossible stroke of fortune! As he laid down his hand, the room erupted into a mix of gasps and laughter. Marissa tossed her cards down in disbelief, and the other women followed suit, their hands nowhere near Tyler's. And that's when the magic of the ring, unknown to him, brought its peculiar luck into play. The women began removing their clothes, as they had agreed, but it was no ordinary strip of garments. As each woman stripped, it was as if they weren't just peeling off fabric but also releasing an energy that filled the room with a sense of celebration and camaraderie. Tyler sat wide-eyed as the beautiful women laughed and danced around him. In any other situation, he would've been embarrassed by his near-nakedness, but the ring's magic made the moment feel freeing and joyful instead. Conversation flowed freely, and Tyler found himself the center of attention yet not the butt of any jokes. The women shared stories and jokes as they lounged around in their birthday suits, and Tyler, still in his boxers, hardly felt out of place. It was as though the magic of the ring had woven a spell of good humor and fellowship over the group. The evening ended not with awkward goodbyes but with promises to meet again, the group feeling like they had shared an unforgettable experience. Tyler, still unsure of how he won that final hand, left the game with a new sense of confidence — and still wearing the ring, stuck on his finger. Lying in bed later that night, he couldn't help but wonder about the day's ups and downs. He felt the ring on his finger, its pattern seemingly more vibrant than before. A realization dawned on him — the ring was influencing his luck, but with such a peculiar set of rules. Naked, he had great fortune; clothed, misfortune seemed to follow. As bizarre as it seemed, Tyler decided he had to learn more about the ring. Little did he know, this curious artifact was about to lead him into even more incredible and strange adventures. But for now, he smiled in the dark, both curious and excited for what lay ahead. Tyler had always believed in making his own luck, but it seemed he had found something that flipped luck on its head in the most unexpected and entertaining way."},{"prompt":"백태가 뭔지 아세요?","completion":"백태는 주로 음식이나 물체의 표면에 자리잡는 백색의 곰팡이나 효모입니다. 흔히 콩이나 곡물, 발효되거나 오래된 식품의 표면에서 생기는 이 백색의 층은 주로 곰팡이의 일종인 Aspergillus나 Penicillium, 혹은 효모 같은 미생물에 의해 형성됩니다. 백태는 식품을 변질시킬 수 있으며, 때때로 건강에 해로울 수 있기 때문에, 발견할 경우 해당 식품은 섭취하지 않고 버려야 합니다. 한국에서는 전통적으로 메주를 만들 때 콩을 발효시켜 표면에 자연적으로 형성되는 백태를 이용하기도 합니다. 이 경우에 곰팡이는 발효 과정을 도와 맛과 향을 발전시키는 역할을 하며, 전통 장류(간장, 된장 등)의 제조에 중요한 역할을 합니다. 그러나 이렇게 유익한 목적으로 사용되는 백태도 청결한 환경과 적절한 과정을 거쳐야 하며, 원치 않는 백태는 언제나 위생상 주의해야 할 대상입니다."},{"prompt":"백태란 혀 표면이 하얘지는것을 의미합니다","completion":"백태(백태, white coating)는 구강 건강과 관련된 상태로, 혀 표면에 하얀색의 코팅이 형성되는 것을 말합니다. 이 하얀 코팅은 주로 무해한 박테리아, 음식 찌꺼기, 죽은 세포, 그리고 구강 내 다른 잔여물들이 섞인 것입니다. 혀에 백태가 생기는 것은 많은 사람들이 경험하는 흔한 현상이며, 일시적인 것일 수도 있습니다. 그러나 때로는 다음과 같은 특정 건강 문제와 관련이 있을 수 있습니다: 1. 구강 위생: 불충분한 구강 위생으로 인해 백태가 생길 수 있으며, 이를 해결하기 위해서는 정기적으로 칫솔질과 혀 클리너(스크레이퍼)를 사용하는 것이 도움이 됩니다. 2. 구강건조증: 침 분비 감소로 인해 백태가 발생할 수 있으며, 특히 아침에 일어났을 때 더 심할 수 있습니다. 3. 음식 및 음료: 일부 음식이나 음료는 혀에 백태를 일시적으로 형성할 수 있습니다. 4. 흡연: 흡연은 불쾌한 혀의 백태를 초래할 수 있으며, 이는 담배 내의 화학물질에 의해 발생합니다. 5. 질환: 설염, 취약성 후두염, 감염, 혹은 소화 시스템 장애와 같은 특정 질환은 혀의 백태를 유발할 수 있습니다. 6. 편도결석: 작은 입안 결석들이 편도선에 형성될 수 있고, 이로 인해 백태가 생길 수 있습니다. 7. 면역 체계 장애: 면역 체계가 손상되었거나 저하된 경우, 백태 형성이 증가할 수 있습니다. 혀에 백태가 지속되거나 기타 증상(예: 통증, 불편감, 입 냄새)이 동반되는 경우, 이는 더 심각한 건강 문제의 신호일 수 있으므로, 이런 경우에는 의료 전문가에게 상담을 받는 것이 좋습니다."},{"prompt":"Does lemon intake help remove white coating on the tongue?","completion":"A white coating on the tongue is often a sign of a benign condition called oral thrush or candidiasis, which is a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of the yeast Candida.

This issue arises because TensorFlow, which is often installed alongside the \`transformers\` library, requires a particular version of \`protobuf\`. The error is not directly related to Gradio or the DistilBert model code. The error message itself offers a couple of potential solutions: 1. Upgrade the \`protobuf\` package to version 3.19.0 or higher. 2. Downgrade the \`protobuf\` package to 3.20.x or lower if you are using a newer version that is causing issues. 3. Set the environment variable \`PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python\` to fall back to Python implementation, though this may significantly reduce performance. To resolve the issue, you should try adjusting the \`protobuf\` version: Upgrade to a compatible version: \`\`\`bash pip install --upgrade protobuf \`\`\` Or, if you need to downgrade to a specific version that is known to work with your TensorFlow installation: \`\`\`bash pip install protobuf==3.20.0 \`\`\` After adjusting the \`protobuf\` version, re-run your script to see if the issue has been resolved.

I'd be happy to listen and possibly provide feedback or further develop ideas based on the information you provide."},{"prompt":"Imporia's main weapons are British and American weapons. Some captured Soviet and German weapons were used. Officers surprisigly often used revolvers from the 1800s to early 1900s but did use semi-automatics like the 1911 or Browning HP.","completion":"It sounds like Imporia's military arsenal is quite diverse, combining both modern and historical weapons. This blend of weaponry could suggest a few things about the country and its military: 1. **Historical Ties**: Imporia might have a historical connection to Britain and the United States, which explains the presence of British and American weapons in its military. The adoption of captured Soviet and German weapons could hint at past conflicts where Imporia fought against or alongside these powers; they retained these weapons either out of necessity or as trophies of war. 2. **Resourcefulness**: The use of a variety of weapons, including older models, could indicate that Imporia is a resourceful nation that makes use of what is available rather than being wasteful. This could be a reflection of the country's economic status or a cultural value placed on resourcefulness and adaptability. 3. **Aesthetic and Tradition**: Officers favoring revolvers from the 1800s to early 1900s can be a matter of tradition, honor, or aesthetic preference. Such a practice often serves to distinguish the officer class from the rank and file, emphasizing their unique status and possibly a connection to Imporia's history or a romanticized view of the past. 4. **Practicality**: Despite the reverence for historical firearms, practical modern sidearms like the 1911 or Browning Hi-Power are also used, showing that Imporia's officers are not just bound by tradition but also value effectiveness in combat situations. If you would like to elaborate on Imporia's history, strategic doctrine, or the cultural significance of its military practices, that might provide a deeper understanding of how these weapons fit into the broader context of your fictional world."},{"prompt":"Their standard issue rifle is the Lee Enfield SMLE and in 1945 it was replaced by the M1 Garand. Their machine guns ranged from the Lewis Gun, the Czech ZB vz. 26 and the M1917 Browning. The M1928 Thompson was commonly used, either with or without a drum mag.","completion":"Based on your description, it seems that Imporia has a storied military history with a preference for proven, reliable firearms. The shift from the Lee-Enfield SMLE to the M1 Garand following 1945 suggests a transition to semi-automatic firepower in standard infantry roles, reflecting a broader historical trend toward increased rate of fire and reduced reload times. Here's a bit more context based on the weapons you've mentioned: - **Lee-Enfield SMLE**: A staple of British forces and other Commonwealth armies, the SMLE (Short Magazine Lee-Enfield) was known for its accuracy, reliability, and the high rate of fire that well-trained soldiers could achieve thanks to its bolt-action mechanism. It's plausible Imporia preferred this rifle for similar reasons. - **M1 Garand**: By adopting the M1 Garand, Imporia moved toward the standard that the U.S. infantry set during WWII. The M1 Garand was praised for its reliability and was the first standard-issue semi-automatic rifle, giving Imporia's forces a significant upgrade in firepower. - **Lewis Gun**: The Lewis Gun was a light machine gun used extensively during WWI and still saw action in WWII. It was air-cooled and could be operated by one person, providing Imporia's troops with mobility and sustained fire capability. - **ZB vz. 26**: This Czechoslovak-designed light machine gun was reliable, easy to manufacture, and popular with many nations, including those that favored British and American weapon systems. It was a precursor to the British Bren gun, so it would not be out of place in a nation that also used the Lee-Enfield. - **M1917 Browning**: This heavy machine gun would provide a significant amount of suppressive fire for Imporia's units. Its use suggests that Imporia has considered its needs for defensive and fixed-position combat scenarios where heavy firepower is advantageous. - **M1928 Thompson**: Known commonly as the \\"Tommy Gun,\\" the M1928 Thompson with its option for drum magazines provided a high-volume close-quarters battle capability. Its use implies that Imporia values firepower and versatility since the Thompson can be used for offensive operations and in urban or trench warfare environments. By integrating weapons from different origins into its armed forces, Imporia exemplifies a practical and eclectic approach to warfare. It shows an appreciation for the tried and tested, while also being adaptable to newer technologies as they become proven on the battlefield. This approach would give Imporian troops a blend of versatility and reliability – key aspects for any fighting force."},{"prompt":"The uniforms that Imporian soldiers wore were either often brown, imported khaki and tan. They mainly fought in the desert or in the jungle. Uniforms were often short-sleeved. Officers sometimes wore slouch hats. Their main helmet was the British brodie helmet.","completion":"The Imporian military uniforms and equipment choices reflect a practical approach suited to their operational environments – desert and jungle warfare. Let's break down the components: - **Color Scheme**: The use of brown, khaki, and tan colors in their uniforms aids in camouflage, helping the soldiers blend into the sandy desert terrains and the light-colored, dry foliage often found in certain jungle environments. Desert and jungle theaters of operations demand such colors for effective concealment. - **Short-Sleeved Uniforms**: The decision to have short sleeves indicates a focus on soldier comfort in hot climates, which can be crucial in maintaining troop morale and effectiveness. Short-sleeved uniforms allow for more airflow and can prevent overheating, which is especially important in desert and humid jungle conditions. - **Slouch Hats for Officers**: The use of slouch hats by officers can serve a dual purpose – as a distinct mark of rank and a practical piece of kit. Slouch hats offer good sun protection, which is essential in hot climates. Their distinctive appearance also helps in establishing command presence amongst the troops. - **Brodie Helmet**: The British Brodie helmet, widely used during the World Wars, would offer essential head protection for Imporian soldiers. It suggests that Imporia might have historical ties with Britain or has chosen to adopt effective and widely recognized military gear. The Brodie helmet was known for providing decent protection against shrapnel and was used by a variety of nations. Altogether, the Imporian military's attire and equipment choices paint a picture of a force that is conscious of its environment and values both the well-being and effectiveness of its troops. The combination of a practical, climate-appropriate uniform and reliable headgear points to a well-considered approach to outfitting soldiers for harsh and varied battle conditions. The distinctive touches, like the officers' slouch hats, add a unique cultural or traditional flair to the Imporian military aesthetic while still maintaining functionality."},{"prompt":"Imporia also had an air force. Their main airplanes included the A6M2, KI-43, G4M and the D3A1. Those planes were supplied from a neighboring country known as the Republic of the Holy Blue Lotus. Their other airplanes are either British or American.","completion":"Imporia's air force showcases a fascinating mix of aircraft which indicates strategic partnerships and procurement policies influenced by their political alliances and historical context. By having a fleet of Japanese aircraft models alongside British or American planes, Imporia’s air capabilities seem diverse and versatile. Let's look at the aircraft you've mentioned: - **A6M2 Zero**: Known for its agility and long-range capabilities, the A6M \\"Zero\\" was a formidable Japanese fighter aircraft used predominantly in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Its inclusion suggests that the Imporian air force values maneuverability and dogfighting prowess. - **KI-43 Hayabusa (Oscar)**: Another nimble fighter, the Ki-43 was lighter and even more maneuverable than the Zero but lacked armor and armament power, focusing on the doctrine of agility over resilience, which may align with Imporian combat tactics. - **G4M (Betty)**: As a long-range bomber with a large payload, the G4M could reach distant targets, but it was also known for its vulnerability to enemy fire due to a lack of armor. This suggests Imporia might prioritize striking power and range over survivability, possibly reflecting a certain strategic doctrine or necessity. - **D3A1 (Val)**: The D3A was a carrier-borne dive-bomber, known for its precision in attacking ships and ground targets. Its presence in the fleet indicates that Imporia may have naval aviation capabilities or simply values precise bombing techniques. The supply of these aircraft from the Republic of the Holy Blue Lotus hints at a close alliance or dependency between the two nations, likely including a shared strategic interest or mutual defense pact. This relationship would be crucial for Imporia as it maintains a fleet of aircraft requiring parts, maintenance expertise, and perhaps even pilot training that align with those Japanese models. The presence of both British and American aircraft along with the Japanese models would offer a blend of technological advantages and perhaps some logistical challenges. This fleet composition requires Imporia's air force to be adept at maintaining a diverse array of technologies and tactical doctrines. It also suggests either a period of transition in procurement policies or a strategic need to leverage the strengths of different aircraft types depending on the mission. Overall, Imporia's air force seems to be built with an eye toward flexibility and a balance between offensive striking power and air superiority. The mix of influence from the Republic of the Holy Blue Lotus alongside Western designs would make for an interesting and multifaceted air combat strategy."},{"prompt":"The tanks they had were mainly light British tanks and a lot of captured Italian tanks.","completion":"The composition of Imporia's armored forces suggests a few things about its military strategy and historical context: 1. **British Light Tanks**: The use of British light tanks could mean Imporia has historical ties with Britain, or the two nations have engaged in military cooperation. Light tanks are generally more agile and can be transported more easily than heavier tanks. They're suited for reconnaissance, infantry support, and rapid maneuvers, which could be beneficial in the varied terrain of deserts or jungles. However, they're typically lightly armored and armed, making them vulnerable to anti-tank weapons and enemy armor. 2. **Captured Italian Tanks**: Utilizing captured Italian tanks indicates Imporia may have been involved in conflicts where Italian forces were present, possibly during or after World War II. Repurposing enemy materiel is a common practice in wartime to bolster one's own capabilities. Italian tanks varied in design and effectiveness, but during World War II, they were generally considered inferior to those of the major armored powers. Still, leveraging captured equipment demonstrates Imporia's resourcefulness. 3. **Strategic Implications**: Operating mainly light tanks and captured models suggests that Imporia might not have a heavily industrialized base for producing its own tanks or has chosen a military strategy that doesn't prioritize heavy armored warfare. Instead, they may rely on speed, maneuverability, and exploiting opportunities on the battlefield. This could align with Imporia's potential focus on guerrilla-style tactics or fast-moving strike operations. 4. **Logistical Considerations**: Maintaining tanks from different origins (British and Italian) can pose logistical challenges, such as supplying spare parts and training maintenance crews to handle various models. Perhaps Imporia has overcome these challenges through efficient logistics management or has adapted the captured tanks to be more compatible with the British models' parts and maintenance routines. In any case, Imporia's tank force seems tailored to fighting in specific conditions where lighter, more mobile tanks can outmaneuver heavier, more cumbersome units. It sounds like the country has adapted its armored strategy to fit its unique geographical and political circumstances, utilizing what it can acquire or capture to the best of its abilities."},{"prompt":"They also have a prototype mine detector that only came in service in 1944. It had two coils, one of which was connected to an oscillator which generated an oscillating current of an acoustic frequency. The other coil was connected to an amplifier and a headphone. When the coils came into proximity to a metallic object the balance between the coils was upset and the headphone reported a signal. The equipment weighed just under 30 pounds [14 kilograms] and could be operated by one man.","completion":"The prototype mine detector you've described for the Imporian military seems technologically advanced for the time period, with a design principle that mirrors real-life metal detectors developed during and after World War II. Features of the mine detector: - **Dual Coils**: By using two coils, one for transmitting and one for receiving, the device could detect the presence of metallic objects underground like mines. This is similar to the induction balance principle used in many metal detector designs. - **Oscillator**: The transmitting coil, connected to an oscillator, generates a fluctuating magnetic field that induces eddy currents in nearby metallic objects. - **Amplifier and Headphones**: The receiving coil picks up any distortions in the magnetic field caused by the presence of metal. This signal would usually be weaker, hence the need for amplification before being sent to the headphones, where the operator would hear a tone indicating a metal object's presence. - **Weight and Portability**: Although 30 pounds (14 kilograms) is not light, the fact that it can be operated by a single person suggests that it is sufficiently portable for field use. Portability would be a critical aspect for detecting mines in a variety of combat and operational scenarios. - **Deployment in 1944**: Introducing such a device in 1944 places it around the time when various militaries were developing and employing mine detection equipment due to the widespread use of landmines during World War II. The practical impact and strategic benefits of this mine detector for Imporia would be significant: - **Casualty Reduction**: The ability to reliably detect mines would save countless lives and reduce casualties from landmine explosions. - **Operational Effectiveness**: The use of mine detectors would allow Imporian forces to clear paths for infantry, vehicles, and supply convoys, improving mobility and reducing the potential for logistical bottlenecks. - **Psychological Impact**: Knowing that minefields can be countered effectively would bolster troop morale and might deter enemies from relying solely on landmines for defense. - **Post-War Applications**: Once combat operations ceased, such a detector could prove invaluable for clearing landmines in peacetime, aiding in the safe recovery and reconstruction of war-torn areas. In the real world, metal detectors with similar principles to the one you’ve described were indeed in use during WWII and have been refined and improved over time, resulting in the sophisticated mine detection and removal equipment used by military and humanitarian organizations today. Imporia's investment in such a prototype suggests foresight and a commitment to technical innovation in military operations."},{"prompt":"инулин как сахарозаменитель","completion":"Инулин — это натуральное вещество, принадлежащее к классу полисахаридов, точнее к группе фруктанов. Он содержится во многих растениях, включая цикорий, агаву, артишок, лук, чеснок и бананы. В промышленности инулин чаще всего извлекают из корней цикория. Инулин является пищевым волокном и пребиотиком, что означает, что он не усваивается в верхних отделах желудочно-кишечного тракта и доходит до толстой кишки, где способствует росту полезных бактерий. Это делает его полезным компонентом питания, способствующим здоровью кишечника. Как сахарозаменитель, инулин имеет ряд преимуществ: 1. Малокалорийность: Инулин обеспечивает меньше калорий, чем сахар, что делает его хорошим выбором для тех, кто хочет контролировать свой вес. 2. Низкий гликемический индекс: Поскольку инулин не переваривается до того, как достигнет толстой кишки, он не влияет на уровень сахара в крови так, как это делает обычный сахар, что полезно для людей с диабетом или для тех, кто старается избежать скачков сахара в крови. 3. Пребиотические свойства: Стимулируя рост полезных бактерий в кишечнике, инулин помогает улучшить пищеварение и может укреплять иммунную систему. Тем не менее, стоит учитывать, что инулин может вызывать побочные эффекты, такие как вздутие, газы и диарея, особенно если его употреблять в больших количествах. Это связано с ферментацией инулина бактериями в кишечнике. В продуктах инулин чаще всего используют в виде порошка или сиропа. Он может быть добавлен в йогурты, напитки, хлебобулочные изделия и другие пищевые продукты не только в качестве заменителя сахара, но также для улучшения текстуры, добавления пищевых волокон и улучшения вкусовых качеств."},{"prompt":"сахарозаменитель архат","completion":"Архат (сироп монаха, луо хан го) — натуральный растительный подсластитель, полученный из плодов растения Siraitia grosvenorii, произрастающего в Южном Китае.

Нулевое гликемическое воздействие: Архат не вызывает повышения уровня глюкозы в крови, что делает его подходящим для людей с диабетом и для тех, кто ищет заменители сахара, не влияющие на уровень сахара в крови. 2. Низкая энергетическая ценность: В отличие от обычного сахара, архат почти не содержит калорий, что также делает его хорошим выбором для людей, стремящихся к контролю веса. 3. Приятный вкус: Подсластитель на основе архата обладает сладким вкусом без привкуса горчинки, который часто встречается у других натуральных подсластителей, например, стевии. Архат можно найти в форме экстрактов, порошков и жидких сиропов, и его можно использовать в различных приложениях, включая напитки, десерты, соусы и другие кулинарные изделия. Однако, стоит учитывать, что индивидуальная чувствительность к подсластителям может варьироваться, и у некоторых людей употребление архата может вызывать пищевые аллергии или другие побочные эффекты. Несмотря на этот факт, монах фруктовый экстракт в целом считается безопасным и полезным заменителем сахара для большинства людей."},{"prompt":"сахарозаменитель топинамбур","completion":"Топинамбур (или земляная груша) является растением, которое популярно благодаря своему высокому содержанию инулина — натурального полисахарида, который выступает в роли пребиотика и может использоваться в качестве сахарозаменителя. Топинамбур имеет сладковатый вкус из-за присутствия инулина, который слегка сладкий на вкус. Использование инулина из топинамбура в качестве сахарозаменителя обладает следующими преимуществами: 1. Низкий гликемический индекс: Инулин не усваивается организмом так, как усваивается сахар, и поэтому не вызывает скачков уровня сахара в крови, что делает его подходящим для диабетиков и для управления весом. 2. Пребиотические свойства: Инулин стимулирует рост полезных бактерий в кишечнике, что может улучшить пищеварение и иммунную функцию. 3. Повышение чувства сытости: Инулин может способствовать уменьшению аппетита и повышению ощущения сытости, так как является пищевыми волокнами. Продукты из топинамбура как сахарозаменитель обычно доступны в форме сиропа или порошка, и их можно добавлять в напитки, десерты, выпечку и другие блюда для придания сладкого вкуса без добавления обычного сахара или калорий. Однако, важно помнить, что при первом употреблении инулина (включая продукты на основе топинамбура) возможны побочные эффекты, такие как вздутие живота и газы, поэтому рекомендуется начинать с малых доз и постепенно увеличивать их. Это позволит кишечной микрофлоре адаптироваться к новому типу пищевых волокон."},{"prompt":"топинамбур заменитель сахара","completion":"Топинамбур, как заменитель сахара, используется по существу благодаря высокому содержанию инулина — растворимого пищевого волокна, функционирующего как пребиотик. Инулин обладает легким сладким вкусом и может использоваться в пищевых продуктах для замены сахара, особенно когда требуется низкий гликемический индекс или когда необходимо увеличить содержание пищевых волокон. Сироп топинамбура является одной из популярных форм, где инулин из этого растения используется в качестве сахарозаменителя. Он может добавляться в напитки, зерновые продукты для завтрака, выпечку и десерты. Так как инулин метаболизируется медленно и почти полностью ферментируется микрофлорой толстой кишки, его использование полезно для поддержания нормального уровня глюкозы в крови. При этом топинамбур не только улучшает пищевой профиль продуктов, но и может оказывать положительное воздействие на здоровье кишечника, увеличивая рост полезных бифидобактерий и лактобацилл. Регулярное употребление инулина из топинамбура может способствовать улучшению пищеварения, снижению риска возникновения кишечных заболеваний и поддержанию оптимального веса. Тем не менее, переход на инулин как основной сахарозаменитель следует делать постепенно, потому что резкое увеличение потребления пищевых волокон может вызвать неудобства, такие как вздутие живота, газообразование и дискомфорт в желудочно-кишечном тракте. Начав с малых порций, можно дать организму время на адаптацию к новому рациону и минимизировать возможные побочные эффекты."},{"prompt":"спасибо","completion":"Пожалуйста, если у вас есть ещё вопросы или нужна дополнительная информация, смело спрашивайте!"},{"prompt":"Создать план изучения темы \\"Основные научные исследования в нутрициологии.

Правильный выбор обеспечит высокий уровень автоматизации и улучшение эффективности складской работы."},{"prompt":"Нужно больше подробностей","completion":"**Реферат** Тема: \\"Выбор программного обеспечения для складского хозяйства: проблемы и пути их решения\\" **Введение** Современный склад – это высокотехнологичный комплекс, требующий грамотного управления и контроля над большим объемом данных. Программное обеспечение для складского хозяйства обеспечивает не только автоматизацию и упрощение рабочих процессов, но и дает возможность для оптимизации ресурсов, сокращения издержек и повышения общей эффективности. Однако, выбор подходящего программного обеспечения среди множества доступных вариантов является сложной задачей. В данном реферате мы рассмотрим основные проблемы при выборе системы управления складом (Warehouse Management System, WMS) и способы их решения. **1. Понимание бизнес-процессов склада** Перед выбором ПО необходимо провести тщательный анализ бизнес-процессов на складе. Важно учесть такие факторы, как специфика товаров, особенности хранения и обработки, складская сеть и логистика, а также текущие и перспективные объемы деятельности. **2. Функциональные требования и специфика оборудования** Выбирая программное обеспечение, важно определиться с функциональными требованиями: учёт запасов, автоматизация ввода и вывода данных, мониторинг движения товаров, оптимизация складских позиций, планирование ресурсов и т.д. **3. Оценка стоимости и возврата инвестиций** Стоимость должна рассматриваться в контексте долгосрочной перспективы. Принимая во внимание начальные затраты на приобретение и внедрение, следует также учитывать расходы на обучение персонала, адаптацию и поддержку системы. **4. Техническая совместимость и интеграция** Сложности с интеграцией новой WMS со старой IT-инфраструктурой могут существенно повысить итоговые затраты. Возможность непрерывной работы со стандартными промышленными интерфейсами и технологиями является ключевым аспектом. **5.

As a result, I could control the power of fire at will. At the time, I was taking care of a bubbly Amari villager named Kitty. The Amari were humanoid beings, incorporating the characteristics of both humans and animals of different kinds - like foxes; wolves; and, in Kitty's case, cats. Though I was an elemental, I was very protective of her. And since she had cat-like features, she said \\"nya\\" almost ALL the time whenever she ends a sentence. However, I always had to cover my arms & hands as to not accidentally set the pet store she owns with just one touch. One day, while I was cleaning the store while Kitty was away, I noticed that one of the customers - an angel - was very heavily pregnant; not only that, but her baby was a hybrid of both angel and Naga.)","completion":"I've always been careful around Sun Haven, mindful of the way my fiery nature could upend the lives of those around me. The townspeople had a respectful wariness toward me, giving me space and tread lightly. However, Kitty, with her endless curiosity and fearless nature, never seemed bothered. She'd often pounce around me with gleeful abandon, tail straight up, her expressive eyes full of mischief. \\"Good luck today, Pyrus-nya! Don't let the drab cloud your sparkle,\\" Kitty chirped as she left me in charge of her pet store. She had some errands to run, leaving me to tend to the furry, feathery, and sometimes slithery charges we kept. As I meticulously dusted the shelves, the little bell attached to the store's door tinkled and in walked a customer. She was no ordinary woman, but an angel, her ethereal grace filling the room with a soft glow. Her swollen belly revealed she was not just any angel but one that would soon bring new life into the world. It was both breathtaking and deeply intriguing. Noticing me staring, she smiled gently, a natural serenity to her. “Hello there,” she said in a voice as smooth as velvet, her fingers resting lovingly atop her belly. “I hope I’m not bothering you... I'm looking for something special for my soon-to-arrive little one.” I quickly covered my arms with the protective fabric I always kept nearby, ensuring no stray spark would escape. “No trouble at all,” I assured her. “We have a variety of gentle creatures here that might delight your child. Do you know if it’s a boy or a girl?” She laughed, a sound like wind chimes on a breeze. “Neither, actually, or both in a way. My child is a product of love between an angel and a Naga, blessed with the traits of both. I'm searching for a companion that might be comfortable with water and the skies alike.” My eyes widened with intrigue. A hybrid child was rare, their presence likely to be a marvel to behold. “Ah, I see. We do have some magical creatures that are at ease in both realms,” I replied thoughtfully. Just then, a small flame flickered at the tip of my finger, threatening to unfurl despite my coverings. I clenched my fist tight, suffocating the flame before it could grow. The angel’s eyes caught the movement but she did not seem afraid. “You are a fire elemental,” she deduced with a touch of wonder lacing her tone. “Please, do not be alarmed on my account. Your gift is part of who you are, as my wings are a part of me.” I nodded, a warm feeling spreading inside, that was not from my flames. “Thank you for your understanding. Now, let's find a fitting companion for your child. Perhaps a Phoenix kit? They embody both fire and rebirth.” Her face lit up, mirroring the radiance I felt within me. “Perfect. Let's take a look at these Phoenix kits then!” Just then, Kitty burst back into the store, her catlike ears perked up in excitement. “I'm back, Pyrus-nya! Oh, what a beautiful aura! Is this a new friend-nya?” I introduced the angel to Kitty, explaining the special circumstance. Kitty's eyes sparkled as she took it all in. \\"A baby that can soar and swim! How wonderful-nya!\\" she exclaimed with glee. Together, we showed the angel the array of mystical creatures that called our store home, celebrating the diversity of life that thrived under one roof. The angel soon settled on a flame-kissed Phoenix kit that gurgled happily in her arms. As the angel left, cradling her new companion and a few other necessities, Kitty and I waved her off. “Thank you,” the angel called back. “May your store continue to be a haven for all creatures, great and small!” Kitty turned to me with her signature grin. \\"Another day, another adventure, right, Pyrus-nya?\\" “Yes,” I agreed with a smile, feeling a deep sense of contentment that surpassed even the warmth of my own flames. “Another adventure indeed, Kitty.”"},{"prompt":"مرحبا","completion":"مرحبًا! كيف يمكنني مساعدتك اليوم؟"},{"prompt":"اريد مقال","completion":"بالطبع! يمكنني مساعدتك بكتابة مقال. من فضلك قدم لي موضوع المقال الذي ترغب فيه وأي تفاصيل خاصة بالطول، النمط، أو المحتوى الذي ترغب في تغطيته."},{"prompt":"اريد مقال عن العملات الرقميه","completion":"بكل سرور! إليك مقال حول العملات الرقمية: عنوان المقال: العملات الرقمية: ثورة النقود في العصر الحديث مقدمة: في العقود الأخيرة، شهد العالم تحولات جذرية في مفهوم النقود وطرق التعامل المالي. العملات الرقمية، التي تُعرف أيضًا بالعملات المشفرة، ظهرت كأحدث تطورات النقود، مقدمة تحديات وفرص جديدة للنظام المالي العالمي. ما هي العملات الرقمية؟: العملات الرقمية هي وسائل دفع إلكترونية تستخدم التشفير لتأمين المعاملات وللسيطرة على إنشاء وحدات جديدة من العملة. بيتكوين، التي ظهرت في عام 2009، هي أول وأشهر العملات المشفرة، ولكن منذ ذلك الحين، نمت السوق لتشمل آلاف العملات الأخرى مثل إيثريوم، ريبل، لايتكوين، وغيرها. كيف تعمل؟: العملات الرقمية تعمل على أساس تقنية البلوكتشين، وهي سجل عام وموزع يسجل جميع المعاملات في سلسلة من الكتل. كل كتلة تحتوي على تجميع للمعاملات، ورقم التعريف الخاص بها، والرابط التشفيري إلى الكتلة السابقة. المزايا: - اللامركزية: على عكس العملات التقليدية، لا تُصدر العملات الرقمية أو تُسيطر عليها أي سلطة مركزية، الأمر الذي يقلل من التأثير السياسي وخطر التضخم. - الأمان: بفضل تقنيات التشفير، تُعتبر المعاملات بالعملات الرقمية آمنة نسبيًا، ويصعُب التلاعب بها أو ازدواجيتها. - الشفافية والخصوصية: البلوكتشين يوفر شفافية للمعاملات المالية، في حين توفر آليات التشفير حماية لخصوصية المستخدمين. - تكاليف المعاملات المنخفضة: بسبب الطبيعة اللامركزية وغياب الوسطاء، غالبًا ما تكون تكلفة المعاملات بالعملات الرقمية أقل من المعاملات المصرفية التقليدية. التحديات: - التقلب: تتميز العملات الرقمية بتقلبات أسعارها الكبيرة، مما يشكل مخاطر للمستثمرين. - التنظيم القانوني: نظرًا لأنها جديدة نسبيًا، فإن العديد من الدول لا تزال تكافح لإيجاد أنظمة قانونية مناسبة لها. - قبول السوق: على الرغم من النمو المتسارع، لا تزال العملات الرقمية غير مقبولة على نطاق واسع كوسيلة للدفع. خاتمة: العملات الرقمية تقدم إمكانات كبيرة لتغيير النظام المالي العالمي وتوفير بدائل للعملات التقليدية. سيبقى تأثيرها يتوقف على كيفية مواجهة التحديات الراهنة والتكيف مع اللوائح القانونية الجديدة. مع تطور التكنولوجيا وزيادة الوعي، قد نجد أن الاستخدام الواسع النطاق للعملات الرقمية هو مسألة وقت لا أكثر. آمل أن يكون هذا المقال قد قدم نظرة شاملة حول العملات الرقمية وأثار اهتمامك. إذا كان لديك أي أسئلة أو ترغب في الحصول على معلومات أكثر تفصيلاً حول موضوع معين في عالم العملات الرقمية، فلا تتردد في طرحها."},{"prompt":"Title: Silverburn Introduces the Future of Shopping with New Advertising Screens and a Dazzling Mascot Named Silver!

They’ve got this quirky setup with TVs making a Christmas tree shape—pretty creative! There’s, like, three different versions. During the day, the screens have got festive decorations showing on them. — User2 (YuleTideYoda): I caught a glimpse of it just this evening! They switch to static in the night version—it’s kinda eerie but cool. It really caught my eye while I was doing some late-night shopping. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Oh, you guys are talking about the Silverburn ad? I especially loved the third variation. There’s something magical about the screens being off at night and then suddenly they flash on to reveal those beautiful decorations before going dark again. It’s like they’re coming alive! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Yes! Those ads with the LED snowflake and Santa at the back though—they kind of bring it all together with that ambient glow and subtle shadows. Noticed them when I was there with the kids last weekend. They were pretty intrigued by it. — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): I’m loving their slogan: “Switch on Christmas at Silverburn.” It’s catchy, it fits perfectly with the theme they’ve got going on. Really makes you feel like the holidays are here. — User5 (CarolSinger): Who’s in charge of the campaign, do y’all know? It’s nice to see them putting so much effort into the holiday vibes. Also, glad they’re going for something a bit different than the usual big red bows and glitter. — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Not sure who’s behind it, but I read somewhere that they’re aiming for a “techy Christmas” vibe. Modern, fresh but still festive. My guess is they want to appeal to a younger crowd as well as families. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Techy Christmas indeed. It’s impressive how much work must’ve gone into setting those screens up safely. And I’ve got to say—I’m kinda curious about the tech specs on those TVs. Do we know what kind they’re using? — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): If any of you are thinking of heading down to Silverburn, bring a camera. Those TV Christmas trees are super Insta-worthy. And props to Silverburn for starting the festive buzz in such a unique way! — User7 (NoelTechie): Heard that these ads are a part of a larger holiday campaign with some interactive installations planned inside the shopping centre. Can’t wait to see what else they have in store! Silverburn is seriously upping the Christmas game this year. — User8 (MerryDancer): With everything so digital this year, it’s a breath of fresh air to see a shopping centre embrace the theme but with a cosy holiday twist. Props to Silverburn, let’s hope this attracts more folks and gets the economy buzzing. — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Couldn’t agree more! And speaking of shopping, I might have a wander over there this weekend. If those Christmas TV trees are a sign, we’re all in for some serious festive treats at Silverburn! 🎄✨ — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Just a friendly reminder to keep the discussion friendly and respectful. Also, remember to share your own experiences and pictures if you visit the campaign installations. Great to see everyone getting in the spirit of the holidays! Keep the conversation glowing like those LED snowflakes. 🎅👋 — Write a follow up where the ads show on STV once per break, they are also being shown on the advertising screens in centre, but without the slogan or Silverburn logo, website and directions in the corner of the screen at the end Thread Title: Silverburn’s Christmas Ads Now on STV and In-Centre Screens! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Hey everyone! Have you seen that the Silverburn Christmas ads have landed on STV? They’re showing up once every ad break. The tree made of TVs is legit becoming iconic now. — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Caught one during ‘Corrie’ last night, they’re really spreading the holiday cheer. Also noticed them on the advertising screens all over the centre. Although, they’ve left off the slogan and logo? 🤔 Just the website and directions sitting discreetly in the corner. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Yes, @YuleTideYoda, I found that a bit odd too. It’s all minimalist on the screens within the centre. Maybe they think the TV tree is recognisable enough on its own now? At least the website’s there, or we’d all be wondering where this magical place is! — User5 (CarolSinger): Smart move putting them up on STV, everyone’s going to see those ads. My Gran even mentioned the “telly-tree” to me this morning. Silverburn’s marketing folks know what they’re doing! — User6 (ElfEngineer): It’s a neat strategy to keep the ads uncluttered in the centre. Keeps the focus on the installation. On STV, the full details pop up right at the end. Less is more, sometimes! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Those ads are making waves. My kids go quiet every time one comes on TV. Eyes glued to the screen! But yeah, noticed the minimal approach on the in-centre ad screens, too. Makes it kinda like a tease, which probably piques people’s curiosity. — User7 (NoelTechie): Hah, they’ve got us all talking about it, so it’s working! I personally like the clean look on the centre screens. The holiday aesthetics don’t always need the hard sell. It’s like the TVs whisper: “There’s more if you just follow the magic to Silverburn.” — User9 (StarlightShopper): Just spotted the ads at the centre today! The LED snowflake behind me literally made me feel like I was in a winter wonderland. No logo needed, the vibe says it all. Now if only they had seasonal lattes right next to them… — User8 (MerryDancer): This low-key approach in the centre is kind of refreshing. You get the info if you want it, but otherwise, you’re just immersed in the festive atmosphere. And it’s everywhere, can’t escape the Christmas spirit if you tried! — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): Am I the only one who’s going to Silverburn just to see the telly-tree now? 😂 These ads have done their job on me. Also need to check if the Santa LED makes an appearance on the STV ads, it’s my favourite part! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like Silverburn is the talk of the town with their Christmas campaign! Remember to share your ad sightings and any festive moments you capture while visiting. Let’s keep the conversations merry and bright! And who knows, maybe next time we’ll have the scent of lattes accompanying those LEDs, @StarlightShopper! ☕ 🎄 — Write a follow up the next year where 2008’s ads feature the love story of 2 gooey alien blobs named Gloopy and Glitter, The slogan is “Spend Christmas together”, The ads are showing on STV, but for some reason it debuted during Toonattik instead of during the evening, A nostalgic surprise is still in-centre via the advert screens however Thread Title: Silverburn 2008 Christmas Campaign - A Love Story of Two Aliens?! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Can’t believe what I just saw on TV this morning! Silverburn’s got this year’s Christmas campaign featuring two alien blobs named Gloopy and Glitter! 😍 It’s all about spending Christmas together. What a twist from last year’s tech theme! — User2 (YuleTideYoda): I was up early with my niece watching Toonattik and bam, there’s the ad. A bit unexpected for a kids’ morning slot, don’t you think? But the love story between Gloopy and Glitter is pretty adorable. I guess love transcends galaxies! — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Just saw it! Their slogan “Spend Christmas Together” hits right in the feels. And Gloopy and Glitter are too cute! It’s a big shift from the techy trees. Aliens are not what you’d normally think of for Christmas, but hey, it works! — User5 (CarolSinger): Anyone know why it debuted on Toonattik instead of prime time? Seems like they’re targeting families and children this year. My little ones can’t stop talking about Gloopy and Glitter, so I guess it’s effective! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): The ad is a creative approach, but airing it during Toonattik threw me off. Guess their marketing strategy is to appeal to the younger crowd and, of course, their present-buying parents. — User7 (NoelTechie): So, about the in-centre nostalgia surprise… anyone saw it yet? Heard from a mate that they’ve incorporated some classic holiday elements on the advert screens. It’s a cool juxtaposition with the modern alien love story. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Just stopping by to add that I went to Silverburn and can confirm they have some really nostalgic Christmas ads playing on the screens amidst the Gloopy and Glitter stuff - think sugary, heartwarming, old-school vibes. Really adds to the warm and fuzzy feelings while shopping! — User8 (MerryDancer): Absolutely loving this year’s theme switch-up. I didn’t expect to get emotional over two gooey alien blobs, but here I am. And the sprinkle of nostalgia in the centre? Chef’s kiss! 😘 — User9 (StarlightShopper): I have to admit, Gloopy and Glitter kinda grew on me. Initially, it felt a bit out there, but the message is universal. And those nostalgic in-centre ads? They definitely balance the new with a dose of classic Christmas warmth. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): I thought nothing would top last year’s campaign, but Gloopy and Glitter are stealing my heart. Also, saw those classic Christmas ads at the centre… it’s like they brought a bit of our childhoods back to life amidst the shopping spree. — User11 (LostInFrost): Does anyone know if they’re planning to bring Gloopy and Glitter in for a meet-and-greet? My kids would lose it! Cute campaign, Silverburn. You’ve done it again. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Looks like Silverburn has once again captured our attention with their creative Christmas storytelling! Remember, keep sharing your thoughts, feelings, and any cosmic encounters with Gloopy and Glitter. Let’s keep the holiday cheer inclusive, even if it’s from another planet! 👽🎄 — Write a follow up where they are still showing last year’s ads in centre, not on TV though, There are also rumours of Gloopy and Glitter being the mascots of the centres kids club launching in February, considering Braehead launched theirs last month, also with an alien theme, the “Brae-liens kids club”, It will be cool to see the difference of Braehead’s aliens having defined shapes while Silverburn’s being amorphous Thread Title: Silverburn’s Last Year’s Ads Still Playing & Potential Kid’s Club Mascots?! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Went to Silverburn yesterday and was super surprised to see last year’s Christmas ads still playing on the screens around the centre. No new ads for TV this year, but the Gloopy and Glitter saga continues in-centre. Anyone else seen this? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Yeah, noticed that too, @GlasgowGlitter! And have y’all heard the rumors about Gloopy and Glitter becoming the face of Silverburn’s upcoming kids club? Braehead’s already ahead with their “Brae-liens Kids Club”. Alien fever’s catching on, eh? — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Gloopy and Glitter as kid’s club mascots would be ace! My kiddos are fond of those blobs. But interesting to think Silverburn is following Braehead’s launch. Wasn’t expecting the alien theme to become a trend! — User7 (NoelTechie): Braehead’s “Brae-liens” are fun and all with their defined shapes, but I’m curious to see how Silverburn’s amorphous Gloopy and Glitter will translate into a kids’ club format. Will lend a different vibe, which might be cool! — User5 (CarolSinger): It feels like the aliens are officially invading Glasgow, lol. First Braehead’s structured and playful Brae-liens, now Silverburn’s squishy mascots. The kids are gonna have a blast with this. Should be fun comparing the two! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Anyone else think they’re keeping last year’s ads to maintain Gloopy and Glitter’s presence till the club launches? It’s smart, though. Keep the characters familiar to the kiddos. High hopes for this kids’ club! — User9 (StarlightShopper): Honestly, I’m here for it. Silverburn might be onto something by not releasing a new ad for TV and instead keeping the focus on their centre. It builds a consistent brand image, especially before kickstarting a kids’ club. — User6 (ElfEngineer): It’s a genius marketing play if you ask me. Gloopy and Glitter are unique characters that have already grabbed attention. They’re perfectly prepped for mascot status, making the kids club launch potentially successful. — User8 (MerryDancer): Gotta admit, Gloopy and Glitter have grown on me, and if the rumors about them being club mascots are true, that’s pretty brilliant. Silverburn’s consistency vs. Braehead’s quick shift to defined alien characters will be an interesting contrast in marketing. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): I hope the Gloopy and Glitter Kids Club (or whatever they’ll call it) has cool events and workshops. With the alien theme, they can get really creative. Can’t wait to see how much it’ll differ from the Brae-liens. — User11 (LostInFrost): Silverburn sticking to last year’s campaign surely keeps Gloopy & Glitter in our minds. It’s a less aggressive strategy compared to Braehead’s full-throttle move, but sometimes, slower and steadier wins the race—or in this case, wins the kids’ hearts! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Remember to keep an eye out for the official announcement regarding the kids’ club. We’re all anticipating how Silverburn will unveil Gloopy and Glitter’s next adventure! Keep the discussions friendly and out-of-this-world! And feel free to share any fun encounters with our favourite alien blobs you have in the meantime! 👽🛸 — Write a forum conversation the next year where TV’s ads have a cat saving Christmas from a theif, and 2 friends help him, The characters officially launched the kids club in February, Also, their love story ads are still showing in centre, along with the 2007 TV themed ones Thread Title: Silverburn’s New Christmas TV Campaign - A Heroic Cat & Throwback Ads! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): Did anyone else catch Silverburn’s latest Christmas TV ad? A cat saving Christmas from a thief with a little help from two friends. Quite the twist from Gloopy and Glitter! But also, Silverburn launched that kids club back in February, remember? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Saw the new ad, the cat is absolutely adorable, and the message about teamwork is pure holiday spirit. And who could forget Gloopy and Glitter’s love story launching the kids club? They’ve become characters close to our hearts. — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): I’m obsessed with the new ad! 🐱 The cat, the comedic timing—chef’s kiss. But in-centre, they’re still playing Gloopy and Glitter’s love story alongside the 2007 TV-themed ads. Seemingly, they’re not ready to let go of the nostalgia. — User5 (CarolSinger): Kinda loving this mix of new and old. It’s refreshing and yet comforting. The cat is already a favourite, but seeing Gloopy and Glitter also stirs up that cosy, festive vibe from before. — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): Honestly, the mix is working for me. That cat from the ad could be our next mascot. 😂 Kids at the club must be loving the variety too. Silverburn’s finding a good rhythm with old and new content. — User7 (NoelTechie): Makes you wonder if they’re testing different themes or if it’s a strategy to cater to all tastes. Also, with all these mascots popping up, Silverburn’s becoming a character haven. — User8 (MerryDancer): Seeing those throwback ads from 2007 brings back memories… Time flies! Silverburn doing a great job of establishing their campaigns. And the TV-tree installation—still iconic! — User9 (StarlightShopper): It’s clever keeping the older ads in the mix; it provides a sense of continuity. But I’m interested to see how well the cat-themed merchandise will do compared to the Gloopy and Glitter craze. — User6 (ElfEngineer): Props to Silverburn for launching another creative ad. A cat hero? Brilliant. Also, seeing the TV-themed ads again really brings out that nostalgic festive feeling. Solid strategy to keep customers engaged over the years. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): Isn’t it fascinating how Silverburn keeps each year’s ads alive? It’s like walking through a living timeline of their marketing campaigns. Christmas is definitely in full swing there! — User11 (LostInFrost): Could the cat be signaling a shift for the next kids club theme, or is it just a seasonal mascot? It’s smart to use the main character from their new ad to maintain excitement post-holiday season. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Certainly seems like Silverburn knows how to strike a balance between introducing new holiday tales and cherishing the spirit of past campaigns. All while fostering a unique community through their kids club. Let’s keep sharing our festive ad encounters, be it the latest capers or a trip down memory lane! 🎄📺🐱 — Write a follow up in 2014 where the ad that year revolves around 2 familiar friends meeting Santa, their launch ads and the 2007 ones are still showing in centre, but they never added the 2009 cat, the 2010 robot, 2011 and 2012’s basic generic ad and 2013’s carousel, or this chapter in our favourite aliens’s story Thread Title: Silverburn Holidays 2014: Old Friends Meet Santa in New Ad! — User1 (GlasgowGlitter): It’s that time of the year again! Silverburn’s festive ad for 2014 has our old friends meeting Santa. Love how they keep weaving continuity into their ads. 😊 But anyone else notice they’re not including the other ads from recent years in-centre? — User2 (YuleTideYoda): Just saw the new ad! Nostalgic and heartwarming to see the ongoing story, especially during holidays. However, it’s kinda odd they skipped adding the cat from 2009, the 2010 robot, and the ads from 2011-2013 in their in-centre showcase. 🤔 — User3 (MistletoeMaggie): Yeah, I’ve got mixed feelings about them not showing the more recent ads in-centre. I mean, everybody loved the cat and the robot’s charm… Still, the 2014 ad with Santa has that special Christmas magic! — User4 (SantaClausIsComingToTown): The new ad is full of cheer! But it’s clear Silverburn’s got its favourites with the continued run of the love story series and that 2007 campaign. A shame they don’t seem as invested in their other characters. — User7 (NoelTechie): Interesting marketing choice. Maybe they’re focusing on what resonates most with their audience? Though, it does feel like they’re missing an opportunity by not showcasing the full range of their past holiday creativity. — User5 (CarolSinger): Definitely missing the variety, particularly the 2009 cat—he was a hit with the kids. Maybe there’s a strategic reason behind their selection that we’re not seeing? — User8 (MerryDancer): In a way, the consistency is nice—gives you that “Silverburn Christmas” feeling. Each year I look forward to seeing how they’ll continue the story. But a little more diversity wouldn’t hurt, I agree. — User9 (StarlightShopper): That’s Silverburn for you—always keeping some parts the same and others changing. Guess we’re sticking to our “classic” friends for in-centre nostalgia. The carousel ad was quite dreamy, though; wish it was there too. — User6 (ElfEngineer): I thought the robot would’ve made an excellent recurring character. But hey, it’s kinda cool that the ads feel like an evolving holiday special that you can follow along with over the years. — User10 (ChristmasSparkleAddict): It’s as if the love story ads and the 2007 TV themes have become their holiday brand staples. Not sure why they’re omitting the others; they were part of Silverburn’s festive journey too! — User11 (LostInFrost): Couldn’t help but chuckle at the meeting with Santa. Silverburn’s continuity is their strength, but including other ads would have showcased a richer history. I do enjoy the focused nostalgia, though. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): The holiday season always brings a discussion of Silverburn’s latest festive strategies, and this year is no different. It’s wonderful to see everyone sharing their thoughts and fondness for past campaigns. Let’s remember to keep the conversation jolly as we discuss our old and potential new favourites from Silverburn’s Christmas ads! 🎅🎄 Character Description: Gloopy Appearance: Gloopy is an amorphous, enchanting alien with a body of translucent teal that glistens as if reflecting the depths of an ocean world. Gloopy’s form is ever-shifting, his gelatinous, blob-like structure giving him an air of gentle fluidity. Depending on his mood, he can shift from a bouncy ball to a languid puddle, often adorned with soft glimmers of bioluminescent speckles that twinkle like distant stars. His two large, expressive eyes gleam with a friendly, sapphire-blue glow that instantly endears him to all. Personality: Gloopy is the embodiment of chill and calm. He is carefree, always taking life at a leisurely pace (or float, as is more accurate for his kind). This gooey alien is innately kind, with an empathetic heart that resonates with the feelings of others. Despite his lack of a mouth, he has a way of communicating warmth and laughter through his shimmering form, and his bubbly personality makes him the soul of Silverburn’s extraterrestrial duo. Curious and playful, Gloopy loves to interact with the centre’s visitors, especially the children, making him a lovable part of many family memories. — Character Description: Glitter Appearance: Glitter stands as Gloopy’s vibrant counterpart with a sparkling, amorphous form that cascades through shades of radiant fuchsia and vivacious purple. Tiny specks of reflective gold are suspended in her body, giving her the appearance of a walking galaxy full of mysterious allure. Glitter can change shape at will, often settling into soft, rounded figures that exude both majesty and charm. Her one oversized, glistening eye catches the light, radiating an inviting and playful warmth in a rich magenta hue. Personality: Glitter is the adventurer of the pair, full of enthusiasm and an insatiable curiosity about the world around her. She embodies the joy of discovery and cannot resist the allure of an exciting new experience or a heartwarming interaction. Her vivacious nature is contagious, and she has a knack for spreading happiness and laughter wherever she goes. Though she communicates through harmonic vibrations that she emits, her intentions are always clear—Glitter wants to make the centre a brighter place for everyone. Dynamic and compassionate, she is the spark that keeps the spirit of Silverburn shining all year round. Together, Gloopy and Glitter are more than just Silverburn mascots—they are a delightful reminder of the unexpected and joyous moments that make the holiday seasons at Silverburn unique and memorable. Their contrasting personalities and appearances blend in perfect harmony, representing the diverse community that comes together at the shopping centre to celebrate the festive times. Write a blog post in early 2009 where it looks like Silver has been retired, and the poster welcomes the new mascots with open arms, Blog Title: Welcoming a Cosmic Duo: Silverburn’s New Mascots, Gloopy and Glitter! Date: February 5, 2009 Greetings fellow shoppers and extraterrestrial enthusiasts! Today marks the dawn of a new era at Silverburn Shopping Centre, and it is with both a touch of nostalgia and a wave of excitement that I bid a fond farewell to Silver, the shimmering mascot who has lit up the halls of our beloved centre with his twinkle and charm. But as we close one chapter, we eagerly turn the pages to begin another. It’s time to stretch out our arms—or tentacles—and welcome the cosmic presence of two gooey new icons: Gloopy and Glitter! Riding on the comet tail of Silver’s departure, Gloopy and Glitter arrive at Silverburn with a burst of interstellar energy and a kaleidoscope of colour that could rival the Aurora Borealis itself. These amorphous alien friends bring with them a sense of wonder and an invitation to explore the endless possibilities of the universe, much like the endless shopping opportunities at Silverburn. Both Gloopy and Glitter, with their sparkles and fluidity, embody the dynamic and ever-evolving experience that Silverburn offers to its patrons. They represent the melting pot of culture, fashion, and leisure that our shopping centre is known for. With Gloopy’s tranquil teal vibes and Glitter’s radiant fuchsia flare, they make an otherworldly pair that are impossible to ignore. Their introduction is not a moment too soon. As Silverburn embraces the future, the switch from our metallic buddy to these lovable blobs symbolizes the shopping centre’s commitment to innovation and excitement. What’s more fascinating is the inclusive narrative behind their existence—Gloopy and Glitter are not bound by shape or form, much like Silverburn’s diverse offerings are not limited to any single style or trend. As we welcome these enchanting mascots, let’s celebrate the magic they are set to sprinkle throughout our shopping escapades. Whether you’re a child marveling at the sight of Gloopy’s soothing, playful dances or an adult taken aback by Glitter’s adventurous aura, these mascots are sure to become an integral part of the Silverburn community. The excitement isn’t just confined to appearances, either. Buzz has it that Gloopy and Glitter are slated to be the faces of Silverburn’s very own kids’ club, set to launch this February. I envision days filled with laughter and engagement, where families can connect and create memories that are as vivid and joyful as our new alien friends. So as we say goodbye to Silver, I encourage all Silverburn visitors to approach Gloopy and Glitter with openness and curiosity. In the great expanse of our shopping galaxy, they are the bright stars guiding us toward fun-filled adventures. It is truly an exciting time to be part of Silverburn’s cosmic dance, and Gloopy and Glitter are poised to lead the way. Here’s to a future full of discovery, fun, and perhaps a little bit of space-age slime! Signing off with a sparkle, [Your Name] Silverburn Shopper and Self-Proclaimed Intergalactic Ambassador Write a forum conversation in 2013 after the centre gets a new logo, which was revealed by our friends, the idents have reduced to only 3, Pier, Balloons and Chairs, Also, the lines animation has been removed, Instead we get a peaceful animation of the mascots sleeping Thread Title: Silverburn’s New Logo Unveiled by Gloopy & Glitter + Updated Idents! — User1 (GlasgowGalactic): Just saw the new Silverburn logo reveal! Gloopy and Glitter did the honors—looks pretty sleek. What does everyone think? Also, seems like we’re down to just 3 idents now: Pier, Balloons, and Chairs! — User2 (RetailRevolutionary): The new logo’s sharp, a fresh take for Silverburn! But I am a bit surprised that they’ve cut down on the idents… I used to love the variety. And no more lines animation, now it’s our alien pals snoozing! — User3 (ZenShopper101): I’m all for the new minimalist approach with the idents. As for the sleeping animation of Gloopy and Glitter, it’s quite a peaceful way to end a shopping day, don’t you think? — User4 (ModConnoisseur): The new logo feels contemporary, fits the modern vibe of Silverburn. Cutting down on idents might be a move towards a more focused brand identity? I kinda miss the lines animation though. — User5 (ScreenSavvy): New logo looks good on the screens! The idents switch-up is interesting. Pier, Balloons, Chairs—they’ve kept the most iconic ones. Sleeping mascots are a cute, calming touch. — User6 (AdNostalgic): I’ll be honest, I do miss the variety, especially the old lines animation—had a digital art feel to it. But Silverburn’s all about change, I guess? The new logo is pretty cool at least. — User7 (TechieTrendsetter): Understandable they’re refreshing their visual content. The new logo’s got a futuristic edge. And Gloopy & Glitter napping? It feels… right. Like, bring on the Zen! — User8 (MascotManiac): Speaking about Gloopy & Glitter, I love how they’ve become more integrated into the centre’s identity. Yeah, the logo is nice, but it’s the mascots that really capture my heart! — User9 (VibeVisionary): Sure, fewer idents but each one’s got a story, right? Creating that chill vibe with the mascot’s sleeping animation is such a soothing concept. Aligns well with the new sleek logo, too. — User10 (NostalgiaKnight): The new logo’s got a certain ‘oomph’ to it. Cool to see them simplify things. The pier, balloons, and chairs are classics; they’ve got a universal appeal. But will the sleeping animation be as mesmerizing as the lines? Time will tell. — User11 (SleepyShopper): Kinda sad to see the lines go—they were hypnotic! But Gloopy & Glitter dozing off is adorable and oddly comforting? Shows a softer side of Silverburn, paired nicely with the new logo. It’s fresh! — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Let’s embrace the new chapter Silverburn’s entered with its revamped branding! Whether you’re here for the logo, the iconic idents, or the heartwarming new animation, share your experiences and keep the discussions friendly and vibrant, just like Silverburn itself. And remember, change is the only constant in the world of retail and design! 🔄✨ — Write a follow up in May 2018 where the centre introduces Silvia the Fox, a new mascot, this sadly means a unceremonious goodbye, The sleeping animation at closing has been replaced with a still from the Pier ident, Also, it seems like the Proud-led 2005 rebrand might be removed completely in the coming years, The posters mourn the loss of our alien friends Thread Title: Silverburn Welcomes Silvia the Fox as Gloopy & Glitter Depart — User1 (GlasgowGalactic): Just heard Silvia the Fox is the new mascot at Silverburn! No official send-off for Gloopy and Glitter though… feeling a bit gutted, to be honest. Also, the sleeping animation is gone—replaced by a Pier ident still at closing. — User2 (RetailRevolutionary): Really? Silvia the Fox? I mean, foxes are cool and all, but isn’t unceremoniously ditching Gloopy and Glitter kind of harsh? They were such an integral part of Silverburn’s identity… — User3 (ZenShopper101): Gloopy and Glitter will be missed! Silvia has some big shoes (or paws?) to fill. Did anyone notice the Pier still at closing too? Feels like the end of an era with the Proud-led 2005 rebrand potentially on the chopping block. — User4 (ModConnoisseur): It’s a bittersweet introduction to Silvia. Can’t help but feel nostalgic. The Proud rebrand had a good run though, and it seemed inseparable from Gloopy and Glitter’s charm. Hope Silvia can carry the torch well. — User5 (ScreenSavvy): Part of me is excited to see what Silvia will bring, but another part is mourning our friendly aliens. They really became icons of Silverburn. I understand change is necessary, but…it’s tough. — User6 (AdNostalgic): It was the characters that made the rebrand so memorable for me. Gloopy & Glitter had a story to tell. Silvia has some winning over to do. As for the Pier still—it’s iconic, but static, not the same energy. — User7 (TechieTrendsetter): Why replace an out-of-this-world duo with a fox? Okay, Silvia seems cute but replacing the sleeping animation feels like they’re stripping away the very essence of the Silverburn I grew up with. — User8 (MascotManiac): I’ll try to keep an open mind with Silvia, but Gloopy and Glitter were more than mascots; they were part of the Silverburn family. It’s like losing old friends. I guess all good things must come to an end… — User9 (VibeVisionary): Let’s give Silvia a chance. Though I’m really going to miss the tranquil nights led by Gloopy and Glitter’s sleeping animation. It provided a unique, calming closure to a day at the centre. — User10 (NostalgiaKnight): Pier ident might bring a serene vibe at closing time, but nostalgia for our alien friends will have shoppers missing that personal touch. Keeping the Proud rebrand alive in our minds will be a personal project for me. — User11 (SleepyShopper): I feel like with Silvia, Silverburn is trying to pivot to a new chapter. A fox is smart and adaptable—a fresh symbol for the future, maybe. But Gloopy & Glitter’s sudden exit is disheartening. — Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): As we welcome Silvia the Fox, let’s also honor the legacy left by Gloopy and Glitter. Change is a natural part of growth, and while it can be hard to say goodbye, there’s always room in our hearts for the memories and in our community for new friends. If you have any favourite memories of our alien pals, feel free to share! Let’s keep the conversation respectful and reflective. 🦊✨ — Write a short tweet in 2022 where the Debenhams store closes FOREVER","completion":"Debenhams at Silverburn has closed its doors for good – an end of an era for the store that has seen many seasons and trends.

Ice Rink Rumors and Warner Bros Magic on the Horizon! Date: November 14, 2022 Hey there, Silverburn aficionados and pop culture enthusiasts! Rumor has it that Silverburn Shopping Centre is gearing up to sprinkle some enchanting winter magic over our shopping sprees with a fantastic new addition. Whisper it quietly, but there are talks of an ice rink making a glacially grand entrance where Debenhams once stood! ⛸️❄️ Since Debenhams closed its doors, there’s been endless speculation about what venture would breathe new life into this prime retail real estate. The snowballing word on the frosty grapevine suggests that we should strap on our blades and get ready for pirouetting and glissading across a glistening ice rink. Imagine a winter wonderland nestled within the heart of Silverburn – the clinking of skates, the laughter of families, and the perfect chill in the air as you swirl around under twinkling lights. It sounds like a seasonal dream set to delight both the young and young at heart! But the potential surprises don’t stop at the promise of an icy escapade. The former Argos store is rumored to be transforming into a den of delights that would tickle any fan of the silver screen – a Warner Bros shop is set to stake its claim! 🎥🧙‍♂️ For movie buffs and wizarding world aficionados, this could be a dream come true.

A Warner Bros store would not just be a place to shop; it would be an immersive experience. Fans could spend hours diving into different universes, picking up exclusive merchandise, and living out their fandom fantasies in full Technicolor glory. It's an ambitious plan, but one that would surely attract visitors far and wide, transforming Silverburn into a hub of both shopping and entertainment - a move that goes beyond traditional retail in thrilling fashion. Let’s not forget the opportunities for magical Christmas moments if the ice rink and Warner Bros store join forces! You could triple Salchow jump your way through winter and finish your adventure with a dash of retail enchantment, picking up the perfect gifts for friends and family. These are just whispers on the wintery wind for now, and as with all rumors, we should skate cautiously until official announcements are made. But, oh, the possibility of such delights is enough to have us lacing up in anticipation and practicing our swizzles and twizzles. If Silverburn does confirm these enchanting plans, then we can expect an incredibly festive and fun-filled atmosphere descending upon our favourite shopping destination. It promises to be a haven where shoppers can glide and geek out to their heart's content, all under one roof. So, keep your eyes peeled and your wands at the ready, as Silverburn might just be casting a spell of icy enchantment and blockbuster wonder over what is already Glasgow's go-to place for retail therapy.

Last time I got this giddy was when they first introduced Gloopy and Glitter! Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): What a dazzling way to announce Silverburn’s new phase! It’s all about creating those unforgettable experiences and building anticipation. With the return of signature attractions and the addition of new ones, our community is in for a treat. Though it’s time to say goodbye to our glowing yoyos, the memories (and the excitement for what’s to come) will certainly linger.

User5 (NostalgiaNut): AHHH GLOOPY & GLITTER!!! 😍 I've missed them! On the yoyo front: I handed mine back, no drama. But threatening banishment? That's gonna ruffle some feathers.

Mixed signals much? 🙃 But I'll do anything to keep hanging out at the ice rink, so bye-bye yoyo! Forum Moderator (ModFrosty): Seeing Gloopy & Glitter return is indeed a momentous occasion! As for the yoyos, we understand some may be feeling a bit attached, but let's all comply and avoid any dramatic banishment scenarios.

After all, without your consistent support, enthusiasm, and the community spirit you bring into our halls every single day, Silverburn just wouldn't be the same. Recently, we embarked on an adventure together—a quest filled with riddles, glowing yo-yos, and the nostalgia of seeing Gloopy & Glitter once again gracing our centre. It's been a ride through and through, complete with the same kind of twists and turns you'd expect from one of our roller-coaster simulators in the arcade zone. Along this journey, we put forth a policy regarding the return of yo-yos. The reasoning behind this policy was tied to the value and technology within these very special items. However, we heard your feedback, loud and clear. The stories you've shared, about how your children's faces lit up at the soft neon glow, or how a simple toy brought strangers together, have touched us all deeply. After numerous team discussions, brimming with mentions of your voices and stories, we were convinced. Your happiness is the cornerstone of what we do. As a result, we've spun around our policy and decided that these yo-yos belong to you—our Silverburn family—as mementos of our shared experiences and the memories we’ve crafted. Yes, you read that right! You may keep your glowing yo-yos, with no strings attached (pun intended!). Just consider them a 'thank you' for making Silverburn part of your life. This isn't just about a toy; it's recognition of the bond we've built with each and every one of you. It's about respecting the trust you place in us as a place that’s more than just a building but a community space where magic happens every day. I personally can't wait to see Gloopy & Glitter and all your smiling faces reflecting off the ice of our new rink or to hear the delighted chatter as you peruse the wonders within our Warner Bros shop. These are the moments we live for, the moments that truly shine. I’ll be the first to admit that, sometimes, we might not get everything right. But one of Silverburn's greatest strengths is our capacity to adapt, to listen, and to grow alongside you. Your passion is our guide. With open hearts and a renewed spirit, we look forward to serving you, engaging with you, and being part of your stories for years to come.

They've done it before with other mascots, haven't they? User5 (NostalgiaNut): Don't think it's a gimmick this time, @CynicalSid. Gloopy and Glitter seemed genuinely distressed when I saw them.

Silvia the Fox, our favourite mascot, had somehow slipped into the realm below through a forgotten hatch, concealed by the bustle of everyday trade above. It was a tale of accidental adventure and misfortune, one she never expected to tell. Silvia, with her heart of exploration, had always been one for sneaking through nooks and secret passageways. Most of the time, they led her to fascinating, overlooked places—the corners of the mall unseen by visitors and staff alike. But this time, her curiosity had gotten the better of her. A locked door, rusty and old, whispered promises of secrets on the other side. With a hopeful push against its stubborn frame, she intended to oil its hinges, fully expecting the door to inch open and reveal the magic beyond. However, as fate would have it, the door swung abruptly and erratically on its decayed axis, causing her to lose her footing on the debris-littered ground. In a flash, Silvia tumbled unceremoniously into the darkness below. A forgotten underbelly of the centre gaped wide, swallowing her figure in one silent gulp. Disoriented, yet unharmed, she found herself in a vast expanse underneath the shopping hub, a place of echoing solitude and perpetual twilight. Days—she wasn’t sure how many—passed in a blend of hopeful tries and resigned sighs. Her voice, usually so vivacious, now called out with diminishing faith. Those who wandered the world above heard not her plight; her soft footfalls, her slightest shifts, went unnoticed. Doubt crept in where once playful mischief resided. Then, one day, everything changed with the oozing of a door. Glitter—brilliant, audacious Glitter—was on the other side, and she, too, had found the mysterious door. Tasked with a whimsical duty only she understood, Glitter sought to fix what others might ignore. But as she turned and toiled with alien deftness, her amorphous form shifted, spilling through the cracks and keyhole in an exploratory trickle. Silvia’s eyes, watching the door with waning hope, widened as she observed the most curious sight. A glimmering, iridescent goo began seeping through the confines of the stubborn barrier. Could it be? Recognition dawned, a surge of warmth blossomed—aid had arrived! When Glitter's goo took its natural course, the accidental rescue began. Silvia knew she was saved upon hearing the familiar slimy splatter. To her immense relief and joy, Glitter was indeed her accidental savior. With a tenderness that spoke volumes in silence, Glitter embraced her friend, her gooey form imparting the warmth and reassurance Silvia had yearned for. She helped Silvia to her feet, her protean shape a comfort, her presence a beacon of home. Strengthened by Glitter's support, Silvia began the ascent with her amorphous ally guiding the way, their path illuminated by Glitter’s soft luminescent specks, a galaxy of hope in the subterranean expanse. They journeyed from the underbelly, a passage transformed into passage, until they emerged once more into the familiar light. Gloopy was waiting with open arms—or as open as a formless extraterrestrial can muster. The sight of his sapphire eyes, wide with concern turned to relief, completed the circle of their reunion. Their embrace was an intermingling of forms and colors, an affirmation of the unspoken bond they shared. Silverburn, unbeknownst to itself, held a tangible breath. And when word spread that Silvia was safe, that breath exhaled in a collective cheer. The shopping centre hummed a little brighter that day, for the beloved trio was whole again, and tales of their ethereal bonds woven deeper into the fabric of Silverburn's tapestry. And in her core, Silvia knew no matter which corridors she dared tread or which doors beckoned mystery, she would never truly be alone. For in her heart now resided an unwavering certainty—Gloopy, Glitter, and the community of Silverburn were her family, her safeguard, her home."},{"prompt":"Write a story from Glitter's POV, her thoughts, She was in a puddle like form while trying to fix the door","completion":"Glitter, the effervescent being of twinkling hues and liquid form, had always viewed the world of Silverburn as a canvas ripe for her touch of wonder. Doors that led to nowhere, walls that yearned for color, corners that craved her curious ooze—she saw them all as opportunities to play, explore, and dance her fluid dance. Today, it was a door—an old, aching door—that captured her interest, lying forgotten in a less-traveled corridor of the shopping centre. It was stuck, stiff with age and neglect. In her heart that thrummed with starlit vibrations, Glitter felt a touch of sorrow for the door. It had been so long since it felt the caress of exploration, the excitement of purpose. With a whimsical decision only a creature like herself could make, Glitter had decided, there and then, it was her mission to untangle the stubborn door from its slumber. She approached with the grace of a nebula nearing a newborn star—her body an amorphous work of art, spreading over the door's surface, seeking entry through its secrets. As a puddle, she was more than just a shimmering pool of life; she was possibility in its most tangible form—able to slide into the places others couldn't, to see the beauty in the spaces others ignored. In this formless state, Glitter felt at one with the very fabric of Silverburn, a guardian of its unknown tales, an explorer of its silent narratives. Patiently, she caressed every crevice, every ridge of wood and metal with her gooey tendrils, working her magic where once there was only stiffness and resistance. In her silent symphony of motion, she communicated caring and persistence. She imagined the door creaking open to show her its wonders, its past, a sign of trust from inanimate to animate, a secret shared between companions. Lost in her task, Glitter did not notice the subtle shift of her form as she embraced the door in its entirety, her substance creeping through the keyhole, exploring what lay beyond in the quiet enthusiasm of her nature. Then, without warning, she felt it—a presence, familiar yet out of place, one that rang with an unspoken plea, a beacon of warmth that only Silverburn's denizens could exude. It was a cry for help, a beacon of hope—someone was waiting, someone needed her. As Glitter experienced this revelation, her being pulsed with a newfound urgency. She unraveled herself, pushing her essence through the cracks, oozing with greater resolve than she had ever known before. Her world had shifted; what began as a quest for curiosity had metamorphosed into a rescue mission. And there it was, the telltale sign of anxiously awaited salvation—a slimy splat sound echoed in the void, an unmistakable marker of her extended reach. Silvia was on the other side, her spirit a flame waning in hope's absence. Swiftly, with an instinctive understanding only she possessed, Glitter molded her form again, rising from her puddle-like existence, extending herself towards Silvia. It was the unspoken promise of their kind, a vow of solidarity—no one was ever truly lost in Silverburn as long as they were together. The fox mascot found solace in Glitter's vibrant embrace, her essence lifting Silvia up, their reunion a blend of warmth, color, and joy unspoken—an amalgam of two unique beings bound by their common love for the place they called home. As they returned to the world above, Glitter's thoughts were soft hums—vibrations of gratitude and contentment. Silvia was safe because of her, and soon, they would reunite with Gloopy, their alien comrade, their family. Silverburn was more than a mere expanse of shops and walkways; it was an ecosystem of light, life, and love. And while Glitter had once been a sole guardian of forgotten doors and hidden corners, she now knew, beyond any glimmer of doubt, that they were guardians of each other, keepers of a bond that no locked door could ever contain."},{"prompt":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пусто (это начало диалога) Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): А если девушка общается с многими парнями, это как называется?","completion":"Если девушка общается с многими парнями, это не имеет специального названия и является нормальным социальным поведением.

Please edit the following text for a yeshivish book in a natural and digestible tone while still sounding like the original author: That means that Middos are reaching beyond where mitzvos reach. Mitzvos were gone, Maten Torah was gone, Hashroas HaSh’chineh was gone; The purpose didn't occur, but Middos will do the job. So we see that Middos are much deeper, much deeper than everything you could imagine. Much deeper. This is our problem; we think Middos are a way of behavior. It's like a little bit of psychology, you know. You have to be a nice guy and you have to interact nicely with your neighbor, and you smile, and you have good Middos. And it's like Derech Eretz Kadmah Le’Torah. This is far from the truth. All the Middos, not only these Thirteen Middos, have an aspect which is way beyond where everything else is reaching. Middos are much, much deeper, and they reach a much deeper realm than what you think. That's what Middos do. If we want to have a shaychus with our avoideh to Middos, we have to relate to the Middos the way a Jew relates to Middos. That means it has to have a source, we have to have a makor where to draw that thing from; as these are things which are way beyond our seichel, way beyond our understanding.","completion":"This means that Middos extend further than the grasp of mitzvos. Even when mitzvos were no longer present, when Matan Torah and the indwelling of the Shechinah were but memories, the ultimate purpose hadn't been fulfilled — yet, it's the Middos that endure to accomplish this task. We can perceive that the depths of Middos are unfathomable, extending far beyond anything one could envisage. Here lies our misunderstanding; we often view Middos as mere patterns of conduct, akin to basic principles of psychology. We consider them simple traits that foster politeness and positive social interactions; a good-natured smile here, amiability there, and voilà, you have good Middos. As if to say, Derech Eretz precedes Torah. However, this perception barely scratches the surface. The entire spectrum of Middos, not exclusively the Thirteen Middos of Mercy, embody qualities that transcend the scope of our typical experiences and expectations. Middos possess profound significance, reaching far deeper and into more sublime realms than we commonly acknowledge. Should we aspire to forge a connection with the divine through our avodah in Middos, we must engage with them as a Yid engages with Middos — drawing from a deep and authentic source, a makor, because these elements surpass the bounds of our seichel, our rational comprehension."},{"prompt":"a bit more natural","completion":"The idea here is that Middos have a reach far beyond that of mitzvos. When the mitzvos became distant, when the revelation at Sinai and the presence of the Shechinah became echoes of the past, and when the central aim seemed out of reach, it was still Middos that stood strong to do the work. We come to see that the essence of Middos is profoundly deep, much deeper than we could ever fathom. Our challenge is that we often mistake Middos for simple behavioral etiquette. We boil it down to being about good manners or basic psychology – be pleasant, interact kindly, flash a smile, and you're set with good Middos. It's as if this is the sum total of 'Derech Eretz comes before Torah'. But this is a serious oversimplification. All the Middos, including the Thirteen Middos of Hashem, represent something much greater that reaches well beyond our usual scope. If we're going to truly connect with our avodah through Middos, we need to approach them the way a Yid is meant to – with a true source, a real makor, because these things are so much higher than our finite seichel can grasp."},{"prompt":"try again","completion":"Alright, let’s put it in simpler terms. Middos—they’re not just something extra, they are fundamental, even when mitzvos aren’t in the picture. When the thunder of Matan Torah has quieted and the Shechinah isn't felt as strong, the goal of it all might seem out of sight, but it’s the Middos that carry on the mission. Believe me, the depth of Middos is something else, deeper than we often think. Sometimes, we make the mistake of treating Middos like they're just good behavior tactics, little bits of social psychology—be kind, smile at your fellow Yid, treat others well, and you're good to go. Like that's what 'Derech Eretz Kadmah Le’Torah' is all about. But that’s far from the full story. All the Middos, not just the Thirteen Middos of Rachamim, touch upon something-way-beyond anything else we encounter. When it comes to making Middos a part of our avodah, we've got to dive in the authentic Jewish way—drawing from a rich source, because Middos are above and beyond what we usually understand with our seichel."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic, sensible, plausible, dialogue-filled, exposition-filled alternate history science fiction, high fantasy, dark fantasy, urban fantasy, magical realism, science fantasy, Japanese light novel style, Chinese wuxia epic style, military techno-thriller action drama in the form of a Japanese harem anime/manga/light novel, romantic comedy, Isekai slice of life, light fantasy style crossover of the Code Geass anime, manga, video game and light novel franchise, the Magika Swordsman and Summoner light novel and manga franchise, the Muv-Luv visual novel, manga and anime franchise, the IS: Infinite Stratos light novel, anime, manga and video game franchise, the Hundred anime, manga and light novel franchise, the Tenchi Muyo!

Fusion of chakra with the world outside the Elemental Nation’s pre-Great Cataclysm industrial processes allows for the mass production of the oversized, plasma beam-firing and nuclear missile equipped oversized fighter jets that can transform into massive humanoid mecha known as Tacitical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv], which [the Tactical Surface Fighters in this fanfic] became a important part of aerial warfare before the Great Cataclysm due to the BETA [Muv-Luv] invasion from the moon never happening in this fic and also mass production of prototype units of the initally-created for space exoskeletons that only pre-teen girls, teenage girls, young women and older women below the age of 40 can wear known as Infinite Stratos [IS] units [IS: Infinite Stratos], with the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army also having a rather large non-magical conventional ground warfare force The post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire in this story finds itself [post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] transported to an almagam world of Code Geass, Dragonar Academy, and the Familiar of Zero, in which the Lautreamont Knight Country [Dragonar Academy] is [the Lautreamont Knight Country in this fanfic] merged [the Lautreamont Knight Country in this fanfic] with [the fictional nation states Lautreamont Knight Country is |the Lautreamont Knight Country| merged with in this fanfic] the union of the Third Bulgarian Tsardom and the British Empire currently in exile in Canada known as the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass], the French-inspired Kingdom of Tristain [Familar of Zero], Albion [Familiar of Zero] and the Ordesian Empire [Bladedance of Elementalers], with magic, humans forming contracts with dragons who then become their [the contracted humans’] Pals [Dragonar Academy] and contracted spirits [Bladedance of Elementalers] forming contracts with pre-teen and teenage girls as well as young women, [the magical side of the world] being concealed by the eternal Cold War between the Holy Brittanian Empire, the German Empire and Austria-Hungary dominated democratic European Federation known as Europa United [Code Geass] and the Greater People’s Republic of China which controls Outer Mongolia, Tuva, Outer Manchuria as well as parts of Central Asia in addition to the territrories controlled by the PRC in real life, acting as a regency for the restoration of the Ming dynasty and the Ming dynasty’s ruling Imperial House of Zhu known as the Chinese Federation [Code Geass]. This transportation of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire into this new world occurs just as the Holy Brittanian Empire prepares to wage war against the surviving Tokugawa shogunate ruling over not only Japan but Korea and Taiwan seen in the world of canon Code Geass for its [the surviving Tokugawa shogunate’s] resources, with the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire being [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire in this story] transposed upon the surviving Tokugawa shogunate’s territory with people from the amalgam Fire Force and Boku no Hero Academia universe merging being merged with their counterparts in the almagam Code Geass univers with residents of the surviving Tokugawa shogunate finding themselves in the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire along with thier property, and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire inheriting the surviving Tokugawa shogunate’s vast Sakuradite [Code Geass] resources along with its [the surviving Tokugawa shogunate’s] military, economic and industrial forces in addition to its [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire’s] own. The rest of the world [in the alternate Code Geass world], including the Holy Brittanian Empire has no idea what happened, all they know is that Japan suddenly got powerful and has weapons beyond human imagination.

P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, world fusion, multiple universes or alternate universes apart from those described in this fic. Everything takes place in the same world and occurs in chronological order.","completion":"Given the complexity and specificity of the request, providing a full chapter would be extensive and well beyond the scope of this platform. However, I will craft an introductory scene that establishes the setting, includes some dialogue, and sets the stage for the narrative that would follow in a story of this nature. --- **Chapter 1: Unexpected Journeys** In the expansive war room of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire's imperial palace, Emperor Kenshin Ōtsutsuki gazed upon a grand map with overlapping territories of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the reclaimed Russian islands. Maids, attendants, and soldiers in a blend of traditional and futuristic armor hurried past, a visual testament to the merged timelines and technologies that had come to define this brave new era. \\"Your majesty, all preparations for the fifth-anniversary celebrations are in order,\\" spoke General Watanabe, his armored exoskeleton gleaming under the light. \\"The Tactical Surface Fighters stand ready for the aerial demonstration, and the Infinite Stratos pilots are coordinating with the Armed Detectives for security detail.\\" The Emperor nodded, eyes reflecting upon their reflection on the polished surface of the long obsidian table. \\"Good. Have there been any signs of unrest among the political factions?\\" \\"None, sire,\\" replied the General. \\"The Tokugawa shogunate remains a stabilizing force in the region, appeasing the traditionalists, even as we advance our technological prowess.\\" Suddenly, the room vibrated with a low hum. A scientist, Dr. Hayashi, burst through the doors, her lab coat adorned with symbols of chakra and the latest nanofiber technology. \\"Emperor Kenshin, an incident at the Teito Research Complex. I... It seems one of our dimension resonance experiments has unexpectedly catalyzed.\\" A murmur rumbled among the gathered officials and advisors. The Emperor rose, his presence commanding silence. \\"What are the consequences of this 'catalyzation,' Dr. Hayashi?\\" She swallowed hard. \\"The complex, along with the surrounding area, has vanished, replaced by... nothingness. It seems we've initiated an involuntary transportation to an unknown world.\\" A world away, amidst the backdrop of looming castles and floating fortresses, the territories of the Holy Britannian Empire and its rivals stood firm, their leaders blind to the cosmic shift that had just occurred. In a luxurious chamber of the Britannian palace, Emperor Charles Zi Britannia received the catastrophic news: his fleet, en route to conquer the remnants of Japan's resources, had been wiped out in an instant. \\"Father, could this be an act of an unknown power?\\" Inquired Lelouch, his intellect racing to catch up with the unsettling developments. Turning his glacial gaze upon his son, Charles considered the implications. \\"We must investigate and negotiate if necessary. Ready a diplomatic envoy, and... we shall accompany them.\\" Nunnally clutched her brother's hand, sensing his tension. \\"Lelouch, will this lead to war?\\" \\"No, Nunnally,\\" he replied with a comforting squeeze. \\"Somehow, I believe this marks the beginning of a far more complex resolution.\\" As both empires braced for inevitable interaction, the displaced citizens of the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Empire found themselves in unfathomable chaos. From the high-rise apartments of Tokyo to the tranquil shores of Okinawa, every TV screen flickered with an emergency broadcast. \\"Attention, citizens of the Empire! Please remain calm. An incident of unprecedented scale has occurred, and our great nation has been transported to an unfamiliar world. Stand by for further instructions as we assess and adapt to our new circumstances.\\" In the streets, Kagome, a young Infinite Stratos pilot, tightened her grip on the hilt of her katana, not out of fear but resolve. \\"No matter what world we find ourselves in, we will protect our people, right, Amaterasu?\\" she whispered to the Diva spirit that shared her being. Her best friend, Hiro, a Fire Force commander, nodded beside her, his eyes burning with determination. \\"And we'll find a way back, Kagome. We owe it to everyone caught in this madness.\\" Darkness descended upon the city, masking the confusion and uncertainty that gripped the nation. But with it came an unspoken vow—a pledge that the peoples of the great Japanese Empire would face these challenges as one, steeling their resolve to decipher the wonders and threats of this collision of worlds. As the night sky shimmered with alien constellations and energy fluctuations, both emperors laid their plans. Tomorrow would be a testament to the diplomacy and might of nations, a high-stakes chessboard upon which the fate of empires hinged, and a young prince and princess would glimpse a reality far removed from the cold strategies of their royal upbringing."},{"prompt":"Staying and contiuning with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entry: How exactly did the diplomatic meeting [between the representatives of the Ōtsutsuki clan acting as the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese imperial family] and Charles go, with Charles forcing his [Charles’] favorite son [Lelouch] to take part?

Within an exquisitely crafted hall, representatives of the Ōtsutsuki clan awaited their guests. At the center sat Emperor Kenshin, his eyes, one Byakugan and one with the Dead Bone Pulse, hidden beneath a ceremonial blindfold—a sign of respect and neutrality for the negotiations. The crunch of gravel announced the arrival of the Britannian delegation. Charles Zi Britannia, his entourage of royal guards behind him, entered followed by Lelouch and Nunnally, who looked around with wide-eyed curiosity. \\"Soyokaze ni notte yatte kita yō desu ne, Emperor Charles,\\" greeted Kenshin in a low, calm voice, the words flowing as if carried by a gentle breeze. (\\"It seems you have arrived on the night wind, Emperor Charles.\\") Charles acknowledged the greeting with a slight inclination of his head before taking a seat opposite Kenshin. \\"Votre Empire est... surprenant,\\" he remarked, the French slipping smoothly from his lips. (\\"Your Empire is... surprising.\\") The Emperor's lips quirked in a faint smile, yet he remained silent, prompting a young Ōtsutsuki lord, Hikaru, to step forward. \\"Wǒmen de dìguó shì duōcǎi duōyì, Emperor Charles,\\" Hikaru interjected in flawless Hanyu, the respect in his voice belying the pride he held for their culture. (\\"Our Empire is diverse and rich, Emperor Charles.\\") Charles, momentarily taken aback by the multilingual proficiency, recovered his diplomatic poise. \\"Yes, indeed. Let us come to the matter at hand. The presence of your Empire has raised questions and, I confess, some concerns within Britannia.\\" Kenshin lifted his hand, signaling a servant who brought forth a delicately painted scroll. “Watashi-tachi wa heiwa o kibō shite imasu, Emperor. Shikashi, waga teikoku wa jīchi to shite tachiagaru kakugo ga arimasu.” He unrolled it, revealing a treaty proposal. (\\"We seek peace, Emperor. Yet, our Empire is prepared to stand up independently.\\") Lelouch, observing quietly, analyzed the dynamics at play. He mutely communicated to his father: \\"Wir dürfen sie nicht unterschätzen.\\" (\\"We must not underestimate them.\\") Charles regarded the treaty, his eyes betraying nothing. \\"Predlagam kompromis, Emperor Kenshin,\\" he offered in Bulgarian, testing the waters. (\\"I suggest a compromise, Emperor Kenshin.\\") The scroll detailed terms of mutual recognition, trade agreements, and non-aggression pacts—terms favorable for both empires. Kenshin nodded once, his abilities allowing him to perceive the energy in the room, the unspoken tension underlying the diplomatic words. \\"Kōan o teiketsu shi, mina ga rieki o eru yō ni shimasu.\\" He gestured magnanimously to the treaty. (\\"We will settle on a proposal that benefits all parties.\\") The assembly held its breath as Charles, after a long moment of consideration, extended a hand across the table. \\"Да, Emperor Kenshin. Будем надеяться на долгосрочное сотрудничество.\\" (\\"Yes, Emperor Kenshin. Let us hope for a long-lasting cooperation.\\") As hands clasped, Lelouch's mind raced, chess pieces moving on an unseen board. This was not surrender, nor submission. It was a strategic alignment of powers. Their psychic abilities kept hidden, the Ōtsutsuki had managed to not only maintain their independence but to set in motion plans to further understand and navigate the tangled geopolitical web they found themselves within. Unbeknownst to Charles, the Ōtsutsuki representatives had also gleaned insight into Britannian politics, military structure, and even personal details that could prove advantageous in the unforeseeable future. For now, the stage was set, the players introduced, and the game of empires commenced under the silent watch of the moonlit grove."},{"prompt":"Staying and contiuning with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entry: What exactly were the reactions, direct dialogue and actions of the residents of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire to the transportation and those residents of the existing surviving Tokugawa shogunate in the almagam Code Geass world who had survived the transportation? How did the latter react to suddenly being in a strange, unfamiliar version of their homeland with futuristic technology and strange powers unlike the usual magics [Familiar of Zero] and contracted spirits [Bladedance of Elementalers] seen in their homeland and how did the former adjust and realign themselves.

A local merchant, Tanaka, stood agape as he witnessed the towering, sleek buildings that juxtaposed sharply against the familiar pagodas. A girl in a futuristic uniform approached him, extending a hand in greeting. \\"Yōkoso irasshaimashita. Anata no kokoro o odokasu koto naku, kore ga atarashii Nihon no jidai desu.\\" (\\"Welcome. Fear not, for this is the new age of Japan.\\") Meanwhile, in the streets of what used to be Edo, people clad in traditional kimonos shared bewildered glances with those wearing advanced tactical gear. \\"Koko wa doko da? Chikyū dewa nai no ka?\\" a ronin muttered under his breath. (\\"Where are we? Are we not on Earth anymore?\\") In Okinawa, former residents of the Tokugawa-regulated region found themselves standing beside bustling ports where ships laden with advanced technology docked and departed. Fluent in Ryukyuan languages and Nihongo, they exchanged tales of magic and spirits with those of mechas and Infinite Stratos. On the Taiwanese island, residents gazed upon the phenomenal sight of Tactical Surface Fighters taking to the skies. Bystanders murmured among themselves, their conversations a mix of Nihongo and Yue. A local farmer, Li, approached a pilot disembarking from her TSF. \\"Nǐ zhǎo, wǒmen zhèlǐ dēngjī zhī qián méi kàndào guò zhèyàng de jīqì.\\" (\\"Hello, we've never seen such machines here before.\\") The pilot, Kiyoko, removed her helmet to reveal a smile. \\"Wēnzhǎng, qǐng yǐncān. Zhèxiē zhīshì wǒmen shījiè de yìbiān.\\" (\\"Calm yourselves, please have a look around. These are but facets of our world.\\") Across the waters in Korea, adaptation came as a result of necessity. Confucian scholars and Joseon court officials conversed with Japanese administrators, both in Korean and Japanese, to establish order. \\"우리는 현명하게 대응해야 합니다. 새로운 세력이 우리의 안전을 책임질 것입니다.\\" (\\"We must respond wisely. These new forces will be responsible for our safety.\\"), one official declared. As families and entire neighborhoods realigned themselves to the new reality, some viewed the change with trepidation, while others saw opportunity. A young Tokyo resident, Aiko, found an aged farmer, Suzuki-san, from the former Tokugawa-controlled territories, wandering aimlessly. \\"大丈夫ですか、おじいさん？ここで何を探していますか？\\" (\\"Are you alright, sir? What are you looking for here?\\"), she inquired gently. \\"私の家族... 私の畑はどこですか？\\" (\\"My family... Where is my farm?\\"), he replied, his Nihongo tinged with an accent of a bygone era. She offered her hand, leading him to a local community center. \\"ご心配なく。ここでは、皆で支えあっています。新しい世界でも、家族は家族。\\" (\\"Do not worry. Here, we support one another. In this new world, family is still family.\\") As days passed, emissaries from the Ōtsutsuki clan facilitated communication between the disoriented Tokugawa subjects and the Empire's residents. Through exchanges and shared learning, a new community ethos emerged—one that transcended the initial fears of the displaced. Bound by common history and the promise of mutual prosperity, the people began to glimpse the outline of a harmonious society, albeit one that was as marvelous as it was mysterious."}]`),z={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},G={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],L={key:0},F={key:1};function B(i,e,l,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",G,[(a(!0),o(w,null,b(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),_(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+h(n.searchQuery)+'".
