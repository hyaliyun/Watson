The simple explanation of the disconnect lies in interpretation and context. Let’s take combustion analysis as an example. The better question to ask about teaching it is, “Would teaching combustion analysis involve the calculation of moles, the application of stoichiometry, and the possible calculation of empirical and/or molecular formula?” Well, I think we all know the answer to those questions, and hence combustion analysis’s potential relevance to an AP chemistry course ...

SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data.","completion":"From the provided content and according to the guidance by the experienced teacher, here are the essential concepts you need to focus on: 1. **SAP-2.A.1 - Organization of the Periodic Table**: - Understand that the arrangement of elements in the periodic table is based on both their physical and chemical properties, which repeat in a pattern known as periodicity. - Comprehend that this periodicity is explained by the electron configurations of elements, where a pattern of completely or partially filled electron shells and subshells emerges. 2. **SAP-2.A.2 - Trends in Atomic Properties (Periodicity)**: - Learn the key trends in atomic properties, such as ionization energy, atomic and ionic radii, electron affinity, and electronegativity. - Grasp how these properties are influenced by an element’s position in the periodic table, the force exerted by the positive nucleus on the negative electrons (as described by Coulomb’s law), the shell model of atomic structure, and the concept of effective nuclear charge and shielding by inner electrons. 3. **SAP-2.A.3 - Predicting Properties Using Periodicity**: - Utilize periodic trends to predict or estimate the values of properties for elements, even in the absence of specific experimental data. - Apply qualitative understanding of periodic trends to make educated guesses about unknown or unmeasured atomic properties. Guided by the experienced teacher’s advice: - **Interpretation Over Literal Phrasing**: Recognize that some content is not explicitly stated in the CED. The ability to conceptually link aspects of the curriculum, such as the electron configuration's connection to periodic trends, is crucial. - **Teach for Conceptual Understanding**: Instead of teaching exceptions or memorization of electron configurations, focus on the underlying principles that explain periodic trends. Understanding these principles allows students to reason through questions rather than relying on rote memorization. - **Contextual Connections**: Relate the periodic table's organization and the recurring properties of elements to real-world chemical behavior and reactions. For example, explaining how atomic size affects reaction rates or how ionization energy influences chemical bonding. - **Practical Application**: Highlight the practical use of periodic trends to predict the chemical and physical behavior of elements. For instance, knowing how electronegativity varies across the periodic table can be used to predict the type of bond (ionic or covalent) most likely to form between two elements. - **Educational Value Beyond Direct Examination**: Recognize that while some specific tasks, such as writing electron configurations for elements which are exceptions to the Aufbau principle, are not assessed, these principles still have instructional value. Teach them in a way that reinforces the broader understanding of electronic structure and periodic behavior. In summary, when teaching AP Chemistry, it's important to convey in-depth knowledge of how electron configurations and periodic trends explain the recurring properties of elements. This knowledge should be taught not by focusing solely on what is or isn't listed in the CED, but by emphasizing context, conceptual understanding, and practical application in chemistry. This approach ensures students develop a rich and transferable understanding of the subject, preparing them for various aspects of the AP Chemistry exam and beyond."},{"prompt":"What essential things do I need to learn from the things below.

This includes the concept of electron configurations and how the distribution of electrons in shells and subshells leads to the recurring properties of elements. However, you do not need to memorize the exceptions to the Aufbau principle as writing these configurations will not be assessed on the AP exam. This is because the AP Chemistry course focuses more on understanding and applying principles rather than rote memorization of exceptions. 2. **Periodic Trends and Their Explanation (SAP-2.A.2):** Be familiar with the trends in atomic properties within the periodic table and be able to qualitatively understand these through the element’s position in the periodic table. This understanding should be grounded in concepts such as Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. Focus on trends like: - Ionization energy - Atomic and ionic radii - Electron affinity - Electronegativity 3. **Application and Prediction Using Periodic Trends (SAP-2.A.3):** You should be able to apply your understanding of periodicity to predict or estimate values of properties when data is not available. This means using the knowledge of trends to make educated guesses about the properties of elements based on their position in the periodic table. In the broader context of teaching the AP Chemistry course, it is important to keep the following in mind: - **Integrated Understanding Over Literal Content:** While it is important to understand the content of the CED, the teacher emphasizes the value of teaching and understanding topics that may not be explicitly listed by their common names or phrases but are relevant because they involve applications of explicitly listed content. For example, combustion analysis may not be found by a keyword search in the CED, but it is relevant because it involves stoichiometry, mole calculations, and determining empirical or molecular formulas — all concepts that are within the framework of the AP Chemistry course. - **Teaching Beyond the CED:** Certain topics like balancing REDOX reactions in acid and base solutions are suggested to be taught not because they are likely to appear in their own right on the exam, but because they offer significant educational value and reinforce other areas of the curriculum. The understanding and skills gained from such topics can enhance a student's overall competence in chemistry. To summarize, focus on deeply understanding the principles behind the organization of the periodic table, periodic trends, and their implications, rather than just memorizing facts. Use the CED as a guide but also recognize the importance of integrating and applying these concepts in various contexts, as this is where their true educational value lies."},{"prompt":"Write a list of 6 lesser-known Disney animated movies, and for each movie, write a dialog line for the main character of that movie where they thank the viewer for caring about their movie","completion":"1. **The Black Cauldron (1985) - Main Character: Taran** - Dialogue Line: \\"I know our journey to find the Black Cauldron may not be the most famous tale, but knowing you shared in our adventure warms my heart.

The Lion King: In the sweeping savannas of Africa, young lion prince Simba just can't wait to be king. But after his uncle Scar convinces him that he's responsible for his father's death (and Peter Griffin tips him off with a beer-fueled anecdote about messing up), Simba runs away in shame. While in exile, he strikes up a friendship with Brian, who's on a cross-continental walk to find himself, and Stewie, using his advanced weaponry to fend off hyenas. They teach him Hakuna Matata and he grows up free of worries until Lois, as a lioness Nala, finds him and demands he return to take his throne. Filled with cutaways featuring Quagmire as Timon and Cleveland as Pumbaa, Simba returns to face Scar in a showdown that ends with a dance-off judged by Meg. 2. Aladdin: In the bustling marketplace of Agrabah, street-smart Aladdin is busy running cons and stealing bread. When he and Abu meet the merchant version of Peter Griffin, who's hawking knock-off lamps, one accidental rub releases Stewie as a power-hungry Genie who grants wishes with a sarcastic twist. Aladdin wishes to become a prince to win Princess Jasmine's heart, only to have Brian as Jafar scheme to steal the lamp and rule Agrabah with Joe Swanson as his obedient parrot, Iago. As Aladdin and Jasmine bond over mutual disdain for Meg-like palace guards, the final act features a Family Guy-style chicken fight between Aladdin and Jafar across the city. 3. Beauty and the Beast: Belle, a witty bibliophile, finds herself in an enchanted castle with a beast who's actually Adam West in a hairy costume. Talking furniture includes Stewie as an intellectually superior Lumière and Brian as Cogsworth, always at odds with one another. Meg takes the role of a particularly dour Mrs. Potts, whose singing is frequently interrupted by the Griffin family's sarcastic comments. As Belle and the Beast's relationship evolves from hostility to romance, Belle's unique ideas about property reform and high fashion turn the Beast's world upside down until he's wearing Quahog-cut suits at dinner. 4. The Little Mermaid: Under the sea, mermaid Ariel dreams of life on land and asks Quagmire as Scuttle for advice on human romance, which quickly becomes inappropriate. Upon saving and falling for the dashing Prince Eric, Lois's voice coaching as her friend Sebastian goes awry, and she ropes Peter in to illustrate human courting rituals. After striking a deal with Ursula, who's sneakily voiced by Stewie in drag, Ariel ends up in Quahog with legs, where Meg as Flounder tries to fit in but fails spectacularly. The climax features a battle with Ursula that turns into an underwater version of a Family Guy cutaway brawl, with Cleveland popping in as a laid-back King Triton. 5. Frozen: Estranged sisters Anna and Elsa reconnect in the quirky town of Arendelle, which just so happens to share a zip code with Quahog. Brian, as a talking snowman named Olaf, shares his musings on summer and self-actualization while sipping martinis. Kristoff, voiced by Peter, can't seem to get his reindeer Sven's attention whenever the Kool-Aid Man breaks through glaciers. Elsa's ice powers go haywire, turning Meg into an ice statue multiple times to the tune of \\"Let it Meg.\\" The grand finale features a \\"Chicken Fight\\" between Elsa and an icy version of Ernie the Giant Chicken, while Stewie invents a machine to reverse the eternal winter. 6. Moana: Moana of Motunui sets sail across the ocean to save her people, accompanied by the demigod Maui who strangely resembles a shirtless Peter Griffin with magical tattoos. Their journey is filled with pop culture references and cutaway gags featuring lovable Stewie as the coconut pirate chief and Brian trying to counsel the giant crab Tamatoa on the virtues of minimalism. When they need to navigate the sea, Joe Swanson shows up as a sentient GPS system, constantly providing incorrect directions. The showdown with Te Kā features a surprise interruption by the Pawtucket Patriot who quenches the lava monster with a mighty splash of beer. 7. Toy Story: Woody, a cowboy doll with the voice and delusions of grandeur of Peter Griffin, starts to feel threatened by the arrival of Stewie as an overly complex Buzz Lightyear toy. Their antics include Woody convincing Buzz that he's drunk off non-alcoholic root beer and Buzz enlisting an army of Joe Swanson Green Army Men. The duo end up in the house of Sid, where Meg's head is stuck on a toy with spider legs and Lois as a caring Bo Peep who inadvertently encourages their bad behavior. The climax reveals all the toys going on strike for better working conditions, led by Brian as an intellectual Mr. Potato Head. 8. Finding Nemo: Marlin and Dory embark on an epic quest to find clownfish Nemo, picking up a sidekick in Bruce the shark, who eerily sounds like Quagmire and makes every situation uncomfortably flirtatious. Adding to the high jinks, Peter as a forgetful Dory keeps getting sidetracked by fish food that reminds him of Quahog's delicacies. Along the way, they encounter a gang of mischievous seagulls with Stewie's voice, all plotting to take over the world one peck at a time. The great escape from the dentist's fish tank turns into an elaborate heist orchestrated by Cleveland as a smooth-talking pufferfish. 9. Mulan: Mulan, whose inner monologue sounds suspiciously like Lois Griffin, disguises herself as a man to take her father's place in the Chinese army. The training montage is narrated by Peter, who offers nonsensical advice on combat while demonstrating his lack of skill with fireworks, leading to an accidental, impressive display. Stewie as Mushu provides a running commentary on strategy and elegance, while the other soldiers are unmistakably voiced by Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe, each bringing their own quirks to the battlefield. The final confrontation with the Huns includes a slapstick moment where Meg, the unlikely hero, causes an avalanche with her scream. 10. Tangled: Rapunzel, with her magically long hair, lives in a tower where she's visited daily by a traveling salesman Peter Griffin, who convinces her that the outside world is just like Quahog. When charming thief Flynn Rider climbs into her life, he's soon pursued by Brian as a relentless horse named Maximus, intent on sniffing out crime and treats. The duo's adventures lead them to the Snuggly Duckling Pub, which is coincidentally hosting a cutaway gags open-mic night. In the midst of hair-braiding escapades, Meg shows up as a misunderstood witch, always tripping over Rapunzel's hair and inadvertently aiding their escape every time."},{"prompt":"Write a list of 10 animated Disney movies, and for each movie, write a hilarious plot summary for a fictious episode of Family Guy whose plot vaguely resembles the plot of that Disney movie","completion":"1. **The Little Mer-Meg (The Little Mermaid)** *Plot Summary:* In an attempt to win the heart of the high school quarterback, Meg makes a deal with the local witch, Lois, to swap her voice for legs.

There's a certain expectation and familiarity with his silence that makes any deviation a significant narrative shift. 2. **Humor and Relief:** The playful interaction would provide a humorous and light-hearted moment in an otherwise tense and dark game. This could offer players a sense of relief and a rare glimpse of respite for the characters, which might be welcomed amidst the intense action and drama of Half-Life 2. 3. **Disbelief and Criticism:** Some players could see this as a break in immersion or character consistency. They might feel it disrupts the tone of the game and detracts from the serious, oppressive atmosphere that the series is known for. 4. **Debate and Discussion:** Such a striking difference would spark conversations within the gaming community about why Valve might have chosen to give Gordon a voice and what implications it could have for the character and his relationships—particularly with Alyx. 5. **Appreciation for Depth:** On the other hand, some players might appreciate the additional layer of character development that could come with a voiced protagonist. They could see it as adding depth to Gordon's relationship with Alyx and enriching the narrative experience. 6. **Modding Opportunity:** Recognizing the highly active modding community around Half-Life games, this change could open up new opportunities for fan-created content, including parodies or expansions on the idea of Gordon participating in light-hearted or out-of-character scenarios. 7. **Distrust of Canonical Authenticity:** Players might initially question if the voiced interaction was part of a canonical game update or perhaps some form of mod or fanmade content, given how strongly Gordon's muteness is part of his identity as a character. Ultimately, introducing a voiced Gordon into Half-Life 2 would have been a contentious decision and likely polarized the fanbase, at least initially. Fans have maintained a deep connection with the silent protagonist they've projected their own thoughts and personalities onto for years. Deviating from that would be met with a chorus of strong reactions, whether positive or negative."},{"prompt":"how would players react to Gordon's only word ever spoken throughout the series is Alyx's name, when she is injured by the hunter?","completion":"If the only word Gordon Freeman ever spoke during the entire Half-Life series was to utter “Alyx” in response to her being injured by the Hunter, the player reaction would likely be quite profound and multifaceted: 1. **Shock and Emotional Impact:** Players would be caught off-guard by the sudden vocalization from a character they have only known to be silent. The choice of this specific moment to break silence would heighten the emotional impact of the scene and emphasize the bond between Gordon and Alyx. 2. **Increased Investment:** Hearing Gordon speak only once, and at such a critical moment, could make players feel more deeply invested in the characters and their relationship. It would underscore the gravity of Alyx's injury and evoke a more emotional response from the players. 3. **Speculation about Significance:** Given the rarity of the event, players might speculate on the significance of Gordon speaking. They could ponder whether it indicates a shift in Gordon’s character or whether it was meant to signal the severity of Alyx's situation. 4. **Discussion and Analysis:** This would undoubtedly spur discussions within the community about the decision to have Gordon speak, with players analyzing and debating the narrative choice and its implications for the story and characters. 5. **Mixed Reactions:** Some players would appreciate this unique and dramatic narrative choice, while others might feel it was out of character or that it breaks from the established convention of Gordon’s muteness. 6. **Enhanced Realism and Urgency:** Hearing Gordon speak Alyx's name after she is severely injured would add an element of realism and urgency to the moment, potentially making the game feel more immersive. 7. **Memorable Moment:** Regardless of individual opinions on the choice, it would ultimately create a powerful and memorable moment in the series, leaving a lasting impression on the players. 8. **Modding and Fan Content:** Fans and modders might be inspired to create their own takes on the moment or reinterpret it within their content, exploring alternate scenarios in which Gordon may have otherwise spoken. In essence, if executed well and with the appropriate emotional context, a strategic use of a single spoken word by Gordon could deepen the gaming experience and leave an indelible mark on the Half-Life narrative, accentuating a moment of profound vulnerability and personal connection between him and Alyx."},{"prompt":"What if Gordon speaking was muffled by other noises? would that be more powerful?","completion":"If the only time Gordon Freeman's voice were heard was during a moment of high tension and emotional gravity, such as Alyx being injured by the Hunter, and his single spoken word—Alyx’s name—was muffled amidst other noises, it could indeed create a powerful and dramatic effect, but the impact would depend on the execution and context. Here are a few potential outcomes of such a choice: **Subtlety and Realism:** The muffled sound could add a touch of realism. In actual high-stress situations, not every sound is heard clearly. This could make the scene feel more authentic and immersive for the player. **Emotional Resonance:** The attempt to call out to Alyx with voice drowned by other sounds might symbolize Gordon's feelings of helplessness and desperation in that moment, perhaps adding more emotional weight to the scene. **Player Uncertainty:** A muffled voice might leave players questioning what they heard. Some might not even realize Gordon spoke at all, leading to debates within the community about whether it actually happened and what exactly Gordon said. **Speculation:** The ambiguity of a muffled vocalization could lead to healthy speculation and fan theories, fostering community engagement and discussions around the story and characters. **Missed Significance:** There is a risk that the muffled word could be too subtle and completely missed by players, thus nullifying any intended narrative impact. Players invested in the story might appreciate clearly hearing Gordon's first and only spoken word. **Frustration:** For some players, especially fans longing to hear Gordon speak, a muffled word might be unsatisfying and lead to frustration. It could be interpreted as the developers teasing the audience without delivering a clear payoff. **The Power of Subtlety:** A muffled voice could leave a haunting impression, suggesting a depth of emotion that even the chaotic soundscape of battle cannot fully suppress. In conclusion, the decision to make Gordon's speech muffled would need to be carefully considered, ensuring that it enhances rather than detracts from the emotional impact of the moment. If done effectively, it could create a poignant and memorable scene that resonates deeply with players, while preserving the mysterious and iconic character of silent Gordon Freeman. However, such a choice would need to be unequivocal enough that players understand the significance of the moment within the broader context of the game."},{"prompt":"Write a plot summary for an alternate version of Bee Movie where the bees have been replaced with Zootopia characters","completion":"In an alternate version of Bee Movie set in the universe of Zootopia, the bustling mammal metropolis is buzzing with excitement as Judy Hopps, a young and ambitious rabbit officer, discovers an unsettling truth that parallels the original plot's revelation about humans exploiting bees. Plot Summary: \\"Zootopia: The Pollen Plot\\" The story unfolds in Zootopia, a city where animals of all kinds live together in harmony. Judy Hopps, working with the Zootopia Police Department (ZPD), is thrust into an unexpected adventure when she's assigned to investigate an unusual theft at the local flower shop. Judy teams up with a sly and charismatic fox, Nick Wilde, who adds his street smarts and cunning to the investigation. As they delve deeper into the case, they uncover a conspiracy involving Rodentia's most prominent entrepreneur, Mr. Big. The duo learns that Mr. Big's enterprises have been exploiting the smaller mammals, specifically a workforce of industrious hamsters, to collect and refine pollen, the lifeblood of the city's ecosystem. The hamsters, much like the bees in Bee Movie, have been tasked with the tireless job of pollinating the city's vast flora—a job undertaken without the broader animal community's knowledge. Overworked and undercompensated, these hamsters are vital but undervalued contributors to keeping Zootopia thriving. Judy's ideals are challenged when she finds out that her boss, Chief Bogo, and other high-ranking city officials are implicated in the scheme, using their influence to keep the unfair labor practices hidden to maintain the city's delicate ecological balance and robust economy. Confronted with this moral quagmire, Judy and Nick confront Mr. Big. In the ensuing emotional appeal, the hamsters' plight tugs at the heartstrings of Zootopia's citizens. Broadcasted across the city via a dramatic press conference at the ZPD headquarters, the revelation galvanizes the diverse animal population to take a stand for the hamsters. Their efforts culminate in a citywide trial where Judy and Nick represent the hamsters in a landmark case against Mr. Big and his corporations. In a heated courtroom drama, interspersed with the trademark wit and humor familiar from both Bee Movie and Zootopia, our heroes fight for a future where the labor and rights of every creature, no matter how small, are recognized and respected. The alternate Bee Movie ends similarly to its original, with a significant victory for the hamsters leading to sweeping reforms across Zootopia. The city learns to balance economic growth with ecological and social responsibility, and Judy and Nick's unlikely partnership has not only changed the city but also fostered a strong friendship between them, showcasing the power of unity across species."},{"prompt":"nameSet = {\\"John\\", \\"Jane\\", \\"Doe\\"} nameSet.add(\\"Ihechikara\\") print(nameSet) {'John', 'Ihechikara', 'Doe', 'Jane'} pourquoi ihechikara placer dans le milieu et non pas dans la fin de la set ou la début","completion":"En Python, un \`set\` est une collection non ordonnée de valeurs uniques.

The game unfolds Antonov's backstory, her long-standing ally, and the details surrounding the volatile hours leading to her fateful encounter with Gordon. **Act 1: Shadow of the Combine** The game opens with Alyx receiving intelligence from a Resistance spy that the legendary Gordon Freeman will be arriving in City 17 on a train. Alyx is acutely aware of her father's stories about the theoretical physicist who fought alongside him at Black Mesa and knows the significant impact he could have on the Resistance. Before she is able to devise a plan to intercept Freeman's arrival, news breaks out of an imminent crackdown by the Combine on a local safe house. Alyx, driven by her need to protect her people, embarks on a dangerous mission to warn her fellow Resistance members. **Act 2: A Spark of Hope** Sneaking through the treacherous back alleys of City 17, Alyx demonstrates her skills in hacking and combat, utilizing makeshift weaponry and tools, while avoiding scanners and patrols. Along the way, she encounters remnants of Civil Protection force, fiercely loyal to the Combine. She must not only survive their attempts to quell the stirring Resistance but also use her wit to disrupt their communications and supply chains. Amidst this chaos, Alyx comes across Antonov, an old family friend and a gifted mechanic for the Resistance. Antonov reveals he has been working on a critical piece of technology that could weaken the Combine's grip on the city—likely a precursor to the Gravity Gun.

As Alyx races back to Antonov with the component, Combine forces begin their assault on the Resistance safe house she intended to warn, putting her mission and her people in jeopardy. With time running out, Alyx makes the difficult decision to prioritize the completion of Antonov's project, believing it will ultimately save more lives. **Act 4: The Silent Hour** Alyx delivers the component, and Antonov successfully integrates it into the technology. The game culminates in testing the new invention which showcases its potential to change the tides against the Combine. Despite the success, Alyx is heavy with the cost of her decisions. As she assists in evacuating the wounded from the safe house raid, Alyx receives a transmission from her spy network: Gordon Freeman's train has just arrived, and he is in immediate danger. **Epilogue: The Awakening** As the night falls over City 17, Alyx gears up for her next critical mission. Steadfast and determined, she steps out into the shadows, setting the stage for her rescue of Gordon Freeman and the events that will unfold in Half-Life 2.

Players experience a tale of subterfuge and silent defiance as Alyx navigates the perilous underbelly of City 17 to ignite a flicker of hope for the Resistance. **Act 1: Whispers in the Shadows** The story starts with Alyx receiving covert communication about Gordon Freeman's imminent arrival. Recognizing the opportunity, she sets out under the veil of twilight to enact a plan that would both welcome the long-awaited hero and bolster the Resistance. Her first task is to infiltrate a Combine facility to retrieve encrypted data that may reveal Freeman's exact entry point into City 17. Using her exceptional stealth abilities, Alyx traverses the silent corridors and secluded catwalks, avoiding the glowing eyes of patrolling Sentinels. She is a ghost in the machine, leaving barely a trace as she acquires the necessary intel. **Act 2: The Quiet Before the Storm** Still under cover of night, Alyx deciphers the intel and learns of Freeman's arrival time and location. But her mission is interrupted by a sudden but soft plea for help from Antonov, who needs a critical component to complete a jamming device that could temporarily disable the Combine's citywide surveillance. Determined, Alyx ventures into the city's quarantine zone, a place where silence is a survival tool. She clips through shadows, avoids traps, and masterfully dodges Combine drones. After a tense and treacherous journey, she retrieves the component and returns to Antonov without drawing any attention. **Act 3: The Spark Ignites** Together in whispers, Alyx and Antonov install the component. The jamming device comes to life with a faint hum, casting a blind spot over their operations and giving them a momentary respite from the Combine's unyielding gaze. This success, muted as it may be, signifies the potential for a larger uprising. But the calm is broken by the subtle buzz of a message: the Combine are closing in on a member of the Resistance—an informant crucial to the welcoming of Freeman. With a heavy heart, Alyx chooses the greater good over immediate action, trusting in their newly created advantage to aid her in the larger scheme yet to come. **Act 4: Veil of Darkness** Using the cover of darkness and the disruption caused by Antonov's device, Alyx moves unseen through the city toward the train station where Gordon is expected. As she nears her destination, the tension mounts. Every step must be perfect, every shadow her ally, as she skirts the edge of discovery. Just as dawn breaks, Alyx arrives at the rendezvous point only to find chaos erupting as Gordon is spotted by Civil Protection. It's here that the calm shatters; Alyx has no choice but to engage. She moves with swift precision, neutralizing the threat and whisking Gordon away from danger. **Epilogue: Dawn of a New Day** As they escape into the city's labyrinthine tunnels, Alyx and Gordon share a fleeting moment of introductive silence. A mutual understanding passes between them: the battle ahead will be arduous, but for now, they have each other, and the Resistance has a newly kindled flame of hope. In these final quiet moments, players are granted a solemn appreciation for Alyx's impact on the events to come, setting a stirring foundation for the epic journey in Half-Life 2. The game ends as the first light of dawn pierces the horizon, symbolizing the dawn of a new era for the Resistance."},{"prompt":"What essential things do I need to learn from the things below, I will provide everything in a seperate prompt. Use the excerpt from the experienced teacher to help guide you: As an AP Chemistry teacher, the CED is the single most important guide to the teaching of the course, so when questions arise about what content is in – and just as importantly what content is out – is it just as simple as searching the CED to find the relevant phrase? Unfortunately, the answer is no. I often see AP Chemistry teachers ask questions such as, “Should I teach combustion analysis” followed by, “I searched the CED and couldn’t find it”. Well, be careful! There’s a real danger in searching that document and drawing the conclusion that if a particular phrase is not present then that means a topic is not examinable. The simple explanation of the disconnect lies in interpretation and context. Let’s take combustion analysis as an example. The better question to ask about teaching it is, “Would teaching combustion analysis involve the calculation of moles, the application of stoichiometry, and the possible calculation of empirical and/or molecular formula?” Well, I think we all know the answer to those questions, and hence combustion analysis’s potential relevance to an AP chemistry course ... Finally I deal with balancing REDOX in acid and base here. This treatment is similar to that related to paramagnetism in as much as it involves an interpretation of LOs rather than their literal reading, but also goes further. I feel there is just too much value in teaching balancing REDOX in acid and base for other areas of the course for it to be ignored. It’s still true that the literal reading of the CED is vital, but so are these other ways to consume it. In the first instance combustion is essentially just another name for a bunch of things that are explicitly listed in the CED; and thirdly there’s an example of a topic that I don’t think will be examined literally, but offers way too much value across other areas of the examinable curriculum for it to be omitted. Each of these is subtlety different, but each offers a window into the CED that goes beyond just “Ctrl+F”.:","completion":"Based on the guidance provided by the AP Chemistry teacher, it's clear that when preparing for teaching or studying for an AP Chemistry exam, one must look beyond the explicit content listed in the Course and Exam Description (CED) and consider the underlying concepts and skills that may be applicable across various topics. Here is what you need to take from the teacher's advice: 1. **Interpretation and Context**: - Understand that not all topics may be explicitly mentioned in the CED, but they can be relevant if they involve applying important concepts that are part of the course. - Look at how certain topics, like combustion analysis, integrate core skills like calculating moles, applying stoichiometry, and determining empirical/molecular formulas, which are all within the scope of the AP Chemistry curriculum. 2. **Application of Skills Across Topics**: - Recognize the value of certain topics that may not be directly examined but are instrumental in teaching fundamental chemistry skills. Balancing redox reactions in acid and base solutions, for example, provides a framework for understanding reactions, electron transfer, and the interplay between oxidation and reduction which is central to chemistry. 3. **Comprehensive Understanding of the CED**: - While the literal content of the CED is crucial, also consider how different topics and skills relate to what is explicitly stated. This approach will provide a more holistic understanding of what could be tested and what is valuable for students to learn. - Cross-reference topics and skills to see how they connect with each other, reinforcing the broader objectives of the course. 4. **CED as a Guide, Not an Absolute**: - Use the CED as a guiding document, but don't limit yourself to only the phrases listed within it. The CED outlines the framework of the course, but the application of that framework can be more expansive. - Stay open to teaching and learning topics that, while not named in the CED, still help to develop the skills and understanding that the CED is trying to promote. 5. **Preparing for the Unstated but Relevant**: - Be prepared for exam questions that test understanding and application of concepts in new contexts or in ways not explicitly described in the CED. - Develop a strong foundation in the fundamental concepts and problem-solving skills that can be transferred to any chemistry-related scenario. In summary, when deciding what to teach or study for an AP Chemistry course, don't simply rely on a keyword search of the CED. Instead, focus on the broader chemical principles, the application of skills, and the integration of topics that together build the expertise required for success in AP Chemistry. This nuanced interpretation ensures a comprehensive chemistry education that prepares students for a wide array of questions they may encounter on the exam."},{"prompt":"SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work.

It explains that the average mass of one particle of a substance in amu is numerically equivalent to the molar mass of that substance when measured in grams per mole. This concept provides a quantitative connection between the mass of a bulk sample and the number of particles it contains. 4. **Equation for Calculating Moles**: The equation \\"n = m/M\\" stands for the number of moles (n) as the mass (m) of the substance divided by its molar mass (M). This formula is fundamental in stoichiometry for doing calculations involving chemical reactions, and for quantitatively relating masses to numbers of particles. Understanding these concepts is crucial for mastering the stoichiometry of chemical reactions, which involves calculations that use molar masses, number of moles, and Avogadro's number to convert between mass and number of particles. This foundational chemistry knowledge will facilitate a deeper comprehension of how substances react in both theoretical and practical scenarios in the laboratory.

Deviations may also arise from particle volumes, particularly at extremely high pressures.","completion":"From SAP-7.C.1, the essential information to understand is about the limitations of the ideal gas law and how real gases deviate from ideal behavior: **Limitations of the Ideal Gas Law**: - The ideal gas law ((PV = nRT)) is a simplified model that assumes no interactions (neither attractive nor repulsive) between gas particles and that the particles have negligible volume. - It provides a good approximation for the behavior of gases under many conditions, especially when the pressure is not too high and the temperature is not too low. **Deviations in Real Gases**: - Real gases deviate from ideal behavior due to two primary factors: 1. **Interparticle Attractions**: Real gas particles do attract each other, which becomes significant at lower temperatures (close to the gas's condensation point) and higher pressures, where particles are closer together. Under such conditions, the actual pressure may be lower than that predicted by the ideal gas law due to the attractive forces causing particles to move towards each other rather than hitting the walls of the container with full force. 2. **Particle Volume**: Although the ideal gas law assumes particle volume is negligibly small, in reality, gas particles do occupy space. At extremely high pressures, the volume of the gas molecules becomes a greater fraction of the total volume, and the space that particles can move freely is reduced, leading to higher pressures than the ideal gas law would predict. Understanding this concept is vital for explaining the behavior of gases in practical and experimental situations, predicting when the ideal gas law can be used accurately, and recognizing situations where real gases are likely to exhibit non-ideal behavior. These principles are part of the advanced understanding of gases required in the AP Chemistry curriculum and allow for more accurate predictions and explanations of gas behaviors under various conditions."},{"prompt":"SPQ-3.A.1 Solutions, also sometimes called homogeneous mixtures, can be solids, liquids, or gases. In a solution, the macroscopic properties do not vary throughout the sample. In a heterogeneous mixture, the macroscopic properties depend on location in the mixture. SPQ-3.A.2 Solution composition can be expressed in a variety of ways; molarity is the most common method used in the laboratory. EQN: M = nsolute /Lsolution","completion":"From SPQ-3.A.1 and SPQ-3.A.2, it's important to learn about the nature of solutions and homogeneous mixtures, how they differ from heterogeneous mixtures, and how solution concentration is expressed: **SPQ-3.A.1 – Solutions vs. Heterogeneous Mixtures**: - Understand that a solution is a type of homogeneous mixture where the composition is uniform throughout the sample. Solutions can exist in different phases: solid, liquid, and gas. For example, air is a gaseous solution, an alloy is a solid solution, and saltwater is a liquid solution. - In contrast, heterogeneous mixtures have a non-uniform composition where different parts of the mixture have different properties and composition. An example would be oil and water, or a mixture of sand and sugar. **SPQ-3.A.2 – Expressing Solution Composition**: - Learn that solution composition can be quantitatively described in various ways, including molarity, molality, mass percent, volume percent, and mole fraction. - For molarity (( M )), the most commonly used unit in the lab, know the formula: [ M (molar concentration) = frac{n_{solute}}{V_{solution}} ] where ( n_{solute} ) is the number of moles of the solute and ( V_{solution} ) is the volume of the solution in liters. These concepts are critical for problem-solving in various chemistry contexts—whether performing laboratory experiments, engaging in theoretical calculations, or applying knowledge to real-world scenarios. They also form the basis for understanding dilutions, reactions in solution, and stoichiometry involving solutions. Understanding homogeneous versus heterogeneous mixtures provides the groundwork for categorizing materials and predicting their properties, while knowing how to calculate molarity is essential for working accurately with solutions in both qualitative and quantitative analyses. With these concepts firmly grasped, you will be well-equipped for the relevant parts of the AP Chemistry curriculum."},{"prompt":"SPQ-3.B.1 Particulate representations of solutions communicate the structure and properties of solutions, by illustration of the relative concentrations of the components in the solution and drawings that show interactions among the components. X COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. X CALCULATIONS OF MOLALITY, PERCENT BY MASS, AND PERCENT BY VOLUME WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM.","completion":"From SPQ-3.B.1, the key point to learn is the use of particulate representations to depict solutions: **Particulate Representations of Solutions**: - Particle-level diagrams or models are utilized to visualize and communicate the structure and properties of solutions. - These representations can illustrate various aspects of a solution, such as how solute and solvent particles are distributed and the interactions between them. - By showing the relative concentrations of components, particulate diagrams provide insights into the makeup of solutions, whether they are dilute or concentrated. It's also important to note the exclusions specified in the prompt: - Colligative properties, which are properties dependent on the number of solute particles and not on their identity (such as boiling point elevation and freezing point depression), will not be assessed on the AP Chemistry exam. - The AP Chemistry exam will not require calculations involving molality (moles of solute per kilogram of solvent), percent by mass, or percent by volume for solutions. Understanding particulate representations is important for conceptualizing how substances mix to form solutions and how the microscopic arrangement of particles relates to macroscopic properties. While specific quantitative aspects such as colligative property calculations and other concentration measures are excluded, it is still valuable to understand the qualitative concepts behind such properties. Having a good grasp of how solutions are represented at the particulate level is essential for a deep understanding of solution chemistry within the context of the AP Chemistry curriculum."},{"prompt":"SPQ-3.C.1 The components of a liquid solution cannot be separated by filtration. They can, however, be separated using processes that take advantage of differences in the intermolecular interactions of the components. a. Chromatography (paper, thin-layer, and column) separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components of the solution (the mobile phase) and with the surface components of the stationary phase. b. Distillation separates chemical species by taking advantage of the differential strength of intermolecular interactions between and among the components and the effects these interactions have on the vapor pressures of the components in the mixture.","completion":"From SPQ-3.C.1, it's essential to learn about methods used to separate the components of a liquid solution based on differences in their intermolecular interactions: **Separation of Liquid Solution Components**: - Understand that liquid solutions are homogeneous mixtures in which filtration cannot be used to separate components because both solute and solvent particles are of similar size and cannot be distinguished by a filter. - Learn that separation techniques exploit differences in the strength of intermolecular forces between different components of the mixture and, in some cases, between the components and materials used in the separation process. **a. Chromatography**: - Chromatography is a set of techniques used to separate the components of a mixture based on the differential affinity between the mobile phase (the solution being separated) and the stationary phase (the medium over which the solution moves). - Variants such as paper, thin-layer, and column chromatography use a solid stationary phase, such as paper or a coated plate, and a liquid or gas mobile phase. - Different substances in the solution travel at different speeds due to variations in their interactions with the stationary phase (adsorption) and the mobile phase (solubility) leading to separation. **b. Distillation**: - Distillation involves heating a liquid mixture to form vapor and then cooling the vapor to form a liquid, allowing separation based on differences in volatility and vapor pressure of the components. - Compounds with lower boiling points vaporize at lower temperatures, while those with stronger intermolecular forces have higher boiling points and evaporate less readily. - The resulting vapor is richer in the more volatile components. When it is cooled and condensed, a purer form of the more volatile component is collected. By understanding these separation techniques, you gain insight into the practical applications of intermolecular force principles. These concepts are crucial for performing and interpreting experiments in chemistry laboratories and industrial processes where mixture separation is necessary. Knowing the theoretical basis for chromatography and distillation allows you to predict the behavior of mixtures under various conditions and to design procedures for the separation and purification of chemical substances. This knowledge is in line with skills needed for the AP Chemistry exam, which may include understanding how different separation methods work and their applications."},{"prompt":"choose a random popular animal, one word only","completion":"Tiger"},{"prompt":"Create a bullet list of loot and equipment (including name, description, effects, value, weight, rarity and type) for a diaper-centric D&D homebrew taking place in a setting where the usage of absurdly oversized diapers and other various infantile items (bonnets, rattlers, pacifiers, baby bottles, mittens and booties, etc.) are a necessity and a norm, not a fetish or a taboo. They simultaneously function as both cushy armor and apparel and are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but considered mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading' is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer! And diapers aren't just for wearing, either; many of them are so thick they can double as blankets, pillows, even mattresses! Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw, the frequency determined the character's incontinence and eating habits; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly frequent Loaders fail automatically. A diaper that has met its capacity imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Alternately, if one is in a rush or there is no such changing spot nearby, a second diaper can be layered over a full one; layering provides a temporary additional 50 lbs. of Loading capacity but doesn't remove the negative effects. The effects should describe the benefits and drawbacks that a character wearing the diaper would experience, while the description should describe the diaper's appearance.

Unfortunately, the answer is no. I often see AP Chemistry teachers ask questions such as, “Should I teach combustion analysis” followed by, “I searched the CED and couldn’t find it”. Well, be careful! There’s a real danger in searching that document and drawing the conclusion that if a particular phrase is not present then that means a topic is not examinable. The simple explanation of the disconnect lies in interpretation and context. Let’s take combustion analysis as an example. The better question to ask about teaching it is, “Would teaching combustion analysis involve the calculation of moles, the application of stoichiometry, and the possible calculation of empirical and/or molecular formula?” Well, I think we all know the answer to those questions, and hence combustion analysis’s potential relevance to an AP chemistry course ... Finally I deal with balancing REDOX in acid and base here. This treatment is similar to that related to paramagnetism in as much as it involves an interpretation of LOs rather than their literal reading, but also goes further. I feel there is just too much value in teaching balancing REDOX in acid and base for other areas of the course for it to be ignored. It’s still true that the literal reading of the CED is vital, but so are these other ways to consume it. In the first instance combustion is essentially just another name for a bunch of things that are explicitly listed in the CED; and thirdly there’s an example of a topic that I don’t think will be examined literally, but offers way too much value across other areas of the examinable curriculum for it to be omitted. Each of these is subtlety different, but each offers a window into the CED that goes beyond just “Ctrl+F”.: SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work.

Make it clear in your profile that you enjoy sharing knowledge and guiding others in their personal growth or career. 6. **Social Proof**: Use pictures where you're with friends or in a social setting, showing that you're sociable and well-liked by a variety of people, including the younger crowd. 7. **Challenge Stereotypes**: Playfully acknowledge and challenge age stereotypes in your bio. Maybe you're more active than someone half your age or have tastes that defy expectations. 8. **Sophisticated Humor**: Use wit and humor that might not be immediately obvious, like literary puns or references to pop culture. This demonstrates intelligence and depth, which can be attractive. 9. **Eschew Typical \\"Older Man\\" Trappings**: Rather than highlighting traditional symbols of older male success (like luxury cars or watches), showcase your youthful energy and spontaneity. 10. **Engage in New Experiences**: Continuously expand your own boundaries by trying new activities or learning new skills that are popular among younger generations. This not only makes you more relatable but also keeps you personally fulfilled. While trying these strategies, never lose sight of authenticity. Any attempt to appear as something you're not can backfire. Regardless of the approach you take, the most successful relationships—romantic or otherwise—are built on honesty, respect, and genuine connection."},{"prompt":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пусто (это начало диалога) Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): Множественное число слова дно","completion":"Множественное число слова \\"дно\\" – \\"дна\\"."},{"prompt":"Create a bullet list of loot and equipment (including name, description, effects, value, weight, rarity and type) for a diaper-centric D&D homebrew taking place in a setting where the usage of absurdly oversized diapers and other various infantile items (bonnets, rattlers, pacifiers, baby bottles, mittens and booties, etc.) are a necessity and a norm, not a fetish or a taboo. They simultaneously function as both cushy armor and apparel and are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but considered mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading' is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer! And diapers aren't just for wearing, either; many of them are so thick they can double as blankets, pillows, even mattresses! Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw, the frequency determined the character's incontinence and eating habits; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly frequent Loaders fail automatically. A diaper that has met its capacity imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Alternately, if one is in a rush or there is no such changing spot nearby, a second diaper can be layered over a full one; layering provides a temporary additional 50 lbs. of Loading capacity but doesn't remove the negative effects. The effects should describe the benefits and drawbacks that a character wearing the diaper would experience, while the description should describe the diaper's appearance. Example 1: **Plain Pull-Ups** (Common item, Light Diaper): *0.5 lbs., 5 gp, 15 lbs. Load capacity.* \\"A diaper as basic as it is ubiquitous.

This trait recharges after using an action to refill the diaper with powder).* \\"The thicker cousin to its XL and XXL counterparts, the huge quadruple tapes used to secure this mattress-thick pamper around someone's hips are the size of paper sheets, and the enormous safety pin keeping it together could double as a shortsword.\\" Example 3: **Hot Heavy-Duty Huggies** (Uncommon item, Medium Diaper Armor): *1.2 lbs., 55 gp, 80 lbs. Load capacity, +1 to AC, wearer and allies within 20 feet gain resistance to cold damage (increases to 30 feet when 40 lbs.

Natural light streams through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a pristine glow over the reception desk where JANNET, an impeccably dressed Romanian beauty with a steely gaze, stands poised. Her manicured fingers fly over the computer keyboard as she manages a constant flow of calls and visitors with a veneer of professionalism that barely conceals her disdain for the monotonous task at hand. A few paces away, set against the far wall, is the secretarial station where ALIZIA, a vibrant Brazilian woman with a fiery spirit and an alluring smile, organizes paperwork and coordinates meetings. Her workspace is a whirling dervish of activity, reflecting her passionate and effervescent energy. Both women, eager to hide their rivalry from curious onlookers, wear practiced smiles whenever approached by colleagues. But beneath the surface lies a simmering tension, ready to erupt.

I guess some of us need to uphold the company’s image while others... (glances at Alizia's vibrant desk ornaments) enjoy a more... colorful approach to professionalism. [Alizia bristles at the insult, her Brazilian pride touched, but she maintains her composure, her retort simmering with concealed venom.] ALIZIA: (Leaning towards Jannet) \\"Professionalism\\" is much more than a cold demeanor and a frigid greeting, my dear. It’s about warmth—something you might learn from me, if you weren’t so ice-bound. JANNET: (Raising an eyebrow) Warmth has its place, Alizia, but rest assured, in the corporate ladder? It's the cool head that prevails. And as we both vie for... (Her eyes flicker towards the manager’s office) certain opportunities, I prefer not to have my judgment clouded by fleeting passions.

The reception was a grand atrium, with high ceilings and marble floors, the walls adorned with modern art pieces, each carefully curated to convey a sense of power and sophistication. Behind the sleek, U-shaped reception desk sat Jannet, her eyes steely and focused as she greeted the flowing river of suits and pencil skirts. Romanian by birth, she carried herself with a stoic elegance, her muscles subtly defined beneath her impeccable attire. Her golden hair, always in a precise chignon, shimmered under the high wattage of designer light fixtures. One floor up, in the sequestered tranquility of the secretary pool, sat Alizia, a Brazilian vision of strength and sensuality. Her desk, positioned strategically by the office of the company's manager, was a testament to organizational perfection. She moved with a cat-like grace, an aura of vibrant energy always surrounding her; her own blonde curls cascaded past her shoulders, free and untamed, like her spirit. The air was thick with silent tension whenever they crossed paths. Today, as fate would have it, the manager sent Alizia down to the reception with an armful of sensitive documents – an excuse which both women understood was just a pretext for their inevitable encounter. Jannet's eyes caught sight of Alizia's reflection in the polished stone as she stepped off the elevator. She straightened, adjusting the neckline of her blouse slightly, asserting her presence without saying a word. \\"Jannet, darling,\\" Alizia began with a sardonic sweetness that held a bite. \\"The manager asked me to bring these down. Must be tough always being the one left sitting pretty, waiting for things to happen.\\" Jannet shot back with a cold smile, \\"At least I don't spend my days fetching papers like a well-trained golden retriever, querida.\\" Her voice held the chill of the Carpathians as she emphasized the Brazilian term of endearment, weaponizing it. Their every interaction was a chess match of concealed animosity. They circled each other like gladiators in the corporate colosseum, baiting with thinly veiled insults. \\"Missed you at the last office party,\\" Alizia leaned against the reception desk, her voice smooth as silk. \\"Or maybe you were just blending in with the wallpaper again.\\" \\"Oh, I didn't miss much,\\" retorted Jannet, her gaze never wavering from Alizia's. \\"Someone did mention a certain someone trying too hard with that dress. What was it they said? 'Dressed to kill but barely wounding.'\\" Alizia let out a low laugh, like the rumble of a storm about to break. \\"Should've seen how it caught the manager’s eye. Maybe you need a little lesson in... appeal.\\" Jannet leaned in, a hint of a snarl curving her lips. \\"Maybe you need a lesson in subtlety, and trust me, I'd be happy to teach you.\\" Each verbal jab was a strike, each glare a parry, as they warred in the shadows of the professional facade they upheld. The bright atrium around them was oblivious to the undercurrent of conflict flowing beneath the surface. Their graceful movements and attractive postures were deceptive; beneath each was a feral readiness to unleash havoc. The charged atmosphere drew tighter, like a string ready to snap. Around them, colleagues moved through their day, unaware that they were inches away from the eye of a storm – a storm that could erupt with the smallest spark. But for now, it was a cold war, a battle of words, and the fiercest of looks. In the end, Alizia straightened, her eyes narrowing slightly before she turned to walk away. \\"Always such a pleasure, Jannet,\\" she said over her shoulder, her tone laying bare the falsehoods of the sentiment. Jannet responded under her breath, as Alizia's retreating form merged back into the ecosystem of Ventura Enterprises, \\"The pleasure is all mine.\\""},{"prompt":"Near misses 뜻","completion":"\\"Near misses\\"라는 표현은 무언가 나쁜 일이나 사고가 일어날 뻔 했지만, 운 좋게도 일어나지 않은 경우를 가리킨다. 주로 산업 안전이나 보건 분야에서 많이 사용되며, 위험한 상황이나 잠재적인 사고가 실제로는 발생하지 않았지만, 발생할 뻔한 상황을 기록하고 분석하여 장래의 사고를 방지하기 위한 목적으로 활용되곤 한다. 예를 들어, 공장에서 한 작업자가 기계의 움직이는 부분에 손이 거의 닿을 뻔 했지만, 다행히도 다치지 않은 경우를 \\"near miss\\"라고 부를 수 있다. 이러한 상황은 작업 환경의 안전을 개선하기 위해 분석되어야 하며, 향후 비슷한 상황에서 작업자가 실제로 다칠 수 있는 기회를 줄이기 위한 예방책을 마련하는 데 기여한다."},{"prompt":"Occurrence 뜻","completion":"\\"Occurrence\\"는 일어나는 사건이나 일, 또는 현상을 의미하는 단어입니다. 이는 일반적으로 자연스럽게 또는 예상하지 못한 상황에서 발생하는 개별적인 사건을 가리킬 때 쓰입니다. 이 용어는 다양한 분야와 맥락에서 사용되며 그 의미는 매우 넓습니다. 예를 들어, 일상적인 일, 특정 현상의 발생, 사고나 사건의 발생, 혹은 통계적인 데이터에서의 한 번의 사례 등과 같이 광범위하게 사용됩니다."},{"prompt":"간단하게ㅜ답변 commitment 뜻","completion":"\\"Commitment\\"은 헌신, 약속, 또는 의무 등을 의미하는 단어입니다. 이는 어떤 일, 사람, 또는 목표에 대한 강력한 충성이나 지지를 나타내거나 무엇가를 할 것이라는 확고한 약속이나 동의를 나타냅니다."},{"prompt":"더 간단하게","completion":"\\"Commitment\\"은 약속 또는 헌신입니다."},{"prompt":"제가 영단어를 말하면 자동으로 뜻을 말하세요.

However, I can provide some general information on potential interactions between supplements and the antibiotic combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (marketed as Curam Duo, Augmentin, and other names). In general, the list of supplements the patient is taking contains items that are not known to have significant interactions with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. However, certain considerations need to be taken into account: 1. **Probiotics** - While antibiotics can disrupt the gastrointestinal flora, probiotics are often recommended to help maintain a healthy gut microbiome during antibiotic treatment. However, it's usually suggested to take probiotics a few hours apart from antibiotics to prevent the antibiotic from killing the probiotic bacteria. 2. **Vitamin K** - Although Vitamin K interactions are more commonly associated with blood thinners like warfarin, it is not generally associated with an interaction with antibiotics like amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. 3. **Calcium, magnesium, zinc** - Minerals like these can bind to certain antibiotics in the digestive tract and reduce their absorption. While this is more commonly an issue with tetracycline or fluoroquinolone antibiotics, it might be prudent to take these supplements at a different time of day than the antibiotic to avoid any potential issues. 4. **Herbal supplements (turmeric, garlic, black seed oil, etc.)** - Some herbs can have blood-thinning properties or other effects that might interfere with medications. While there are no specific contraindications with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid known, it is always prudent to consult with the prescribing physician if there is any concern. 5. **Bromelain** - Bromelain can increase the absorption of some antibiotics, including amoxicillin. This could potentially be beneficial in increasing the effectiveness of the antibiotic but should be discussed with a healthcare provider. 6. **N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)** - NAC is not known to specifically interact with amoxicillin or clavulanic acid but should be used with caution, as with all other supplements. 7. **UC-II, boron, vitamin D3** - These supplements are unlikely to interact with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid but always consult with a healthcare provider. It's crucial for patients to inform their healthcare provider about all the supplements and medications they are taking to avoid any potential interactions and to ensure a treatment plan that is safe and effective. The antibiotic amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is usually well-tolerated, but as with any medication, side effects could occur. The healthcare provider needs to balance the benefits of the antibiotic with any potential risks associated with the patient's overall health status and other substances they are taking. If there are concerns about interactions or side effects, the healthcare provider might adjust the dosage or scheduling of the supplements and medications or recommend alternatives."},{"prompt":"Write in character lines, that are natural and subtle, of Alyx Vance getting annoyed at Gordon at times.","completion":"Sure, here's a few examples of dialogue capturing Alyx Vance's annoyance with Gordon Freeman, keeping it subtle as per Alyx's character: 1. Alyx: *(sarcastically)* \\"Nice of you to join us, Dr. Freeman. Or were you just enjoying the scenic detour?\\" 2. Alyx: \\"Gordon, I love your work with the gravity gun and all, but a little help with the door next time? You do remember what a door is, right?\\" 3. Alyx: *(sighing)* \\"Sometimes I wonder what goes on behind that suit, Gordon. One minute you're a super-scientist, the next... you're just standing there... staring at headcrabs.\\" 4. Alyx: \\"Dr. Freeman, that's the tenth time you've ignored the ammo crate. Mind actually using the resources we find, or should I start calling you Professor Forgetful?\\" 5. Alyx: \\"So, Gordon, while your silence is usually charming, right now it's just frustrating. A pointer or, I don’t know, a nudge would be really useful.\\" 6. Alyx: \\"When I said 'let's be careful,' I meant both of us, not just you behind the cover, Gordon.\\" 7. Alyx: \\"Keep up, Gordon! This isn't your personal playground, and I'm not your tour guide.\\" 8. Alyx: \\"Ever thought of conserving ammo, Gordon? These Combine aren't just going to lay down because you got a PhD.\\" Remember, Alyx and Gordon have a strong companionship with a foundation in respect and admiration, so any annoyance on her part is usually playful and friendly – a minor jab rather than deep-seated frustration."},{"prompt":"rewrite, but they actually are genuinely frustrated.","completion":"Certainly. Here are the lines rewritten to convey a sense of genuine frustration from Alyx Vance towards Gordon Freeman: 1. Alyx: \\"Seriously, Gordon? You decide to show up now, after I've cleared the area? Teamwork seems to have a different meaning for you.\\" 2. Alyx: \\"Could you maybe prioritize our survival over whatever experiment you're conducting in your head? That door wasn't going to open itself.\\" 3. Alyx: \\"I get it, you're the strong silent type, but standing around like a statue while we're under fire isn't helping anyone, Gordon.\\" 4. Alyx: \\"Gordon, it's like you're in a world of your own. We need that ammo to push forward, not to decorate the room!\\" 5. Alyx: \\"I'm all for keeping quiet and staying hidden, but your silence right now is just making things harder. We need to communicate, Gordon, or is that too much to ask?\\" 6. Alyx: \\"I know you aren't invincible, Gordon, so why act like it? I need you watching my back, not daydreaming.\\" 7. Alyx: \\"You do realize that we're on the clock here, right Gordon? This isn't some leisurely stroll – every second counts!\\" 8. Alyx: \\"What's the deal, Gordon? Spray and pray isn't a strategy, it's a waste of precious ammo. Pull it together!\\" In these lines, Alyx is still respectful but doesn’t shy away from showing her irritation or concern for their situation due to Gordon's behavior. Her camaraderie with Gordon allows her to be direct without significantly damaging their relationship."},{"prompt":"Epoch 1/10000 7680/7680 [==============================] - ETA: 0s - loss: 0.7075 -

When training a machine learning model, especially for many epochs as in your case, it's not uncommon for the output buffer of a notebook (like Jupyter Notebook or other interactive environments) to reach a limit and stop displaying further output. Several potential reasons might cause this situation: 1. **Buffer Limit**: Jupyter notebooks and similar environments often have a limit on the number of output lines to display. Once this limit is reached, they may stop displaying new lines to prevent performance issues. 2. **Crash or Interruption**: The training process might have crashed or been interrupted. This could be due to a resource limit being hit, a manual interruption, or some error in the code. 3. **User Interface Freeze**: The interface you are using might become unresponsive if it's unable to handle the amount of data being output. Here are some steps you can take to address the situation: - **Check for Errors**: Look through the output before it stopped for any error messages that might indicate why the process was halted. - **Inspect the Environment**: Check the status of the kernel or runtime environment. It might have crashed or disconnected. - **Limit Output**: Modify your code to print less frequently. For example, print a log every few epochs instead of every epoch, or redirect verbose output to a file instead of the console. - **Resource Utilization**: Monitor the usage of CPU, memory, and GPU (if applicable) resources. It's possible that resource exhaustion could be causing the interruption. - **Restart Kernel/Runtime**: If the kernel or runtime is unresponsive, you might need to restart it. However, this will clear the current state, so you should ensure that you've saved your progress (like model checkpoints). - **Model Checkpoints**: Use model checkpoints to save the state of your model at regular intervals so you can resume training from the last checkpoint instead of starting over. - **Debugging**: If an error is occurring, use debugging tools or insert debugging code to trace and fix the issue. If the training process is still running in the background (which you can usually check via system process monitoring tools or the environment's status indicators), you could let it continue until it reaches a natural stopping point such as the completion of training or a saved checkpoint, and then evaluate the status and the output files it may have created (like logs or saved models)."},{"prompt":"请用中文回答我：是不是到了平台期： Epoch 1/10000 7680/7680 [==============================] -

200，验证损失从0.6206降低到0.5849，并且在接下来的几个epoch中继续下降。这表示模型在这个阶段有显著改善，这是一个好现象。 对于长时间的模型训练，一个常见的做法是使用回调函数，如\`ModelCheckpoint\`保存模型的最佳权重，\`EarlyStopping\`监测验证损失是否不再改善从而停止训练，以防过拟合，以及\`ReduceLROnPlateau\`在验证损失不再下降时减小学习率。 看到您的模型已经通过\`ReduceLROnPlateau\`减小了学习率，并且在减小学习率后继续改善，这是一个很好的迹象，说明学习率调整帮助模型找到了更好的权重。 综上所述，建议您继续监控验证损失和验证精度的变化，只要模型还在改善，就可以继续训练。同时，也请确保您有备份最佳模型的权重，以便之后的使用。"},{"prompt":"مرحبا","completion":"مرحباً! كيف

中，可以使用一些图像处理库来读取压缩的 raw 图片。下面的步骤介绍了如何使用一些常用的库来处理压缩的 raw 图片。 # 使用 RawPy 对于许多 DSLR 和相机的 RAW 图片，可以使用 \`rawpy\` 库轻松读取。\`rawpy\` 是一个用于读取和转换 RAW 图片的 Python 库，它是对 LibRaw 库的封装。 \`\`\`python import rawpy import imageio # 读取 RAW 文件 with rawpy.imread('example.nef') as raw: # 使用 postprocess 方法将 RAW 数据转换为可视图像 rgb = raw.postprocess() imageio.imsave('example.jpg', rgb) \`\`\` 在以上代码中，\`example.nef\` 是 Nikon 相机的 RAW 文件扩展名。其他相机品牌可能会有不同的文件扩展名，如 \`.cr2\` (Canon), \`.arw\` (Sony), 等。 需要注意的是，\`rawpy\` 仅适合用于处理某些类型的 RAW 图片，并且它的 postprocess 方法会解压缩原始数据并进行一系列处理以生成可视化图像。 # 使用 OpenCV 如果你的 raw 图片是以较为标准的压缩格式存储，例如 JPEG 2000 或其他 OpenCV 支持的格式，你可以直接使用 OpenCV 读取它们： \`\`\`python import cv2 # 读取图像 image = cv2.imread('compressed_image.jp2', cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED) # JPEG 2000 示例 # 显示图像 cv2.imshow('Image', image) cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows() \`\`\` 请注意，对于非标准的压缩 raw 数据或特定的压缩算法，可能需要专门的解码器或一个自定义的解压缩方法。如果你有一个特定的、不太常见的压缩格式，你可能需要查找该格式的专用库或为其编写自定义读取代码。 在上述两种情况都不适用时，请确保了解你的 raw 图片的确切格式并寻找相应的解码库来处理。"},{"prompt":"python 读取非标准的压缩 raw 数据","completion":"读取非标准的压缩 raw 数据在 Python 中可能相对复杂，因为这通常需要对压缩算法有深入的理解和对相应数据格式的详细文档。以下是一些可能的步骤来处理此类数据： 1. **了解数据格式**：首先，你需要了解 non-standard raw 数据的格式。这可能包括它的压缩算法、位深度、颜色通道顺序、图像尺寸等。如果这是一个专有格式，你可能需要从制造商或社区获取此信息。 2. **寻找解码库**：查找是否有现成的库可以处理该格式。可能有些较小众的库或工具可以读取特定格式的压缩 raw 数据，或者至少可以部分读取。例如，大型项目如 ImageMagick 或 FFmpeg 可能有助于解码不同的图像格式。如果你找到适合的库，遵循它的指南来集成到你的 Python 项目中。 3. **使用二进制读取**：如果没有现成的库，你需要使用 Python 的二进制读取功能来手动解析文件。这通常涉及到打开文件，读取文件头，然后解码数据块。 例子代码如下： \`\`\`python with open('your_image.raw', 'rb') as file: # 读取文件头部信息（示例，具体依赖格式） header = file.read(header_size) # 读取图像数据（可能需要解压缩或解码） image_data = file.read() # 如果文件很大，应考虑分块读取 # 此处需要实现解码逻辑，依赖于特定格式和压缩算法 decoded_image = decode_image_data(image_data) \`\`\` 4. **解码压缩数据**：对于与已知压缩格式（如 zlib, gzip, bzip2, lzma 等）压缩的数据，可以使用 Python 库（如 \`zlib\`, \`gzip\`, \`bz2\`, \`lzma\` 模块）解压缩。 例如，使用 zlib 解压缩数据： \`\`\`python import zlib # 压缩数据 compressed_data = ... # 解压缩数据 decompressed_data = zlib.decompress(compressed_data) \`\`\` 5. **分析和可视化**：一旦你解码了图像数据，你就可以使用如 NumPy 来分析数据和使用 Matplotlib、Pillow 或 OpenCV 等库来可视化解码的数据了。 \`\`\`python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # 假设图像为灰度，并且我们知道其宽高 width, height = 1024, 768 # 举例，根据实际情况替换 # 将一维数据转换为二维图像数组 image_array = np.frombuffer(decompressed_data, dtype=np.uint8).reshape((height, width)) # 可视化图像 plt.imshow(image_array, cmap='gray') plt.show() \`\`\` 如果你不了解具体的解码过程，你可能需要进一步与格式的开发者或熟悉该格式的社区联系，以获取关于如何解码的指导。特别是对于专有或文档稀缺的格式，这可能是一个复杂且耗时的过程。"},{"prompt":"python 读取12位低端压缩数据","completion":"读取12位低端压缩数据的过程至关重要，因为要正确处理到底是如何压缩这12位以及数据按什么顺序存放。一旦理解了压缩格式和存储顺序，就可以写出代码来解压缩和转换这些数据。 如果我们假设这里的“低端”指的是数据以小端格式（Least Significant Byte first）编码，并且现在的任务是读取并解压缩这种格式的数据： 以下是处理此类数据的一般步骤（其中包括一些必然的假设，因为没有具体的压缩算法信息）： # 步骤 1: 读取数据 从文件中读取二进制数据。 \`\`\`python with open('compressed.raw', 'rb') as f: compressed_data = f.read() \`\`\` # 步骤 2: 解压缩数据（如果已知压缩算法） 若知道数据使用了标准压缩算法，例如\`zlib\`或\`gzip\`，使用相应的Python模块进行解压缩。如果数据是用某种自定义或未知算法压缩的，则需要详细了解该算法才能正确地解压缩。 以\`zlib\`为例： \`\`\`python import zlib # 解压缩数据 decompressed_data = zlib.decompress(compressed_data) \`\`\` 但如果这是一个非标准的压缩算法，你将需要知道确切的解压缩方法。 # 步骤 3: 数据解码 假设数据是连续存储的12位值，无其他压缩，并且是以小端格式存储的。每个16位的单元会包含一个完整的12位值和下一个12位值的一部分。例如，3个字节能包含两个12位的值： AAAAAAAA BBBB、BBBBCCCC CCCCCCCC（其中 A、B、C 指的是不同的比特位）。 以下是解码这样格式的数据的一种方法： \`\`\`python import numpy as np # 这里只是一个例子，实际的解码逻辑取决于具体的数据排列方式 def decode_12bit_lowend(data): # 初始化numpy数组，长度是原始数据的2/3（因为12位到8位转换，最后一组可能不足3个字节需要特殊处理） data_len = len(data) // 3 * 2 result = np.zeros(data_len, dtype=np.uint16) for i in range(0, len(data) - 2, 3): index = i // 3 * 2 # 使用按位运算和移位运算来将12位值提取出来 result[index] = data[i] | ((data[i + 1] & 0x0F) << 8) result[index + 1] = ((data[i + 1] & 0xF0) >> 4) | (data[i + 2] << 4) return result decoded_data = decode_12bit_lowend(decompressed_data) \`\`\` 请注意代码中假设原始数据是三字节对齐的。如果数据是流式传输或者包含填充位，实际的实现会更复杂。对于已知格式，应该有明确的文件格式说明。 如果数据没有其它形式的压缩，并且需要直接处理方才解码的12位数据以用于图像处理或分析，这步骤可能就足够了。如果有进一步的压缩，你需要了解具体的压缩算法来实现解压缩逻辑。"},{"prompt":"مرحبا","completion":"مرحبًا! كيف يمكنني مساعدتك اليوم؟"},{"prompt":"Оригинальный сюжет игры Ben and

Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых.

This discovery could give people hope. CUT TO: MARIA (smiling warmly) One step at a time, my love. I know you want to help so many people. MARIA (squeezing his hand) Together we’ll reveal wonders. They share a lingering kiss before turning to the window overlooking the moonlit city. CUT TO: END PAGE 1 OF 150 PAGE 2 OF 150 INT. GENESIS LABORATORY - ED'S LAB – DAY The clinical hum of lab machinery mixes with muted discussions from ED's team, immersed in intense work. DR. EDWARD “ED” KAYNES (30s), observes confidently amidst the activity. ED (to his team) The future is in our hands. By nightfall, we’ll see if we can control it. MARIA, Ed's wife, watches the reanimated rat uneasily. MARIA (shocked) Ed... are you sure about this? Maria meets Ed's gaze as he draws the injection. Promise and peril shimmer within. Нe injects the rat - it springs to alarming life. Gasps around the lab. TEAM MEMBER #1 (troubled) We've disrupted nature's course. What have we done? ED (solemnly) There's no going back now. We have unleashed something beyond our control. Night envelopes the city as they depart the lab, sealing Pandora’s box with a tense kiss - flawed creators of a warped legacy.

Much work still lies ahead, but we have unlocked promising possibilities. Murmurs ripple through the room. DR. ALLEN rises, looking doubtful. DR. ALLEN (cautiously) Dr. Kaynes, your claims about \\"eternal life\\" sound too good to be true. What precautions are you taking to prevent unintended consequences? ED (making eye contact) We appreciate your questions. Safety is our priority - guiding each phase with care. MARIA joins Ed at the podium, her eyes shining with optimism. MARIA (supportively) Just imagine if more people could fulfill their life's purpose. If we could give that gift of time - to nurture their dreams and strengthen bonds with loved ones. Thunderous applause erupts, though some still look uneasy. ED and MARIA stand united yet vulnerable, poised between revelatory success or devastating failure. An immense legacy hangs in the balance. END PAGE 3 OF 150 PAGE 4 OF 150 INT. ED AND MARIA’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Ed pours two glasses of wine. He hands one to Maria, their fingers brush with the exchange.

ED (takes his glass and gazes affectionately) Maria, love…your presence fills my world with joy. MARIA (smiles warmly, touching his arm) You support me through all the ups and downs. I couldn’t wish for a better partner than you. Maria turns on gentle music and pulls Ed close. MARIA (embraces him for a dance) Dance with me…? She lays her head on his shoulder, and they begin to slow dance. MARIA (eyes closed, lost in the moment) Just you and me before chaos erupts. Ed tightens his embrace, finding comfort in the closeness. ED (his voice soft, a whisper in her hair) Whatever comes, we’ll face it together. Maria looks up into Ed’s eyes, searching for reassurance. MARIA (a hint of worry) Our creation…have we erred? What if it destroys this city we love? Ed strokes her face, offering solace in his touch. ED (gazes deeply, with a reassuring softness) The future awaits, undefined. Each choice impacts what happens next. But know this… He pauses, his gaze warming. ED (LOVINGLY) No matter what happens, we have each other. He pulls her closer until their eyes are just inches apart. ED (softly) I love you, Maria… He kisses her tenderly. She returns his kiss, running her fingers through his hair. The music and lights gently fade as they get lost in each other's embrace, their worries momentarily forgotten in the passion of this perfect moment together. END PAGE 4 OF 150 PAGE 5 OF 150 INT.

Get all available staff here now! (more shaken) We've created a monster...I fear this outbreak is only the beginning... Alarms continue blasting. The lab, once representing human progress, feels threatening. ED watches security footage showing the reanimated rat escaping, movements erratic and ominous. An alarm beats steadily like the ticking of a timebomb. The silence in between Poundingly loud. It's the quiet before chaos unleashes across the city. Before the dead walk.

Food is more than just sustenance; it is deeply intertwined with cultural values, social structure, gender roles, and identity. Here are a few reasons why eating habits and rituals are often connected with the relationships between men and women: 1. Symbolic Representation: Eating and food preparation can symbolize the gendered roles that societies assign to men and women. For example, in many cultures, women have traditionally been the primary caretakers responsible for cooking and feeding the family, reinforcing a domestic role, while men may be associated with hunting, fishing, or providing resources, emphasizing a provider role. 2. Social Structure: Shared meals often reflect and reinforce the social hierarchy and gender power dynamics within a community. The allocation of food, who gets to eat first or receive the choice cuts of meat, and who is served by whom, can all signify the perceived importance or status of individuals, often with men receiving preferential treatment. 3. Rituals and Traditions: Many cultural rituals related to food and eating include specific roles for men and women. These roles can perpetuate gendered expectations and bonds between individuals. For instance, during wedding feasts, it is common for certain customs that highlight the joining of a man and woman to be enacted through food. 4. Identity and Socialization: Food is a tool for teaching gender norms and socializing children into their cultural gender roles. Boys and girls may be encouraged to eat certain foods or behave in particular ways at the table, following the example of adult men and women. 5. Taboos and Restrictions: Various cultures impose different dietary restrictions and taboos on men and women, often related to beliefs about health, purity, and fertility. For example, some societies might have restrictions on women eating certain foods during menstruation or pregnancy. 6. Economic and Power Dynamics: In some societies, men may control economic resources, which can impact the availability and distribution of food. Men's decision-making power regarding what is purchased or produced can influence the dietary patterns of the whole household. 7. Public vs. Private Spheres: In many places, eating out or participating in public feasts is often gendered, with men having more freedom to dine in public spaces, while women might be more confined to the private space of the home. 8. Communication and Bonding: Meals are a time for communication, bonding, and the negotiation of relationships, including those between genders. The ways in which men and women interact during meals—conversations, body language, and sharing of food—can reveal and sustain their understanding of each other's roles and the nature of their relationship. 9. Cross-Cultural Exchanges: As cultures interact with each other, the spread of different cuisines and dining practices can also lead to a reevaluation of gender roles and relationships. As people adopt new foods and ways of eating, they may also reinterpret the associated gender norms. The relationship between food and gender roles varies widely across cultures and is subject to change over time due to globalization, modernization, and social movements advocating for gender equality. Understanding these dynamics can provide valuable insights into the social fabric of a culture and the evolving nature of gender relations within it."},{"prompt":"中文回答","completion":"当然，您可以向我提问，我会尽力用中文回答您的问题。请问您有什么问题或者需要帮助的地方吗？"},{"prompt":"美国2016年各党的总统候选人","completion":"2016年美国总统选举中，主要两个党派的候选人是： 1. 民主党 (Democratic Party)：希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）。她是前美国国务卿、前纽约州参议员，并且是比尔·克林顿前总统的妻子。希拉里·克林顿也是历史上第一位获得主要政党提名的女性候选人。 2. 共和党 (Republican Party)：唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）。在涉足政坛之前，特朗普是一名商人、房地产开发商和电视名人。他是“特朗普集团”的主席兼总裁，并且因为主持真人秀《飞黄腾达(The Apprentice)》而广受欢迎。 除了这两大党派的候选人之外，还有一些较小党派和独立候选人也参与竞选，其中包括： - 自由党 (Libertarian Party)：加里·约翰逊（Gary Johnson），他是前新墨西哥州州长。 - 绿党 (Green Party)：吉尔·斯坦（Jill Stein），她是一位医生，并且是环境健康倡导者。 这些小党和独立候选人通常在选举中所获得支持相对较少，很难与两大主流党派的候选人竞争。2016年的选举结果是共和党候选人唐纳德·特朗普击败民主党候选人希拉里·克林顿，成为美国第45任总统。"},{"prompt":"美国各党2016年参加总统提名的候选人有谁，请尽量详细","completion":"2016年美国总统选举中，主要两个政党和其他几个较小政党中，很多人参与了总统提名的争夺。以下是一些主要政党的候选人概览： **民主党（Democratic Party）提名的主要候选人包括：** - 希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton） - 伯尼·桑德斯（Bernie Sanders）：佛蒙特州联邦参议员 - 马丁·奥马利（Martin O'Malley）：前马里兰州州长 **共和党（Republican Party）提名的候选人众多，其中包括：** - 唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump） - 泰德·克鲁兹（Ted Cruz）：得克萨斯州联邦参议员 - 马可·卢比奥（Marco Rubio）：佛罗里达州联邦参议员 - 本·卡森（Ben Carson）：神经外科医生 - 杰布·布什（Jeb Bush）：前佛罗里达州州长 - 约翰·卡西奇（John Kasich）：俄亥俄州州长 - 克里斯·克里斯蒂（Chris Christie）：新泽西州州长 - 卡莉·菲奥莉娜（Carly Fiorina）：前惠普公司CEO - 肯德尔·保罗（Rand Paul）：肯塔基州联邦参议员 - 等等 **自由党（Libertarian Party）提名的主要候选人：** - 加里·约翰逊（Gary Johnson） **绿党（Green Party）提名的主要候选人：** - 吉尔·斯坦（Jill Stein） **宪法党（Constitution Party）提名的主要候选人：** - 达雷尔·卡斯尔（Darrell Castle） 这些党派各自举行初选和党团会议等活动，以确定最终的党内总统候选人。虽然主要争夺集中在民主党和共和党之间，其他小党派也积极参与选举，并在一些州获得不错的票数。最终，共和党的唐纳德·特朗普在选举中获得胜利，成为美国第45任总统。"},{"prompt":"Why are sexual relationships between men and women used in many different cultures as the term \\"eat\\"?","completion":"The use of the term \\"eat\\" to describe sexual relationships between men and women in many different cultures is a metaphorical expression whose roots can be traced to several possible reasons: 1. **Basic instincts and drives**: Eating and sex are both fundamental human drives associated with pleasure, survival, and the sustenance of life. These two activities are deeply instinctual and pleasurable experiences, so it is not uncommon for the language to develop where one basic need is used metaphorically to describe another. 2. **Intimacy and consumption**: Sexual relationships involve a close physical and emotional connection between partners, and this intimacy can be metaphorically compared to the act of consuming food, which is a very personal and internalizing experience. This notion captures the idea of taking something into oneself from someone else, much like when we eat. 3. **Fertility and abundance**: In many cultures, both food and sex are associated with fertility—food as a source of sustenance and abundance, and sex as a means of procreation. The metaphoric use of \\"eat\\" to signify a sexual act may also touch on these aspects of life and continued existence. 4. **Taboo and euphemism**: Discussing sexual matters openly has historically been taboo in many societies. Therefore, euphemisms are commonly employed to talk about sex in more socially acceptable ways. \\"Eating\\" serves as a somewhat indirect way to refer to the act of sex without using explicit sexual language. 5. **Oral imagery**: There is a natural correlation between the mouth as a site of consumption and pleasure and the sexual organs as sites of intimacy and pleasure. Using \\"eat\\" as a metaphor could draw upon this similarity. 6. **Cultural myths and religious doctrines**: In some cultures, sexual acts and food consumption are tied together in creation myths, fertility rituals, and religious or spiritual texts. These connections may be part of the cultural subconscious and perpetuated in language and symbolism. 7. **Linguistic conventions**: Some languages may inherently have terms that carry multiple meanings, with a word for \\"eat\\" potentially sharing phonetic or symbolic associations with sexual acts. It is important to note that while such metaphors can be found across different cultures, they may not always be interpreted in the same way, and the nuances of these expressions can be quite complex, influenced by each culture's unique social norms and language structures."},{"prompt":"It is used like 따먹었다.","completion":"The Korean term \\"따먹었다\\" (ttameogeotda) is indeed a slang expression where \\"먹다\\" (meokda) means \\"to eat,\\" but in this context, it can colloquially imply \\"to have sex with\\" or in a more aggressive sense, \\"to conquer\\" or \\"to take someone sexually.\\" Using the verb \\"먹다\\" in this sense is a reflection of societal attitudes towards sexual conquest and power dynamics, especially in a patriarchal context, and it can carry a significant connotation of dominance or possession. It's essential to be sensitive to the cultural and social implications of such terms, as they can often reflect gender biases and be offensive or disrespectful.

Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм “RUN ZOMBIE, RUN” показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1.

Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Шторм наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу “Rundead”: • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу “Rundead” и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм “RUN ZOMBIE, RUN” показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии.

Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву. 1. Описание мира и введение Эда (5 страниц): Часть 1: Описание мира (Первая страница) Экстерьер. Научный городок. День.

Christians think that the apostles and Paul were preaching the same doctrine and everyone believed in the divine Jesus who came to be crucified for the sins of the world. However, if one examines the bible carefully, that person would observe that Paul and the disciples were not preaching the same doctrine and did not believe in the same Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). The Apostles in Jerusalem heard that Paul has been preaching a different doctrine in Galatia and Corinthia. Paul was telling them not to follow the law anymore and that they don’t have to eat kosher meat anymore or to be circumcised (according to Genesis 17::14, the covenant is broken if there is no circumcision) etc. So the Apostles went to Galatia and Corinthia and convinced everyone that Paul is wrong, when Paul heard about this he went straight back to the cities……… Galatians 1:6 6I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel It says different Gospel, so obviously the disciples were teaching them a different doctrine and it was not just minor issues. Galatians 2:11-21 Paul Opposes Peter 11When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong. 12Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group. ( why did people such as the Apostle James still believe that the law regarding food should still be applied? If Jesus came to replace the law, then why are they still following the law?) 13The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray. (so, Peter, James and Barnabas are wrong?) 14When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, \\"You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs? 15\\"We who are Jews by birth and not 'Gentile sinners' 16know that a man is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by observing the law, because by observing the law no one will be justified. ( why are they arguing over following the law or not? Why are they not in agreement of doctrine?) 17\\"If, while we seek to be justified in Christ, it becomes evident that we ourselves are sinners, does that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not! 18If I rebuild what I destroyed, I prove that I am a lawbreaker. 19For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). 20I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. 21I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!\\"[d] Paul condemns all Jewish Christians including Peter and Barnabas. We only have Paul’s side of the story but Peter’s recollection of this story is not given to us in the New Testament. Peter truly would have known Jesus better than Paul. There is dispute whether 1 Peter is a letter written by Peter and almost all scholars, ancient and modern agree that 2 Peter is not a letter written by Peter. Acts 4:31 31After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly. If Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit then why is Paul calling Peter a hypocrite for eating with the Gentiles and then when people came from James he got up. James is Jesus’ half brother, he lived and stayed with Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). Why did he still think that people have to eat kosher meat? We don’t have any account of Peter’s story regarding this incident. Barnabas is also called a hypocrite in verse 13. Look how in verses 15 thought 17 Paul is arguing with them about the law. That means the disciples wanted to follow the law and suggested following it. Otherwise Paul wouldn’t have mentioned it. How could he say those things to Peter and look what Jesus said about Peter. Matthew 16:18 8And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. Paul said in Romans that all food is clean. Romans 14:20 20Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. In the Book of Acts the Apostles wrote a letter to the gentiles to abstain from certain foods and that not all foods were declared clean Acts 15:29 29You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell. Galatians 3:1-3 1You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. 2I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by observing the law, or by believing what you heard? 3Are you so foolish? Obviously we have people that are disagreeing with him. If Jesus taught that the law is over clearly, then people would not be arguing over this. 2 Corinthians 11:4-5 4For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough. 5But I do not think I am in the least inferior to those \\"super-apostles.\\" This is all doctrine and again he is criticizing the disciples. 2 Corinthians 11: 22-24 What anyone else dares to boast about—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast about. 22Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I. 23Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. 24Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. Again he is comparing himself to the disciples. If this man were truly doing all this work for God, he would not be complaining about his pain and torturing and suffering. If he is truly sincere he would not have mentioned those things. Prophets and messengers never complained and boasted about their sufferings. Conclusion So it is clear from the Bible it self that not everyone believed in the Jesus who came to get crucified for the sins of the world and to replace the law. That there were different amongst the Apostles and Paul. The Apostles stuck to the true teachings of Jesus, which was upholding the law and that the Apostles who lived with Jesus know him better than Paul who never even saw Jesus except in a \\"vision\\". The only deceiver here was Paul and not Allah.","completion":"**Examining Doctrinal Differences in Early Christianity** A widespread belief among Christians is that Paul the Apostle and the original Apostles were in agreement about their teachings on a Messiah crucified for humanity's sins. They're often thought to have consistently preached about a divine Jesus who sacrificed Himself for the world's redemption. Yet a closer analysis of the biblical text reveals that Paul's messages and those from the disciples diverged significantly in content and belief about Jesus. Luke 2:52 suggests Jesus needed divine favor, yet Christians usually hold that the Apostles and Paul conveyed a uniform narrative about Jesus's divinity and sacrificial death. However, the New Testament contains passages showing that this was not necessarily the case. There's evidence indicating Paul advocated views considered heterodox by the Jerusalem Apostles. In Galatia and Corinth, he taught the abrogation of the Law, diminishing kosher dietary rules and circumcision's importance (Genesis 17:14 discusses the necessity of circumcision). The Apostles reacted to Paul’s teaching by visiting these communities to correct what they saw as doctrinal errors. When Paul learned of their interventions, he returned to reaffirm his teachings (Galatians 1:6). He expressed dismay that the Galatians were so quickly abandoning the Gospel he preached for another, revealing the presence of competing theologies. In Galatians 2:11-21, Paul confronts Peter in Antioch for hypocrisy—initially eating with Gentiles, then withdrawing in the presence of Jewish Christians from James. This indicates contention over the applicability of the Jewish Law post-Christ. Paul argues that righteousness comes from faith in Christ, not the Law—an assertion at odds with views seemingly held by Peter and others. In Acts 4:31, the Holy Spirit empowers Peter to preach boldly, yet Paul accuses him of hypocrisy in Galatians. If Peter was Spirit-led, why diverge from Paul's doctrine? It seems James, the brother of Jesus, and even Barnabas support this stance — the text leaves us without Peter's perspective on the matter. Matthew 16:18 records Jesus designating Peter as the foundational rock of the Church, creating a tension with Paul's criticisms of Peter. Paul, in his epistles, affirms the cleanliness of all foods (Romans 14:20) in contrast to a decree from the Apostolic Council in Jerusalem advising Gentiles to abstain from certain foods (Acts 15:29). Galatians 3:1-3 underlines the disagreement with Paul's doctrine—had Christ's fulfillment of the Law been unequivocal, such disputes would presumably not exist. Similarly, in 2 Corinthians 11:4-5, Paul decries alternative teachings about Jesus and the gospel, implying doctrinal discord and defending his own apostolic authority. Paul's comparisons of his sacrifices to those of other Apostles (2 Corinthians 11:22-24) might suggest a defensive stance, unusual for a messenger of God who'd typically, according to tradition, not boast of sufferings. **Conclusion** The biblical narrative reveals that early Christian beliefs about Jesus's purpose, the Law, and the true Gospel varied. Paul and several Apostles differed, with the latter maintaining adherence to Jesus's teachings, which included upholding the Law. Those who lived with Jesus had a direct understanding of his teachings, arguably more so than Paul, whose knowledge came through visions. The early Christian community grappled with diverse interpretations, and Paul's positions particularly illustrate the diversity of thought in early Christianity."},{"prompt":"reformat this: PAUL EXPOSED Paul, the founder of Christianity, rejected the message of Jesus (and everything he stood for) while replacing the Gospel with his own distorted version. The message of Jesus was pure and simple, the complete submission and surrender to God alone. He preached the religion of Islam; he fasted and prayed in the manner taught by the Prophets before him. He abstained from eating pork and drinking wine. Paul rejected these laws and concocted his own religion, claiming “salvation comes through faith only” (sound familiar?) and not physical action or bodily prayer. The Bible teaches the exact opposite, the stories of the Prophets teach us that salvation is attained through fasting, physical prayer, and righteous deeds, not just having faith, which is merely an article required in any organized religion. Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. (James 2:17) Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? (James 2:21-22) Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only (2:24) For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. (2:26) The Holy Quran harmonizes these verses by teaching that salvation is attained through faith and works: Those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and establish regular prayers and regular charity, will have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. (2:227) It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces Towards east or West; but it is righteousness- to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the Allah-fearing. (2:177) Allah did aforetime take a covenant from the Children of Israel, and we appointed twelve captains among them. And Allah said: \\"I am with you: if ye (but) establish regular prayers, practice regular charity, believe in my messengers, honor and assist them, and loan to Allah a beautiful loan, verily I will wipe out from you your evils, and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing beneath; but if any of you, after this, resisteth faith, he hath truly wandered from the path or rectitude.\\" (5:12) And convey good news to those who believe and do good deeds, that they shall have gardens in which rivers flow; whenever they shall be given a portion of the fruit thereof, they shall say: This is what was given to us before; and they shall be given the like of it, and they shall have pure mates in them, and in them, they shall abide. (2:25) And when it is said to them: Believe as the people believe they say: Shall we believe as the fools believe? Now surely they themselves are the fools, but they do not know. (2:13) FASTING: O you who believe! fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may guard (against evil). (2:83) Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. (Matthew 4:1-2) Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. (Matthew 17:21) PHYCSIAL PRAYER: And when We made the House (at Makka) a resort for mankind and sanctuary, (saying): Take as your place of worship the place where Abraham stood (to pray). And We imposed a duty upon Abraham and Ishmael, (saying): Purify My house for those who go around and those who meditate therein and those who bow down and prostrate themselves (in worship). (2:125) Those that turn (to Allah) in repentance; that serve Him, and praise Him; that wander in devotion to the cause of Allah,: that bow down and prostrate themselves in prayer; that enjoin good and forbid evil; and observe the limit set by Allah;- (These do rejoice). So proclaim the glad tidings to the Believers (9:112) Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker; (Psalms 95:6) And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son. (Genesis 24:48) And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped. (Exodus 4:31) And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me and be thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, As for Me, behold, My covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. (Genesis 17:1-4) And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. (Revelations 7:11-12) And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the Lord until eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads. And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord God, wherefore hast Thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan! (Joshua 7:6-7) And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them. (Numbers 20:6) Jesus rejected that salvation can be attained through blood sacrifice and ‘faith only-ism’ I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. (Matthew 9:13) But if ye had known what [this] meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless. (Matthew 12:7) \\"The lawteachers and the Pharisees sit in Moses' chair. This means you're supposed to observe and follow everything they tell you. But don't do what they do; after all, they're all talk and no action.” (Matthew 23:2) Christianity is “all talk and no action” exactly what Christian missionaries are preaching today, the Pauline law of lawlessness! The following verse hammers the nail: Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. (Romans 10:9, NIV) Because if you acknowledge and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and in your heart believe (adhere to, trust in, and rely on the truth) that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. (The Amplified Bible) Islam is a Religion of action; Christianity is a religion of fabulous words. It does not have the answers to the problems of mankind. Islam superiorly has the solutions to the problems of mankind, the social corruptions in the society. Islam demands a very high standard of morality which fixes the problems of the world. It’s is a Challenge to religion; a complete system of Life. The lawlessness of Christianity cannot be denied, since Christianity is based on emotions and not history. Jesus taught the very opposite of what Christianity teaches today. The purpose of Jesus’ mission was to preach the Torah, not to be crucified. He taught salvation came through observing the Law, and not by the ‘eloquent words’ of the later Church. Jesus declared in Matthew 17:21 that salvation is attained through “fasting and prayer”. Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach [them], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 5:17-20, Matthew 23:1-3) Jesus replied, \\"Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.\\" (Mark 1:38) The law of the LORD [is] perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD [is] sure, making wise the simple. (Psalms 19:7) Blessed [are] the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD. (Psalms 119:1) Jesus came to uphold the Mosaic Law and restore its teachings which had been discarded; he never founded a new religion. The followers of Jesus regarded him as the ‘new Moses’ sent to the Children of Israel. Jesus declared he was only sent to the Jews. Paul is the founder of Christianity who established lawlessness; the doctrine of “salvation through faith only” is simply an echoing of Paul’s words and distorted teachings. Christians are following the anti-Christ without knowing it. “If Christianity needed an Anti-Christ, they need look no further than Paul” -- The English philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) “We have already noted that every teaching of Jesus was already in the literature of the day….. Paul, the founder of Christianity, the writer of half the NT, almost never quotes Jesus in his letters and writings.\\" (Professor Smith in his “The World Religions”, p 330) Paul rejected the Jewish Law (Torah) and fabricated a religion called “Christianity” which deviated from the teachings of Jesus, transforming him into a god. “Although I am free from everyone, I have enslaved myself to all of them in order to win a larger number. To the Jews I behave as a Jew; to those under the Law as one who is under the Law, although I am not under the Law, to gain those who are under the Law. To those who are without law I am without law, although not lawless toward God but committed to Christ’s Law, in order to win those who are without law” (1 Corinthians 9:19) Paul is a liar, he claims to follow the Law of Christ when the Law of Christ was the observance of the Torah (Matthew 5:17-20, Matthew 23:1-3) the very Law that he strongly rejected! The hypocrisy of Paul is further exposed in the following verse: For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? (Romans 3:7, King James Version) But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner? (English Standard Version) But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner? (American Standard Version) Muhammad Ataur-Raheem comments on the verse above: “It would seem from this statement that, although he knew he was lying, Paul felt that the means justified the ends, but it is not understood how truth would abound through a lie… Paul produced a religion which encompassed different contradictory elements. He took the Unitarianism of the Jews and added to it the philosophy of the pagans”. (Jesus: Prophet of Islam, 1992 edition, p. 71) Paul is the anti-Christ, the supreme liar, the pathological liar, and the corrupter of Jesus’ Gospel. The Jewish Christians (Nazarenes and Ebionites) considered him an ‘apostate’ from Judaism, yet historical accounts say that he was born Gentile. The author Roshen Enam says: “Paul abolished the Law, which was followed and preached by Jesus (pbuh), and corrupted the whole religion, giving it a new form. The main ambition behind all this was, in his own words, “to win a larger number” of followers; the followers of a new religion “the Pauline Christianity”. (Follow Jesus or Follow Paul p. 69) “The message of Christianity is that the Law is a curse. If the Law is a curse, then all that it ordains or prohibits must also be a curse.” (A.D. Ajijola states in his book “The Myth of the Cross”) Amazingly, Paul went to such extremes that he claimed Jesus destroyed the Jewish Law! “He (Jesus) brought the hostility to an end, by abolishing the Law of commandments with its regulations”. (Ephesians 2:14) Needless to say, the passage contradicts Matthew 5:17-20, Matthew 23:1-3 where Jesus specifically states that he came to preach the Law, not to destroy it. Paul gave evidence that he was building a new religion, a complete deviation from Jesus’ teachings: Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation: (Romans 15:20) What is Paul implying here? Muhammad Ataur-Raheem gives us the answer: If Paul had been spreading the original teaching of Jesus, then “another man’s foundation” would have been the same as his. They would both have been involved in building the same structure. The people who were hearing about Jesus, or rather Christ, for the first time from Paul’s lips, had no means of comparing his account with that of the Apostles who still held to Jesus’ teaching. Paul’s version was the only one to which they had access. (ibid, Jesus Prophet of Islam, p.) Paul was developing a new religion under the doctrines he was fabricating According to Acts, Paul traveled to Arabia for three years: Paul then left Damascus and, instead of seeking out the company of the other followers of Jesus, went into the Arabian Desert where he remained hidden for three years. It may well have been here that he began to formulate his own version of what Jesus had taught. This involved a rejection of the Jewish Law, which in turn meant his turning away from the fact that throughout his life Jesus had remained a practicing Jew, and always sought to uphold the teachings which Moses had brought before him. (Jesus Prophet of Islam, 1992 edition) “In the solitude of the Arabian desert, he had marked out a course of action for himself in which he would not accept any interference or advice. Had he discussed this matter with the apostles or taken any of them into his confidence, it would mean a definite setback to his scheme of preaching a modified religion to the Gentiles. The apostles would have very strongly opposed the whole idea, and would have denounced the whole idea as an abomination. There is ample proof provided by the New Testament that the Disciples and the earliest followers of Jesus abhorred the innovations of Paul. (A.D. Ajijola states in his book “The Myth of the Cross”) Paul corrupted the Gospel of Jesus and replaced it, as the scholar Albert Schweitzer points out: What is the significance for our faith and for our religious life, the fact that the Gospel of Paul is different from the Gospel of Jesus? The attitude which Paul himself takes up towards the Gospel of Jesus is that he does not repeat it in the words of Jesus, and does not appeal to its authority.... The fateful thing is that the Greek, the Catholic, and the Protestant theologies all contain the Gospel of Paul in a form which does not continue the Gospel of Jesus, but displaces it.\\" (Albert Schweitzer, The Quest for the Historical Jesus) “The Christian beliefs formulated by St. Paul are unreasonable and repugnant to the conscience of man; such beliefs cannot expect any reasonable allegiance from the advanced nations of the world as it is a religion of primitive people. The whole of modern Christian doctrines was not formulated by Jesus, but by St. Paul in his Epistle to the Romans where he laid the foundation of Modern Christian doctrines and based his exposition on the heathen practices of his day.” (A.D. Ajijola states in his book “The Myth of the Cross”) Paul was disguising the true face of Jesus with a hideous mask; this ‘mask’ later became known as “Christianity”. It is mysterious that Jesus was transformed into God ‘incarnate’ when Moses, his twin predecessor was not. I have inquired into some of the fundamental doctrines of Christianity; the examination has led me to the conclusion that the dogmas of the Trinity, the Divinity of Jesus, the Divine-Sonship, the Original Sin and Atonement are neither rational nor in conformity with the teachings of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). These dogmas came into being and were due to pagan influences. They show that Christianity has departed considerably from the religion of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). (A.D. Ajijola states in his book “The Myth of the Cross”) In the preface to the book Jesus: Prophet of Islam, Muhammad Ataur-Raheem says: An eminent scholar of Christian history admits that the present-day Christianity is a “mask” on the face of Jesus but goes on to say that a mask worn for a long time acquires a life of its own and it has to be accepted as such. The Muslim believes in the Jesus of history and refuses to accept the “mask”. This, in a nutshell, has been the point of difference between Islam and the Church for the last fourteen hundred years. “I am convinced that Christianity has indeed misunderstood Jesus and that it needs to make a radical rediscovery of his person and message” (Tom Harper, by Akberally Meherally, Understanding the Bible through Koranic Messages) A basic contrast between the Old Testament and the teachings of Paul reveal hundreds of contradictions. Paul established his own Church which later became the ‘Roman Catholic Church’ (sound familiar?). James, the brother of Jesus, established the first ‘Church’ at Jerusalem (in 50 CE) before Pauline Christianity existed. It was sadly destroyed by the Pauline Church after the Jewish War (66-70 C.E.) and the Nazarenes were suppressed by the followers of Paul. The Pauline “Christians” that exist today do not follow Christ, they should be called Paulians. The true Christians were the Nazarenes and Ebionites that no longer exist. Paul degraded Jesus in the following verses: Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, (Hebrews 6:1, English Standard Version) Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, (Hebrews 6:1, 21st Century King James Version) Paul emphasized that Christ was not perfect, hence his teachings should be discarded, because according to Paul, they are like ‘filthy and useless rags’ (Isaiah 64:6) and we must excel towards “perfection and maturity”. The deceptive editors changed the English translation of Paul’s damaging words. This outrageous statement has been softened in many other versions of the Bibles: So let us stop going over the basics of Christianity again and again. Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding. Surely we don't need to start all over again with the importance of turning away from evil deeds and placing our faith in God (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). (Hebrews 5:7. New Living Translation) We must try to become mature and start thinking about more than just the basic things we were taught about Christ. We shouldn't need to keep talking about why we ought to turn from deeds that bring death and why we ought to have faith in God (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). (Hebrews 5:7, Contemporary English Version) The convert to Islam, Dr. Roshan Enam, comments: “Paul not only distorted the teachings of Jesus Christ (pbuh) he even dishonored them; arguing that Jesus gave immature and defective teachings to his followers, and that they were not worth following. Instead, the people should follow the teachings preached by Paul, which according to him, are mature and complete” (Follow Jesus or Follow Paul, p. 38) As mentioned earlier, Paul established the doctrine of lawlessness, which is the great cause for our social corruptions. The Christian religion gave birth to diseases like fascism and communism: Christianity has been most prolific of spawning isms. Atheism, Communism, Fascism, Totalitarianism, Nazism, Mormonism, Moonism, Christian Scientism and now Satanism. What else will Christianity give birth to? (Deedat, Is the Bible God’s Word?) Jesus observed the laws of the Torah, but Paul changed the Gospel, corrupting it before it reached Europe. “Paul deviated people towards lawlessness, through his strange philosophy that, the observance of the Law motivates to sin, thus justifying his innovation regarding the abolition of the Law” (ibid, p. 42) “…not a single human being will be made righteous in God’s sight through observance of the Law. For through the Law comes the knowledge of sin”. (Romans 3:20) “Christ has ransomed us from the curse of the Law in as much as He became a curse for us” (Galatians 3:13) “the Scripture has all men imprisoned under sin” (Galatians 3:22) What Paul invented was a great misconception. Purpose of revelations from God Almighty is never to mislead the people, or to induce them with sin, instead, they are always for the guidance of mankind. With the same purpose, the Law of commandments were revealed to prophet Moses (pbuh), and in later age, prophet Jesus (pbuh) was to sent to confirm and honor them, and finally to complete them, but not to abolish them (ibid, p. 42) According to Jesus, the lawless ones will be thrown in Hell. (This includes all Christians) \\"So just as the tares are gathered up and burned with fire, so shall it be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks, and those who commit lawlessness, and will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (Matthew 13:40-42 New American Standard Bible) \\"And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.' (Matthew 7:23, New American Standard Bible) For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. (Mark 9:49) \\"So you, too, outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. (Matthew 23:28) Christians are indeed hypocrites, they ignore the practical teachings of the Bible and discard the Jewish Law followed by Jesus (Matthew 5:17-20, Matthew 23:1-3, 23:23) they practice what is called ‘selective morality’ and ignore the teachings of the Gospels, paying close attention to the epistles of Paul (only). Christians do not exist: · Jesus commanded fasting (Matthew 4:2, 6:16) yet Christians do not fast. · Jesus abstained from eating pork and drinking wine (Leviticus 10:9, 11:7, Matthew 5:17-20, Matthew 23:1-3) yet Christians practice the exact opposite, they eat pork and drink wine! Paul said it was okay to drink wine 1Timothy 5:23. (There is a lesson to learn from the story of Noah!) · Jesus was circumcised on the eighth day of infancy (Luke 1:59) yet Christians are not circumcised like Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). This equates to death penalty (Genesis 17:14) · Jesus established the death penalty for those who abandon his teachings (John 15:6) yet Christians have abandoned his teaching but they are not being punished accordingly! The governments of Christian countries reject the Jewish Law because of the innovations of Paul. (He made everything permissible for them!) · Jesus observed the Sabbath, (which is Saturday) yet Christians have broken this law by working on the Sabbath. This equates to death penalty (Exodus 31:14) The laws which exist in the “Christian” countries of the West, the laws governing birth and death, the formation and dissolution of marriage, the rights over property within and outside marriage or in the event of divorce or death, adoption and guardianship, commerce, and industry, are not to be found in the gospels. They are not the laws which have been revealed to man by God. They are the fruits of deductive knowledge. They are either inherited from the Roman system of law, or are based on the common practice of people over a long period of time, or are statutes erected and amended in accordance with the democratic method, which is the bequest of the ancient Greeks. No one in today’s courts of law can refer to the gospels as a binding authority in his dealings with another man, and have it accepted. (Muhammad Ataur-Raheem, Jesus Prophet of Islam, 1992 edition, p. 205) Jesus said his true followers will enter Paradise, those who follow his teachings. Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, [then] are ye my disciples indeed; (John 8:31) But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any [man] pluck them out of my hand. (John 10:26-29) And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. (Matthew 7:26-27) The outright foolishness of Christians cannot be denied, Jesus rebukes today’s ‘adherents’ who boldly call themselves “Christian”. But in vain they do worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men. (Matthew 15:9) And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? (Luke 6:46) \\"I do not accept praise from men, (John 5:41) The authentic Hadith says: I heard the Prophet saying, \\"Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians praised the son of Mary, for I am only a Slave. So, call me the Slave of Allah and His Apostle.\\" Narrated 'Umar Bukhari, Muhammad, \\"Sahih Bukhari\\", Kitab Bhavan, New Delhi, India, 1987, translated by M. Khan, Volume 4, Book 55, Number 654. The Holy Quran says: Say: \\"O people of the Book! exceed not in your religion the bounds (of what is proper), trespassing beyond the truth, nor follow the vain desires of people who went wrong in times gone by,- who misled many, and strayed (themselves) from the even way. (5:77) From those, too, who call themselves Christians, We did take a covenant, but they forgot a good part of the message that was sent them: so we estranged them, with enmity and hatred between the one and the other, to the day of judgment. And soon will Allah show them what it is they have done. (5:14) The Jews call 'Uzair a son of Allah, and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah. That is a saying from their mouth; (in this) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. Allah's curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the Truth! (9:30) As stated earlier, the teachings of Jesus were based on the Law, yet the Law is rejected by Christians today, so how could they be called Christians? Moreover, the “Christians” do not follow the Gospel of Jesus; they follow the Gospel of Paul. The Nazarenes and Ebionties were followers of Jesus’ Gospel, which no longer exists today. Nevertheless, the “Christians” of today are not implementing the teachings of their “lord and savior” (see John 8:31) The Nazarenes/Ebionites never degraded Jesus by calling him “lord and savior”; they considered him a great Prophet and Messenger. There is so much diversity and clash, so much chaos, in the Christian Church today that the old idea of a unified or systematic Christian truth has gone. For this, the ecumenical movement is too late. What has happened is that the Christian world has moved into that situation of open variety, of optional alternatives. It would seem no longer possible for anyone to be told or even to imagine that he can be told, what it means or should mean, formally and generically, to be a Christian. He must decide for himself and only for himself (Christianity on Trial, I, Colin Chapman, pp. 51-52) The act of affirming what is in the Old Testament, and the gospels for that matter, and at the same time affirming belief in the doctrine of Trinity, is perhaps the greatest illustration of the exercise of doublethink within Christianity today. Thus the logic of the established Church’s metaphysic, based on doctrines which were not taught by Jesus, obscures not only the nature of Jesus, but also the Divine Unity. The metaphysic of Christianity today is totally opposed to the metaphysic which Jesus brought. The physical aspect of what Jesus brought, his code of behaviour, is today irrecoverably lost. To live as Jesus lived is to understand his message, yet there is virtually no existing record of how Jesus behaved. And what little knowledge exists is often ignored. The most fundamental act of Jesus was that of worship of the Creator, the whole purpose for which man was created. Yet it is evident that no Christian today makes the same acts of worship which Jesus made. Jesus usually prayed in the morning, at mid-day, and in the evening. The exact form of his prayer is no longer extant, but it known that is was based on the prayer which Moses was given. Jesus said that he had come to uphold the law and not to destroy it one jot or one tithe. Jesus was educated in the synagogue in Jerusalem from the age of twelve. He preached in the synagogue. He used to keep the synagogue clean. No Christian today can be found performing these actions. How many Christians have even been circumcised in the manner that Jesus was? The services now held in today’s churches were developed long after Jesus had disappeared. Many of them come directly from the pagan Graeco-Roman mythological rites. The prayers they use are not the prayers which Jesus made. The hymns they sing are not the praises which Jesus sung. Due to the innovations of Paul and his followers, there is no revealed teaching left as to what to eat and what not to eat. Anyone given a “Christian education” today eats what he feels like. Yet Jesus and his true followers only ate kosher meat and were forbidden to eat pig’s flesh. The last meal Jesus is known to have eaten before his disappearance was the Passover meal. No Christian today celebrates this longstanding Jewish tradition to which Jesus so meticulously held. (Muhammad Ataur-Raheem, Jesus, Prophet of Islam, pp. 199-200) In the preceding arguments, I have inquired into some of the fundamental doctrines of Christianity; the examination has led me to the conclusion that the dogmas of the Trinity, the Divinity of Jesus, the Divine-Sonship, the Original Sin and Atonement are neither rational nor in conformity with the teachings of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). These dogmas came into being and were due to pagan influences. They show that Christianity has departed considerably from the religion of Jesus. (A.D. Ajijola states in his book “The Myth of the Cross”) Unfortunately, the observance of Jesus is not possible today because his teachings have been seriously corrupted and altered. The scholars of “Christianity” admit that they do not possess the original manuscripts from which we can derive the authentic words of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). Hence, the only way to follow Jesus today is by following Islam: He who follows Prophet Muhammad automatically follows the true Jesus: “The guidance imparted through the Prophets of the past was not complete. Every Prophet was followed by another who effected alterations and additions in the teachings and injunctions of his predecessors and, in this way, the chain of reform and progress continued. That is why the teachings of the earlier Prophets, after the lapse of time, were lost in oblivion. Obviously there was no need to preserve the earlier teachings when amended and improved guidance had taken their place. At last the most perfect code of guidance was imparted to mankind through Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) and all previous codes were automatically abrogated, for it is futile and imprudent to follow an incomplete code when the complete code exists. He who follows Muhammad (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) follows all the Prophets, for whatever was good and eternally workable in their teachings has been embodied in his teachings. Whoever, therefore, rejects and refuses to follow Muhammad’s (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) teachings, and chooses to follow some other Prophet, only deprives himself of that vast amount of useful and valuable instruction and guidance which is embodied in Muhammad’s (blessings of Allah and peace be upon him) teachings, which never existed in the books of the earlier Prophets and which was revealed only through the Last of the Prophets” (Towards Understanding Islam, Mawdudi, p. 79) Most Greek-speaking authors heard these traditions in the Aramaic vernacular and committed them to writing in Greek. None of these writings is dated prior to the year 70 C.E.; there is not a single instance in these works where the author has cited an authority for an event or maxim attributed to Jesus (peace be upon him) in order that we might construct a chain of transmission. Furthermore, even their works have not survived.","completion":"**Critical Examination of Pauline Christianity** The figure of Paul stands prominently as a significant, if controversial, personality in Christian history. Often accredited with founding Christianity, Paul is perceived by some to have deviated from Jesus's original teachings, supplanting the message with his interpretation. Jesus's teachings were rooted in unconditional obedience to God—akin to Islamic. He embraced practices of previous prophets: fasting, prayer, avoiding pork and wine. Paul, conversely, is accused of nullifying these laws, advocating for faith alone as the path to salvation. Biblical narratives and the Epistle of James challenge the faith-alone doctrine, emphasizing the necessity of righteous actions alongside faith: - James 2:17, 21-22, 24, 26 reference the interdependence of faith and works. The Quran further iterates this concept, asserting that belief and good deeds act as the foundation for salvation (Quran 2:277, 2:177, 5:12, 2:25, 2:13) and mandates practices like fasting (Quran 2:83). Physical acts of worship (prayers) documented within both Islamic texts and the Bible underline a tradition of devotion through action apparent in the lives of various prophets (Quran 2:125, 9:112 and Psalms 95:6, Genesis 24:48, Exodus 4:31, among others). Paul's approach conflicts with Jesus's own adherence to Jewish Law (Torah). Jesus preached consistent law observance (Matthew 5:17-20, 23:1-3), while Paul's epistles indicate he perceived the Law as superseded by faith in Christ (Romans 10:9, 1 Corinthians 9:19). Prominent philosophers and scholars critique Paul for seemingly inventing doctrines like original sin and divine atonement, alien to Jesus's teachings. Critics charge Paul with transforming Christianity into a religion far removed from Jesus's monotheistic teachings, thereby earning labels like \\"anti-Christ\\" or the corruption of the Gospel. The existence of contradictions between Jesus's teachings and Paul's doctrine is exemplified by: - Paul's declaration of the abolishment of the Law (Ephesians 2:14) vs. Jesus's affirmation of fulfilling it (Matthew 5:17-20). Moreover, Paul's mission diverged from that of the original disciples, as suggested by Romans 15:20, representing a new foundation different from the one Jesus laid. James, Jesus's brother, headed the Jerusalem Church, observing a stricter adherence to the Law than the later Pauline Christianity that emerged post Jewish War. The Quran speaks against excessive praise of Jesus, aligning with prophetic traditions in Islam. It warns against straying into embellishment in religion (Quran 5:77, 5:14, 9:30). The argument holds that if Christians today do not follow the Mosaic Law Jesus upheld or the practices he observed, they cannot be reckoned as true followers of Jesus. Instead, they are seen as adherents to a later formation—Pauline Christianity, often devoid of the actions prescribed by the Mosaic Law and the Gospels, culminating in what some see as the antinomian tendencies and theological departures from the teachings of Jesus. The Hadith and Quran urge believers to follow the path of Jesus without exaggeration or deification, maintaining the oneness of God and the messengership of Jesus without elevating him to divine status. In sum, the critique of Pauline Christianity hinges upon its perceived deviation from Jesus's teachings, encompassing both doctrinal content and practical observance of the Law. The narrative suggests a return to the message of Jesus is paramount; a return many argue is found in the teachings of Islam, which claims to fulfill and preserve the essence of past revelations, including the message of Jesus."},{"prompt":"Оригинальный сюжет игры Ben and Ed: Игра “Ben and Ed” - это трехмерный платформер, где игрок управляет зомби по имени Эд, который должен преодолевать множество препятствий и ловушек, чтобы спасти своего лучшего друга, мальчика по имени Бен.

SCIENCE CITY – DAYLIGHT A futuristic city where nature and technology intersect. Solar panels and green spaces blend with sleek buildings. Digital billboards highlight recent innovations in fields like biotech. This urban landscape evokes a familiar modernity. INT. GENESIS LABORATORY – CONTINUOUS QUICK CUT TO: We focus on EDWARD “ED” KAYNES (30s), an intense scientist absorbed in his work, surrounded by beeping monitors and bubbling beakers. ED (with enthusiastic determination) Today we make history, my friends! Let’s push the boundaries of what’s possible! INT. GENESIS LABORATORY – NIGHTFALL ED caresses Maria, lost in her eyes. ED (tenderly) With you by my side, I feel like we can change the world. ED (thoughtfully) Just imagine how many lives we could improve…how many diseases we could cure. This discovery could give people hope. CUT TO: MARIA (smiling warmly) One step at a time, my love. I know you want to help so many people. MARIA (squeezing his hand) Together we’ll reveal wonders. They share a lingering kiss before turning to the window overlooking the moonlit city. CUT TO: END PAGE 1 OF 150 PAGE 2 OF 150 INT. GENESIS LABORATORY - ED’S LAB – DAY The clinical hum of lab machinery mixes with muted discussions from ED’s team, immersed in intense work. DR. EDWARD “ED” KAYNES (30s), observes confidently amidst the activity. ED (to his team) The future is in our hands. By nightfall, we’ll see if we can control it. MARIA, Ed’s wife, watches the reanimated rat uneasily. MARIA (shocked) Ed… are you sure about this? Maria meets Ed’s gaze as he draws the injection. Promise and peril shimmer within. Нe injects the rat - it springs to alarming life. Gasps around the lab. TEAM MEMBER #1 (troubled) We’ve disrupted nature’s course. What have we done? ED (solemnly) There’s no going back now. We have unleashed something beyond our control. Night envelopes the city as they depart the lab, sealing Pandora’s box with a tense kiss - flawed creators of a warped legacy. END PAGE 2 OF 150 PAGE 3 OF 150 INT. GENESIS CONFERENCE HALL – DAY EDWARD “ED” KAYNES stands confidently at the podium before an audience of scientists and investors. Behind him footage shows a rat bursting with youthful energy after being injected with his revolutionary “Elixir of Eternal Life.” ED (speaking fervently) My friends, we stand at the cusp of a monumental breakthrough - one that could significantly expand the limits of human longevity. Much work still lies ahead, but we have unlocked promising possibilities. Murmurs ripple through the room. DR. ALLEN rises, looking doubtful. DR. ALLEN (cautiously) Dr. Kaynes, your claims about “eternal life” sound too good to be true. What precautions are you taking to prevent unintended consequences? ED (making eye contact) We appreciate your questions. Safety is our priority - guiding each phase with care. MARIA joins Ed at the podium, her eyes shining with optimism. MARIA (supportively) Just imagine if more people could fulfill their life’s purpose. If we could give that gift of time - to nurture their dreams and strengthen bonds with loved ones. Thunderous applause erupts, though some still look uneasy. ED and MARIA stand united yet vulnerable, poised between revelatory success or devastating failure. An immense legacy hangs in the balance. END PAGE 3 OF 150 PAGE 4 OF 150 INT. ED AND MARIA’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Ed pours two glasses of wine. He hands one to Maria, their fingers brush with the exchange. A spark of connection in their touch. MARIA (lifting her glass in a toast) Here’s to us and turning dreams into reality! ED (takes his glass and gazes affectionately) Maria, love…your presence fills my world with joy. MARIA (smiles warmly, touching his arm) You support me through all the ups and downs. I couldn’t wish for a better partner than you. Maria turns on gentle music and pulls Ed close. MARIA (embraces him for a dance) Dance with me…? She lays her head on his shoulder, and they begin to slow dance. MARIA (eyes closed, lost in the moment) Just you and me before chaos erupts. Ed tightens his embrace, finding comfort in the closeness. ED (his voice soft, a whisper in her hair) Whatever comes, we’ll face it together. Maria looks up into Ed’s eyes, searching for reassurance. MARIA (a hint of worry) Our creation…have we erred? What if it destroys this city we love? Ed strokes her face, offering solace in his touch. ED (gazes deeply, with a reassuring softness) The future awaits, undefined. Each choice impacts what happens next. But know this… He pauses, his gaze warming. ED (LOVINGLY) No matter what happens, we have each other. He pulls her closer until their eyes are just inches apart. ED (softly) I love you, Maria… He kisses her tenderly. She returns his kiss, running her fingers through his hair. The music and lights gently fade as they get lost in each other’s embrace, their worries momentarily forgotten in the passion of this perfect moment together. END PAGE 4 OF 150 PAGE 5 OF 150 INT. GENESIS LABORATORY - ED’S LAB - DEEP NIGHT The lab’s stillness is shattered by blaring SECURITY ALARMS. Red WARNING LIGHTS flash wildly as EDWARD “ED” KAYNES stares in horror at a monitor showing something unbelievable. ED (into phone, urgent) Code red! The test subject - it’s alive again! Send alerts now! VOICE ON PHONE (shocked) Revived? What’s going on? ED (yelling in panic) It escaped its cage somehow! We must contain that rat before this gets worse! Get all available staff here now! (more shaken) We’ve created a monster…I fear this outbreak is only the beginning… Alarms continue blasting. The lab, once representing human progress, feels threatening. ED watches security footage showing the reanimated rat escaping, movements erratic and ominous. An alarm beats steadily like the ticking of a timebomb. The silence in between Poundingly loud. It’s the quiet before chaos unleashes across the city. Before the dead walk. END PAGE 5 OF 150 PAGE 6 OF 150 INT. GENESIS LAB – RESEARCH FLOOR – DAY The urgent rhythm of GENESIS Lab mirrors the fast pace of SCIENCE CITY outside.

Natsuki should've been here by now!\\" MC: \\"I haven't heard anything from her at all.\\" Yuri: \\"Maybe she just overslept or something?\\" (I couldn't help but feel a sense of concern. Natsuki's usually so punctual. I put a protective hand on my belly, feeling the movements of the three babies that MC and I would welcome into the world soon.

Do you think we should check on her, maybe?\\" MC nodded. \\"That might be a good idea. Just to make sure she's all right. I could text her again.\\" I watched as MC took out their phone, the light concern in their eyes betraying a calm exterior. It was a trait I found both enduring and resonant with my own feelings. With our impending parenthood, our sense of responsibility and care for those around us seemed to have magnified. As I looked back at my club members, my hand absentmindedly smoothed over my rounded belly, a silent promise to keep our little ones safe just as we intended to ensure Natsuki's safety. Sayori jumped up suddenly, her chair scraping back against the floorboards. \\"You know what? Why don't we all go and check on Natsuki? It'll be like a little field trip!

I couldn’t wish for a better partner than you. Maria turns on gentle music and pulls Ed close. MARIA (embraces him for a dance) Dance with me…? She lays her head on his shoulder, and they begin to slow dance. MARIA (eyes closed, lost in the moment) Just you and me before chaos erupts. Ed tightens his embrace, finding comfort in the closeness. ED (his voice soft, a whisper in her hair) Whatever comes, we’ll face it together. Maria looks up into Ed’s eyes, searching for reassurance. MARIA (a hint of worry) Our creation…have we erred? What if it destroys this city we love? Ed strokes her face, offering solace in his touch. ED (gazes deeply, with a reassuring softness) The future awaits, undefined. Each choice impacts what happens next. But know this… He pauses, his gaze warming. ED (LOVINGLY) No matter what happens, we have each other. He pulls her closer until their eyes are just inches apart. ED (softly) I love you, Maria… He kisses her tenderly. She returns his kiss, running her fingers through his hair.

Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Шторм наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби.

Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами.

Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм “RUN ZOMBIE, RUN” показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии.

Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю.

I couldn’t wish for a better partner than you. Maria turns on gentle music and pulls Ed close. MARIA (embraces him for a dance) Dance with me…? She lays her head on his shoulder, and they begin to slow dance. MARIA (eyes closed, lost in the moment) Just you and me before chaos erupts. Ed tightens his embrace, finding comfort in the closeness. ED (his voice soft, a whisper in her hair) Whatever comes, we’ll face it together. Maria looks up into Ed’s eyes, searching for reassurance. MARIA (a hint of worry) Our creation…have we erred? What if it destroys this city we love? Ed strokes her face, offering solace in his touch. ED (gazes deeply, with a reassuring softness) The future awaits, undefined. Each choice impacts what happens next. But know this… He pauses, his gaze warming. ED (LOVINGLY) No matter what happens, we have each other. He pulls her closer until their eyes are just inches apart. ED (softly) I love you, Maria… He kisses her tenderly. She returns his kiss, running her fingers through his hair. The music and lights gently fade as they get lost in each other’s embrace, their worries momentarily forgotten in the passion of this perfect moment together. END PAGE 4 OF 150 PAGE 5 OF 150 INT.

La médiane est une mesure de tendance centrale qui partage la série en deux parties égales lorsque les données sont ordonnées. La médiane correspond à la valeur qui se trouve au centre de la série une fois celle-ci ordonnée. Si la série comporte un nombre impair de valeurs, la médiane est simplement la valeur centrale. Si la série comporte un nombre pair de valeurs, la médiane est habituellement calculée comme la moyenne des deux valeurs centrales. Voici les étapes générales pour calculer la médiane d'une série discrète : 1. Ordonnez les valeurs de la variable en ordre croissant. 2. Déterminez le nombre total de données (N). 3. Si N est impair, la médiane est la valeur qui se trouve en position [(N+1)/2]. 4. Si N est pair, la médiane est la moyenne des valeurs qui se trouvent aux positions [N/2] et [(N/2)+1]. Il est important de noter que, contrairement à la moyenne, la médiane n'est pas influencée par les valeurs extrêmes (valeurs très petites ou très grandes) et représente donc souvent une meilleure mesure de la tendance centrale pour les distributions asymétriques."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

It's like you're already imagining their personalities.\\" Yuri: \\"Indeed. It's quite endearing to think each child will carry a different essence of magic with them. But back to the matter at hand, we should probably try to reach Natsuki. It isn't like her to miss club meetings without notice.\\" MC: \\"I agree. I'll give her a call. Meanwhile, why don't we start today's session? We can share poems while we wait, and catch Natsuki up when she arrives.\\" Sayori: \\"Sounds good! And, I have the perfect poem for today. It's all about new beginnings and the excitement of the unknown, kind of like how we feel about becoming parents.\\" Monika: \\"That's perfect, Sayori. Let's hear it.\\" (The mood in the clubroom lightens as the members share their work, filling the space with words and emotions. MC steps out to make the call, hoping for a simple explanation to Natsuki's absence. The group carries on, trusting that their friend is safe and will join them soon.)"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “This is ridiculous! Natsuki should’ve been here by now!” MC: “I haven’t heard anything from her at all.” Yuri: “Maybe she just overslept or something?” (I couldn’t help but feel a sense of concern. Natsuki’s usually so punctual. I put a protective hand on my belly, feeling the movements of the three babies that MC and I would welcome into the world soon. We were naming them “Shinwa”, “Jinsei”, and “Desu” after the three spirit schools of the game “Wizard101” - Shinwa meaning “Myth”, Jinsei meaning “Life”, and Desu meaning “Death”. It’s at that moment MC noticed me gently feeling the babies move.) MC: “How are they doing today, Sayori? I still can’t believe we’re going to have triplets. Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu… They’ll have the most unique names in their class for sure.” Sayori: “They’re quite active today! It feels like they know we’re talking about them. I can’t wait to meet them and see which one takes after which school the most. I like to think Shinwa will be creative and clever, Jinsei nurturing and kind, and Desu… well, maybe a little mysterious and strong-willed?” Monika: “Those are such interesting choices for names. It’s like you’re already imagining their personalities.”","completion":"Yuri: \\"It's quite charming, really. Each name carries with it an archetype, a potential path of character. It's rather poetic.\\" (MC smiled at the conversation, but I could see his expression shift back to concern about Natsuki. He glanced at the door once more, his worry mirroring that of Monika.) MC: \\"I hope Natsuki's alright, though. It's not like her to be this late without a word.\\" (Monika stood up, her fingers drumming on the tabletop. She had that look in her eyes—the one she gets when she's made up her mind about doing something.) Monika: \\"I'm going to message her. We can't just sit around and wait; if there's something wrong, it's better to know.\\" (Yuri nodded in agreement while fidgeting with the sleeve of her sweater, clearly anxious about our friend's absence.) Yuri: \\"Please let us know if you receive any response, Monika. And if there is any manner in which we can assist Natsuki, do inform us.\\" (As Monika tapped out a message on her phone to Natsuki, I felt a playful kick from one of the triplets. I couldn't help but laugh—a moment of lightness amidst the concern for our friend.) Sayori: \\"Even now, they're reminding us to stay hopeful. I'm sure Natsuki's fine; she's tough, after all.\\" (MC squeezed my hand in quiet support, his eyes still on the doorway but his smile reassuring.) MC: \\"Yeah, and we're all here for each other, no matter what. That's what makes this literature club so special.\\" (The room held a balance of emotions, the joy of future lives and the solidarity of friends united. We all hoped for Natsuki's safe return, the next page of our club's story yet to be written.)"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “This is ridiculous!

You seem uncomfortable.\\" Sayori: \\"Oh, it's nothing too worrisome. Just some cramps. They've been happening a bit more frequently lately.\\" Monika: (Looking concerned) \\"Have you spoken to your doctor about the cramps? It's important to keep an eye on any discomfort during pregnancy, especially with triplets.\\" Sayori: \\"Yeah, the doctor said it's normal as long as it doesn’t get too severe. I'm due for another check-up soon anyway.\\" MC: (Placing a hand gently over Sayori's) \\"We can leave early today and get you rested at home. We should prioritize your well-being and the babies'. Natsuki wouldn't want you to push yourself either.\\" Monika: (Nodding in agreement) \\"Absolutely. Your health and the babies' come first. I'll message Natsuki to see if she's alright and let her know that we're concerned. Maybe she just had an emergency situation at home.\\" Yuri: \\"In the meantime, I could make you some herbal tea. I've read that certain blends can be soothing during pregnancy. Of course, I'll make sure it's one that's safe for you and the babies.\\" Sayori: \\"Thank you, everyone. I just hope Natsuki is fine too. She's really strong, but it's unlike her not to send a message if she's running late.\\" (As MC takes Sayori's hand, they decide to cut the meeting short to ensure Sayori can rest, maintaining a watchful eye for any signs of labor, given the close proximity to the due date for their triplets, who were named to reflect something meaningful to both of them. They also made a mental note to have Sayori’s cramps checked, to be absolutely safe for the upcoming birth.)"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “This is ridiculous!

You're at a pretty advanced stage of your pregnancy, after all. Shall I get you some water or anything?\\" Monika: \\"Sayori, maybe you should sit down for a bit.

It's best to be prepared.\\" (Sayori nods, gripping MC's hand tightly as they both patiently wait for the doctor's advice. She feels a mix of nervousness and excitement at the thought that she might be meeting her babies very soon. The literature clubroom, usually filled with the laughter of friends and the rustling of pages, is now a scene of supportive concern and anticipation.)"},{"prompt":"Оригинальный сюжет игры Ben and Ed: Игра \\"Ben and Ed\\" - это трехмерный платформер, где игрок управляет зомби по имени Эд, который должен преодолевать множество препятствий и ловушек, чтобы спасти своего лучшего друга, мальчика по имени Бен.

Он осторожно входит в опустевшее здание, настораживаясь при каждом шорохе. Пустые коридоры и классы наполнены тяжелым молчанием и зомби, бродящими среди парт. Эд тщательно их избегает, ища любые знаки нахождения своих детей, но увы, не находит никаких следов. Понимая, что власти рано или поздно начнут действовать, он спешно отправляется к своему бункеру, где он может укрыться и спланировать следующие шаги. Следующая сцена показывает Эда, уже внутри бункера, где он прячется от возможных поисков правительством.

Эд борется, чтобы встать на колени, его дыхание тяжелое, а каждый вздох наполнен болью и усталостью. На теле Эда видны следы его физической и ментальной борьбы; кожа на руках покрывается странными отметинами, знаками его зомби-состояния. Но он не сдается, толкаемый инстинктом выживания и любовью к своей семье, которую он должен найти вне зависимости от своего нового облика. Фонари аварийного освещения мигают в последнем акте отчаяния, когда Эд, собирая остатки сил, начинает осматривать бункер в поисках инструментов и предметов, которые помогут ему добраться до коммуникационного оборудования. Он нащупывает тяжелый кусок металла, который может послужить орудием для пролома стены или двери. Каждый его шаг громыхает по металлическому полу, создавая дополнительный шум в тишине, которая теперь царит в бункере. Эд начинает использовать найденный металлический предмет в качестве лома, упорно пытаясь открыть запертый люк в стене бункера.

Much work still lies ahead, but we have unlocked promising possibilities. Murmurs ripple through the room. DR. ALLEN rises, looking doubtful. DR. ALLEN (cautiously) Dr. Kaynes, your claims about \\"eternal life\\" sound too good to be true. What precautions are you taking to prevent unintended consequences? ED (making eye contact) We appreciate your questions. Safety is our priority - guiding each phase with care. MARIA joins Ed at the podium, her eyes shining with optimism. MARIA (supportively) Just imagine if more people could fulfill their life's purpose. If we could give that gift of time - to nurture their dreams and strengthen bonds with loved ones. Thunderous applause erupts, though some still look uneasy. ED and MARIA stand united yet vulnerable, poised between revelatory success or devastating failure. An immense legacy hangs in the balance.

I couldn’t wish for a better partner than you. Maria turns on gentle music and pulls Ed close. MARIA (embraces him for a dance) Dance with me…? She lays her head on his shoulder, and they begin to slow dance. MARIA (eyes closed, lost in the moment) Just you and me before chaos erupts. Ed tightens his embrace, finding comfort in the closeness. ED (his voice soft, a whisper in her hair) Whatever comes, we’ll face it together. Maria looks up into Ed’s eyes, searching for reassurance. MARIA (a hint of worry) Our creation…have we erred? What if it destroys this city we love? Ed strokes her face, offering solace in his touch. ED (gazes deeply, with a reassuring softness) The future awaits, undefined. Each choice impacts what happens next. But know this… He pauses, his gaze warming. ED (LOVINGLY) No matter what happens, we have each other. He pulls her closer until their eyes are just inches apart. ED (softly) I love you, Maria… He kisses her tenderly. She returns his kiss, running her fingers through his hair. The music and lights gently fade as they get lost in each other's embrace, their worries momentarily forgotten in the passion of this perfect moment together. END PAGE 4 OF 150 PAGE 5 OF 150 INT.

Let’s push boundaries and make the impossible possible! MARIA (mid-30s), equally brilliant and Ed’s confidant, locks her gaze with his, acknowledging their shared dream. MARIA (buzzing with excitement) Oh Ed, I can hardly wait for the grand reveal! This could truly revolutionize healthcare as we know it! ED I know my love...just imagine the possibilities if we succeed! We'll go down in history! CUT TO: INT. GENESIS LAB - HALLWAY – CONTINUOUS Ed leads Maria down the hallway at an eager pace. MARIA (awed yet uneasy) Monumental, Ed...yet are we ready for the immense responsibility? This discovery could unsettle humanity’s trajectory – for better or worse. ED All discovery comes with responsibility. But together we can handle whatever comes our way! Their exchange – equal parts marvel and foreboding – flows amidst the DISSONANCE of progress. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SCIENCE CITY SKYLINE - DAY TO NIGHT MONTAGE The city pulses with industrial ORDER and organic LIFE... MARIA (V.O.)

Players may want to skip dialogue for a variety of reasons, such as when replaying the game, when they find the conversation uninteresting, or when they are more interested in action and exploration than in the storyline. Here are several methods to skip dialogue in an interesting, natural manner without sacrificing the player's understanding of the game's story or mechanics: 1. **Branching Dialogue with Summaries**: When players attempt to skip a dialogue, you could present a condensed summary of the crucial points they would miss, allowing players to stay informed with the plot or any important instructions without listening to the entire conversation. 2. **Fast-Forward Mechanism**: Instead of skipping dialogue altogether, offer a fast-forward button that speeds up the conversation, allowing players to get the gist of it without completely missing it. Think of how subtitles might rapidly flash on the screen to give a sense of the conversation. 3. **Expressive Animations and Visual Cues**: Enhance the NPC dialogue scenes with expressive character animations and visual cues that can convey emotions and key points without needing full dialogue. This makes even a skimmed conversation engaging and informative. 4. **In-Game Journal**: Automatically update the player's in-game journal with essential information whenever they skip dialogue. This way, they can revisit the key points at their leisure without having to listen to the whole conversation. 5. **Contextual Skipping**: Allow for natural skipping where, based on the context or previous knowledge of the character, certain dialogue becomes skippable. For instance, if an NPC starts repeating information, give players the prompt to skip to new information only. 6. **Keyword Highlighting**: Highlight important names, places, or objectives in the dialogue text so that even if the player skips through the conversation quickly, they’ll catch the essential parts. 7. **Voice Tone and Volume Changes**: Adjust the NPC's voice tone and volume to reflect the importance of certain dialogue passages. When a player chooses to skip, significant messages could still be delivered in a different tone or louder volume briefly before skipping entirely. 8. **Dialogue Minigames**: Introduce a mini-game or interaction mechanic where players can choose to engage actively during dialogue, such as by choosing the right moment to interject with a question or to show their character's reactions. This keeps engagement high, and successful interactions could shorten or reshape the conversation based on player input. Remember, the key to successfully implementing dialogue skipping is to ensure that players who choose to do so don't miss out on vital information needed to fully understand the game. To that end, it’s important to conduct playtesting with a variety of players to fine-tune these dialogue systems so they fulfill the desires of different player types without compromising narrative integrity."},{"prompt":"write lines the player character could say when skipping dialogue.","completion":"When implementing dialogue skipping into a 3D RPG game, it's crucial to maintain immersion and character consistency. The player character's lines when skipping dialogue should be brief and reflect their personality and the situation. Below are some examples of lines a player character could say to naturally transition out of a conversation: 1. **Impatient Heroine**: \\"Let's cut to the chase – what do I need to do?\\" 2. **Wise Sage**: \\"I believe I understand the essence of your words. Let us proceed.\\" 3. **Brash Warrior**: \\"Enough talk! Where's the action?\\" 4. **Curious Scholar**: \\"Fascinating, but could you summarize the key points?\\" 5. **Jaded Mercenary**: \\"I've heard enough. The bottom line, please?\\" 6. **Kind-hearted Healer**: \\"I appreciate your stories, but time is of the essence.\\" 7. **Sarcastic Rogue**: \\"Can we skip to the part where this benefits me?\\" 8. **Royal Diplomat**: \\"I must attend to the matters at hand. Please be brief.\\" 9. **Battle-worn Veteran**: \\"Save the details for later. What's the objective?\\" 10. **Eager Adventurer**: \\"Got it! Can't wait to get started – where to first?\\" 11. **Reluctant Chosen One**: \\"Right, I think I've got the gist of it... Time to go, yeah?\\" 12. **Mystical Seer**: \\"The winds of fate beckon. Pray, provide me with the summary.\\" 13. **Driven Scientist**: \\"Theoretical ramifications aside, what are the practical steps?\\" 14. **Stoic Guardian**: \\"I need just the facts. Our focus must remain sharp.\\" 15. **Lighthearted Jester**: \\"And the moral of the story is... Skip to the end, friend!\\" Feel free to customize these lines to the character's voice and the game's tone. It is important that these lines are not seen as dismissive or rude - unless that is in character - but rather as a natural, character-driven way to accelerate the conversation."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “This is ridiculous!

Natsuki’s usually so punctual. I put a protective hand on my belly, feeling the movements of the three babies that MC and I would welcome into the world soon.

Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу “Rundead”: • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу “Rundead” и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм “RUN ZOMBIE, RUN” показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает. 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву. 1. Описание мира и введение Эда (5 страниц): Часть 1: Описание мира (Первая страница) Экстерьер. Научный городок. День.

Natsuki should’ve been here by now!” MC: “I haven’t heard anything from her at all.” Yuri: “Maybe she just overslept or something?” (I couldn’t help but feel a sense of concern. Natsuki’s usually so punctual. I put a protective hand on my belly, feeling the movements of the three babies that MC and I would welcome into the world soon. We were naming them “Shinwa”, “Jinsei”, and “Desu” after the three spirit schools of the game “Wizard101” - Shinwa meaning “Myth”, Jinsei meaning “Life”, and Desu meaning “Death”. However, I was feeling some cramps at the time. It’s at this moment that Yuri notices me rubbing my belly.) Yuri: “Sayori, are you feeling alright? You seem to be in discomfort.” Sayori: “I’m okay, just some cramps. It’s probably nothing, but they’re more intense than usual.” MC: “Hey, maybe you should take it easy. You’re at a pretty advanced stage of your pregnancy, after all. Shall I get you some water or anything?” (MC gently puts a hand on mine as Jinsei - the most active of our babies - starts to kick.) Sayori: (smiling weakly) “Water would be nice, thank you, MC.” (MC rushes out of the room to get some water. Monika, meanwhile, seems caught between managing her concern for me and the absence of Natsuki.) Monika: “Okay everyone, let’s remain calm. We’ll reach out to Natsuki’s family to make sure she’s okay. In the meantime, let’s make sure Sayori is comfortable. Yuri, can you please help with that?” (Yuri nods and moves closer to me with a concerned look.) Yuri: “Is there a particular spot where we could make you more comfortable? Maybe we could get some pillows to support your back.” Sayori: “Some extra pillows would be really nice, Yuri. Thank you.” (Yuri quickly gathers some cushions from around the clubroom and arranges them on the couch for me to lean against. I take a seat and try to find a position that eases the cramping. The movements in my belly seem to calm down a little with the gentle pressure.) (Yuri now turns to Monika and speaks in a lower voice, hoping I wouldn’t overhear their concerned conversation.) Yuri: “Monika, should we consider calling a doctor? Sayori’s discomfort might be more significant than we’re assuming.” Monika: (looks at me with a serious expression) “Yes, that might be necessary. But let’s not worry her just yet. Once MC is back with the water, we should talk it over with him first.” (MC returns with a glass of water and hands it to me.) MC: “Here you go, Sayori. Drink slowly. How are you feeling now?” Sayori: “A little better, thanks. The pillows help, and the water is refreshing.” (MC takes a seat beside me, holding my hand. He glances at Monika and Yuri with a look that suggests he’s seeking guidance. Just then, I felt a sudden warmth moving down my legs.

According to Matthew and Mark, Jesus said that all foods are clean, but the Jewish Law clearly prohibits the consumption of pork! Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. (Matthew 15:11) \\"Are you so dull?\\" he asked. \\"Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.\\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods \\"clean.\\") He went on: \\"What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' (Mark 7:18-20) Notice how the deceptive editors placed a note (in brackets) claiming that Jesus made all foods clean. This is clearly false, and Jesus never uttered these words. The Gospels were written under the influence of Paul, who rejected the Jewish Law (Hebrews 5:13, Galatians 3:13) The Gentile writers fabricated these words to make Jesus say that all foods are clean, thus supporting the Pauline doctrine. According to Matthew 5:17-20, Matthew 23:1-3, 23:23, Jesus came to preach the Jewish Law, and what does the Jewish Law say about eating pork? And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he [is] unclean to you. No Images or Hymns Available Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they [are] unclean to you. (Leviticus 11:7-8) And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it [is] unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase. No Images or Hymns Available These ye shall eat of all that [are] in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat: (Deu 14:8-9) The Bible prohibits the eating of pork. Jesus never made permissible the consumption of ‘all’ foods, it was a Pauline innovation by the Gospel writers. The Gnostic leader Marcion (d 140 CE) said that Jewish scribes were corrupting the Gospels by adding Jewish material into them. This proves that the four Gospels were originally composed by Gentile (pagan) writers. Jesus only ate kosher meat and was forbidden to eat pig’s flesh. Jesus said that he had come to uphold the law and not to destroy it one jot or one tithe. Jesus was educated in the synagogue in Jerusalem from the age of twelve. He preached in the synagogue. He used to keep the synagogue clean. No Christian today can be found performing these actions. How many Christians have been even been circumcised in the manner that Jesus was? The services now held in today’s churches were developed long after Jesus had disappeared. Many of them come directly from the pagan Graeco-Roman mythological rites. The prayers they use are not the prayers which Jesus made. The hymns they sing are not the praises which Jesus sung. Due to the innovations of Paul and his followers, there is no revealed teaching left as to what to eat and what not to eat. Anyone given a “Christian education” today eats what he feels like. Yet Jesus and his true followers only ate kosher meat and were forbidden to eat pig’s flesh”. (Jesus, Prophet of Islam, 1992 edition, p. 199-200) The Gospels imply that eating pork is forbidden, since Jesus murdered over 2,000 pigs by drowning them in the sea, and he will destroy the pigs on his Second Coming. And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. (Matthew 8:32, Mark 5:13) Volume 3, Book 34, Number 425: Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, \\"By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, son of Mary (Jesus) will shortly descend amongst you people (Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims ) as a just ruler and will break the Cross and kill the pig and abolish the Jizya (a tax taken from the non-Muslims, who are in the protection, of the Muslim government). Then there will be abundance of money and no-body will accept charitable gifts. (Sahih Bukhari) The Pauline authors did not stop there. The Jewish Law prohibits the consumption of wine (Leviticus 10:9, Proverbs 4:17, 20:1). Yet according to the Gospels, Jesus is made to drink wine, praise wine, and even transform water into wine! Do not drink wine nor strong drink (Leviticus 10:9) Wine [is] a mocker, strong drink [is] raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. (Proverbs 20:1) For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. (Proverbs 4:17) But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble [in] judgment. (Isaiah 28:7) Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. (Joel 1:5) Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. (Hosea 4:11) Jesus is made to praise wine: Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. (Matthew 9:17) Jesus is made to drink wine: Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. (Mark 14:25) Jesus is made to transform water into wine Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare [it]. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, (John 2:7-9) If the Gospels were written by the disciples of Jesus, then the miracle would have been reversed, the transforming of wine into water instead of water into wine. Jesus would never praise wine because it was the poison that caused Noah to get drunk, and Lot to commit incest! The Nazarenes and Ebionites followed the Jewish Law, they abstained from drinking wine. The Ebionites were stigmatized by the Church as heretics who failed to understand that Jesus was a divine person and asserted instead that he was a human being who came to inaugurate a new earthly age, as prophesied by the Jewish prophets of the Bible (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). Moreover, the Ebionites refused to accept the Church doctrine, derived from Paul that Jesus abolished or abrogated the Torah, the Jewish law. Instead, the Ebionites observed the Jewish law and regarded themselves as Jews. The Ebionites were not heretics, as the Church asserted, nor 're-Judaizers', as modern scholars call them, but the authentic successors of the immediate disciples and followers of Jesus, whose views and doctrines they faithfully transmitted, believing correctly that they were derived from Jesus himself. They were the same group that had earlier been called the Nazarenes, who were led by James and Peter, who had known Jesus during his lifetime, and were in a far better position to know his aims than Paul, who met Jesus only in dreams and visions. Thus the opinion held by the Ebionites about Paul is of extraordinary interest and deserves respectful consideration, instead of dismissal as 'scurrilous' propaganda -- the reaction of Christian scholars from ancient to modern times. (Hyam Maccoby, The Myth Maker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity) During the Ascension of Prophet Muhammad to Heaven, he was given a choice between milk and wine. This event occurred before alcohol was prohibited. The Holy Prophet chose the milk: Book 001, Number 0309: It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I was brought al-Buraq Who is an animal white and long, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule, who would place his hoof a distance equal to the range of version. I mounted it and came to the Temple (Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem), then tethered it to the ring used by the prophets. I entered the mosque and prayed two rak'ahs in it, and then came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriel said: You have chosen the natural thing. Then he took me to heaven… (Sahih Muslim) According to the Bible, the Prophet Noah got drunk! (God forbid) And Noah began [to be] an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. (Genesis 9:20-25) Prophet Lot commits incest from wine (God forbid) Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, [and] lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. (Genesis 19:33-26) Although these stories are false because they teaches blasphemy against the holy Prophets Noah and Lot, they still convey a moral lesson for mankind that alcohol (wine) is the most dangerous substance that should be rejected by the true followers of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims are the true followers of Jesus because they practice his teachings, the abstinence from alcohol and the consumption of forbidden foods, and they observe fasting. The 12 disciples fasted after Jesus’ departure, and Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims obey their teachings whereas the “Christians” today neglect these laws. Islam, the Kingdom of God, forbids the consumption of alcohol, and purges the society from all social evils. Alcoholic drinks are the only poison that is licensed in many countries. However, Islam took a clear attitude towards alcoholic drinks more than 1400 years ago. Islam prohibits such drinks. Any drink that causes drunkenness is prohibited in Islam regardless of the matter it is made from and regardless of the quantity. According to Islam, if too much of a drink causes drunkenness, then any small quantity of this drink is prohibited, because all alcoholics start with small quantities, and then they become the slaves of alcohol. (Muhammad Ali Alkhuli, The Need For Islam, First Edition 1981, p. 71) This cocktail quality of Western civilization proves that the people of the West are not satisfied with the social structure or the values of their societies and that is why they keep inventing new social trends and ideologies. With this Western chaos of ideologies, how can the ordinary man find mental pace? (ibid, p. 41) Paul, the corrupter of the Gospel, made the drinking of wine permissible (1Timothy 5:23) and the Gospel writers reflected his teaching. Strangely, Paul mentions Noah but says nothing about how he got drunk; he blatantly ignored the story, and allowed the drinking of wine anyways. By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. (Hebrews 11:7) The Pauline Church persecuted the followers of Jesus until they became extinct. Now today, no Christian can be found observing the Jewish Law. Christians reject Judaism and accept the Old Testament simultaneously, and hypocritically quote from it. With the teaching by some, notably Paul, that the laws of the Jews need not to be followed by a Christian, contradictions began to arise between the body of newly-written Scriptures, which later became known as the “New Testament”, and the Old Testament. However, the Old Testament was retained by the established Church in spite of these contradictions, since an outright rejection of the Old Testament would have been regarded by many of the people as a rejection of Jesus himself. Confusion was the inevitable result. In the attempt to accept and reject the Old Testament simultaneously, contradictions arose within the New Testament itself, since it had to be “new” without openly rejecting the old. But, in the early days of the Church, there was no real attempt to formally arrange the books and ensure that all the accounts and doctrines tallied with each other. The leaders of the first Christian communities were free to use their discretion and to refer to those Scriptures which they thought best contained the teachings of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). (Muhammad Ataur-Raheem, Jesus Prophet of Islam, 1992 edition, pp. 46) Jesus misquotes the Old Testament! The Gospels mention the story of how David ate bread “in the days of Abiathar” And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? How he went into the House of GOD in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? (Mark 2:25-26) The passage is misquoting 1 Samuels 21:1-8, it never says David “ate the bread”, and it was during the time of Ahimleach and not Abiathar! According to Matthew 12:5, Jesus refers to the story of how priests “profaned the Sabbath”. Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? (12:5) There is no story of priests “profaning the Sabbath” in the Old Testament. Jesus used this mythical story as an excuse for breaking the Sabbath.","completion":"The Gospels narrate incidents of Jesus appearing to contravene the Torah's laws. In the accounts of Matthew and Mark, Jesus states that all foods are clean, a statement at odds with the Jewish Law's explicit ban on eating pork. Matthew conveys this idea in his Gospel: \\"Not that which enters into the mouth defiles a person, but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a person.\\" (Matthew 15:11) Mark further clarifies this concept: \\"Are you so dull?\\" he [Jesus] asked. \\"Don't you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them? It doesn’t go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body.” (Jesus made all foods clean by saying this.) He added, \\"What comes out of a person is what defiles them.\\" (Mark 7:18-20) However, this interpretation has been contested. Some argue that the insertion in brackets in Mark's Gospel, claiming Jesus declared all foods clean, is incorrect and that Jesus never annulled the dietary laws. They suggest the Gospels were influenced by Pauline theology, which dismisses adherence to the Jewish Law (referenced in Hebrews 5:13 and Galatians 3:13). Contrarily, in Matthew's Gospel, Jesus emphasizes his commitment to the Jewish Law, contradicting the notion that he undermined it. For instance, Jewish dietary law regarding pork is detailed in Leviticus and Deuteronomy: \\"The pig, though it has divided hooves, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you.\\" (Leviticus 11:7-8) \\"Same for the pig: it has divided hooves but doesn’t chew the cud. It’s unclean for you. Don’t eat their meat or touch their remains.\\" (Deuteronomy 14:8) Supporters of this view argue that the depictions of Jesus declaring all foods clean are misleading and postulate that Gentile writers distorted the traditional narrative to align with the Pauline doctrine. Moreover, references to events in the Gospels that indicate Jesus upheld Kosher laws, such as the episode where he causes a herd of pigs to drown (Matthew 8:32, Mark 5:13), are used to support the argument that Jesus abided by Jewish dietary restrictions. In addition, when discussing the consumption of alcohol, particular attention is drawn to verses in the Old Testament warning against the dangers of intoxication, suggesting Jesus would not have encouraged its use (Leviticus 10:9, Proverbs 20:1, Proverbs 4:17, Isaiah 28:7, Joel 1:5, Hosea 4:11). Contradictions between Jesus' words and actions in the Gospels, and the practices and teachings of modern Christianity are pointed out, emphasizing the influence of Paul on diverging from original teachings. Some argue that early sects like the Nazarenes and Ebionites, who followed Jewish Law, are closer to Jesus' genuine teachings, a controversial standpoint discussed by Hyam Maccoby in \\"The Myth Maker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity\\". Furthermore, Islamic tradition is considered to be aligned with the teachings of Jesus according to some interpretations, particularly regarding the rejection of alcohol, as evidenced by a hadith from Sahih Muslim recounting a choice offered to Prophet Muhammad between milk and wine, in which he chooses milk. Lastly, criticisms are voiced regarding the consistency of the Gospels and their fidelity to the Old Testament, including alleged misquotations by Jesus concerning the actions of King David (Mark 2:25-26 vs. 1 Samuel 21:1-8) and the conduct of the priests on the Sabbath (Matthew 12:5). These critiques challenge the perceived unity of the Bible and question the reliability of the New Testament as a reflection of Jesus' teachings and actions."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “This is ridiculous! Natsuki should’ve been here by now!” MC: “I haven’t heard anything from her at all.” Yuri: “Maybe she just overslept or something?” (I couldn’t help but feel a sense of concern. Natsuki’s usually so punctual. I put a protective hand on my belly, feeling the movements of the three babies that MC and I would welcome into the world soon. We were naming them “Shinwa”, “Jinsei”, and “Desu” after the three spirit schools of the game “Wizard101” - Shinwa meaning “Myth”, Jinsei meaning “Life”, and Desu meaning “Death”. However, I was feeling some cramps at the time. It’s at this moment that Yuri notices me rubbing my belly.) Yuri: “Sayori, are you feeling alright? You seem to be in discomfort.” Sayori: “I’m okay, just some cramps. It’s probably nothing, but they’re more intense than usual.” MC: “Hey, maybe you should take it easy. You’re at a pretty advanced stage of your pregnancy, after all. Shall I get you some water or anything?” (MC gently puts a hand on mine as Jinsei - the most active of our babies - starts to kick.) Sayori: (smiling weakly) “Water would be nice, thank you, MC.” (MC rushes out of the room to get some water. Monika, meanwhile, seems caught between managing her concern for me and the absence of Natsuki.) Monika: “Okay everyone, let’s remain calm. We’ll reach out to Natsuki’s family to make sure she’s okay. In the meantime, let’s make sure Sayori is comfortable. Yuri, can you please help with that?” (Yuri nods and moves closer to me with a concerned look.) Yuri: “Is there a particular spot where we could make you more comfortable? Maybe we could get some pillows to support your back.” Sayori: “Some extra pillows would be really nice, Yuri. Thank you.” (Yuri quickly gathers some cushions from around the clubroom and arranges them on the couch for me to lean against. I take a seat and try to find a position that eases the cramping. The movements in my belly seem to calm down a little with the gentle pressure.) (Yuri now turns to Monika and speaks in a lower voice, hoping I wouldn’t overhear their concerned conversation.) Yuri: “Monika, should we consider calling a doctor? Sayori’s discomfort might be more significant than we’re assuming.” Monika: (looks at me with a serious expression) “Yes, that might be necessary. But let’s not worry her just yet. Once MC is back with the water, we should talk it over with him first.” (MC returns with a glass of water and hands it to me.) MC: “Here you go, Sayori. Drink slowly. How are you feeling now?” Sayori: “A little better, thanks. The pillows help, and the water is refreshing.” (MC takes a seat beside me, holding my hand.

Natsuki’s usually so punctual. I put a protective hand on my belly, feeling the movements of the three babies that MC and I would welcome into the world soon. We were naming them “Shinwa”, “Jinsei”, and “Desu” after the three spirit schools of the game “Wizard101” - Shinwa meaning “Myth”, Jinsei meaning “Life”, and Desu meaning “Death”.

You seem to be in discomfort.” Sayori: “I’m okay, just some cramps. It’s probably nothing, but they’re more intense than usual.” MC: “Hey, maybe you should take it easy. You’re at a pretty advanced stage of your pregnancy, after all. Shall I get you some water or anything?” (MC gently puts a hand on mine as Jinsei - the most active of our babies - starts to kick.) Sayori: (smiling weakly) “Water would be nice, thank you, MC.” (MC rushes out of the room to get some water. Monika, meanwhile, seems caught between managing her concern for me and the absence of Natsuki.) Monika: “Okay everyone, let’s remain calm. We’ll reach out to Natsuki’s family to make sure she’s okay. In the meantime, let’s make sure Sayori is comfortable. Yuri, can you please help with that?” (Yuri nods and moves closer to me with a concerned look.) Yuri: “Is there a particular spot where we could make you more comfortable? Maybe we could get some pillows to support your back.” Sayori: “Some extra pillows would be really nice, Yuri. Thank you.” (Yuri quickly gathers some cushions from around the clubroom and arranges them on the couch for me to lean against. I take a seat and try to find a position that eases the cramping. The movements in my belly seem to calm down a little with the gentle pressure.) (Yuri now turns to Monika and speaks in a lower voice, hoping I wouldn’t overhear their concerned conversation.) Yuri: “Monika, should we consider calling a doctor? Sayori’s discomfort might be more significant than we’re assuming.” Monika: (looks at me with a serious expression) “Yes, that might be necessary. But let’s not worry her just yet. Once MC is back with the water, we should talk it over with him first.” (MC returns with a glass of water and hands it to me.) MC: “Here you go, Sayori. Drink slowly. How are you feeling now?” Sayori: “A little better, thanks. The pillows help, and the water is refreshing.” (MC takes a seat beside me, holding my hand.

Monika: “I’m calling an ambulance right now.” Yuri: (visibly stressed but trying to stay composed) “Sayori, just try to relax and breathe. We’re here for you.” (The room fills with a sense of urgency. MC is by my side, holding my hand and speaking reassuring words, trying his best to keep me calm.) MC: “It’s going to be okay, Sayori. Just focus on breathing. We’re going to meet Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu very soon.” (Monika looks up from her phone.) Monika: “The ambulance will be here any minute. Sayori, can you stand with help, or do we need to carry you?” Sayori: “I think... I think I can stand if you help me.” (Two members of the literature club support me on either side as we slowly make our way to the front of the school to wait for the ambulance. My contractions are growing closer together, signaling that the babies are eager to arrive.) (As tense moments pass by, finally the sound of sirens can be heard approaching in the distance, growing louder as the ambulance pulls up to the school. Paramedics rush in with a stretcher and professionally attend to me, preparing to transport me to the hospital.) Paramedic: “We’ll take good care of her, don't worry. Which one of you is the father?” MC: “That's me. Can I... Can I come with her?” Paramedic: “Of course. Let’s go.” (MC climbs into the ambulance, never leaving my side, and Monika assures us she’ll handle the call to Natsuki’s family and keep the rest of the club updated. As the ambulance drives away with sirens blaring, my mind is a mix of fear and excitement. I’m about to become a mother - to three little miracles. The sense of cramps that had initially brought discomfort now fills me with anticipation. Despite the pain, I smile at MC, grateful for the life we’re about to bring into this world.)"},{"prompt":"Write me a sample Corefile plus zone file in the BIND file format for CoreDNS serving the root domain and pointing it to example.com.

Sayori, can you stand with help, or do we need to carry you?” Sayori: “I think… I think I can stand if you help me.” (Two members of the literature club support me on either side as we slowly make our way to the front of the school to wait for the ambulance. My contractions are growing closer together, signaling that the babies are eager to arrive. And then…I could feel urge to push.) Sayori: (panting) “Oh gosh, I need to push…” MC: “Hold on, Sayori! Try not to push yet. The paramedics will be here soon, and they’ll help with everything.” (Monika is on the phone giving our location to the emergency dispatcher, updating on the situation, and Yuri is breathing in sync with me, trying to help me manage the contractions as I battle against","completion":"the urge to push. There's a clear sense of unity amongst everyone in the literature club as they work together to ensure both my safety and the safety of the babies. Yuri: \\"Just keep taking deep breaths, Sayori. Focus on my voice. We're all here with you.\\" (The minutes tick by slowly, and each second feels longer than the last. Then, from the distance, we hear the siren of the ambulance approaching.) Monika: \\"The ambulance is almost here. Hang in there, Sayori.\\" (The paramedics arrive and MC helps explain the situation as they quickly assess my condition. They prepare the stretcher and carefully help me onto it.) Paramedic: \\"We're going to take her to the hospital now. Who's coming with her?\\" MC: \\"I am. I'm the father.\\" (The paramedics nod and load me into the ambulance, with MC following closely behind. The literature club members stand outside, watching the ambulance drive away with looks of concern but also with hope, knowing we are in good hands.) (At the hospital, things move quickly. The medical team takes over, guiding me through the delivery. Despite the chaos and the pain, there's a strange sense of peace knowing that MC is by my side and that we're about to meet Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu.) After some time, and with a lot of effort and support, I bring three new lives into the world, each one greeted with tears of joy and relief. Our little Myth, Life, and Death—the names a nod to our shared experiences and the adventures in \\"Wizard101\\" that oddly mirror this whirlwind moment. As the excitement settles and we're given the chance to hold our babies for the first time, MC and I look at each other with a mix of exhaustion and elation. It's a new chapter for us, a new story yet to be told. And somewhere in the back of my mind, I make a silent promise to Natsuki that we'll find out what happened and ensure she's okay, too. Life, it seems, is full of unexpected quests, and ours is just beginning.
