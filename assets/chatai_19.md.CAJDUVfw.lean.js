Since M is on the ellipse, we have: frac{x_0^2}{a^2} + frac{y_0^2}{b^2} = 1 quad (a>b>0), thus frac{(ax)^2}{a^2} + frac{(by)^2}{b^2} = 1 quad (a>b>0), resulting in the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1. (2) From frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{a}, we get a=2. Also, frac{1}{a^2} + frac{9}{4b^2}=1, so b = sqrt{3}.

Each repetitive sequence (3, 1, 1, 2, 3) has a sum of: [ 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10 ] Since there are 40 such sequences: [ text{Total sum of the digits} = 10 times 40 = 400 ] Importantly, the sum of the digits remains the same throughout any allowable transformation. 3. **Transformation Rules and Pair Sum Analysis** By the problem constraints, we can erase two adjacent digits if their sum is less than or equal to 9 and replace them with their sum. We'll analyze the possible final configuration: - Since each operation reduces the total number of digits and conserves the sum of digits, we look for configurations that sum up to 400. - The number sequence will be minimized when pairs of digits add up to a sum of 10 since the sum of all pairs has to equal the total sum, which is 400. 4. **Maximize the Remaining Number of Digits** Pair the digits such that each pair sums up to 10: - This ensures the maximum number of remaining digits. Since 400 is the sum of the digits and each digit-pair sums to 10, the maximum number of these pairs is: [ frac{400}{10} = 40 , text{pairs} ] Therefore, there can be up to 40 digits remaining. 5. **Specific Configuration for Largest Possible Digit** Given each pair sums to 10, the digits can be maximally: - (7) and (3) or (7) and (3), which is a permissible sum due to the original digits containing numbers 1, 2 as smaller components. 6. **Conclusion** The largest number that can remain on the board after all possible transformations while ensuring each pair sums to 10 is indeed: [ 77 quad text{or} quad 737373 ldots ] Thus, the largest possible number that might remain on the board is given by considering repeated digit (7).

Now, we find a: a = sqrt{k+2} = sqrt{2+2} = 2. The eccentricity e of the ellipse can be calculated as: e = frac{c}{a} = frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the eccentricity of the ellipse is boxed{frac{1}{2}}. To solve this problem, we first used the given equations a^{2} = k+2 and b^{2} = k+1 to find an expression for c. We then used the definition of an ellipse to find a relation involving |AF_1| + |AF_2| in terms of k. Next, we used the given perimeter of triangle ABF_2 to find k, which allowed us to find a. Finally, we used the formula for eccentricity, e = frac{c}{a}, to find the desired value.

Let's start by examining a set of equations modulo ( n ) for ( k cdot 1, k cdot 2, ldots, k cdot (n-1) ). Step-by-Step Solution: 1.

In addition, the company pays a monthly maintenance fee of 200 for each rented car.<br/>B company manager: The monthly rent for each car in my company is 3500. Regardless of whether cars are rented out or not, the company must pay a total monthly maintenance fee of 1850. Explanation: 1. The number of cars is an integer. 2. Monthly profit = Monthly rent fee Monthly maintenance fee. 3. The difference in monthly profit between the two companies = Profit of the company with higher profit Profit of the company with lower profit. Under the condition that the number of cars rented out by both companies is equal, solve the following problems: (1) When each company rents out 10 cars, the monthly profit of company A is ______ yuan; when each company rents out ____ cars, the monthly profit of both companies is equal.

(3) Company A is enthusiastic about public welfare and donates a yuan (a > 0) to a charity for each car rented out.

Find the range of values for a.","completion":"(1) For company A, when renting out 10 cars, the monthly profit can be calculated as follows: - The rent for each car increases by 50 for each car less than 50 rented out, so for 10 cars, the rent per car is 3000 + (50-10) times 50 = 3000 + 2000 = 5000 yuan. - Therefore, the total rent for 10 cars is 5000 times 10 = 50000 yuan. - The total maintenance fee for 10 cars is 200 times 10 = 2000 yuan. - Thus, the monthly profit for company A when renting out 10 cars is 50000 - 2000 = 48000 yuan. So, when each company rents out 10 cars, the monthly profit of company A is boxed{48000 text{ yuan}}. To find the number of cars rented out when the monthly profit of both companies is equal, we set up the equation based on the given conditions: [ left[ (50-x) times 50 + 3000 right]x - 200x = 3500x - 1850 ] Simplifying this equation gives: [ 2500x - 50x^2 + 3000x - 200x = 3500x - 1850 ] [ -50x^2 + 1800x + 1850 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find that x = 37 or x = -1. Since the number of cars cannot be negative, we discard x = -1. Therefore, when each company rents out boxed{37} cars, the monthly profit of both companies is equal. (2) To find the maximum value of the difference in monthly profits between the two companies, we consider two scenarios based on the number of cars rented out (x). For 0 < x < 37, the profit difference is given by: [ y = -50x^2 + 1800x + 1850 ] The maximum profit difference in this range occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at x = 18, and the maximum difference is boxed{18050 text{ yuan}}. For 37 < x leq 50, the profit difference is given by: [ y = 50x^2 - 1800x - 1850 ] The profit difference increases with x in this range, so the maximum occurs at x = 50, yielding a maximum difference of boxed{33150 text{ yuan}}. Therefore, the maximum difference in monthly profits between the two companies is boxed{33150 text{ yuan}}. (3) For the range of values for a, given that the maximum difference occurs when both companies rent out 17 cars each, we have: [ y = -50x^2 + (1800-a)x + 1850 ] The axis of symmetry of this parabola is x = frac{1800-a}{100}. For the maximum difference to occur at x = 17, we need: [ 16.5 < frac{1800-a}{100} < 17.5 ] Solving this inequality for a, we get: [ 50 < a < 150 ] Thus, the range of values for a is boxed{50 < a < 150}."},{"prompt":"3 birds and 2 storks were sitting on the fence. 5 more birds came to join them..

Since 4 is 2^2, n must be odd (i.e., not divisible by 2), because an even number n will share a common factor with 4. 3. **Count of Coprime Numbers**: - Count all numbers up to 2017 that are coprime with 4.

This implies a specific pattern of coloring across the entire board. 2. **Consider the Board Layout**: - Let's denote the colors as (A), (B), (C), and (D). - Consider the top left (2 times 2) square of the board: [ begin{array}{|c|c|} hline A & B hline C & D hline end{array} ] - For this specific square, let's assign the colors as follows just for illustration: [ begin{array}{|c|c|} hline A & B hline C & D hline end{array} ] 3. **Propagation of Colors**: - Given the rule, the colors in this pattern must propagate throughout the board. This implies a repetitive pattern. - For any (2 times 2) square in the entire board, the relative positions of (A), (B), (C), and (D) will remain consistent. 4. **Examining Corners**: - Consider the four corners of the (100 times 100) board: - Top-left corner: This is colored (A), by our initial assignment. - Top-right corner: Moving horizontally, the pattern ensures it follows the same color sequence, ending at (C). - Bottom-left corner: Moving vertically, the pattern ensures it follows the same color sequence, ending at (B). - Bottom-right corner: Both horizontally and vertically, the pattern concludes at (D). 5. **Conclusion**: - Since the board is large enough (100x100), we observe multiple repetitions of the basic (2 times 2) pattern. - Since each (2 times 2) square contains all four colors, by consistency in coloring propagation, the four corners necessarily instantiate four different colors.

According to the information given, Hollis owes 4700 on each loan. However, he owes 1500 more on the 7% loan. This means he actually owes 4700 + 1500 = 6200 on the 7% loan. Now, let's calculate the interest paid on each loan last year. Interest on the 7% loan = 7% of 6200 = 0.07 * 6200 = 434 Since the total interest paid last year was 617, the interest paid on the second loan would be 617 - 434 = 183 Now, we can set up an equation to find the interest rate of the second loan using the interest paid on it: Interest on the second loan = x% of 4700 = 0.01x * 4700 = 183 Now, we solve for x: 0.01x * 4700 = 183 0.01x = 183 / 4700 0.01x = 0.03893617 x = 0.03893617 / 0.01 x = 3.893617 Therefore, the interest rate of the second loan is approximately 3.89% per year.

The compound interest (CI) can be calculated by subtracting the principal (P) from the future value (A): CI = A - P We can rearrange the formula to solve for P: P = A / (1 + r/n)^(nt) We know CI = Rs. 630.50, so: P + CI = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) P + 630.50 = P(1 + 0.10/2)^(2 * 1.5) P + 630.50 = P(1 + 0.05)^(3) P + 630.50 = P(1.05)^3 Now we need to solve for P: P(1.05)^3 - P = 630.50 P((1.05)^3 - 1) = 630.50 P(1.157625 - 1) = 630.50 P(0.157625) = 630.50 P = 630.50 / 0.157625 P ≈ 4000 So the principal amount is approximately Rs. boxed{4000} ."},{"prompt":"A boat having a certain length and breadth of 2 m is floating on a lake.

What is the length of the boat?","completion":"To find the length of the boat, we can use the principle of flotation, which states that the weight of the water displaced by the boat is equal to the weight of the boat plus the weight of the man when he gets on it. First, let's calculate the volume of water displaced by the boat when the man gets on it. Since the boat sinks by 1.5 cm (which is 0.015 m), we can calculate the volume of water displaced as follows: Volume of water displaced = length of the boat × breadth of the boat × change in depth Let's denote the length of the boat as L (in meters). The breadth of the boat is given as 2 m. Volume of water displaced = L × 2 m × 0.015 m Now, let's calculate the weight of the man in newtons (N), since weight is the force due to gravity. The weight of the man (W) can be calculated using the formula: W = mass × acceleration due to gravity The mass of the man is 90 kg, and the acceleration due to gravity (g) is approximately 9.81 m/s². W = 90 kg × 9.81 m/s² W = 882.9 N This weight is equal to the weight of the water displaced. The density of water (ρ) is 1000 kg/m³, and the weight of the water displaced can be calculated using the formula: Weight of water displaced = volume of water displaced × density of water × acceleration due to gravity 882.9 N = (L × 2 m × 0.015 m) × 1000 kg/m³ × 9.81 m/s² Now we can solve for L: 882.9 N = L × 2 m × 0.015 m × 1000 kg/m³ × 9.81 m/s² 882.9 N = L × 29.43 N/m² L = 882.9 N / 29.43 N/m² L ≈ 29.99 m So, the length of the boat is approximately boxed{30} meters."},{"prompt":"Let S be the set of complex numbers of the form x + yi, where x and y are real numbers, such that [frac{1}{2} le x le frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.] Find the smallest positive integer m such that for all positive integers n ge m, there exists a complex number z in S such that z^n = 1.","completion":"Note that for 0^circ le theta le 360^circ, the real part of operatorname{cis} theta lies between frac{1}{2} and frac{sqrt{2}}{2} if and only if 45^circ le theta le 60^circ or 300^circ le theta le 315^circ.

First, let's set up the problem with the given information: - k, n, r are positive integers. - r < n. - There are k cdot n + r black and white chess pieces each, arranged in a row. - The goal is to ensure there are no consecutive 2n pieces that consist of only black or only white. 2. To start, we note that the total number of pieces is 2(k cdot n + r). 3. We divide the row into segments of size 2n. If we have consecutive 2n pieces of one color, the number of that color in such a segment must differ from the number of the opposite color by at least 2, due to parity (i.e., both counts cannot be odd/even simultaneously if their cumulative total adds to 2n). 4. Let’s denote: - x as the number of black pieces in any segment of 2n. - y as the number of white pieces in that segment. Since x + y = 2n and x neq y (to ensure balance), we must have that: [ x - y geq 2 ] 5. Arrange the entire sequence 2kn + 2r of pieces, indexed as 1, 2, ldots, 2kn+2r. We denote the i-th segment as starting from position i and consisting of consecutive 2n pieces (called segment i). 6. For the first segment (1 to 2n), assume black pieces (count x) exceed white pieces (count y) by at least 2, so: [ x - y geq 2 ] 7. Moving to the second segment (2, 3, ldots, 2n+1): - The first piece of the segment (1) is black; the last piece (2n+1) is white. Hence, the count of black pieces x in this segment decreases by at most 1, and the count of white pieces y increases by at most 1. Thus, in the second segment: [ (x - 1) - (y + 1) = x - y - 2 geq 0 ] 8. By similar logic, each subsequent segment must maintain black pieces outnumbering white pieces by at least 2. 9. Considering the entire sequence of 2kn + 2r: - In the first 2kn pieces, black must exceed white by at least 2k. - In the remaining 2r pieces, it follows: [ 2r geq 2k Rightarrow r geq k ] 10.

The difference between the banker's discount and the true discount is the interest on the true discount for the same time. Given: Banker's Discount (BD) = Rs. 42 True Discount (TD) = Rs. 36 The difference between BD and TD is the interest on TD: Interest on TD = BD - TD Interest on TD = Rs. 42 - Rs. 36 Interest on TD = Rs. 6 Now, we know that the true discount (TD) is the simple interest on the present value (PV), and the interest on TD is the simple interest on TD itself. Therefore, we can use the formula for simple interest to find the sum due (which is the face value, FV): Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) × Rate (R) × Time (T) / 100 Here, the interest on TD (Rs. 6) is the simple interest on the true discount (Rs. 36), and we can assume the rate and time such that the product of rate and time is 100 (for simplicity, since we don't have the rate and time values). Let's assume R × T = 100. Interest on TD = TD × (R × T) / 100 Rs. 6 = Rs. 36 × (R × T) / 100 Rs. 6 = Rs. 36 × 100 / 100 Rs. 6 = Rs. 36 Now, we can find the face value (FV) using the true discount (TD) and the interest on TD: FV = PV + TD Since TD is the interest on PV, we can also write it as: FV = TD + Interest on TD FV = Rs. 36 + Rs. 6 FV = Rs. 42 Therefore, the sum due (face value of the bill) is Rs. boxed{42} ."},{"prompt":"Given vectors a( sqrt {3}cos omega x,sin omega x) and b(sin omega x,0), with omega > 0, let the function f(x)=(a+b)cdot b+k.

We know: [ a costheta + b sintheta = R sin(theta + phi). ] Here, ( a = 1 ) and ( b = sqrt{3} ). To find ( R ) and ( phi ): [ R = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = sqrt{1^2 + (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{1 + 3} = sqrt{4} = 2. ] Since: [ tan(phi) = frac{b}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}}{1} = sqrt{3}, ] it follows that: [ phi = frac{pi}{3}. ] Therefore: [ cos(2x) + sqrt{3} sin 2x = 2 sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{3}right). ] 5. **Determine the range and period**: The transformed function is: [ y = 2 sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{3}right). ] The range of ( sin ) function is ([-1, 1]), so: [ y = 2 sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{3}right) text{ ranges from } -2 text{ to } 2. ] 6. **Calculate period**: The fundamental period of ( sin(kx + c) ) is ( frac{2pi}{k} ).

Since the number of edges per face is at least 3 (because it's a polyhedron), each face contributes at most 2/3 of its edges to the total number of edges intersected. 3. **Summation**: Adding up these fractions for each face, considering that every edge is shared by two faces, ensures that at most 2/3 of the total edges can be intersected by such a plane. 4. **Calculation**: Using this logic, the maximum number of edges that can be intersected is: [ frac{2}{3} times 100 = 66.67 ] Since the number of edges must be an integer, we have: [ leftlfloor 66.67 rightrfloor = 66 ] 5. **Supporting Example**: Consider constructing a polyhedron with a known arrangement and verify it through practical examples, confirming that at most, 66 edges can be intersected.

The number 12 can be written as 2^2cdot3, and 9 can be written as 3^2. Thus, the equation becomes: [ {(2^2cdot3)}^3=frac{(3^2)^2}{3}cdot2^{12p} ] 2. **Applying laws of exponents**: Next, we apply the laws of exponents to simplify both sides of the equation. On the left side, {(2^2cdot3)}^3 becomes 2^6cdot3^3 because (acdot b)^n = a^n cdot b^n. On the right side, (3^2)^2 simplifies to 3^4, and dividing by 3 gives us 3^3. Thus, the equation now looks like: [ 2^6cdot3^3=frac{3^4}{3}cdot2^{12p} Rightarrow 2^6cdot3^3=3^3cdot2^{12p} ] 3. **Dividing both sides by 3^3**: To isolate the terms involving 2, we divide both sides of the equation by 3^3.

That is, there exists a set ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k}) that satisfies the given condition. - We need to show that there exists a set of ( k + 1 ) numbers that also satisfies the same condition. - Take primes ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) which do not divide any of the ( a_i )'s in the set ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k}).

Now, we check each option to see if mathbf{v} lies on the line and if mathbf{d} is a scalar multiple of begin{pmatrix} 1 2 end{pmatrix}: - Option (A): The direction vector is begin{pmatrix} 2 1 end{pmatrix}, which is not a scalar multiple of begin{pmatrix} 1 2 end{pmatrix}. - Option (B): The direction vector is begin{pmatrix} -1 -2 end{pmatrix}, which is a scalar multiple of begin{pmatrix} 1 2 end{pmatrix} by -1.

Subtract the first equation from the second: [ (2alpha + 4gamma) - (2alpha + 3gamma) = 10 - 8 implies gamma = 2 ] 8.

Construct a sphere centered at ( A ) with radius ( d ). [ S: (x - A_x)^2 + (y - A_y)^2 + (z - A_z)^2 = d^2 ] The goal is to find planes that touch this sphere and pass through the given line ( ell ). 2. **Identify planes tangent to the sphere that pass through the line**: Any plane tangent to the sphere will have a perpendicular distance ( d ) from the point ( A ). To identify these planes: - Consider the line ( ell ) with a given point ( A ) outside the line. - Determine the distance from ( A ) to ( ell ). 3. **Equation and properties of the tangent plane**: A plane with a normal vector (mathbf{n} = (a, b, c) ) passing through a point ( P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0) ) has the equation: [ a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0 ] If this plane is tangent to the sphere, the distance ( d ) from ( A ) to the plane must be equal to the sphere's radius, ( r = d ). The distance ( D ) from a point ( A(x_1, y_1, z_1) ) to a plane ( ax + by + cz + d = 0 ) is given by: [ D = frac{|ax_1 + by_1 + cz_1 + d|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} ] 4. **Construct the geometric solution**: - **Case 1: Tangent and intersection properties**: - If the distance from ( A ) to ( ell ) is exactly ( d ), there will be only one solution where the plane touches the sphere at exactly one point. - If the distance is less than ( d ), there will be two tangent planes symmetrical about the line. - If the distance is greater than ( d ), no real solution exists because the plane cannot simultaneously touch the sphere and pass through the line. - We employ orthogonal projections and polar coordinates to visualize and calculate these planes.

Considering that a_1 belongs to the set of positive natural numbers, we conclude a_1 = 1. Since a_1 + a_4 neq 10, then we have a_4 neq 9.

Since the sum of a_2 and a_3 is expected to be smaller than a_4 (which is 16), and the sum of their squares should be reasonable (as they cannot be too large), the pairs of (a_2, a_3) can be reduced to a few checks. The only pair (a_2, a_3) that reasonably fits the conditions (considering the ordering and natural numbers) seems to be (3, 5).

It turns out that it is possible to divide the space into parts using ten planes so that there is no more than one cloud in each part. What is the maximum number of clouds that an airplane could fly through while adhering to a straightline course?","completion":"We are given that 10 planes divide the 3-dimensional space, and every partition contains at most one cloud. We need to find the maximum number of clouds that an airplane can pass through, given that it follows a straight path. Let's denote each plane as ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{10} ). 1. **Understanding the problem**: The airplane can cross each plane at most once, because if it crosses a plane again, it means it is retracing its path in reverse, which doesn't count as moving forward along a straight path. 2. **Counting the intersections**: Each time the airplane crosses a plane ( P_i ), it moves from one partition of space to another. Since there are 10 planes, the maximum number of partitions created by these 10 planes is given by a combinatorial argument. However, since we are only interested in the intersections along a single path: - Initially, the plane starts in one partition. - Every time it crosses a plane ( P_i ), it moves to a different partition. 3. **Maximizing the partitions crossed**: Since an airplane can cross each plane at most once, the maximum number of borders it can cross is 10 (one for each plane). Consequently, if the airplane starts in one partition, after crossing 10 planes, it has visited 11 partitions. 4. **Effect of partitions on clouds**: Given each partition contains at most one cloud, visiting 11 partitions means potentially passing through up to 11 clouds, as each of these partitions can have at most one cloud. To achieve this maximum number, the course of the airplane must not be parallel to any plane and must avoid passing through the lines formed by the intersections of multiple planes (i.e. no degeneracy in the path). **Conclusion**: The airplane can pass through a maximum of 11 clouds under the given constraints.

Therefore, f'(1) = frac{1 + a - ln{1}}{(1 + a)^2} = frac{1}{1 + a}. Since the tangent to the curve y = f(x) at the point (1, f(1)) is perpendicular to the line x + y + 1 = 0, it must be the case that the product of their slopes is -1. Thus, we have f'(1) = -1, and frac{1}{1 + a} = -1. Solving for a gives a = 0. Hence, the value of a is boxed{a = 0}. (2) The equation f(x) = 1 can be written as frac{ln{x}}{x + a} = 1, which simplifies to ln{x} = x + a (given that x neq -a).

When x neq -a (that is, x neq 1), the equation has no real roots for a = -1. Let g(x) = ln{x} - x (for x > 0), its derivative is g'(x) = frac{1 - x}{x} (for x > 0). Therefore, g(x) is increasing on (0, 1) and decreasing on (1, +infty). Since g(x) leq g(1) = -1, for a < -1 and since e^a in (0, 1), we have g(e^a) = ln{e^a} - e^a = a - e^a < a.

Since each road has 250 street lights on each side, the total number of street lights for one road is 250 * 2 = 500. The total number of street lights in the town is 20000, and this is the sum of the street lights from all the roads in all the neighborhoods. If we multiply the number of roads in each neighborhood (R) by the number of neighborhoods (10), we get the total number of roads in the town, which we can denote as T. So, T = 10 * R. Now, we know that each road contributes 500 street lights to the total, so the total number of street lights is also equal to the total number of roads (T) multiplied by the number of street lights per road (500).

Each day, he chooses one cookie uniformly at random from the remaining cookies, eats it, and also eats all cookies labeled with subsets of the chosen cookie. We need to find the expected number of days until all cookies are eaten. 2. **Indicator Variables:** Let (c_S) be an indicator variable that takes the value (1) if the cookie labeled with subset (S) is chosen manually by Kevin, and (0) otherwise. We seek the expected value (mathbb{E}left[sum_{S} c_Sright] = sum_{S} mathbb{E}[c_S]). 3. **Expected Value of (c_S):** The expected value (mathbb{E}[c_S]) is the probability that the cookie labeled with (S) is chosen manually. This happens if and only if Kevin chooses a cookie labeled with a superset of (S) before any other cookie labeled with a proper subset of (S). 4. **Probability Calculation:** The probability that a specific cookie (S) is chosen manually is the probability that (S) itself is the chosen superset. This is given by: [ mathbb{E}[c_S] = frac{1}{2^{n-|S|}} ] where (n = 8) is the total number of elements in the set ({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}), and (|S|) is the size of the subset (S). 5. **Summing Over All Subsets:** We need to sum this probability over all nonempty subsets (S) of ({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}). The total number of nonempty subsets of an (n)-element set is (2^n - 1). 6. **Expected Number of Days:** The expected number of days is: [ sum_{S subseteq {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, S neq emptyset} frac{1}{2^{8-|S|}} ] We can rewrite this sum by grouping subsets of the same size: [ sum_{k=1}^{8} binom{8}{k} frac{1}{2^{8-k}} ] where (binom{8}{k}) is the number of subsets of size (k). 7. **Simplifying the Sum:** [ sum_{k=1}^{8} binom{8}{k} frac{1}{2^{8-k}} = sum_{k=1}^{8} binom{8}{k} frac{1}{2^8} cdot 2^k = frac{1}{2^8} sum_{k=1}^{8} binom{8}{k} 2^k ] Using the binomial theorem, we know: [ sum_{k=0}^{8} binom{8}{k} 2^k = (1+2)^8 = 3^8 ] Subtracting the (k=0) term (which is (binom{8}{0} 2^0 = 1)): [ sum_{k=1}^{8} binom{8}{k} 2^k = 3^8 - 1 ] Therefore: [ sum_{k=1}^{8} binom{8}{k} frac{1}{2^8} cdot 2^k = frac{3^8 - 1}{2^8} ] 8. **Final Calculation:** [ frac{3^8 - 1}{2^8} = frac{6561 - 1}{256} = frac{6560}{256} = frac{205}{8} ] The final answer is (boxed{213})."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)= begin{cases} x^{2},x > 0 2^{x},x < 0 end{cases}, and g(x)= begin{cases} frac {1}{x},x > 0 x1,x < 0 end{cases}, find the value of g(f(1)).","completion":"Since the function f(x)= begin{cases} -x^{2},x > 0 2^{x},x < 0 end{cases}, and g(x)= begin{cases} - frac {1}{x},x > 0 x-1,x < 0 end{cases}, we have f(-1)=2^{-1}= frac {1}{2}, and g(f(-1))=g( frac {1}{2})= - frac {1}{ frac {1}{2}}=-2.

The distance from the center of the circle to the tangent point (2, -1) can be calculated using the distance formula: [r = sqrt{(x_0-2)^2 + (y_0+1)^2}] Since the center of the circle lies on the line 2x+y=0, we can express y_0 in terms of x_0: y_0 = -2x_0.

We know that Jenna received 1/3 of the roses and Imma received 1/2 of the roses. Since Jenna and Imma received all the roses Hanna bought, we can write the following equation: 1/3 (total roses) + 1/2 (total roses) = 125 roses To solve for the total number of roses, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 6 in this case. So we can rewrite the equation as: 2/6 (total roses) + 3/6 (total roses) = 125 roses Combining the fractions, we get: 5/6 (total roses) = 125 roses Now, we can solve for the total number of roses: total roses = 125 roses / (5/6) total roses = 125 roses * (6/5) total roses = 25 * 6 total roses = 150 roses Hanna bought 150 roses in total.

Specifically, if a way of arrangement is given, we traverse the cells in the order of their numbers. Conversely, if a path is given, we number the cells in the order of the path. 2. **Defining boundaries and paths**: The cells containing the numbers 1 and 100 will be referred to as the ends of the path. If there is any zigzag motion (a sequence of moves where vertical and horizontal moves strictly alternate) on the board, while ensuring that at least one vertical move is not in an extreme column (as illustrated, consider a chessboard's shading for convenience), let us analyze the behavior at the zigzag ends: - A zigzag path can reach the end of the path, which can only be at the edge of the board. Otherwise, the zigzag would 'cut off' any untraversed cells. - Exiting a zigzag with two horizontal moves leaves a cell with a vertical move solely, thus limiting to end at the edge. Therefore, any zigzag is confined between two (non-adjacent vertical) columns containing the ends of the path, meaning other zigzags are absent, and the path ends restore uniquely. 3. **Constructing without zigzag**: The remaining structure involves paths consisting exclusively of segments of a broken line. For a full path (without a zigzag), note that the path would contain precisely 99 segments (as a rook's move count—any movement covers all except the starting point). 4. **Placement count calculation**: To count acceptable placements, ignore restriction #2 temporarily. The number 1 can be placed in any cell (100 choices), and the number 100 can be placed in any cell of the opposite color (50 choices), leading to: [ 100 times 50 = 5000 text{ such arrangements} ] Now, note to satisfy restriction #2, only boundary columns' placements (2 boundary columns) satisfy this.

The slope of the line x - 2y + 1 = 0 is frac{1}{2}, so the slope of the tangent at x=1 must be -2: f'(1) = 2 - 2a + 1 = -2 Solving for a, we get: a = frac{5}{2} Therefore, boxed{a = frac{5}{2}}.

Since a and p-a are both numbers in the sequence 2,3,cdots,(p-2), there exists and only exists one number in the sequence such that: ia equiv 1(bmod p) quad text{with} quad i neq a. 5. Since: (p-a)(p-i) equiv ia equiv 1 (bmod p), by multiplying both sides of the equation by i and p-i: 2 cdot 3 cdot cdots cdot (a-1) cdot i a cdot (a+1) cdot cdots cdot (p-a-1) cdot (p-i) cdot (p-a+1) cdot cdots cdot (p-2) equiv i(p-i) (bmod p). 6. Thus, the term becomes: frac{(p-1)!}{a(p-a)} equiv 1 cdot i(p-i)(p-1) equiv i^{2} equiv (p-i)^{2}(bmod p). 7. By definition, we have: ia equiv 1(bmod p), quad (p-a)(p-i) equiv 1(bmod p), quad 2 leq a leq frac{p-1}{2}. Therefore, i and p-i must have one number greater than frac{p+1}{2} and one number less than frac{p-1}{2}. Let the lesser of i and p-i be i_1.

In the above equation, when a takes each number in the sequence 2,3,cdots, frac{p-1}{2}, we obtain all the terms after the second term in the conclusion. From the previous proof, it is known that i_1 must take each number in the series 2,3,cdots, frac{p-1}{2} without omission. Also, frac{(p-1)!}{p-1} = (p-2)(p-3) cdots 1 equiv (-2)(-3) cdots [-1] equiv 1 (bmod p). 9.

Since: 1^{2} + 2^{2} + cdots + left(frac{p-1}{2}right)^{2} = frac{(p-1)p(p+1)}{24}, and the right side of the above formula is obviously an integer because among three consecutive numbers, one must be a multiple of 3, and the product of two even numbers p-1 and p+1 is necessarily a multiple of 8. Hence: 24 mid p(p-1)(p+1). Thus: p cdot frac{(p-1)(p+1)}{24} equiv 0(bmod p).

Therefore, f′(x_{0})=-3x_{0}^{2}+12x_{0}-9. The equation of the tangent line is y+x_{0}^{3}-6x_{0}^{2}+9x_{0}-8=(-3x_{0}^{2}+12x_{0}-9)(x-x_{0}).

Prove that the sum of the radii of the circles inscribed in these triangles does not depend on how the diagonals are drawn.","completion":"1. Initially, we start by considering the simplest case of a polygon with ( n = 4 ), which is a quadrilateral divided into two triangles by a single diagonal. This case is proved in Problem II. 235. Here, we aim to generalize this result to any ( n )-sided polygon. 2. We employ mathematical induction to prove the general statement. Assume the statement is true for an ( (n-1) )-sided polygon, and we will show it is true for an ( n )-sided polygon. 3. Given an ( n )-sided polygon inscribed in a circle, we can divide it into ( n-2 ) triangles by drawing ((n-3)) non-intersecting diagonals. Our goal is to show that the sum of the radii of the incircles of these triangles does not depend on how the diagonals are drawn. 4. Consider a breakdown of a general triangle ( triangle ABC ), where ( angle A ) is the largest angle, ( r ) and ( R ) represent the radii of the inscribed and circumscribed circles respectively, and ( d_a, d_b, ) and ( d_c ) are the distances from the center of the circumscribed circle to the sides ( BC, CA, ) and ( AB ) respectively. 5. For a given acute triangle, the following equality holds: [ r + R = d_a + d_b + d_c ] For an obtuse triangle, the equality is modified to: [ r + R = -d_a + d_b + d_c. ] For a right triangle, we have ( d_a = 0 ), and hence either of the above relations is applicable. 6. To prove the relationship, consider the acute triangle ( triangle ABC ). Let ( A_0, B_0, ) and ( C_0 ) be the midpoints of sides ( BC, CA, ) and ( AB ) respectively, and ( O ) the center of the circumscribed circle. By Ptolemy's theorem (Problem II. 237), applied to the quadrilateral ( AB_0OC_0 ), we obtain: [ frac{b}{2} d_c + frac{c}{2} d_b = frac{a}{2} R. ] Writing similar equations for quadrilaterals ( BC_0OA_0 ) and ( CB_0OA_0 ), we get: [ left(frac{a}{2} + frac{b}{2}right) d_c + left(frac{a}{2} + frac{c}{2}right) d_b + left(frac{b}{2} + frac{c}{2}right) d_a = frac{1}{2}(a + b + c) R = pR, ] where ( p ) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. 7. From the above relation, we can deduce: [ p(d_a + d_b + d_c) - frac{1}{2}(c d_c + b d_b + a d_a) = pR. ] Since: [ frac{1}{2}(c d_c + b d_b + a d_a) = S = pr, ] where ( S ) is the area of ( triangle ABC ), simplifying gives: [ pr = p(d_a + d_b + d_c) - pr, ] yielding: [ p(d_a + d_b + d_c) = p(r + R). ] Thus: [ r + R = d_a + d_b + d_c. ] 8. For the case ( angle A > 90^circ ), a similar approach can be taken by analyzing the appropriate distances with respect to the largest angle. 9. Summing the correct relations for all triangles in the polygon decomposition, noting that each diagonal is shared between two triangles and it stands with opposite signs, we recognize that the dependence on the arrangement of diagonals cancels out. 10. Therefore, irrespective of how the diagonals are drawn, the sum of the radii of the inscribed circles within these triangles remains constant.

For AOB, we have: [ AB^2 = OA^2 + OB^2 - 2 cdot OA cdot OB cdot cos angle AOB ] Similarly, for triangle XOY, we get: [ XY^2 = OX^2 + OY^2 - 2 cdot OX cdot OY cdot cos angle XOY ] 4. **Summing these results:** Since OA = OX and OB = OY, it follows: [ AB^2 + XY^2 = left(OA^2 + OB^2 - 2 cdot OA cdot OB cdot cos angle AOBright) + left(OX^2 + OY^2 - 2 cdot OX cdot OY cdot cos angle XOYright) ] Rewrite this as: [ AB^2 + XY^2 = left(OA^2 + OB^2right) + left(OX^2 + OY^2right) - 2 cdot OA cdot OB cdot left(cos angle AOB + cos angle XOYright) ] Given that: [ cos angle XOY = - cos angle AOB ] The term with the cosine simplifies to zero: [ - 2 cdot OA cdot OB cdot left(cos angle AOB + cos angle XOYright) = - 2 cdot OA cdot OB cdot left(cos angle AOB - cos angle AOBright) = 0 ] 5. **Final equality:** Therefore, we get: [ AB^2 + XY^2 = 2 left(OA^2 + OB^2right) ] This completes our proof that the sum of the areas of the shaded triangles equals the sum of the areas of the colored triangles.

We can write the following equation to represent their combined work rate: M + S = 1/5 Since we know the man's work rate (M) is 1/10, we can substitute that into the equation: 1/10 + S = 1/5 Now we need to solve for S, the son's work rate. To do this, we subtract the man's work rate from the combined work rate: S = 1/5 - 1/10 To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 10 in this case: S = (2/10) - (1/10) S = 1/10 So the son's work rate is boxed{1/10} of the work per day.

Since the balls are numbered from 1 to 500, there are 250 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 499) and 250 even numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 500).

Thus f(x)_{min} = f(-e) = -ae - 1 = 3, solving gives a = -frac{4}{e} < -frac{1}{e} (discard) (iv) When a < -frac{1}{e}, then when -e leq x < frac{1}{a}, f'(x) = a - frac{1}{x} < 0, at this time the function f(x) = ax - ln (-x) is decreasing; when frac{1}{a} < x < 0, f'(x) = a - frac{1}{x} > 0, at this time the function f(x) = ax - ln (-x) is increasing. Thus f(x)_{min} = f(frac{1}{a}) = 1 - ln (-frac{1}{a}) = 3, solving gives a = -e^2. In conclusion, there exists a real number a = -e^2 such that when x in [-e,0), f(x) has a minimum value of boxed{3}."},{"prompt":"Let m be the product of all positive integers less than 5! which are invertible modulo 5!.

We demonstrate that for any integer ( x ), the set ( S_2 = {K!n!x alpha + 1 mid alpha in S_1} ) has the property that any two distinct non-empty subsets ( A ) and ( B ) of ( S_2 ) have arithmetic means ( f(A) ) and ( f(B) ) that are coprime. 9. **Step 2.1**: Definitions directly imply: for two subsets ( A_1 , B_1 subseteq S_1 ) such that ( |A_1| = |A| ) and ( |B_1| = |B| ), [ f(A) = K!n!x f(A_1) + 1, quad f(B) = K!n!x f(B_1) + 1 ] As ( f(A_1) ) and ( f(B_1) ) are both integers, so are ( f(A) ) and ( f(B) ). 10. **Step 2.2**: Suppose an integer ( d ) is a common divisor of ( f(A) ) and ( f(B) ). Then, [ n! f(A) f(B_1) - n! f(B) f(A_1) ] is divisible by ( d ), so ( d mid n! (f(A_1) - f(B_1)) ). Because the difference ( f(A_1) - f(B_1) ) is non-zero and smaller than ( K ), ( d ) must divide ( K! ). Since ( d mid f(A) ), we conclude ( f(A) ) and ( f(B) ) are coprime. 11. **Step 3**: We demonstrate further that it is possible to choose integers so that all elements of ( S_2 ) are composite. Given that there are infinitely many primes, we can select primes ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_n ) all larger than ( K ). With ( alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_n ) representing elements of ( S_1 ), it follows: [ (p_i, K!n!alpha_i) = 1 quad text{ and } quad (p_i^2, p_j^2) = 1 quad text{for } 1 leq i < j leqslant n ] By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exist integer solutions ( x ) to: [ K!n!x a_i equiv -1 mod p_i^2 quad i = 1,2, ldots, n ] 12. **Conclusion**: An appropriate choice of ( x ) ensures that all elements in ( S_2 ) are composites, satisfying all initial conditions of the problem.

Since frac {1}{3} is a positive fraction less than 1, raising it to any positive power will result in a number that is still less than 1. Therefore, for the inequality to hold true, x must be a positive number, that is, x > 0. Now, let's consider the second inequality frac {1}{x} > 1. When we multiply both sides by x^2, to avoid reversing the inequality sign (as x^2 is always positive), we get x > x^2. Since x is positive, the only way this inequality can be true is if 0 < x < 1. To summarize: - ( frac {1}{3})^{x} < 1 is true for x > 0. - frac {1}{x} > 1 is true for 0 < x < 1.

Therefore, being in the latter set (having ( frac {1}{3})^{x} < 1) is necessary for being in the former set (having frac {1}{x} > 1), but it is not sufficient, because there are values of x greater than 1 for which ( frac {1}{3})^{x} < 1 holds but frac {1}{x} > 1 does not hold.

Let's determine the derivative f'(x): f'(x) = 10left[(x-6)^2 + 2(x-3)(x-6)right] f'(x) = 30(x-6)(x-4) By finding the sign of the derivative f'(x), we can determine the intervals where f(x) is increasing or decreasing: - When x in (3,4), f'(x) > 0 and f(x) is increasing. - When x = 4, f'(x) = 0. - When x in (4,6), f'(x) < 0 and f(x) is decreasing. From this analysis, we conclude that x=4 is the point where f(x) reaches its maximum value on the interval (3,6). Substituting x=4 into f(x) gives us the maximum profit: f(4) = 2 + 10(4-3)(4-6)^2 = 2 + 10(1)(-2)^2 = 2 + 10 times 4 = boxed{42} Answer: When the selling price is 4 yuan per kilogram, the store achieves the maximum daily profit from selling the commodity."},{"prompt":"Thomas needs to borrow 15,000 from a credit union.

To prove the inequality ( A A_{1} + B B_{1} + C C_{1} > A B + B C + A C ), we need to show that each segment formed by the extension of the angle bisectors to the circumcircle is greater than half the sum of the adjacent triangle sides. 2. Consider the cyclic quadrilateral (ABA_1C). By Ptolemy's Theorem, which states that for a cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD), the sum of the products of its two pairs of opposite sides is equal to the product of its diagonals: [ j times l = a times d + b times c ] we apply this to (ABA_1C): [ A A_{1} cdot B C = A B cdot A_{1} C + A C cdot A_{1} B ] 3. Since ( angle B A A_{1} = angle C A A_{1} ) due to the properties of angle bisectors in a cyclic configuration, we get: [ A_{1} B = A_{1} C = x ] 4. Substituting (A_{1} B = A_{1} C = x) into the equation derived from Ptolemy's theorem, we have: [ 2 A A_{1} = 2 frac{A B cdot x + A C cdot x}{B C} ] which simplifies to: [ 2 A A_{1} = (A B + A C) cdot frac{2 x}{B C} ] 5.

Part 1: How many different ways are there to arrange the products A and B next to each other? Step-by-step Solution for Part 1: 1. Consider AB (or BA) as a single unit. Now, we have 4 units to arrange: AB, C, D, E. 2. There are {A}_{4}^{4} = 4! = 24 ways to arrange these 4 units. 3. For each arrangement of the units, A and B can be arranged in {A}_{2}^{2} = 2! = 2 ways since they can either be in the order AB or BA. 4.

Part 2: If the products A and B are next to each other, and the products A and C are not next to each other, how many different ways are there to arrange them? Step-by-step Solution for Part 2: 1. We start with the initial arrangement calculation for AB being adjacent, which is 48 ways. 2. To calculate the arrangements where A and C are also adjacent, we consider cases where C is adjacent to the AB pair, considering them as a single unit, leading to arrangements such as CAB and BAC. 3. In this scenario, we have 3 units: the combined unit (CAB or BAC) and the other two products. These can be arranged in {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 6 ways. 4. Since there are two configurations for the combined unit (CAB and BAC), the total number of ways in this case is 2 times 6 = 12. 5. To find the arrangements where A and B are adjacent but A and C are not, we subtract the above count from the total arrangements where A and B are adjacent: 48 - 12 = 36.

He sells the rice for a varying selling price due to local market conditions as follows: Monday to Wednesday: 1.20 per kilogram Thursday to Friday: 1.30 per kilogram Saturday to Sunday: 1.25 per kilogram In addition, there is a 12% taxation on the total selling price. Calculate David's total profit or loss for the entire week, taking into account the bulk discount and evolving market conditions.","completion":"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 25 sacks of rice that David buys. The cost per sack is 50, and he gets a 5% discount for buying between 21 and 30 sacks. Discount per sack = 5% of 50 = 0.05 * 50 = 2.5 Discounted cost per sack = 50 - 2.5 = 47.5 Total cost for 25 sacks = 25 * 47.5 = 1187.5 Next, let's calculate the total selling price for the rice over the week. Since David buys 25 sacks of 50 kilograms each, he has a total of 25 * 50 = 1250 kilograms of rice. The selling price varies by the day of the week: Monday to Wednesday (3 days): 1.20 per kilogram Thursday to Friday (2 days): 1.30 per kilogram Saturday to Sunday (2 days): 1.25 per kilogram We don't know how much rice he sells each day, so we'll assume he sells an equal amount every day. This means he sells 1250 kg / 7 days = approximately 178.57 kg per day. Now, let's calculate the total selling price for each day of the week: Monday to Wednesday selling price: 178.57 kg/day * 1.20/kg * 3 days = 642.84 Thursday to Friday selling price: 178.57 kg/day * 1.30/kg * 2 days = 464.28 Saturday to Sunday selling price: 178.57 kg/day * 1.25/kg * 2 days = 446.43 Total selling price for the week = 642.84 + 464.28 + 446.43 = 1553.55 Now, we need to account for the 12% taxation on the total selling price: Tax amount = 12% of 1553.55 = 0.12 * 1553.55 = 186.43 Total selling price after tax = 1553.55 - 186.43 = 1367.12 Finally, let's calculate David's total profit or loss for the week: Profit or loss = Total selling price after tax - Total cost Profit or loss = 1367.12 - 1187.5 = 179.62 David makes a profit of boxed{179.62} for the entire week."},{"prompt":"Compute frac{x^6 + 8x^3 + 16}{x^3 + 4} when x = 3.","completion":"First, observe that: [ (x^3 + 4)^2 = x^6 + 8x^3 + 16 ] Thus, the expression simplifies to: [ frac{x^6 + 8x^3 + 16}{x^3 + 4} = frac{(x^3 + 4)^2}{x^3 + 4} = x^3 + 4 ] Substituting x = 3 into the simplified expression: [ 3^3 + 4 = 27 + 4 = boxed{31} ]"},{"prompt":"For a certain positive integer ( n ), there exist real numbers ( x_1, x_2, dots, x_n ) such that [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + dots + x_n = 2000, ] [ x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 + dots + x_n^4 = 3200000. ] Find the smallest positive integer ( n ) for which this is possible.","completion":"Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, [ (1^2 + 1^2 + dots + 1^2)(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + dots + x_n^2) geq (x_1 + x_2 + dots + x_n)^2, ] so [ n(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + dots + x_n^2) geq 2000^2. ] Therefore, [ x_1^2 + x_2^2 + dots + x_n^2 geq frac{2000^2}{n}. ] Again by Cauchy-Schwarz, [ (1^2 + 1^2 + dots + 1^2)(x_1^4 + x_2^4 + dots + x_n^4) geq (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + dots + x_n^2)^2, ] so [ n cdot 3200000 geq left(frac{2000^2}{n}right)^2. ] Then, [ n^3 geq frac{2000^4}{3200000} = frac{4000000}{32} = 125000, ] thus ( n geq 50 ).

For any x value: - If x < 1, as x increases, y increases because we are moving towards the vertex from the left. - If x > 1, as x increases, y decreases because we are moving away from the vertex to the right. Given points A(m, y_{1}) and B(m+1, y_{2}) are on the graph, and y_{1} > y_{2}, this implies that A is closer to the vertex than B on the x-axis. This situation can only happen if A is to the left of the vertex and B is to the right of the vertex or both are to the left but A is closer to the vertex. Since the vertex is at x=1, and B is to the right of A, we can deduce that m must be less than or equal to 1 for y_{1} to be greater than y_{2}, but since B is at m+1, m cannot be 1 because that would place B at the vertex, where y would not decrease for an increase in x by 1.

Let (P) be a point within the circumcircle of (triangle ABC). We aim to show that there exists a triangle with side lengths (|PA|), (|PB|), and (|PC|) and that its area depends only on (|PO|). 2. **Utilize Symmetry and Congruency:** Construct an equilateral triangle (PAD) with (AD = PA). Since (triangle ADB) and (triangle APC) are congruent by SAS (Side-Angle-Side) as they share ( angle PAD = angle Dad ) and (AD = PA), therefore (BD = PC). Here, (triangle BDP) is our required triangle with sides (PA), (PB), and (PC). 3. **Non-Degeneracy:** Ensure that (P) is not on the circumcircle of (triangle ABC). If (D) lies on (BP), making the triangle degenerate, then (angle APB = angle ACB). Since (P) lies inside but not on the circumcircle, the corresponding triangle (triangle BDP) is not degenerate. 4. **Represent Points Using Complex Numbers:** Place (A), (B), (C), and (P) on the complex plane as (1), (omega), (omega^2), and (z) respectively, where (omega = e^{2pi i/3}) and (omega^2 = e^{-2pi i/3}). Note that (|omega| = 1) and (1 + omega + omega^2 = 0). 5. **Formulate Triangle Vertices:** The side lengths (a), (b), and (c) of the triangle are (|1 - z|), (|omega - z|), and (|omega^2 - z|), respectively. We construct a triangle with vertices at (0), (omega z - omega^2), and (omega^2 z - omega). 6. **Area Calculation Using Complex Numbers:** Using the complex number representation, the area of a triangle with vertices (1), (h), and (k) can be given by the imaginary part of (frac{1}{2}(h'k)), where (h') is the complex conjugate of (h). Here, (h = omega z - omega^2) and (k = omega^2 z - omega). 7. **Imparting Imaginary Numbers:** We calculate (frac{1}{2}(omega^2 - omega z - omega omega^2 bar{z} + bar{z})). Given (omega^2 omega = -1), and remembering that (omega) has an imaginary part of (-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) and (omega^2) has an imaginary part of (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}), we focus on imaginary components to compute the triangle’s area. 8. **Combining Results:** Observe that the imaginary contributions simplifying gives (frac{sqrt{3}}{4} (1 - |z|^2)). Since (|z| = |PO|), the area indeed depends only on (|PO|). # Conclusion: Hence, the area of the triangle with sides (|PA|), (|PB|), and (|PC|) depends solely on (|PO|), concluding the proof. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A student, after receiving their monthly allowance, decides to go on a shopping spree.

The formula for compound interest is: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount) r = the annual interest rate (decimal) n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years In Louie's case: P = 1000 r = 10% per month = 0.10 per month n = 1 (since interest is compounded monthly) t = 3 months = 3/12 year First, we convert the time period to years since the formula requires it. Since Louie's loan is for 3 months, we convert this to years by dividing by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year): t = 3 months / 12 months/year = 0.25 years Now we can plug the values into the formula: A = 1000(1 + 0.10/1)^(1*0.25*12) Since the interest is compounded monthly, we multiply the time in years by 12 to get the total number of compounding periods: A = 1000(1 + 0.10)^(3) A = 1000(1.10)^3 Now we calculate the value: A = 1000 * 1.10^3 A = 1000 * 1.331 A = 1331 Now that we have the total amount Louie owes after 3 months, we can calculate the equal monthly payments he needs to make to repay the loan.

It is given that (angle FAB = 50^circ) and (angle FBA = 20^circ). We need to find the measure of (angle FCA). 1. First, let's note the form of the ellipse: [ frac{x^{2}}{25} + frac{y^{2}}{9} = 1 ] This is horizontal ellipse with semi-major axis (a = 5) and semi-minor axis (b = 3). 2. The foci (F) of an ellipse are at ((pm c, 0)), where (c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = sqrt{25 - 9} = sqrt{16} = 4). Hence, the left focus (F) is at ((-4, 0)). 3. Since (C) is on the left directrix, and the directrices of an ellipse are located at (x = pm frac{a^2}{c} = frac{25}{4}), thus the left directrix is at (x = -frac{25}{4}). 4. We draw line (l) passing through point (C), intersecting the ellipse at points (A) and (B). 5.

Since (A) and (B) are points of intersection: * The length (CA cdot C) is proportional to the distance (AF cdot CF). 6. Now, by the properties of the ellipse and geometry of the problem: Since (|FA| = |FC|), and since (FC) is the external bisector of (angle AFB), the angle bisector properties give: [ angle CFA = frac{1}{2}(angle FAB + angle FBA) = frac{1}{2}(50^circ + 20^circ) = 35^circ ] 7.

For a normal distribution, the probability P(X > 2) = 0.2 implies that the area to the right of X = 2 under the normal curve is 0.2. By symmetry and properties of the normal distribution, P(X < 0) = 0.2 because the same area lies to the left of X = 0. Therefore, the probability that X lies between 0 and 2 is given by: P(0 < X < 2) = 1 - P(X > 2) - P(X < 0) = 1 - 0.2 - 0.2 = 0.6 Since P(0 < X < 1) is part of P(0 < X < 2), and given the symmetry and properties of the normal distribution, P(0 < X < 1) cannot be equal to 0.2.

Clearly, ( b_1 < b_2 < cdots < b_n ), and we have: sum_{k=1}^{i} a_k geq sum_{k=1}^{i} b_k quad text{for} ; 1 leqslant i leqslant n. 5. Let's now prove a useful inequality. For ( x, y in mathbb{R}_{+} ), we need to show: frac{x-y}{2sqrt{x}} leq sqrt{x} - sqrt{y}. By the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM), we have: x + y geq 2sqrt{xy}. Therefore, x - y leq 2x - 2sqrt{xy}. Rearranging the terms, we deduce: frac{x-y}{2sqrt{x}} leq sqrt{x} - sqrt{y}. 6. Returning to our problem, observe that: sum_{i=1}^{n} sqrt{a_i} - sum_{i=1}^{n} sqrt{b_i} = sum_{i=1}^{n} left(sqrt{a_i} - sqrt{b_i}right). Applying the inequality proved in step 5, we get: sum_{i=1}^{n} sqrt{a_i} - sum_{i=1}^{n} sqrt{b_i} geq sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{a_i - b_i}{2sqrt{a_i}}. Simplifying the sum, we have: sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{a_i - b_i}{2sqrt{a_i}} = sum_{i=1}^{n} left(frac{1}{2sqrt{a_i}} - frac{1}{2sqrt{a_{i+1}}}right) sum_{j=1}^{i} (a_j - b_j) geq 0. 7. The equality holds only when ( a_i = b_i ) for (1 leqslant i leqslant n ). Therefore, for the minimum value of ( sum_{i=1}^{n} sqrt{a_i} ), we should have: S' = {b_1, b_2, b_3, cdots, b_n} = {1, 2, 4, cdots, 2^{n-1}}. 8. Finally, the minimal value of ( sum_{i=1}^{n} sqrt{a_i} ) is: sum_{i=1}^{n} sqrt{b_i} = sqrt{1} + sqrt{2} + sqrt{2^2} + cdots + sqrt{2^{n-1}}. This simplifies to: left[(sqrt{2})^{n} - 1right](sqrt{2} + 1). # Conclusion: Therefore, the minimum value of ( sqrt{a_1} + sqrt{a_2} + cdots + sqrt{a_n} ) is given by: boxed{left[(sqrt{2})^{n} - 1right](sqrt{2} + 1)}"},{"prompt":"Find the smallest positive integer n that is divisible by 100 and has exactly 100 divisors.","completion":"1. **Understanding the problem**: We need to find the smallest positive integer ( n ) that is divisible by ( 100 ) and has exactly ( 100 ) divisors. 2. **Divisibility by 100**: For ( n ) to be divisible by ( 100 ), it must be divisible by both ( 2^2 ) and ( 5^2 ).

If (a) and (b) are integers that are not coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor (d = mathrm{GCD}(a, b) > 1)), then the point ((a, b)) is invisible from the origin. This is because the point ((frac{a}{d}, frac{b}{d})) lies on the segment between ((0,0)) and ((a, b)), excluding the endpoints. 2. **Invisible Point Condition**: Now, we need to show that if ((a, b)) is invisible from the origin, then (a) and (b) must share a common divisor greater than 1. If ((a, b)) is invisible, there exists (t in (0, 1)) such that both (ta) and (tb) are integers. Assuming (a neq 0) (we can always swap (a) and (b)), (t) must be rational and can be written as (frac{c}{d}), where (c) and (d) are coprime integers. Since (frac{ca}{d}) and (frac{cb}{d}) are integers, (d) must divide both (a) and (b), implying that (a) and (b) are not coprime, otherwise (d = 1) and (frac{c}{d}) would not be in ((0, 1)). 3. **Defining the Square of Points**: To find a square of (n^2) points in (mathbb{Z}^2) that are all invisible from the origin, we consider a square grid defined as: [ {M, M+1, ldots, M+n-1} times {M', M'+1, ldots, M'+n-1}. ] For each ((i, j)) in the range ({0, ldots, n-1}), we want (M+i) and (M'+j) to share a common prime divisor. 4. **Existence of Suitable M and M'**: We can achieve this by choosing (n^2) pairwise distinct primes ({p_{i,j}}_{0 leq i,j < n}).

In how many days was the whole work completed?","completion":"First, let's find out the fraction of the work each person can complete in a day. A can complete the work in 15 days, so in one day, A can complete 1/15 of the work. B can complete the work in 10 days, so in one day, B can complete 1/10 of the work. C can complete the work in 12 days, so in one day, C can complete 1/12 of the work. When they work together for the first 2 days, they can complete: (1/15 + 1/10 + 1/12) of the work per day. Let's calculate this sum: (1/15 + 1/10 + 1/12) = (2/30 + 3/30 + 2.5/30) = (7.5/30) = 1/4 of the work per day. In 2 days, they complete: 2 * (1/4) = 1/2 of the work. Now, half of the work is done, and B leaves. A and C continue to work together for the next 3 days. Together, they can complete: (1/15 + 1/12) of the work per day. Let's calculate this sum: (1/15 + 1/12) = (4/60 + 5/60) = 9/60 = 3/20 of the work per day. In 3 days, A and C complete: 3 * (3/20) = 9/20 of the work. Now, let's add the work done in the first 2 days and the next 3 days: 1/2 + 9/20 = (10/20 + 9/20) = 19/20 of the work. This means that 19/20 of the work is completed, and 1/20 of the work is left. Now, A has to complete this remaining work alone. Since A can complete 1/15 of the work in one day, to complete 1/20 of the work, A will take: (1/20) / (1/15) = (1/20) * (15/1) = 15/20 = 3/4 days.

Then: [ f'(x) = left[ 2(x+a) cdot 1 + b right] e^x = [(x + a + 1)^2 + b - 1] e^x ] 5. **Determine when ( f'(x) ) is positive:** From the derivative ( f'(x) ): [ f'(x) = [(x + a + 1)^2 + b - 1] e^x ] For ( f'(x) ) to be positive for all ( x ), the expression inside the brackets must be positive for all ( x ): [ (x + a + 1)^2 + b - 1 > 0 ] Since ( (x + a + 1)^2 geq 0 ) for all ( x ), ( b - 1 > 0 ) ensures the entire expression inside the brackets is positive for all ( x ). Therefore: [ b > 1 ] **Conclusion for part (a):** Since ( b ) could be any constant not necessarily greater than 1, ( f'(x) ) does not have to be positive for all ( x ): [ boxed{text{No}} ] Question (b): Is ( g(x) ) necessarily positive for all ( x )? Given that ( g'(x) > 0 ) for all ( x ), let us analyze whether ( g(x) ) must be positive. 1. **Consider ( g(x) )'s properties:** Since ( g'(x) > 0 ) for all ( x ), ( g(x) ) is a strictly increasing function. 2. **Implications of a strictly increasing function:** If ( g'(x) ) is continuous and positive for all ( x ), and if ( g(x) ) were to be zero at any point ( x = c ), then for all ( x < c ): [ g(x) < g(c) = 0 ] 3. **Since ( g'(x) ) is positive, it is not possible for ( g(x) ) to be zero or negative for any ( x ):** Thus ( g(x) > 0 ) for all ( x ). **Conclusion for part (b):** Given that ( g(x) ) is strictly increasing and never decreases ( g(x) ): [ boxed{text{Yes}} ]"},{"prompt":"Petya wrote a natural number ( A ) on the board.

Let's begin by understanding the conditions. 1. **Condition 1:** If 8A is a perfect square, then any prime factor of A other than 2 must appear to an even power in its prime factorization, and the power of 2 must be odd. Let 8A = n^2 where n is a natural number. Since 8 = 2^3, the equation can be written as: [ 2^3 A = n^2 ] 2. Rewriting A in terms of squares: [ A = frac{n^2}{8} ] Thus, the factorization of A must be such that multiplying by 8 results in a perfect square. 3. **Condition 2:** The product A cdot B must also be a perfect square. This means A cdot B = m^2 for some natural number m. # Analyzing B: To meet Condition 1: - If A = 2a^2 with an odd number of factors of 2, and any other prime factor occurring in even powers (since 8A = n^2), B must have factors that balance the power of 2 to make the product A cdot B = k^2 a perfect square.

Suppose point A is mapped to A_{1} via a reflection about line s, and A_{1} is then mapped to A^{prime} via a reflection about line s^{prime}. 3. Given that s parallel s^{prime}, both A A_{1} and A A^{prime} are perpendicular to both axes. Thus, points A, A_{1}, and A^{prime} lie in the same plane, which is perpendicular to both s and s^{prime}. 4. Let's denote the intersection as follows: (A A_{1}) cap s = M and (A_{1} A^{prime}) cap s^{prime} = M^{prime}. 5. Since the reflections are symmetrical, the following properties hold: [ overrightarrow{AM} = overrightarrow{MA_{1}}, quad overrightarrow{A_{1}M^{prime}} = overrightarrow{M^{prime}A^{prime}} ] 6.

This template ensures that swapping ( a_p ) and ( a_{p+1} ) does not change the number of valid arrangements. 3. **Consequence of the template structure**: If the template includes two non-consecutive cells in a column, then ( L = 0 ) because the strict monotonicity in columns would be impossible to maintain.
