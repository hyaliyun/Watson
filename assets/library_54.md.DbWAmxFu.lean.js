Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info! Admin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days. Please feel free to open a new one if you have more news or want to continue the discussion about the upcoming Squish cartoon. Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September Thread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! ☀️📺 GreenJelly223: Summer’s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB’s lineup! We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing Thread Title: Revealed: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!✨🤖 CartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery’s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in fall when the new shows premiere, Lyoko is sticking around, Gumball and Craig are back, but won’t be for long, leaving again in January, Also, a user says Skatoony will definitely be back next year, as it has been a summer replacement show since 2018 Thread Title: Fall Premieres are Here! Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! I thought I’d list properties exclusive to each block (24/7 channel in 4Kids TV’s case) effective April 13 4Kids TV Exclusive Shows: Glitter Force: A team of teenage girls become superheroes to save the world from a group of fairytale monsters who want to revive the evil Emperor Nogo, Four Eyes!: Emma is a 11 year old squid-like, four eyed pink alien girl from Albacore 7, who is sent from her planet to Payne Academy Boarding School on Earth to repeat 5th grade, Her only friends are 2 boys named Pete and Skyler, The worst part is that her human form is a stereotypical geek, complete with buckteeth and glasses, But with a bit of resourcefulness, life in boarding school will no longer have any suprises for her Tomodachi Life: Joseph is mayor of the madcap Greenock Island, He has to stop the island from falling into chaos every day, but with the help from his fellow Miis, life in a island is easy. One Piece: Monkey D. Luffy and his friends: The Straw Hat Pirates set out in search of the legendary One Piece, hidden by Gol. D Roger CW4Kids Exclusive Shows: The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: Gloopy, a teal gooey blob and his best friend Glitter, a sparkling fuschia (still gooey) blob, hail from the planet of Gloopiter, Laugh along as they travel through the galaxy Code Lyoko: A group of kids: Jeremy, Aelita, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi do battle against a evil computer program XANA in a virtural world known as Lyoko The Gees (shorts, so shown inbetween shows): Meet G-Girl, G-Boy and G-Cat, the world’s first alien visitors, Unlike B-movie horror villans, these are kind, but annoying aliens, They always try to get involved in human activity, of which they understand nothing, Even to the point where humans think horror movie monsters would be more desirable than these “peaceful” Gees. The Owl (also shorts): Life is hard for this pink owl, Despite wanting to relax on his bench, bad luck has other plans for him, No matter what, this poor owl has the worst luck possible, and always ends each episode blown to smithereens, Do us a favor and don’t laugh: it’s cruel Write a follow up where a user says Shaman King is also 4Kids TV exclusive, and on another note the company seems to have 4 normal toons under their wing now (GGR, FE, TAOG&G and Cl), The shorts don’t count Thread Title: CW4Kids & 4Kids TV’s Exclusive Toons & Updates 📺✨ RetroToonFan: Just wanted to point out that Shaman King is also a 4Kids TV exclusive! Pretty exciting to see them bringing back this epic adventure. On another note, it seems like 4Kids Entertainment now officially has four main cartoons under their wing for CW4Kids - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, Four Eyes!, Glitter Force, and Code Lyoko. ToonEnthusiast123: That’s right! Shaman King’s inclusion is a big win for 4Kids TV. It adds a good mix of action and mystical drama to their lineup. As for CW4Kids, seeing them maintain a unique blend with shows like Gloopy and Glitter is fascinating. I’m curious how this balance between nostalgia and newer properties will play out for them. PixelDoodler: Super pumped for Shaman King! It’s such an underrated gem. But let’s talk about CW4Kids - Gloopy and Glitter represent such a fresh take on adventurous toons, while Code Lyoko offers that sci-fi intrigue. With Four Eyes! and Glitter Force, it’s like 4Kids is exploring diverse genres to cater to everyone. AnimationAficionado: It’s interesting to analyze 4Kids Entertainment’s approach. They seem to be carefully selecting shows to cater to various interests, ensuring a diverse palette. However, I wonder if they’re considering expanding their repertoire further beyond these four main attractions and occasional shorts like The Gees and The Owl. DigitalBytes: Don’t forget those shorts! Even though they’re not considered part of the “main” lineup, they add a lot of character to the programming. The Gees and The Owl have their own unique charm that fills in the gaps quite nicely. But yes, the main toon lineup shows a strategic approach to appealing across the board. SketchyArtKid: Honestly, The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter have been such a breath of fresh air. It’s always great seeing how creative shows can get, and having Code Lyoko sticking around gives the lineup that solid anchor. I’m eagerly waiting to see if 4Kids plans to introduce more “normal toons” to CW4Kids or if they’ll continue to diversify with more shorts. ToonTalker91: With Shaman King on 4Kids TV and the mix of adventures and sci-fi on CW4Kids, it’s like they’re trying to secure every corner of the toon spectrum. The real question is, what’s next? Will they lean more into these established genres, or is there another surprise genre they’re aiming to introduce? Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with the discussions and speculations! Our goal is to offer a range of programming that appeals to various tastes while pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in the lineup. Your favorite might just be around the corner. Thanks for your continued support! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a convo in late April where TL is going away, G&G is coming to 4Kids TV to take its place, Also Kirby is leaving the CW in late May, our currently 24/7 channel exclusive alien is taking its place Thread Title: Late April Shakeup: Tomodachi Life Departing, G&G and Alien Surprise Incoming! 🌌📺 ToonMasterJay: Heads up, team! Just caught wind that Tomodachi Life’s journey on CW4Kids is wrapping up by end of April. Bittersweet, but hey, every season finale preludes a new beginning, right? And guess what’s making waves? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is migrating from CW to 4Kids TV! DigitalToonFan: Whoa, serious moves in the lineup! “Tomodachi Life” had a quirky charm, for sure. But “Gloopy and Glitter” hopping over to 4Kids TV? Interesting switch. They’ve got that intergalactic buddy vibe that could really shine there. And Kirby’s space? Filled by our beloved 24/7 channel exclusive alien, huh? Intriguing! AnimationAficionado: Honestly, “Gloopy and Glitter” has that universal appeal (pun intended), perfect for 4Kids TV. But I’m really curious about our exclusive alien friend taking up residence on CW in place of Kirby. Such a mystery! Any teasers on who this extraterrestrial might be? GoGoFan223: Sad to see Kirby float off into the sunset, but excited for the alien to land! “Gloopy and Glitter” always had that zany, out-of-this-world vibe that’ll probably resonate well on 4Kids TV. As for the alien, fingers crossed for something as charismatic and engaging! SonicXforever: “Tomodachi Life” leaving is like the end of an era, but change is the name of the game. “Gloopy and Glitter” will surely bring their sparkle to 4Kids TV. Now, about our alien – could this mean even more cosmic adventures? CW4Kids and 4Kids TV really know how to keep the universe expanding. PokeNostalgia101: A little heartbroken over Kirby’s departure – those adventures were a blast. But, if the CW4Kids tradition holds, our new alien amigo will fill those boots and then some. As for “Gloopy and Glitter”, those two are about to become interstellar icons over at 4Kids TV. LyokoLover: It’s always interesting to see how these shifts play out. “G&G” has been doing well, so 4Kids TV seems like a logical next chapter for them. Meanwhile, Kirby leaving a void? Let’s hope our new alien resident brings a blend of humor and adventure to fill that vacuum. ComicStripKid: So much happening! While I’ll miss the faces leaving, “Gloopy and Glitter’s” move and the mysterious alien arrival promise fresh storylines and laughs. The CW4Kids universe seems to be ever-evolving. Here’s hoping the alien is as entertaining as our departing friends! ToonTalker91: Changes abound! It’s the cosmic cycle of toon life - some shows set beyond the horizon while new stars rise. “Gloopy and Glitter” will definitely add their unique luster to 4Kids TV. Eagerly awaiting our alien’s unveiling. May it bring a galaxy of new stories to explore! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with your enthusiasm and speculations! Transitions, like the ones you’re seeing, are part of our commitment to keeping our lineup fresh and engaging. Rest assured, “Gloopy and Glitter” and our new extraterrestrial addition are just the beginning of more exciting things to come. Stay tuned and keep watching — adventure is always around the corner!

Seems like our screens will be hosting quite the interstellar party! ToonMasterJay: The addition of “Four Eyes!” really solidifies the extraterrestrial theme they’re going for. But here’s a thought – what if 4Kids is plotting an Alien Hour for the summer? Imagine back-to-back alien adventures, capped off with “The Gees” in between as a quirky interlude. That’d be something! DigitalToonFan: An Alien Hour would be epic! “Four Eyes!”, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”, plus “The Gees” shorts? Sounds like a perfect blend of cosmic chaos and laughter. It’s like they’re curating a dedicated space block for all of us sci-fi toon heads. GoGoFan223: Loving the sound of that! An Alien Hour could really showcase the diversity in their extraterrestrial storytelling. Plus, “The Gees” slots in so naturally – they bring a unique charm that could glue the whole hour together. SonicXforever: The potential for an Alien Hour got me thinking – 4Kids has always been about pushing creative boundaries. This could be their way of testing the waters for more themed hours. And honestly, who doesn’t love a good alien tale? PokeNostalgia101: If anyone can make an Alien Hour work, it’s 4Kids. They’ve got a knack for mixing up genres and themes in the coolest ways. And with “The Gees” as comedic relief? Count me in! Just hoping the variety stays fresh and keeps us on our toes. LyokoLover: The more I think about it, the more I get on board with the Alien Hour idea. These characters and stories offer so much in terms of creativity and fun. It’s a brilliant way to keep viewers engaged, especially over the summer when everyone’s looking for an escape. ComicStripKid: An Alien Hour seems like a great strategy to pull viewers into a universe 4Kids is crafting. I mean, alien adventures are timeless, and integrating “The Gees” means there’s never a dull moment. Here’s hoping they take the leap and make it happen! ToonTalker91: It’s all about creating an experience, and an Alien Hour could really set a unique tone for the summer. Plus, it’d give “Four Eyes!” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a fantastic platform to shine even brighter. Fingers crossed 4Kids goes for it!

From sequels and reboots to fresh dubs of hit anime, it looks like CW4Kids is aiming to cater to a wide audience this fall. Also, can’t help but wonder how “Code Lyoko” will interact with these new additions. ComicStripKid: “Redakai” and “Pokémon Horizons” will be great for keeping that action-adventure vibe going strong, while “My Dad the Spy” could add a wholesome yet thrilling family dynamic. Plus, those shorts like “The Owl” are perfect palate cleansers between heavier shows. ToonTalker91: “Vampire Hunters” could be the wildcard of the bunch, considering its origin.

I’m genuinely surprised but kind of saw it coming after “Tomodachi Life” vanished and WoQ took over its webpage on 4kids.tv back in April. It was like a silent drumroll! ToonArchivist42: Yeah, I noticed the webpage swap too! It was pretty low-key, but definitely hinted at something big. “World of Quest” has that unique blend of humor and adventure that’s been missing. Glad CW4Kids is bringing back some fan favorites.

The show always had potential; it just needed the right moment to shine again. Looks like that time is now.

That show was a gem that deserved more spotlight. And “Four Eyes!” has that fresh, quirky vibe that could really resonate with the audience. CW4Kids is on a roll here. ToonTalker91: The block extension to 12:30pm is curious. It’s like they’re pacing themselves for a larger strategy, possibly eyeing to dominate the Saturday morning cartoon space even more. More shows mean more diversity in content, and I’m all for that. PixelPundit: As much as I love this news, I wonder how they’ll pace the introduction of “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” within the current lineup.

Léa, Verseau, esprit libre et sociable.** **Léa** : (*s'approche de Lucas avec un grand sourire*) Salut Lucas! Super jeu aujourd'hui, tu étais vraiment en feu sur le terrain. **Lucas** : (*rougissant légèrement*) Oh, euh, merci Léa. Je... je m'entraîne beaucoup, c’est sympa de ta part de le remarquer. **Léa** : (*riant légèrement*) Je le remarque toujours. J'aime bien comment tu es toujours à fond dans ce que tu fais, c’est inspirant. Tu as des plans pour ce weekend? **Lucas** : (*surpris, essayant de garder son calme*) Ah, pas vraiment. Je pensais peut-être... euh, regarder le match de l'équipe nationale et... et peut-être quelques entraînements personnels. Rien de spécial. **Léa** : Cool! Je cherchais justement quelqu'un avec qui discuter du match. Tu penses... qu’on pourrait le regarder ensemble? Je pourrais apporter des snacks. **Lucas** : (*les yeux s'élargissent, clairement pas habitué à ce genre d'attention*) Vraiment? Ça... ça serait super! Oui, je veux dire, regarder le match ensemble, ça serait génial. **Léa** : (*avec enthousiasme*) Génial! J’adore rencontrer des gens qui partagent mes passions. Et tu parais être quelqu'un de vraiment posé et réfléchi, ça change de ce que je vois d’habitude. **Lucas** : (*souriant, gagnant un peu plus de confiance*) Merci, Léa. Tu es... vraiment cool et c’est facile de parler avec toi. J’admire ça, surtout pour quelqu'un d’aussi sociable et ouvert. **Léa** : (*clignant de l'œil*) Et bien, dis-toi que tu es déjà un grand sportif, Lucas.

Leur dynamique reflète la curiosité du Verseau et la quête d'harmonie de la Balance, leurs signes zodiacaux influençant leur manière d'entrer en relation l'un avec l'autre."},{"prompt":"Mais pour toi une balance et une verseau sont faits pour entendre","completion":"En astrologie, les signes de la Balance et du Verseau sont généralement considérés comme étant hautement compatibles. Voici les raisons principales de cette harmonie : 1. **Éléments complémentaires** : La Balance est un signe d’Air, tout comme le Verseau. Les signes d’Air ont tendance à avoir beaucoup de points communs, tels que leur agilité intellectuelle, leur affection pour les discussions et leur vision orientée vers l'avenir. Cette similitude élémentaire est une base solide pour une compréhension mutuelle. 2. **Communication** : La Balance et le Verseau attachent une grande importance à la communication dans leurs relations. Les Balances, avec leur diplomatie innée, et les Verseaux, avec leur honnêteté et originalité, trouvent souvent un terrain d'entente où les échanges sont à la fois stimulants et respectueux. 3. **Besoins en liberté** : Les Verseaux valorisent leur indépendance et leur espace personnel, ce que les Balances, aimant le calme et l'harmonie, sont souvent prêtes à respecter. Cela peut aider à établir une relation où chacun se sent libre et soutenu. 4. **Valeurs** : Tant les Balances que les Verseaux ont un fort sens de la justice et se passionnent pour les causes sociales. Cette connexion sur des valeurs partagées peut renforcer leur lien et leur engagement mutuel envers des objectifs communs. 5. **Innovation vs. Harmonie** : Les Verseaux sont connus pour leur côté innovateur et parfois excentrique, ce qui peut fasciner et dynamiser une Balance qui cherche l’équilibre et l'harmonie. La Balance, à son tour, peut apporter une perspective apaisante et pragmatique, aidant le Verseau à mieux canaliser ses énergies. Néanmoins, il est important de se rappeler que l’astrologie peut offrir des perspectives intéressantes sur les personnalités et les relations mais ne détermine pas tout. Chaque relation est unique, et le succès d'une relation dépend des individus impliqués, de leur communication, de leurs efforts, et de leur compréhension mutuelle, bien au-delà de leur signe solaire."},{"prompt":"C'est quoi diplomatie","completion":"La diplomatie est un terme qui désigne principalement la conduite des négociations et des relations entre les pays, mais il englobe également des compétences et des comportements dans le contexte des interactions personnelles et professionnelles. Dans ce cadre plus large, la diplomatie implique la capacité à gérer les situations et les conversations de manière à préserver les relations, résoudre ou éviter les conflits, et parvenir à des accords mutuellement bénéfiques. Dans le détail, voici quelques aspects clés de la diplomatie : 1. **Communication efficace** : La diplomatie nécessite la capacité à communiquer clairement et de manière convaincante, tout en étant ouvert aux perspectives des autres. Cela implique souvent de savoir écouter activement et de répondre de manière réfléchie. 2. **Sensibilité culturelle et émotionnelle** : Être diplomate signifie comprendre les différences culturelles et reconnaître les émotions des autres. Cela aide à adapter sa manière de communiquer pour respecter et valoriser les diverses perspectives. 3. **Résolution de conflits** : Une compétence clé en diplomatie est la capacité à naviguer et à résoudre les conflits d'une manière qui minimise les dommages aux relations. Cela peut impliquer de trouver des compromis ou des solutions créatives qui répondent aux besoins de toutes les parties impliquées. 4. **Discrétion et tact** : La diplomatie exige souvent de la discrétion et du tact, c'est-à-dire la capacité de dire et de faire les choses de manière à éviter l'offense, à ménager la susceptibilité des autres et à gérer les situations délicates avec soin. 5. **Persuasion et influence** : Un diplomate compétent peut persuader les autres et influencer les résultats sans recourir à la coercition, en utilisant plutôt le raisonnement, l'appel aux valeurs communes et la création de consensus. 6. **Patience et persévérance** : Les processus diplomatiques prennent souvent du temps et requièrent de la patience et de la persévérance, que ce soit dans le cadre de négociations internationales ou de discussions plus personnelles ou professionnelles. Au final, la diplomatie est une compétence interpersonnelle précieuse qui permet d'entretenir des relations harmonieuses et constructives dans divers contextes."},{"prompt":"comienza con ana y su mejor amigo lu asentada en el sillón revisando una mochila para ver el documento de quien es la casa…(la casa de Martin ) a unos metros de ella está Martin embalado a la pata de una mesa…………ella mientras revisa la mochila de el le encuentra el documento para ver como se llama, además de encontrarle plata, cel y llaves del auto que se guarda…como fruta del postre ana le cuenta q va a pasar ahí una noche, ya que no tiene donde ir…que ana no para de dialogar y ser turra e ironica acento argentina que el no pueda emular respuestas o contestaciones porque le puso dos medias en la boca acompañadas de","completion":"Parece que estás describiendo una escena específica que podría pertenecer a un guion, un relato de ficción o una narración.

Before the restoration of the Ming dynasty as a Zhu-ruled restored Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China after Mao's death, the death of Soviet dictator's Josef Stalin's puppet in China before the establishment of the PRC in 1949 and brutal warlord and dictator of Nationalist China before and after the formation of the PRC in mainland China, Chiang Kai-Shek in 1975 lead to the overthrow of Nationalist China in exile on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands since 1949 and the subsequent restoration of the partially Han Chinese side branch of the Japanese imperial family, the supposedly Shinto pantheon-descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled combined rump state, satellite state and tributary kingdom of the Ming dynasty of the Tungning Kingdom as the government of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands after Kai-Shek's death.

Among the most significant of these transformations was the revival of the Ming dynasty, not through the line of Yuan Shikai’s progeny as might have been expected, but under the banner of the Zhu, a dynasty that had intertwined its destiny with the very fabric of what was once the unified Han China. This chapter seeks to explore the complexities and the historical path that led to the resurgence of the Ming dynasty through the Zhu lineage, following the fragmentation of the Chinese Communist regime and the resulting power vacuum. # The Fragmentation of Unity The death of Mao Zedong unleashed a pent-up whirlwind of separatist movements, each laying claim to distinct cultural, historical, and territorial identities. Manchuria, seizing the moment of instability, proclaimed the restoration of the Empire of Manchukuo, with the Aisin-Gioro lineage reclaiming their thrown amidst resounding acclamations. Simultaneously, Inner Mongolia revisited its roots, reviving the glory of Mengjiang under the venerable House of Borjigin. Mingled with these restorations was the profound rebirth of the Kingdom of Tibet, where the Lamaist tradition was reinstated as the central government authority, and the emergence of the combined Cantonian Republic from Guangdong and Guangxi. Shaanxi shocked the region by invoking the historical gravitas of the Han dynasty, anointing the House of Liu as its guiding beacon. Yunnan, in a parallel stride, witnessed the return of the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan through the resurgence of the Daili Kingdom, led by the indomitable Yunnan Clique. Each entity, in its assertion of independence, contributed to the fracturing of the once monolithic Chinese landscape, setting the stage for the resurgence of a new but familiar dynasty. # The Restoration of the Ming Central to this period of transformation was the strategic revival of the Ming dynasty under the Zhu lineage. Harnessing the chaos, the Zhu saw an opportunity not to merely reclaim their historical legacy but to redefine it within the modern context. They adeptly navigated the tumult, arriving at the forefront of a movement to consolidate the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty under a reimagined, stratocratic Ming regime. Modeling themselves on the short-lived Beiyang Government, the Zhu envisioned a military-dominated, yet parliamentary imperial structure. The renewed empire sought to integrate the modern governance models that had emerged during the Republic of China era, blending them with the traditional imperial lineage, a bold stroke aimed at unifying the diverse and divided territories. # The New Ming Ideology Central to the Zhu's success was the crafting of a New Ming Ideology, a sophisticated blend of Confucian principles, military stratocracy, and parliamentary governance. This ideology emphasized the unity of the Han people, respect for diverse cultures within the empire, and a strong central government capable of navigating the challenges of the modern world. # Diplomatic Maneuvers and International Recognition The restoration of the Ming dynasty was met with cautious optimism internationally. The Zhu dynasty, aware of their precarious position, embarked on a series of diplomatic initiatives aimed at garnering recognition and support. They reached out to the newly independent states, offering a vision of mutual respect and cooperation rather than dominance. In a surprising turn of events, the Cantonian Republic, with its robust economy and strategic position, emerged as a key ally, providing the New Ming with critical economic support in its infancy. Similarly, diplomatic outreach to the Empire of Manchukuo and the Kingdom of Tibet fostered an atmosphere of regional stability, as these entities sought to navigate their newfound independence in harmony rather than contention. # Conclusion The reestablishment of the Ming dynasty through the Zhu lineage marked a pivotal moment in Asian history. It symbolized not only the resurgence of a dynasty but the reimagining of governance, blending ancient imperial traditions with modern ideals. The New Ming era, thus, commenced not as a mere return to the past but as a courageous stride into the future, promising a harmonious blend of unity, tradition, and progress."},{"prompt":"Bluetooth 4.2 vs Bluetooth 5?","completion":"When comparing Bluetooth 4.2 to Bluetooth 5, there are several key improvements and changes in the newer version that enhance its functionality, speed, and range. Introduced in December 2016, Bluetooth 5 was a significant upgrade over its predecessor, Bluetooth 4.2, which was released in December 2014. Here are the main differences: 1. **Speed**: Bluetooth 5 offers faster data transmission with speeds up to 2 Mbps, which is double the maximum speed of Bluetooth 4.2, which tops out at 1 Mbps. This means quicker data transfer and improved efficiency. 2. **Range**: Bluetooth 5 significantly increases the operational range, offering four times the range of Bluetooth 4.2. This means Bluetooth 5 devices can communicate over distances of up to 240 meters (or 800 feet) in a clear line of sight under ideal conditions, as opposed to Bluetooth 4.2, which maxes out at approximately 60 meters (or 200 feet). This extended range opens up new possibilities for device usage and placement in homes and commercial spaces. 3. **Broadcasting Capacity**: Bluetooth 5 can handle 8 times more data in broadcasting messages than Bluetooth 4.2. This enhancement broadens the scope for IoT (Internet of Things) devices and applications, enabling richer information transfer in beacon and advertising data. 4. **Improved Interference Handling**: Bluetooth 5 has improved coexistence with other wireless technologies, reducing the likelihood of interference in crowded wireless environments. This means devices are more reliable in areas congested with many different types of wireless signals. 5. **LE (Low Energy) Improvements**: Although both versions support Bluetooth Low Energy, Bluetooth 5 introduces LE Long Range mode and LE 2M PHY, which means it can adjust for either longer range or faster speed, making it more versatile for different types of applications, especially in IoT devices. 6. **Indoor Positioning**: One of the new features of Bluetooth 5 is its ability to support location-based services with more precision, such as indoor navigation and tracking of assets within buildings, thanks to its enhanced broadcasting message capacity. 7. **Forward Compatibility**: Bluetooth 5 is designed to be forward compatible with future updates, which means devices are prepared to take advantage of improvements and new features in the Bluetooth standard as they become available. When upgrading from a device that supports Bluetooth 4.2 to one that supports Bluetooth 5, users will likely notice improvements in speed and range. However, to fully utilize the advantages of Bluetooth 5, both the transmitting and receiving devices need to support the newer standard. This compatibility ensures that users can experience the improvements in speed, range, and functionality offered by Bluetooth 5."},{"prompt":"XY-BT-MINI supports Bluetooth 4.1 or 4.2?","completion":"The XY-BT-MINI is a commonly referenced Bluetooth audio receiver module in various DIY and electronics projects.

However, there are a few approaches you can take to find out the Bluetooth version of a device connected to an Android phone or tablet: # 1. Check the Device Specifications The simplest way to find the Bluetooth version of a connected device is to look up its specifications. You can find this information on the manufacturer's website, in the product's manual, or by searching online with the device model number. This method provides you with detailed information about the device, including its Bluetooth version. # 2. Use a Third-Party App There are several third-party apps available on the Google Play Store that can provide detailed information about connected Bluetooth devices, including the Bluetooth version. Apps like \\"Bluetooth Scanner\\" or \\"BLE Scanner\\" can scan and list nearby or connected Bluetooth devices along with some details about each device. While not all apps will display the Bluetooth version explicitly, they might offer other useful information about the device's capabilities. # 3. Developer Options (For Android Developers) For users with development knowledge or those who have enabled developer options on their Android device, you can use Android's built-in tools to get information about connected Bluetooth devices. This isn't a direct way to see the Bluetooth version, but it can give insights into the supported Bluetooth profiles and services. To enable Developer Options: - Go to Settings > About Phone. - Tap on the Build Number seven times to enable Developer Options. - Return to Settings, and you’ll see Developer Options listed. From here, you might be able to use Bluetooth HCI snoop logging to capture data about Bluetooth connections, but interpreting this information requires a good understanding of Bluetooth protocols. # 4. Consult the Device's Settings or Companion App Some Bluetooth devices, especially wearables like smartwatches or fitness trackers, have companion apps that provide detailed information about the device, including firmware and possibly Bluetooth version. Check the device settings or any companion app that comes with the device. # Limitations It's important to note that while these methods can provide useful information, directly finding the Bluetooth version of a connected device through Android settings without external resources is usually not possible for the average user. If you're trying to determine whether a particular device will work with another based on Bluetooth compatibility, the best source of information is typically the device's specifications provided by the manufacturer. As of my last update in 2023, Android does not offer a built-in feature to display the Bluetooth versions of connected devices directly. For the most accurate and specific information, always refer to the device's documentation or contact the manufacturer directly."},{"prompt":"Can you tell me a percentage of energy efficiency improvements of Bluetooth 5.2 compared with 4.1?

Before the restoration of the Ming dynasty as a Zhu-ruled restored Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China after Mao's death, the death of Soviet dictator's Josef Stalin's puppet in China before the establishment of the PRC in 1949 and brutal warlord and dictator of Nationalist China before and after the formation of the PRC in mainland China, Chiang Kai-Shek in 1975 lead to the overthrow of Nationalist China in exile on Taiwan and the Pengu Islands since 1949 and the subsequent restoration of the partially Han Chinese side branch of the Japanese imperial family, the supposedly Shinto pantheon-descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled combined rump state, satellite state and tributary kingdom of the Ming dynasty of the Tungning Kingdom as the government of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands after Kai-Shek's death. Nationalist China returns to its [Nationalist China's] pre-1949 stronghold of Guangdong and Guangxi after the restoration of the Ming dynasty as a Zhu-ruled restored Beiyang Government-ruled Empire of China after Mao's death and immediately gets taken over by Cantonese nationalist and Cantonese independence groups and activists in Guangdong and Guangxi upon returning to Guangdong and Guangxi, who use the military, economic and developmental aid given by both the Soviets and the Americans to \\"reclaim China\\" to Nationalist China to instead develop, rebuild and restore Guangdong and Guangxi, with some of the aid also being secretly sent to pro-democracy and anti-communist guerilla groups in Vietnam to overthrow the newly established communist Vietnamese government with the Empire of Vietnam ruled by the nativized Vietnamesed side-branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty, subsequently being restored as the government of all of Vietnam. Yunnan restores the the Daili Kingdom and the Daili Kingdom's imperial family, the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan to power via the restoration of the Chinese bandit faction/Chinese warlord faction/Nationalist Chinese government faction of the Yunnan Clique","completion":"# Chapter VI: The Dawn of the New Dynasties The death of Mao Zedong in 1976 marked a pivotal turning point in the history of the vast land known as China. The ideological stranglehold of the People's Republic of China began to weaken, leading to a period of fragmentation where ancient dynasties once thought relegated to the annals of history would find new life. Amidst this tumultuous backdrop, several regions embarked on paths to restore their historic sovereignties, culminating in the revival of imperial lineages and the establishment of autonomous republics. The Restoration of the Ming Dynasty Foremost among these seismic shifts was the restoration of the Ming dynasty under the Zhu-ruled, stratocratic Beiyang Government. The re-establishment of a military-dominated, yet parliamentary constitutional imperial monarchy represented a bold reimagining of governance. The descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu ascended to historical prominence once again, instilling a renewed sense of cultural identity and tradition among the populace. The Empire of Manchukuo and Beyond Parallel to the renaissance of the Ming, the vast stretches of Manchuria witnessed the rebirth of the Empire of Manchukuo. The Manchurian Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro, hitherto in the shadows of geopolitical tumult, was reinstated, signifying not only a political transformation but also a cultural reawakening. Similarly, Inner Mongolia, uniting the provinces of Chahar and Suiyan, saw the resurgence of Mengjiang and the illustrious Imperial House of Borjigin, tracing its lineage back to the Mongol Empire. Tibet, Guangdong and Guangxi, Shaanxi, and Yunnan charted their distinct trajectories, each embracing their unique heritage. Tibet revived the Kingdom of Tibet, while Guangdong and Guangxi unified to form an independent Cantonian Republic. Shaanxi took the revolutionary step of restoring the Han dynasty, and Yunnan resurrected the Daili Kingdom, signaling a potent resurgence of regional power and identity. The Struggle in Taiwan and Beyond The demise of Chiang Kai-Shek facilitated a paradigm shift in Taiwan. The reinstallation of the Japanese-Han Chinese Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng over the territories of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands heralded a new chapter for the region, intertwining Ming dynasty traditions with local governance. Upon their attempt to reconquer their former strongholds in Guangdong and Guangxi, the remnants of Nationalist China found themselves outmaneuvered by Cantonese nationalists, who redirected international support towards the reconstruction and empowerment of the newly minted Cantonian Republic. This unexpected outcome not only solidified the independence of Guangdong and Guangxi but also indirectly contributed to the ideological battleground in Vietnam, leading to the restoration of the Empire of Vietnam under the Vietnamese Imperial House of Nguyen. A New Era The dust settled over a transformed landscape, where the echoes of ancient dynasties blended with modern governance to create a mosaic of diversified power centers. These resurrected dynasties and republics, rooted in deep historical legacies, faced the future with a blend of cautious optimism and uncertainty. Their emergence challenged the status quo, ushering in a new era of multipolarity in what was once a homogenized sphere under communist rule. As historians look back on this period, it is seen as a time when history was not merely revisited but reborn, where ancient bloodlines and traditions found a place in the modern world. The dawn of the new dynasties marked not only a return to historical roots but also a bold step forward into uncharted territories of governance and cultural identity."},{"prompt":"Savey said on 01 December 2023 It appears the BBC One Christmas idents this year are focusing on CBBC show KikoRiki, Good considering the characters in that show are anthropomorphic animals, making them awesome for this time of year, I’d assume they will launch tonight in the junction between Doctor Who and Unbreakable, Doctor Who is their highest rating show, so it makes sense to lead into Unbreakable by launching the Christmas idents, Or they could hold it off till tommorow and launch them at Strictly. Whatever works. Currently still running with the normal dancers idents (when will they be retired, they’ve been used since 2002) Emma said on 01 December 2023 Hopefully S4C does something with their new blob mascot, Last year they had TV sets stacked up on top of each other, Then for 10 months they had flickering TV sets, They have finally rebranded and have introduced their first ever mascot: a shape-shifting blob, I hope BBC One rebrand soon, those dancers sure are getting tired, As for the KikoRiki themed Christmas idents, I was told they are launching tonight after Doctor Who, They are being introduced just before Unbreakable. HouseofFun said on 01 December 2023 Doctor Who ending now, announcement playing “A team of 8 people are pushed to the absolute limit, Unbreakable, our brand new game show is up next, But first, Time to say hello and spend Christmas with the Doctor” I’m not liking this one a whole lot…, They seem to be running a trailer advertising the Doctor Who Christmas special, which revolves around the Doctor having to protect his companions from a man who seeks to find a fob watch (the one The Doctor made himself human with one time), Although just before Doctor Who tonight they had a announcement saying “Christmas is switched on tonight in 1 hour in time for Unbreakable, But first, Is this the end for the Doctor?”. Doesn’t seem like they are advertising the Christmas pres at all, Edit: Christmas pres featuring KikoRiki switched on, First ident shown features Rosa the Pig doing a dramatic ice skate dance (She even uses eyedrops for fake tears) While this is happening we hear dramatic music, The announcer says “Welcome to Christmas on BBC One, Let us entertain you, But now a team of 8 people are being pushed to their absolute limits, Are they Unbreakable?” Not sure why they didn’t tell us it was happening untill it did, But still a gorgeous ident, I noticed when the Announcer started talking it sounded as if he was driven to tears by the beauty of Rosa’s gorgeous dance. The best thing to come out of this package since the “Lights” christmas idents in 2006, Eyes said on 01 December 2023 A beautiful ident, Best thing to come out of the “Rythm and Movement” package since those Planet Earth 3 special idents a few months ago, i feel sad that KikoRiki has not been shown much on CBBC on BBC Two, but I’m glad it’s representing the Xmas idents on BBC One (Although I also wish the idents also featured a merman). Maile said on 01 December 2023 Best Christmas ident in a while, I just love that they have spent it with Rosa and her friends, I hear there is also one featuring Krash the Rabbit opening his presents, I like how they used the usual ident theme (dancing) in that first ident, KikoRiki looks like it’s gonna be good this year, but I hope they do more with the style (and maybe finally retire Rythm and Movement idents) Faramad said on 01 December 2023 News safe ident just on, Basically just a Christmas tree on a snowy background, with a music box Christmas carol playing, on top of that the only thing we see is a sleeping Rosa (We vaguely hear her snoring) Glad they are now using characters in their news safe idents, Announcer said “Now on BBC One, time for the BBC News at 8”. Remember the Lights idents the used just before overhauling their promo style in late 2006/early 2007? That was pretty cool, but this is way better. I seem to remember those idents started on a dark street but Christmas lights started turning on before it got to a city center and then people were dancing, It was used again in 2007, And now it seems like the “Project Chameleon” endboard template introduced in July is out the window, at least for now, replaced with a snowy background with a Christmas tree on it. Signs that Rythm and Movement is finally working towards the end. KikoRiki said on 01 December 2023 We’re glad you love our cartoon and the special BBC One idents featuring our characters, However, Rosa will be the star, (We will have idents revolving around Chiko, Krash and the others), As to what you said, BBC One are looking into introducing the Circle idents already in use in other countries, so don’t expect to see Ballet, Capoeria or Festival/Rave back in the new year. Get used to Kites, Capes, Hippos and Bikes as that’s what might be coming after our Christmas campaign, We don’t know for certain, but the Dancers might not be coming back after Christmas WhovianForever: Did everyone catch the Doctor Who Christmas special announcement during the news? I’m so hyped! Can’t wait to see how the Doctor deals with the fob watch saga this holiday season! LemonyFan: And how about they’re showing the 2004 ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ movie!! That’s one of my holiday favorites; the nostalgia is real. 😍🍿 ChristmasCarol: Truly is shaping up to be a wonderful holiday schedule on BBC One. Between Doctor Who and the classic movies, I’m going to be glued to my screen with all the mulled wine and mince pies! KikoFanatic: Plus, the KikoRiki Christmas idents have been adorable so far! Rosa’s ice skate dance nearly brought tears to my eyes just like the announcer. 🐷⛸ Christmas is definitely switched on! RetroTV: I’m just here wondering if the new ‘Circle’ idents KikoRiki hinted at is a sign we’re finally saying goodbye to the “Rythm and Movement” package for good. After 20+ years, it’s about time for a major refresh! NostalgiaNerd: @RetroTV I’m with you on that. The Lights idents back in '06/'07 were beautiful. It’s cool to see they’re still willing to shake things up visually with the news safe ident this year. Sleepy Rosa might just be my new favorite. 😴🎄 SeriesBinger: Doctor Who special + A Series of Unfortunate Events + KikoRiki idents = Best Christmas TV lineup or what? Also, hope BBC One throws in some classic Christmas episodes of our favorite shows. Maybe some ‘Vicar of Dibley’ or ‘Only Fools and Horses’? CircleCurious: Anyone heard more about these new Circle idents? I love change, and KikoRiki characters have been great, but I’m already excited for what’s coming next. Bring on the new era! KikoLover: Just saw a new Krash and Chiko ident! They’re having a blast playing in the snow! ❄️🐇 So cute watching Krash throw snowballs while Chiko dodges around. Really captures the winter fun vibes. SciFiSavvy: Speaking of new idents, did anyone else notice the Dokko the Moose building a laser device ident? It aired right before ‘Doctor Who’ and set the PERFECT tone for sci-fi. Dokko’s always been the tech genius of the group. 🦌🔧 HedgehogAdmirer: @KikoLover Chiko is always adorable, but seeing him in the snow was next level! BBC One knows how to do Christmas idents right. Plus, the animation on these characters in the idents is super impressive this year. WhovianGuru: @SciFiSavvy Loved the Dokko ident! It’s like a mini episode of ‘Doctor Who’ in itself. Brilliant tie-in to the show’s theme! Makes waiting for the Christmas special even more exciting. BakeMaster: But guys, let’s talk about the Olga the Owl baking ident. The detail on that gingerbread house she was making! I can almost smell the cookies through the screen. 🦉🍪 It’s the cozy ident I never knew I needed in my life. HolidayWatcher: Right?! The Olga ident feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket with a hot chocolate in hand. It’s chef’s kiss perfection. BBC One’s going all out with these KikoRiki characters for Christmas. DoctorFan: Dokko’s ident was like a mini teaser for what’s coming with ‘Doctor Who’. Immersive and full of that tech mystery vibe. I appreciate that BBC One creates these unique intros for thematic continuity. AnimationAppreciator: Major kudos to the animation team for the KikoRiki idents. As someone who dabbles in animation, the quality is sensational. It’s like a little holiday gift before each show starts! ChristmasCheer: Can’t get enough of the snow play with Krash and Chiko. It’s absolutely delightful and spreads so much joy. These little moments provided by the idents add a special touch to the holiday season. SciCompanion: Dokko and his inventions always remind me that anything’s possible with a little imagination. Such an inspiring ident to lead into ‘Doctor Who’. Well played, BBC One! Can’t wait to see what else is in store, I’m gonna miss these idents when new year comes around! 😢 WelcomeToSciFi: The Dokko centric ident really sets the scene for what’s to come on ‘Doctor Who’ this Christmas. One of the best things about the KikoRiki set, Far better than the usual dancers, Come to think of it, they have been using the dancers since 2002, so now is a good time for a revamp, I guess 😉 Olgo5: Just saw the Olga ident and damn, Olga really is a talented chef, They always seem to show it before cooking shows, Which ident normally leads into Eastenders, It seems to vary between Krash and Chiko in the snow, Olga cooking and Rosa ice skating. Not sure how this is consistent, But that Rosa one brings tears to my eyes with her graceful skating, Not sure why the Dokko one only plays before Doctor Who, Maybe because it fits it well Prolouge: User1: So, what’s everyone thinking BBC One’s going to pull out of the hat for this year’s Christmas idents? Last year was decent, but I’m hoping for something with a bit more pizzazz. WhovianForever: I’m crossing my fingers for something Doctor Who-themed! With David Tennant back in the show earlier this year, it would be perfect timing to capitalize on that for the festive season. Can you imagine an ident with the TARDIS all decked out in Christmas lights? HolidayJoy: That would be cool for us Whovians, for sure, but BBC One usually goes for something that appeals to everyone. Doctor Who is big, but not universally loved by every single viewer. Plus, they tend to lean towards more generic festive symbols. SeriesBinger: True, they’ll probably aim for something more inclusive. Like a cozy winter scene or playful animation. Maybe bring back some classic characters or even partner with a popular children’s show this time around for wider appeal? RetroTV: I’ve got a hunch they’ll go with animation this year. It has that universal charm, right? Plus, it would work perfectly with both the kids’ content and the family-friendly vibe they love during Christmas. User1: That’s an interesting angle. They could get quite creative with animation. Plus, they’re probably due for a change since the “Rythm and Movement” dancers have been around since 2002. KikoFanatic: What if they teamed up with a show like KikoRiki? The characters are fun, visually engaging, and it’s something that would stand out. Plus, they could do loads with those quirky little animals. LemonyFan: KikoRiki would be such a cute choice! It could be a hit with children and adults alike if done right. And it’s refreshingly different from usual idents, without relying on something niche like a specific Doctor Who theme. WhovianForever: Okay, I see your point. Much as I’d love Doctor Who idents, something like KikoRiki could offer that ‘Christmas with the family’ vibe they probably want. I just hope they add a little extra magic this year, you know? CircleCurious: Whatever they do, I hope it’s something new. We’ve had the “Rythm and Movement” package idents for such a long time. It’s high time for something fresh and exciting to take us into the new year! Write a forum convo saying that the background used for the technical fault/show not avilailable on this platform/BBC One HD can’t show programmes from this area, is Rosa’s legs sticking out of icy waters, This means that for now, the purple/pink/white gradient used for the not available on this platform/BBC One HD can’t show programmes from this area background is out of use TechTVGuru: Hey folks, have you all noticed the new background BBC One is using for those “technical fault/show not available on this platform/BBC One HD can’t show programmes from this area” screens? It’s quite a departure from the usual purple/pink/white gradient we’ve become accustomed to. VisualMediaFan: Really? What did they switch it to? I haven’t caught it yet. TechTVGuru: It’s actually quite clever and in line with this year’s Christmas theme. They’ve gone for an image of Rosa’s legs sticking out of icy waters. It’s a whimsical yet subtle nod to the KikoRiki Christmas idents they’re running this season. AnimationAdmirer: That sounds hilarious! 😂 BBC One is really integrating KikoRiki into everything this Christmas, aren’t they? I love how they find ways to weave the theme across different areas, even in the technical backgrounds. ScreenSavvy: Gotta admire the creativity. Out with the old gradient and in with something that has a bit more charm and personality. But using Rosa’s legs, of all things—it’s a bold move. Does it work well in practice? VisualMediaFan: It definitely grabs your attention. And it’s nice to see something different for a change. That said, I wonder if everyone gets that it’s supposed to be playful, given it’s for a technical fault message or region restriction. TechTVGuru: True, but it’s such a quirky touch. Probably gives a little chuckle rather than the annoyance you’d feel with a standard error screen. Plus, it keeps the festive spirit alive, even when things aren’t going as planned. ErrorScreenEnthusiast: I must say, BBC One is becoming quite daring with their presentation. From the sound of it, Rosa’s legs are a memorable choice. Makes you almost hope for a technical hiccup just to see it. Almost. 😄 BroadcastingBuff: Do you think this indicates a more playful and adventurous direction for BBC One’s branding in general? Or is it just a seasonal flourish? TechTVGuru: Hard to say for sure, but it could signify a willingness to step outside the traditional boundaries, at least during the holiday season. Whether this carries over into other areas of their branding or presentation remains to be seen. I, for one, hope the creativity keeps up! VisualMediaFan: Same here. It’s refreshing to see them play around and be a bit more whimsical. Makes the whole experience of watching BBC One more fun, even when you’re just staring at a technical fault screen. RetroNostalgiaLover: Remember the days when a technical fault screen was just a boring logo or text message? It’s nice to see some evolution. Who knew we’d get to a point where we’re discussing the artistic merit of a technical fault background? 😆 TechTVGuru: Progress and creativity in the most unexpected places! Let’s see if this sparks a trend across other channels too. But for now, hats off to BBC One for making even the technical glitches a part of the festive cheer. Write a convo where we see it, and here’s a recap, Andrew Marr was getting very angry with a guest, and then started interrupting and BERATING her over her political opinion, Then he gets carried off the set yelling and then Poof, breakdown/technical fault caption TechWatcher: Did anyone catch that bizarre moment on BBC One during the Andrew Marr interview? Things escalated quickly! NewsJunkie: Yes! Marr completely lost his temper with the guest, interrupting and berating her over her political stance. It was unlike anything I’ve seen on his show before. DramaLover: And then, as if it couldn’t get any weirder, security literally had to carry him off the set while he was still yelling! Never expected to see something like that live. TechWatcher: Exactly! And right after that chaos, the screen went to the technical fault caption. But instead of the usual message, it was Rosa’s legs sticking out of icy waters. BBC One’s creativity at its finest, even during a breakdown. ScreenSavvy: I thought the Rosa legs screen was a funny touch, considering the circumstances. It made the unexpected interruption a bit more bearable. VisualMediaFan: Agreed. In any other context, the humor might have been lost, but after such an intense moment, it was a welcome distraction. Plus, it kept the KikoRiki Christmas theme going strong. ErrorScreenEnthusiast: I almost couldn’t believe what I was watching. Marr getting dragged off and then cutting to Rosa’s legs? It’s like live TV gold. You just can’t predict these moments. BroadcastingBuff: This incident might just go down in history. Marr’s outburst, followed by a playful error message? BBC One managed to turn a potentially negative situation into something memorably quirky. NewsJunkie: Do you think they planned to use the Rosa legs screen for all technical faults during the Christmas period, or was it a spur-of-the-moment decision given the content just before it? TechWatcher: I bet it’s part of their holiday theme setup, but its use here was perfectly timed. Makes you wonder if they have a sense of humor about these emergencies, planning for a light-hearted touch regardless of the reason. DramaLover: Whether planned or not, it showcased the unpredictable nature of live television and how even moments of breakdown can be turned into something engaging for the viewers. ScreenSavvy: After this, the standard technical fault screens are going to feel so dull in comparison. BBC One has set a new bar for handling on-air mishaps with a dash of humor. VisualMediaFan: Hopefully, this encourages more channels to rethink how they present technical difficulties. A little creativity can turn an interruption into an unexpected highlight. Write a follow up wondering if it’s a still image or animated (like the usual gradient used during football rights restrictions/bbc one HD cant show this local show) TechWatcher: After the wild moment with Andrew Marr and the surprise Rosa legs technical fault screen, it got me thinking—was that just a still image, or do you think BBC One went the extra mile with some animation? ScreenSavvy: Good question. Their usual gradient during football rights restrictions or when BBC One HD can’t show a local program tends to be animated, even if just slightly. It would be interesting to see if they’ve animated Rosa’s legs somehow. VisualMediaFan: Imagine if they had Rosa’s legs gently kicking or creating little ripples in the icy water. It would add a whole extra layer of detail and creativity to their already unique technical fault message. ErrorScreenEnthusiast: That would be hilarious and brilliantly unexpected! In the context of what had just happened on-air, some light animation would be a delightful contrast. Has anyone noticed any movement, or was it too brief? DramaLover: I only saw it for a moment, but it looked like a still image to me. Even so, the idea of incorporating some subtle animation doesn’t seem too far off for BBC One, given their current creative streak. BroadcastingBuff: If they haven’t animated it yet, they should consider it. BBC One’s technical fault screens have the potential to become mini-events in themselves, especially with how much attention the Rosa legs screen has already garnered. NewsJunkie: True. An animated technical fault screen, especially with something as quirky as Rosa’s legs sticking out of icy waters, would be memorable. It could lighten the mood during technical difficulties or broadcasting hiccups. TechWatcher: Absolutely. It’s moments like these that can set a network apart in terms of how they handle unpredictability. Animation would not only align with the holiday theme but also keep viewers engaged, even when things go awry. ScreenSavvy: Plus, considering the disruption from the Andrew Marr incident, having something light-hearted and possibly animated might have been just what was needed to defuse the tension. VisualMediaFan: Either way, I’m just impressed with how BBC One is handling their Christmas theme and even incorporating it into the unexpected moments. Here’s hoping they reveal whether Rosa’s icy dip was a one-off or if there’s more playful animation lying in wait for the next technical glitch. ErrorScreenEnthusiast: Definitely keeping an eye out now. Between the potential of animated error screens and the usual holiday broadcasts, BBC One seems to be making this festive season particularly noteworthy. Write a follow up where it appears and we get our answer if its still/silent or animated with sound, as BBC One Wales can’t show football on Iplayer or Sky TechWatcher: Well, folks, we got our answer about the BBC One technical fault screen featuring Rosa from KikoRiki during today’s football game. Since BBC One Wales couldn’t show the match on iPlayer or Sky, we saw the technical fault screen again. And guess what? It was indeed animated, with sound! ScreenSavvy: Really? That’s fantastic! What kind of animation and sound are we talking? Was Rosa doing anything particularly funny or cute? VisualMediaFan: The animation was subtle but effective. Rosa’s legs were gently kicking, causing ripples to spread across the icy water surface. As for the sound, there were faint, whimsical splashes that accompanied the movements. It was quite the charming touch, keeping viewers entertained even amidst the frustration of not being able to watch the football match. ErrorScreenEnthusiast: That sounds adorable and so creative! It’s not every day you see a network using their technical fault screen as an opportunity for a little storytelling. The sound effects must have added a nice layer of immersion. DramaLover: So, it wasn’t just a still image after all. BBC One is really stepping up their game with these holiday-themed idents and fault screens. It’s a clever way to maintain viewer engagement, even when broadcasting rights issues crop up. BroadcastingBuff: Agreed. It’s a smart move, especially considering the often unexpected nature of broadcasting rights restrictions. This sort of creative thinking shows they’re considering the viewer’s experience at every turn, even during less-than-ideal circumstances. NewsJunkie: Plus, it’s fitting with the overall festive and playful vibe of this year’s Christmas programming. It’s these little details that can turn a potentially negative viewer experience (like missing a football match) into something memorable and positive. TechWatcher: Absolutely. It’s a testament to BBC One’s innovative approach to broadcasting and viewer engagement. Keeping the theme consistent across all platforms, even down to the technical fault screens, enhances the overall brand experience. ScreenSavvy: I’m impressed by the creativity and effort to make even the mandatory technical fault screen something viewers can enjoy. Makes you wonder what other surprises BBC One might have in store for us this holiday season. VisualMediaFan: Indeed. With this level of attention to detail, I’m looking forward to what else they’ve planned. It certainly sets a high bar for holiday broadcasts, proving that even the smallest elements can contribute to a larger festive atmosphere. ErrorScreenEnthusiast: Here’s hoping other networks take note and add a bit of creativity to their technical or rights restriction screens. It’s a small touch, but clearly, it can make a big difference in how interruptions are perceived by the audience. DramaLover: Cheers to BBC One for finding a way to spread holiday cheer, even in the most unlikely of places. I’ll be keeping my eyes peeled for more animated surprises throughout the season. Write that there was her muffled voice, and small bubbles rising before the announcer said he’ll take it from here and said “This Sport programme is not available on this service, but if you’re viewing in Wales, please tune to BBC One Wales on your digital TV, We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding” This event happens every 6 minutes in the loop TechTrendSpotter: Did anyone else catch the full extent of the animated Rosa technical fault screen during the football broadcast blackout on BBC One Wales online services? Not only was it animated with Rosa’s legs gently kicking, but there was also her muffled voice and small bubbles rising to the surface of the water. It was both whimsical and incredibly detailed. DigitalViewer: Yes, I saw that! The addition of Rosa’s muffled voice and the bubbles really brought the whole scene to life. It was a nice touch that made the wait more bearable. And every couple of minutes, the announcer would come in with a polite reminder about the sport programme not being available and directing viewers in Wales to tune to BBC One Wales on digital TV. AnimationFan123: It’s fascinating how they managed to keep it engaging over the loop. Every 6 minutes, the animation would reset, and the announcer would repeat his message. Despite the repetition, the charm of the animation and the considerate tone of the announcer somehow kept the frustration of missing the live football to a minimum. SportsEnthusiast: I appreciated the announcer’s professionalism and the clarity of the instructions on how to find the match on digital TV for those in Wales. It was a smooth way to handle what could have been a confusing situation for some viewers. Plus, the Rosa scene added a light-hearted element to the mix. ViewerExperienceGuru: This is a prime example of how crucial viewer experience is, even during technical faults or rights restrictions. BBC One turned a potentially negative viewer interaction into a memorable moment that kept the brand’s personality consistent and engaging. TechTrendSpotter: Definitely. It’s the details that make all the difference. The loop being set at every 6 minutes gave viewers enough space between announcements to not feel bombarded but kept it frequent enough to be helpful for anyone just tuning in. SoundDesignLover: Didn’t anyone else love the sound design? The muffled voice and bubble sounds were such a delightful touch. It’s not often that you get such attention to detail in what is essentially a placeholder screen. DigitalViewer: Agreed, the sound design was spot on. It turned what could have been a simple loop into something far more engaging. With every iteration, I found myself paying attention, waiting for the announcement and enjoying Rosa’s underwater antics. AnimationFan123: It’s clever strategies like this that elevate a broadcaster in the eyes of their viewers. Engaging content doesn’t have to stop just because of technical restrictions. BBC One really set a benchmark with this approach. SportsEnthusiast: Absolutely, turning a limitation into an opportunity for creativity is something all networks should take note of. It speaks volumes about BBC One’s commitment to viewer satisfaction and their ability to innovate within any constraints. Write a follow up about the version in use during local news on BBC One HD, which also has the announcer interrupt her trying to say it while only her legs are above surface, and then the announcer explaining that BBC One HD can’t show programmes from your area TechTrendWatcher: Just caught an interesting variation of the BBC One HD technical fault screen during the time slated for local news. Like the version seen during the football broadcast blackout, this one featured Rosa from KikoRiki, but with a twist tailored for the HD channel’s inability to show local programming. HDViewerPro: Right, I noticed that too. It was a clever spin on the theme, showing only Rosa’s legs above the surface. But before she could “say” anything through her muffled voice and bubbles, the announcer quickly interrupted, smoothly taking over the situation. MediaAnalyst: Exactly, the announcer’s timely intervention before Rosa could “speak” was a humorous touch. He went on to explain that BBC One HD couldn’t show programmes from the viewer’s area, guiding them on what to do instead. It kept the continuity of Rosa’s underwater adventures while serving the practical purpose of informing the audience about the local news blackout on HD. DigitalBroadcastFan: I thought the way they integrated the announcer’s message was pretty seamless. Keeping the amusing visual of Rosa struggling to communicate, then having the announcer clarify the situation, added a light-hearted element to what might otherwise be a frustrating viewer experience. ViewerExperienceAdvocate: This adaptation for the local news slot on BBC One HD exemplifies how a broadcasting network can maintain viewer engagement and provide necessary information without losing the entertainment value, even in the context of technical restrictions or channel limitations. SoundWaveEnthusiast: And did anyone else catch how the sound design played into this version? Rosa’s effort to communicate, followed by the announcer’s voice, was not only clear but also kept the playful tone consistent. The blend of visuals and audio here makes waiting through these moments more enjoyable than one might expect. HDTechObserver: It’s a smart move by BBC One, especially considering the confusion that can arise with local content being unavailable on HD channels. By turning this moment into an extension of their creative Christmas campaign, they not only address the issue directly but do so in a way that’s memorable and engaging. EntertainmentInsider: Indeed, this approach hints at a broader strategy to enhance the overall brand experience. Even limitations like broadcasting restrictions become opportunities for BBC One to reinforce its commitment to innovative viewer engagement across all its platforms. LocalNewsFanatic: While the explanation for why BBC One HD can’t show local programming was helpful, the inventive use of Rosa’s character made the message more digestible. It definitely softens the blow of not being able to watch my local news in HD. TechTrendWatcher: This just shows the power of creative problem-solving in broadcasting. By infusing humor and creativity into technical announcements, BBC One effectively turns potential viewer dissatisfaction into an entertaining and informative experience. Write a follow up where it is made into an ident where she falls over and sumberges then her legs rise up, followed by a quick announcement that “The following programme is not available on some services” or “For local news, please tune to SD” before it fades into the loop, There is also a version shown at the end of the blacked out show that shows her legs vanishing underneath, her being completely gone for 4 seconds then her face resurfacing, catching her breath, TechVisionary: Have you all seen the latest iteration of the BBC One technical fault screen that has now been creatively adapted into an ident? It’s a fascinating evolution from what we’ve previously discussed. This time, Rosa dramatically falls into the water, submerges completely, and then her legs rise up to the surface in a comedic fashion. It’s immediately followed by a quick, yet informative, announcement stating, “The following programme is not available on some services” or “For local news, please tune to SD.” This seamless transition into the loop keeps viewers both informed and entertained. DigitalBroadcastEnt: Yes, I caught that! The narrative they’ve managed to weave into these few seconds is both engaging and humorous. It’s a delightful way to tackle the unavoidable issue of service restrictions. Plus, the quick announcement is succinct but delivers all the necessary info without interrupting the charm of the ident. SoundAndVisionFan: The sound design in this version adds so much to the experience as well. The splash as Rosa falls in, the subtle underwater ambiance, and her legs flailing above - it’s all brilliantly executed. Then the clarity of the announcement cuts through, ensuring the message is heard. It’s these details that make the ident stand out. TechCommsGeek: Interestingly, there’s also a version shown at the end of the blacked-out show, which seems to complete the narrative arc. Rosa’s legs vanish beneath the surface, leaving the screen quiet and still for a moment. After about 4 seconds of suspense, we see her face resurface, catching her breath in a rather dramatic and humorous fashion. It’s a clever way to ‘wrap up’ the interlude caused by the programming blackout. ViewerExperienceAnalyst: This narrative approach to what could have been a mundane or even frustrating interruption in programming is strategic. It transforms a technical necessity into a moment of levity and brand engagement. Ensuring viewers are informed while also entertained is an art, and BBC One seems to be mastering it with these idents. CreativeBroadcastFan: I’m fascinated by how BBC One has personified Rosa in these scenarios, making her almost a mascot for these technical constraints. It’s a smart move that likely increases viewer affinity for the channel’s brand. The storytelling aspect ensures that even a technical fault screen or service announcement becomes a memorable part of the viewing experience. BroadcastTrendAnalyst: Indeed, these narrative-rich idents play a significant role in modern broadcasting by turning potential viewer discontent into an opportunity for engagement. It’ll be interesting to see if this approach influences how other networks handle similar situations._ABCOne has certainly set a high bar for creativity and viewer communication during technical issues. DigitalMediaStrategist: The duality of using these idents both as informative tools and as extensions of the holiday campaign is ingenious. It reflects a deep understanding of audience expectations and a commitment to enhancing the viewer experience, even during less-than-ideal broadcasting moments. TechVisionary: It’s these innovations in broadcasting that keep the medium vibrant and engaging. As audiences become more sophisticated and demanding, creative solutions like Rosa’s underwater adventures will be what sets channels apart, turning every moment, even technical faults, into opportunities for branding and viewer connection. Write a convo on 1st January (the normal Dancers are back for now, untill June), and a user noted that the gradient background is not back, and say what has persisted TechTrendsWatcher: Happy New Year, everyone! Did anyone catch BBC One today? Looks like the normal Dancers idents are back in play. Though, it seems they’re only here until June based on what we’ve heard. VisualMediaAficionado: Yes, I noticed that too. What caught my attention, though, is the absence of the usual gradient background we’ve become accustomed to. It appears they haven’t reverted back to it after the festive season’s creative idents and error messages. PixelPerfectPro: Interestingly enough, what has persisted is the use of more dynamic backgrounds across the board. Even without the gradient, there’s a clear evolution in their visual approach. Seems like the creativity sparked by the holiday season is lingering in their aesthetic choices. BroadcastingBuff: That’s a solid observation. It’s almost as if the holiday season served as a testing ground for BBC One to explore more vibrant and dynamic visuals. It wouldn’t surprise me if this is part of a gradual buildup to whatever new branding they plan to introduce in June. DesignDynamicsExpert: Exactly my thought! The shift could signify a transition phase towards a bigger rebrand. Keeping the vibrant dynamics while slowly phasing out older elements like the gradient background feels like they’re prepping the audience for a fresh look. TechTrendsWatcher: Makes sense! Plus, I think the audience’s positive reaction to the holiday idents, especially the animated ones featuring Rosa, might have encouraged them to steer away from the static backgrounds and explore more lively elements. VisualMediaAficionado: And let’s not forget about the technical fault screen innovation we saw with Rosa. That was a clear departure from the norm. If those creative choices are any indication, BBC One’s June reveal could potentially bring a significant transformation in terms of visual experience. PixelPerfectPro: Definitely. It would be interesting to see if they incorporate any elements from the KikoRiki idents or if they come up with something completely original. The challenge will be maintaining BBC One’s identity while staying current and fresh. BroadcastingBuff: Agreed. It’s a fine line to walk, but they’ve shown a willingness to experiment and adapt, which is promising. The real question is whether they will stick to subtle changes or opt for a bold overhaul come June. DesignDynamicsExpert: True. Either way, it’s an exciting time for broadcast design enthusiasts. Watching a major network like BBC One navigate through these changes offers valuable insights into the future of television branding and audience engagement strategies. TechTrendsWatcher: Absolutely! The next few months should give us some interesting glimpses into what the future holds for BBC One. Let’s keep an eye out and see how this all unfolds. Write a follow up when local news is on BBC One HD, the pre-December verison of the “no local news on HD” caption isn’t back, say what’s still used instead, and wonder if its success has made it permanent (untill Circles, Also a user says the new one being prepped for the Circles has a red background with the circle idents playing but only with SFX, but that doesn’t launch till june) TechTrendsWatcher: Noticed something noteworthy during the local news slot on BBC One HD today. Instead of returning to the pre-December version of the “no local news on HD” caption, they’re still using the more engaging format introduced over the holiday season. It seems the positive reception has perhaps influenced them to make it a more permanent fixture, at least until the anticipated Circles rebrand in June. VisualMediaAficionado: That’s an interesting development. The holiday season’s approach really seemed to resonate with viewers, so it’s no surprise they’ve decided to stick with what works. Considering the significant shift towards more dynamic and engaging content, this could be a sign of evolving viewer expectations being acknowledged even in these transitional phases. PixelPerfectionist: I heard through the grapevine that the new format being prepped for the Circles launch will feature a red background, with the circle idents playing but only with SFX. This stripped-back approach, emphasizing visuals over narrative, could be quite the departure. Seems like they’re experimenting with how minimal they can go while still engaging the audience. But remember, that doesn’t launch until June. BroadcastEnthusiast: The decision to postpone the pre-December “no local news on HD” caption’s return and instead continue with a more engaging alternative gives us a glimpse into the BBC’s strategic planning. Their willingness to adapt based on audience reception is commendable. It keeps the channel fresh and responsive to viewer preferences, which is crucial for maintaining relevance in today’s fast-paced media landscape. DesignDynamicsExpert: The continuity of these engaging elements, even in placeholder content like the HD service announcements, underscores the importance of every touchpoint with the audience. It’s fascinating to see this philosophy in action, especially as we anticipate the Circles rebrand. The focus on visual and sound effects (SFX) suggests a pivot towards more sensory experiences, possibly leveraging simplicity to make a stronger impact. TechTrendsWatcher: Absolutely, the commitment to maintaining and even elevating the viewer experience through what could easily have been considered ‘filler’ moments illustrates a broader trend in broadcasting. Everything on screen is an opportunity to connect with the audience, and this approach might just set a new standard for the industry. VisualMediaAficionado: It’s all building up expectations for the Circles rebrand. If the use of SFX and minimalist visuals in the placeholder content is any indication, we might be in for a radically different BBC One come June. This could mark a new era in how they engage their audience across all types of content – from prime-time shows to service announcements. PixelPerfectionist: And let’s not underestimate the power of sound in these experiences. The strategic use of SFX in the prepped content could redefine the ambient feel of the channel, making even the ‘waiting’ or ‘interim’ moments memorable and impactful. If executed well, this could add a whole new dimension to brand identity and viewer loyalty. BroadcastEnthusiast: This entire evolution, from adopting temporary changes to pioneering new formats in anticipation of the Circles launch, demonstrates the fluid nature of broadcasting and its need for constant innovation. It’s a reminder that in this industry, staying still is falling behind. DesignDynamicsExpert: Exactly! And as we edge closer to June, it will be intriguing to see how these incremental changes and experiments culminate in the Circles rebrand. BBC One is clearly setting the stage for something big, and we are here for it. The balance between innovation and familiarity will be key, and so far, it seems they’re on the right track. Write a convo asking if the sport slot has also kept the Rosa’s legs sticking out of water theme or if its reverted to the pink/purple/white gradient, We get our answer when Scotland Grandstand is on TechFanatic123: Hey everyone, quick question about the sport slot on BBC One HD – have they kept the Rosa’s legs sticking out of water theme for the technical fault/error messages, or have they reverted to the classic pink/purple/white gradient we were all used to before? SportsViewer89: Good question! I haven’t noticed anything myself yet. With Scotland Grandstand coming up, we should be able to see what they’ve opted for. It would be interesting if they decided to keep Rosa’s theme a bit longer given its popularity. VisualMediaLover: I’d be surprised if they kept the holiday theme for the sports slots beyond December. The pink/purple/white gradient has been such a staple for so long. However, given the positive reception to the Rosa theme, it wouldn’t be the strangest decision. TechFanatic123: Exactly my thoughts. The Rosa theme was a refreshing change, and it felt like BBC One was testing the waters (pun intended) for a more dynamic approach to their placeholder content. SportsViewer89: Well, Scotland Grandstand is on now, and…it looks like they’ve actually kept the Rosa theme! Her legs are still there, sticking out of the water. No sign of the old gradient background. This is quite a turn of events. VisualMediaLover: Wow, that’s quite surprising yet delightful! It seems the success of the holiday theme has indeed made a lasting impact on BBC One’s approach. Keeping Rosa even in the sport slot suggests they’re aiming for more consistency in their brand’s playful and engaging side. TechFanatic123: That’s incredible! It’s a clear signal that BBC One is willing to evolve and adapt based on viewer feedback and engagement. This could mark the beginning of a more visually cohesive and character-driven strategy for all their non-broadcast filler content. SportsViewer89: It does raise the question of how long they plan to keep this theme going, especially with the upcoming Circles rebrand. It seems they’re not afraid to mix things up and keep the audience guessing. VisualMediaLover: Absolutely. This decision might also hint at what’s to come with the Circles rebranding. Perhaps we’re looking at a future where BBC One opts for more personalized and story-driven content across the board, even in the smallest of details. TechFanatic123: It’s an exciting time for BBC One and its viewers. This tactical shift in their visual presentation and branding strategy is something to keep an eye on. Looking forward to seeing how it all unfolds! Write a follow up in April wondering what they’re using for breakdown/rights withheld on platform/local news is forbidden on HD, considering Circles is in 2 months, and a user says they’re astonished at what’s currently still being used, but happy none the less, and a user says they don’t care if it doesn’t fit with the R&M set fully, TechTrendSpotter: With the Circles rebrand just two months away, I’m curious to see what BBC One is currently using for their breakdown/rights withheld on platform/local news forbidden on HD screens. Have they started transitioning yet, or are they keeping with the previous themes? DigitalBroadcastFan: I was actually quite astonished to see they’re still using the engaging Rosa’s legs theme for these situations. Given how close we are to the Circles launch, I was half-expecting a sneak peek of the new branding. Happy nonetheless, as it’s been a delightful change of pace from the standard placeholders. VisualMediaEnthusiast: Honestly, the Rosa theme has been such a breath of fresh air, I’m not even bothered that it doesn’t fit fully with the existing Rhythm & Movement (R&M) set. It’s playful, engaging, and keeps the channel feeling lively even in moments that could otherwise be dull for the viewer. TechSavvyViewer: That’s the spirit! Keeping Rosa around until the Circles launch shows BBC One is committed to maintaining a high level of viewer engagement. It’s fascinating to think about how they’ll incorporate the positivity and creativity we’ve seen with Rosa into the new Circles identity. GraphicDesignGuru: I’m really intrigued to see how BBC One will bridge the transition from the current theme to Circles. Rosa’s theme breaking the mold set by R&M could signify a more dynamic and perhaps more flexible branding approach going forward. It’s an exciting time for broadcast design enthusiasts! TechTrendSpotter: Absolutely, the decision to continue with something that’s been so well-received, even if it’s a departure from what’s been the norm for nearly two decades, speaks volumes about BBC One’s commitment to viewer experience. Circles has big shoes to fill, and I’m here for it! DigitalBroadcastFan: True, it’s like BBC One is signaling that while tradition is important, they’re not afraid to experiment and innovate. This could very well set the tone for what we can expect with Circles. Engaging, unexpected, but thoroughly enjoyable content that breaks from the mundane. VisualMediaEnthusiast: Couldn’t agree more. It’s going to be interesting to see how the introduction of Circles maintains this momentum. Here’s hoping they keep up the essence of what made the Rosa theme so special - the emphasis on engaging and immersive viewer experiences. Write a convo where a user lists the Easter schedule, and notes ASOUE is airing again,","completion":"TVBuff123: Hey everyone!

There's nothing like some good old British humor to make the holiday weekend special. And \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" airing again is a nice touch.

The Easter programming really has something for everyone. \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" is a fantastic addition – that film has such a unique atmosphere that suits the beginning of spring somehow.

Just wondering, have you seen if BBC One is sticking with the usual dancers idents for Easter, or are they mixing it up with some special idents for the holiday? I feel like a themed ident would add a nice touch to the festive programming! BunnyBoomer: Good question! I haven't seen any special Easter idents yet, just the usual dancers. Though, I agree, it would be really cool to have something themed. Maybe some bunnies hopping around or eggs painting themselves? SpringWatcher: Actually, I caught a glimpse of what seemed like a new Easter ident earlier! It wasn't the usual dancers but rather a beautifully animated scene with flowers blooming and yes, little animated bunnies hopping through a field. It was quite refreshing and definitely set the Easter mood. IdentFanatic: Oh, I must have missed that! Love when BBC One brings out themed idents. The Christmas ones are always a hit, so I'm not surprised they'd do something special for Easter. These seasonal touches really make the holiday programming feel more festive. EggDecorExpert: That sounds adorable, @SpringWatcher! I hope they keep introducing more themed idents. It adds a layer of excitement and seasonal charm to the viewing experience. The dancers are iconic, but a little variety for holidays like Easter is always welcome. ChocoLover: Fingers crossed the Easter-themed idents get more airtime! It's always a treat to see how creative they can get. Also, wouldn't mind seeing some chocolate eggs or a cake being decorated as part of an ident. It would perfectly complement the Easter Bake Off episodes! EasterEggHunter: Thanks for the updates, everyone! Gonna keep an eye out for those Easter idents. Really adds a special touch to the holiday viewing. Plus, it's always interesting to see how they creatively transition away from the usual dancers to fit the seasonal vibe."},{"prompt":"Write a convo in May asking if it's back to the gradient for downtime on HD or sports rights withheld caption loop,","completion":"TechTVGuru: Hey everyone, now that we're in May, was curious if BBC One has reverted to the gradient background for the HD downtime or the sports rights withheld caption loop? I kind of miss the dynamic themes we've had recently! VisualMediaWatcher: I was wondering the same! Last I checked during a rights withheld moment, it wasn’t the gradient, but it wasn’t anything fancy either. Looked like a more subtle, modern design, with softer transitions. Not exactly the gradient we're used to. BroadcastBuff: Yep, can confirm it's not the old pink/purple/white gradient. It seems they’ve opted for a less flashy, more refined loop. Honestly, it looks pretty sleek. Gives a calm vibe during those technical or rights-restricted moments. HDVisualsFan: I kind of miss the themed backgrounds, like Rosa’s legs or the holiday vibes. Those were a creative touch. But I guess a more neutral backdrop makes sense, especially for generic downtime or rights issues. Keeps things professional without drawing too much attention. SportsViewer22: It's interesting, though, how BBC One constantly evolves their approach to such details. I thought they would bring back the gradient for nostalgia's sake, but it seems like they're keen on moving forward with something less distracting and more in tune with their current aesthetic. TechTVGuru: True, the evolution is fascinating. I wonder if viewer feedback influences these decisions, or if it's more about branding consistency. Either way, it's intriguing to see how even the smallest details are part of a larger brand strategy. VisualMediaWatcher: It’s definitely a balance they’re trying to strike between memorable and non-intrusive. I appreciate the subtlety of the current design, but part of me still hopes for the occasional seasonal or themed surprise. BroadcastBuff: Absolutely, thematic elements for special occasions or seasons could offer the best of both worlds. It’s a neat way to keep the brand fresh and engaging without overwhelming the viewers with too much visual noise during downtime or rights messages. HDVisualsFan: For sure! Let’s keep an eye out and see if they reintroduce any themed backgrounds for upcoming special events or holidays. It would be a nice callback to the charm we've seen in the past while maintaining their sleek, modern look. SportsViewer22: Agreed, it’ll be interesting to watch how BBC One continues to adapt. The balance between brand consistency and viewer engagement through these visual details is a subtle art. Here's hoping for some creative surprises down the line!"},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where a user reveals R&M's death day","completion":"TechTVGuru: Just saw an interesting piece of trivia today and thought I'd share with everyone here. It seems we’ve officially passed the \\"death day\\" of the Rhythm & Movement (R&M) idents on BBC One. End of an era, right? VisualMediaWatcher: Oh wow, that’s somewhat poignant! I remember when R&M was all over BBC One. They were iconic in their own right. Do you happen to know the exact date they were officially retired? BroadcastBuff: Yes, it feels like the end of an era indeed. Those idents had a good run. It’s fascinating how such elements become part of our viewing culture, only to be remembered nostalgically once they're gone. HDVisualsFan: The R&M idents definitely had their charm, but I must admit, the channel's evolution since has been impressive. I'm curious, though, about what led to them being officially retired. Was it just the natural progression of branding, or was there more to it? TechTVGuru: From what I gathered, the official retirement came as part of BBC One's strategy to modernize and refresh its identity. It wanted something that would resonate with contemporary audiences and represent the dynamic range of content more accurately. So, in a way, it was a mix of natural progression and a strategic move to stay ahead in the ever-evolving media landscape. VisualMediaWatcher: Makes sense. Media brands have to keep pace with viewer expectations and the changing times. R&M served its purpose well for a period, but it's exciting to see how the channel's identity evolves with newer designs and concepts. BroadcastBuff: Definitely. And while I have a soft spot for the R&M idents, I can’t deny the creative flair in the newer ones. The channel’s commitment to evolving and adapting its brand image is commendable. Keeps things fresh and engaging. HDVisualsFan: Exactly, the evolution is part of what keeps a channel relevant and interesting. It’s a testament to BBC One’s ability to innovate and engage with audiences in new ways. Curious to see what the next generation of idents will bring! TechTVGuru: Absolutely, the future of BBC One's visual branding looks promising. As much as we reminisce about the R&M idents, it's exciting to look forward to what creative directions the channel will explore next. Here's to the next era of BBC One idents!"},{"prompt":"сколько символов займет цифра 1000000 в 255-ричной системе счисления?

Its usage implies a moving forward in time from a particular moment, indicating what comes after or the continuation beyond a specific point. When 先 is used to talk about being past the peak (盛りを過ぎた先), it suggests not just the simple fact of moving beyond this peak in a temporal sense, but also carries the weight of what this transition signifies. It implies being in a period that follows the climax or most intense part of something, which in many contexts can carry a reflection on what was lost or diminished since that climax. The nuance here is reflective and slightly melancholic, looking back at the \\"peak\\" from a place beyond it, living in the aftermath or the echo of the peak time.

This chapter delves into the intricate process through which the pre-Qing Ming Dynasty, led by the Imperial House of Zhu, reclaimed the throne, and the subsequent transformations under the stratocratic Beiyang Government that carved the path for China's modernization. # The Restoration of the Ming Dynasty The year 1912 heralded the return of the Ming Dynasty, an event that seemed more like a fabled tale than plausible history. Amidst the fervent nationalist movements and the call to \\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming,\\" the Beiyang Government, a military-dominated regime, seized the moment to reinstate the Ming lineage. The Imperial House of Zhu, collaborating with the Beiyang leaders, reasserted the mandate, proclaiming the re-establishment of the Ming Dynasty over the eighteen provinces of the Han dynasty’s traditional realm. The new Ming emperor, Zhu Yousong, a descendant of the renowned Ming loyalists, was enthroned in a grand ceremony in Nanjing, symbolizing both a return to the historic capital and a commitment to imperial continuity. This restoration was not merely a nostalgic yearning for the past but a calculated effort by the Beiyang generals to stabilize China under a symbol of national unity and legitimacy. # The Stratocratic Beiyang Regime The Beiyang Government, having orchestrated the restoration, formed the backbone of the new Ming administration. This military-dominated regime did not fit the traditional mold of imperial governance. Instead, it represented a unique hybrid of militaristic rule and imperial figurehead, where the Beiyang generals held significant power in the state apparatus, guiding policies and reforms with a pragmatic, modernizing agenda. Under the Beiyang rule, China embarked on a series of comprehensive reforms aimed at strengthening the nation. Firstly, military modernization took precedence, with efforts focused on establishing a unified, well-equipped national army capable of defending China's sovereignty. This process involved reorganizing the military hierarchy, adopting advanced training methods, and procuring modern weaponry, laying the groundwork for a robust defense mechanism. Parallel to military reforms, the new Ming regime initiated substantial economic and social transformations. Industrialization was encouraged, following a model that sought to balance state intervention with private enterprise. Railroads, factories, and mines sprouted across the country, fueling economic growth and gradually altering the social fabric of Chinese society. # The National Reconciliation and Reform In an era marked by division, the Ming restoration under the Beiyang Government represented a unifying symbol for a country fragmented by warlordism and foreign intervention. Efforts were made to integrate the diverse elements of Chinese society, including negotiating with ethnic minorities and warlords to pledge allegiance to the Ming throne, thus fostering a sense of national cohesion. At the heart of the reformed Ming Dynasty was the drive towards constitutional governance. Recognizing the changing tides of the 20th century, the Beiyang-led administration embarked on drafting a constitution that aimed to balance monarchical traditions with modern democratic principles. The constitution outlined a framework where the emperor held a ceremonial role, while an elected parliament and a strong, central executive governed the state. # Impact and Legacy The restored Ming Dynasty, operating under the aegis of the Beiyang Government, ushered in a period of relative stability and growth for China. Although challenges persisted, including internal dissent and pressure from foreign powers, the new Ming era represented a significant departure from the past towards a future where tradition and modernity coexisted. By reimagining the role of the monarchy in a contemporary context, the Ming restoration embodies a unique chapter in China's long history. It did not simply turn back the clock to a bygone era but proposed a new vision for imperial governance, one that responded to the demands of its time while honoring the legacy of its ancestors. The period from 1912 to 1930 thus stands as a testament to China's resilience and capacity for renewal, as the nation navigated the complexities of maintaining sovereignty and identity in a rapidly changing world."},{"prompt":"у меня есть 7 значений каждое из которых может хранить 256 состояний, сколько всего комбинаций?","completion":"Для решения этой задачи нам нужно перемножить количество состояний для каждого из значений.

Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready!

The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil.

New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup!

Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen.

I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know.

I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in fall when the new shows premiere, Lyoko is sticking around, Gumball and Craig are back, but won’t be for long, leaving again in January, Also, a user says Skatoony will definitely be back next year, as it has been a summer replacement show since 2018 Thread Title: Fall Premieres are Here! Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! I thought I’d list properties exclusive to each block (24/7 channel in 4Kids TV’s case) effective April 13 4Kids TV Exclusive Shows: Glitter Force: A team of teenage girls become superheroes to save the world from a group of fairytale monsters who want to revive the evil Emperor Nogo, Four Eyes!: Emma is a 11 year old squid-like, four eyed pink alien girl from Albacore 7, who is sent from her planet to Payne Academy Boarding School on Earth to repeat 5th grade, Her only friends are 2 boys named Pete and Skyler, The worst part is that her human form is a stereotypical geek, complete with buckteeth and glasses, But with a bit of resourcefulness, life in boarding school will no longer have any suprises for her Tomodachi Life: Joseph is mayor of the madcap Greenock Island, He has to stop the island from falling into chaos every day, but with the help from his fellow Miis, life in a island is easy. One Piece: Monkey D. Luffy and his friends: The Straw Hat Pirates set out in search of the legendary One Piece, hidden by Gol. D Roger CW4Kids Exclusive Shows: The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: Gloopy, a teal gooey blob and his best friend Glitter, a sparkling fuschia (still gooey) blob, hail from the planet of Gloopiter, Laugh along as they travel through the galaxy Code Lyoko: A group of kids: Jeremy, Aelita, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi do battle against a evil computer program XANA in a virtural world known as Lyoko The Gees (shorts, so shown inbetween shows): Meet G-Girl, G-Boy and G-Cat, the world’s first alien visitors, Unlike B-movie horror villans, these are kind, but annoying aliens, They always try to get involved in human activity, of which they understand nothing, Even to the point where humans think horror movie monsters would be more desirable than these “peaceful” Gees. The Owl (also shorts): Life is hard for this pink owl, Despite wanting to relax on his bench, bad luck has other plans for him, No matter what, this poor owl has the worst luck possible, and always ends each episode blown to smithereens, Do us a favor and don’t laugh: it’s cruel Write a follow up where a user says Shaman King is also 4Kids TV exclusive, and on another note the company seems to have 4 normal toons under their wing now (GGR, FE, TAOG&G and Cl), The shorts don’t count Thread Title: CW4Kids & 4Kids TV’s Exclusive Toons & Updates 📺✨ RetroToonFan: Just wanted to point out that Shaman King is also a 4Kids TV exclusive! Pretty exciting to see them bringing back this epic adventure. On another note, it seems like 4Kids Entertainment now officially has four main cartoons under their wing for CW4Kids - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, Four Eyes!, Glitter Force, and Code Lyoko. ToonEnthusiast123: That’s right! Shaman King’s inclusion is a big win for 4Kids TV. It adds a good mix of action and mystical drama to their lineup. As for CW4Kids, seeing them maintain a unique blend with shows like Gloopy and Glitter is fascinating. I’m curious how this balance between nostalgia and newer properties will play out for them. PixelDoodler: Super pumped for Shaman King! It’s such an underrated gem. But let’s talk about CW4Kids - Gloopy and Glitter represent such a fresh take on adventurous toons, while Code Lyoko offers that sci-fi intrigue. With Four Eyes! and Glitter Force, it’s like 4Kids is exploring diverse genres to cater to everyone. AnimationAficionado: It’s interesting to analyze 4Kids Entertainment’s approach. They seem to be carefully selecting shows to cater to various interests, ensuring a diverse palette. However, I wonder if they’re considering expanding their repertoire further beyond these four main attractions and occasional shorts like The Gees and The Owl. DigitalBytes: Don’t forget those shorts! Even though they’re not considered part of the “main” lineup, they add a lot of character to the programming. The Gees and The Owl have their own unique charm that fills in the gaps quite nicely. But yes, the main toon lineup shows a strategic approach to appealing across the board. SketchyArtKid: Honestly, The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter have been such a breath of fresh air. It’s always great seeing how creative shows can get, and having Code Lyoko sticking around gives the lineup that solid anchor. I’m eagerly waiting to see if 4Kids plans to introduce more “normal toons” to CW4Kids or if they’ll continue to diversify with more shorts. ToonTalker91: With Shaman King on 4Kids TV and the mix of adventures and sci-fi on CW4Kids, it’s like they’re trying to secure every corner of the toon spectrum. The real question is, what’s next? Will they lean more into these established genres, or is there another surprise genre they’re aiming to introduce? Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with the discussions and speculations! Our goal is to offer a range of programming that appeals to various tastes while pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in the lineup. Your favorite might just be around the corner. Thanks for your continued support! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a convo in late April where TL is going away, G&G is coming to 4Kids TV to take its place, Also Kirby is leaving the CW in late May, our currently 24/7 channel exclusive alien is taking its place Thread Title: Late April Shakeup: Tomodachi Life Departing, G&G and Alien Surprise Incoming! 🌌📺 ToonMasterJay: Heads up, team! Just caught wind that Tomodachi Life’s journey on CW4Kids is wrapping up by end of April. Bittersweet, but hey, every season finale preludes a new beginning, right? And guess what’s making waves? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is migrating from CW to 4Kids TV! DigitalToonFan: Whoa, serious moves in the lineup! “Tomodachi Life” had a quirky charm, for sure. But “Gloopy and Glitter” hopping over to 4Kids TV? Interesting switch. They’ve got that intergalactic buddy vibe that could really shine there. And Kirby’s space? Filled by our beloved 24/7 channel exclusive alien, huh? Intriguing! AnimationAficionado: Honestly, “Gloopy and Glitter” has that universal appeal (pun intended), perfect for 4Kids TV. But I’m really curious about our exclusive alien friend taking up residence on CW in place of Kirby. Such a mystery! Any teasers on who this extraterrestrial might be? GoGoFan223: Sad to see Kirby float off into the sunset, but excited for the alien to land! “Gloopy and Glitter” always had that zany, out-of-this-world vibe that’ll probably resonate well on 4Kids TV. As for the alien, fingers crossed for something as charismatic and engaging! SonicXforever: “Tomodachi Life” leaving is like the end of an era, but change is the name of the game. “Gloopy and Glitter” will surely bring their sparkle to 4Kids TV. Now, about our alien – could this mean even more cosmic adventures? CW4Kids and 4Kids TV really know how to keep the universe expanding. PokeNostalgia101: A little heartbroken over Kirby’s departure – those adventures were a blast. But, if the CW4Kids tradition holds, our new alien amigo will fill those boots and then some. As for “Gloopy and Glitter”, those two are about to become interstellar icons over at 4Kids TV. LyokoLover: It’s always interesting to see how these shifts play out. “G&G” has been doing well, so 4Kids TV seems like a logical next chapter for them. Meanwhile, Kirby leaving a void? Let’s hope our new alien resident brings a blend of humor and adventure to fill that vacuum. ComicStripKid: So much happening! While I’ll miss the faces leaving, “Gloopy and Glitter’s” move and the mysterious alien arrival promise fresh storylines and laughs. The CW4Kids universe seems to be ever-evolving. Here’s hoping the alien is as entertaining as our departing friends! ToonTalker91: Changes abound! It’s the cosmic cycle of toon life - some shows set beyond the horizon while new stars rise. “Gloopy and Glitter” will definitely add their unique luster to 4Kids TV. Eagerly awaiting our alien’s unveiling. May it bring a galaxy of new stories to explore! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with your enthusiasm and speculations! Transitions, like the ones you’re seeing, are part of our commitment to keeping our lineup fresh and engaging. Rest assured, “Gloopy and Glitter” and our new extraterrestrial addition are just the beginning of more exciting things to come. Stay tuned and keep watching — adventure is always around the corner!

Seems like our screens will be hosting quite the interstellar party! ToonMasterJay: The addition of “Four Eyes!” really solidifies the extraterrestrial theme they’re going for. But here’s a thought – what if 4Kids is plotting an Alien Hour for the summer? Imagine back-to-back alien adventures, capped off with “The Gees” in between as a quirky interlude. That’d be something! DigitalToonFan: An Alien Hour would be epic! “Four Eyes!”, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”, plus “The Gees” shorts? Sounds like a perfect blend of cosmic chaos and laughter. It’s like they’re curating a dedicated space block for all of us sci-fi toon heads. GoGoFan223: Loving the sound of that! An Alien Hour could really showcase the diversity in their extraterrestrial storytelling. Plus, “The Gees” slots in so naturally – they bring a unique charm that could glue the whole hour together. SonicXforever: The potential for an Alien Hour got me thinking – 4Kids has always been about pushing creative boundaries. This could be their way of testing the waters for more themed hours. And honestly, who doesn’t love a good alien tale? PokeNostalgia101: If anyone can make an Alien Hour work, it’s 4Kids. They’ve got a knack for mixing up genres and themes in the coolest ways. And with “The Gees” as comedic relief? Count me in! Just hoping the variety stays fresh and keeps us on our toes. LyokoLover: The more I think about it, the more I get on board with the Alien Hour idea. These characters and stories offer so much in terms of creativity and fun. It’s a brilliant way to keep viewers engaged, especially over the summer when everyone’s looking for an escape. ComicStripKid: An Alien Hour seems like a great strategy to pull viewers into a universe 4Kids is crafting. I mean, alien adventures are timeless, and integrating “The Gees” means there’s never a dull moment. Here’s hoping they take the leap and make it happen! ToonTalker91: It’s all about creating an experience, and an Alien Hour could really set a unique tone for the summer. Plus, it’d give “Four Eyes!” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a fantastic platform to shine even brighter. Fingers crossed 4Kids goes for it! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We love seeing your excitement and speculation about what’s coming up! While we can’t confirm or deny the plans for an Alien Hour just yet, rest assured that we’re always looking for innovative ways to entertain our audience.

With the summer winding down, we’re looking at a lineup that’s packing some serious punch. Not just fresh episodes but brand NEW shows are stepping into the limelight: “Redakai: Conquer the Kairu,” “Vampire Hunters” (yep, that’s the 4Kids take on “Demon Slayer”), “Chaotic: Reloaded” (a sequel we’ve all been dreaming of!), and “My Dad the Spy” (the intriguing 4Kids dub of “Spy X Family”). DigitalToonFan: “My Dad the Spy” and “Vampire Hunters” caught my eye! Genius move getting into those major anime titles. “Chaotic: Reloaded” is like meeting an old friend with a new face. And “Redakai,” that’s going to be interesting. Exciting times! AnimationAficionado: WOW! “Demon Slayer” as “Vampire Hunters” and “Spy X Family” turning into “My Dad the Spy”? Only 4Kids can pull off such daring dubs. But seriously, “Chaotic: Reloaded” has me all amped up. Can’t wait to see what’s new and what’s stayed the same. GoGoFan223: Here’s the entire fall lineup so far, as I understand it: 1. “Redakai: Conquer the Kairu” 2. “Vampire Hunters” 3. “Chaotic: Reloaded” 4. “My Dad the Spy” 5. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” 6. “Four Eyes!” 7. “Code Lyoko” 8. “The Owl” (shorts) 9. “The Gees” (shorts) 10. “Pokémon Horizons: The Series” 11. “World of Quest” SonicXforever: “Chaotic: Reloaded” is going to be a blast from the past but with a futuristic twist, I bet. And “World of Quest” sticking around is great news. Also, intrigued by how “Vampire Hunters” will resonate with the audience. PokeNostalgia101: The decision to include major titles like “Demon Slayer” and “Spy X Family” in a form more accessible to the 4Kids audience is a bold and potentially brilliant move. Mixing well-loved series with their unique dubs could really set the fall schedule apart. LyokoLover: The diversity in this lineup is incredible! From sequels and reboots to fresh dubs of hit anime, it looks like CW4Kids is aiming to cater to a wide audience this fall. Also, can’t help but wonder how “Code Lyoko” will interact with these new additions. ComicStripKid: “Redakai” and “Pokémon Horizons” will be great for keeping that action-adventure vibe going strong, while “My Dad the Spy” could add a wholesome yet thrilling family dynamic. Plus, those shorts like “The Owl” are perfect palate cleansers between heavier shows. ToonTalker91: “Vampire Hunters” could be the wildcard of the bunch, considering its origin. Also, super curious about how “Chaotic: Reloaded” plans to evolve the storyline. Either way, this fall is setting up to be game-changing for CW4Kids! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled to share our fall lineup with all of you!

Write a convo suprised Quest is back, but figured it was coming since it replaced TL’s webpage on 4kids.tv in mid April Thread Title: World of Quest Makes a Triumphant Return! 🌍⚔️ QuestFanatic88: Holy smokes, did anyone else catch that “World of Quest” is back on the CW4Kids fall lineup?! I’m genuinely surprised but kind of saw it coming after “Tomodachi Life” vanished and WoQ took over its webpage on 4kids.tv back in April. It was like a silent drumroll! ToonArchivist42: Yeah, I noticed the webpage swap too! It was pretty low-key, but definitely hinted at something big. “World of Quest” has that unique blend of humor and adventure that’s been missing. Glad CW4Kids is bringing back some fan favorites. DigitalScribe: The subtle hints were there with the webpage transition, but seeing “World of Quest” officially back is exciting! The show always had potential; it just needed the right moment to shine again. Looks like that time is now. NostalgiaKnight: It makes you wonder if they’ve been planning this return for a while or if fan demand swayed their decision. Either way, glad to see some strategy behind this nostalgia revival. “World of Quest” has a dedicated fanbase that’s been waiting for this. ComicRelief: TBH, I almost lost hope it would come back, but that sneaky webpage change in April perked my eyebrows. It’s like they were testing the waters to gauge our reaction. Well played, CW4Kids, well played. Excited to see where they take the storyline this season! AdventureAwait: This is the best news! “World of Quest” has that rare mix of epic quests and laugh-out-loud moments. It’s the comeback I didn’t know I was waiting for. Really curious to see if they’ll introduce new characters or stick with the classic crew. PixelPundit: Super psyched for the return, but also intrigued by how it’ll fit with the rest of the CW4Kids lineup. It’s quite diverse this year. “World of Quest” brings a specific flavor that complements the existing shows. Kudos to whoever’s curating the fall schedule! QuestLoreMaster: As a longtime fan, seeing Quest back feels like rediscovering a lost treasure. The character dynamics, the quirky humor, everything! I’m here for it all.

And a chance to vote on summer episodes? Count me in! DigitalScribe: “Redakai” finally joining the lineup feels like a perfect addition for the action-loving crowd. But let’s talk about these summer afternoon slots. An interactive element with episode voting? That’s innovative. CW4Kids is seriously upping their game. RetroCartoonLover: Voting on episodes? That’s a game-changer. Here are the shows we get to choose from: “GoGoRiki,” “World of Quest,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Code Lyoko.” My summer just got so much better. Can’t wait to see my picks on screen! PokeNostalgia101: I’m all in for “Vampire Hunters”. The concept of a Demon Slayer adaptation has me curious.

GoGoFan223: Is it just me or is CW4Kids really trying to bring back the community vibe with this voting thing? Giving us the power to choose episodes is a brilliant move.

Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a convo in May wondering which out of the 2 shows being added on June 8 are being pushed more","completion":"Thread Title: Which June Addition is CW4Kids Pushing More? “Four Eyes!” or “World of Quest”? 🤔🌟 ToonEnthusiast123: So, with both “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” joining CW4Kids on June 8, I can't help but wonder which one the network is betting on more. From the promos, it feels like “Four Eyes!” is getting a slight edge in hype. Anyone else getting that vibe? RetroCartoonLover: Definitely noticed that too. “Four Eyes!” is getting a lot of spotlight, especially with its unique plotline about Emma, the alien girl trying to fit in on Earth. It’s fresh content compared to “World of Quest” which, albeit a fantastic show, is making a comeback rather than a debut. DigitalScribe: You’ve got a point. However, “World of Quest” has its dedicated fanbase eagerly awaiting its return. Perhaps CW4Kids is leveraging the built-in audience and feels the need to push “Four Eyes!” harder to build a new viewership from the ground up. AnimationAficionado: I feel like “Four Eyes!” promotional material is everywhere on their social media channels. It’s almost as though they’re testing the waters with a new concept, seeing if it can draw in the same crowd as their staple shows. Meanwhile, “World of Quest” is riding on nostalgia, which has its own powerful draw. GoGoFan223: It's interesting because “Four Eyes!” could attract a younger audience who are looking for something new, while “World of Quest” appeals to those who’ve been following CW4Kids and even Kids WB for years. Strategically, it makes sense to push the new blood a bit more. LyokoLover: True, but let’s not underestimate “World of Quest”. There’s been a decent amount of buzz around its return among long-time fans. CW4Kids might be balancing promoting the new kid on the block (“Four Eyes!”) while relying on “World of Quest”’s established reputation to generate its own hype. PokeNostalgia101: Honestly, I'm just glad CW4Kids is diversifying their lineup with both new and returning series. Whether they're pushing “Four Eyes!” more or not, it's a win-win for us viewers. More variety and more reasons to tune in! ComicStripKid: Exactly! At the end of the day, it's all about delivering content that resonates with their audience. If “Four Eyes!” is being pushed more, it’s likely to ensure it gains traction. But hey, “World of Quest” already has its champions ready to welcome it back with open arms. ToonTalker91: Spot on. It's a strategic move by CW4Kids to give a little extra push to the newcomers. But regardless of which show they're promoting more, adding both “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” to the lineup enriches the viewing experience for everyone. Can’t wait for June 8! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We're excited for both “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” to join our CW4Kids family!

This period marked the end of over two millennia of imperial rule under various dynasties, the most recent being the Qing Dynasty led by the Aisin Gioro family of the Manchus. The revolution not only toppled the Qing but also paved the way for a resurgence of a dynasty thought long gone—the Zhu dynasty, also known as the Ming, ruling once more over the Han Chinese heartlands through the Beiyang Government. The Restoration of the Zhu Dynasty The dream of \\"Overthrowing the Qing and restoring the Ming,\\" vocalized during the fervor of the Xinhai Revolution, took an unexpected turn when the Beiyang Government, a military junta that emerged dominant in the power vacuum post-revolution, aligned with proponents of the Ming restoration. In an astonishing move, the Zhu dynasty was reestablished over the eighteen provinces traditionally considered the Han Chinese heartlands. This restoration was not merely symbolic; it signified a new era where the old Ming imperial ideals were merged with modern governance concepts under a stratocratic regime. The man at the helm of this ambitious restoration was not a descendant of peasant rebels or scholarly bureaucrats but rather military men who had risen through the ranks of the Beiyang Army. Their governance style reflected their roots—strategic, hierarchical, and with an emphasis on restoring order and Han Chinese cultural pride. The Fragmentation of the Chinese Realm The resurgence of the Ming, however, did not lead to the unification of all territories that once bowed to the Qing. Regions such as Manchuria, East Turkestan, Inner Mongolia, Outer Mongolia, Tuva, Tibet, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi charted their own paths, becoming sovereign entities distinct from both Manchuria and the Beiyang-ruled Han China. Manchuria emerged as a quasi-independent entity under the Qing imperial court's remnants, with the Manchu Qing seizing control from the Fengtian Clique—a faction led by the notorious \\"Old Marshal\\" Zhang Zhuolin, whose allegiances shifted from banditry to the Manchu military system and finally to the leadership of Manchuria during the tumultuous revolution period. It is speculated that covert support from Imperial Japan played a role in this dramatic power shift. To the south, Guangdong and Guangxi, regions with a strong tradition of resisting central authority, united to form an independent Cantonese nationalist republic, embodying the aspirations of its people for self-determination and local governance. In the vast expanses of East Turkestan, a historical shift restored the Kumul Khanate, led by a side branch of the Imperial House of Borjigin—the Imperial House of Chagatai. This reestablishment connected the region back to its illustrious past under the rule of Genghis Khan's descendants, reflecting a deep-rooted aspiration to revive their grand historical legacy. Tibet, under the spiritual and temporal leadership of the Lamas, maintained its unique position as a de facto independent entity, with its spiritual traditions and governance systems intact, mostly untouched by the upheavals in the Chinese heartlands. Yunnan saw the restoration of the Daili Kingdom, with the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan reclaiming power. This move was orchestrated by the Yunnan Clique, a faction that successfully navigated the complex political environment to reestablish a regime deeply rooted in the region's history and cultural identity. Greater Mongolia, under the Bogd Khanate of Mongolia, reasserted its independence, with the Bogd Khans establishing a theocratic governance system that echoed the greatness of the Mongol Empire at its zenith. # Conclusion The early 20th century was a period of profound change for China and its bordering regions. The restoration of the Zhu dynasty marked a significant moment in Chinese history, blending ancient imperial traditions with the demands of modern governance. Yet, the fragmentation of the larger Chinese realm into independent entities highlighted the complexities of nationalism, regionalism, and cultural identity that would define the politics of the region well into the 21st century. This era of restoration and fragmentation underscored the enduring legacy of China's imperial past, even as it stepped into the modern world, forever altering the geopolitical landscape of Asia."},{"prompt":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how websites that allow users to create accounts often make it more difficult to delete the account after creating one. Rarely is there any delete section where the user who may have inadvertently created the account is able to easily delete it. Moreover, if the user wanted to create a new account after deleting the first one, the website often makes it impossible to use the same credentials of the old account to set up the new account despite having deleted the old account.","completion":"In the digital age, the creation and deletion of online accounts have become commonplace, intertwining with the fabric of our day-to-day lives. Websites that permit users to create accounts often present a paradoxical scenario; the process of account creation is usually straightforward and enticing, often requiring no more than a few clicks and the entry of basic personal information. In contrast, the task of deleting an account can be an ordeal, shrouded in obfuscation and unnecessary complexity. This dichotomy is not accidental but a calculated design choice influenced by the business imperatives and user engagement metrics that dominate the web's commercial landscape. To begin with, the ease with which one can create an account is fundamental to the user acquisition strategy of many websites. The allure of immediate access to services or content encourages a user to overlook the implications of sharing personal data, under the assumption that they can easily retract their decision at any time. This assumption, however, is often misguided. When the time comes to delete an account, users frequently encounter a labyrinthine process fraught with obstacles. This can range from the absence of a straightforward 'delete account' option in user settings, requiring the user to navigate through multiple pages and confirmations, to the need for direct contact with customer support—a process that can be time-consuming and frustrating. Illustrative of this issue are social media platforms where deleting an account requires users to search through help articles or FAQs to find the relevant information, often buried under layers of other less critical information. This deliberate obfuscation serves a dual purpose from the platform's perspective. Firstly, it reduces the rate of account deletions, preserving user numbers that are critical to attracting advertisers and investors. Secondly, it encourages users to merely deactivate or abandon their accounts rather than delete them, leaving the data available for the platform's use. Moreover, the aftermath of account deletion reveals further complexities regarding user data and identity. Websites often prohibit the use of previously registered email addresses or usernames for new accounts. This policy ostensibly aims to prevent fraud and impersonation, but it also has the effect of locking users out of their chosen identifiers indefinitely, even long after their data should have been purged from the system. This can be particularly frustrating for users who have made a mistake in their initial registration or who wish to start afresh for any number of personal reasons. This approach underscores a broader tension within digital ecosystems between user autonomy and business interests. While users may seek flexibility and control over their online presence, websites operate on models that prioritize user engagement and data retention. The inaccessibility of straightforward account deletion options serves to dissuade users from severing their ties completely, thereby skewing the power dynamic in favor of the platforms. In conclusion, the disparity between the ease of account creation and the complexity of account deletion on many websites is a phenomenon rooted in the commercial and strategic priorities of online platforms. This practice not only frustrates users but also raises questions about the ethics of user engagement and data retention strategies.

However, its phrasing is slightly formal or old-fashioned due to the use of \\"this night\\" instead of the more common contemporary phrase \\"tonight.\\" A more casual or modern way to express the same idea would be \\"You need to wake up early and buy the spirits for tonight.\\" Both versions convey the necessity of purchasing alcoholic beverages in preparation for an event or gathering occurring on the same day, emphasizing the urgency of doing so early."},{"prompt":"and how about \\"to buy the spirits\\" or \\"to buy spirits\\"","completion":"Both \\"to buy the spirits\\" and \\"to buy spirits\\" are grammatically correct, but they have slightly different nuances. 1. **To buy the spirits**: The use of \\"the\\" specifies a particular set or type of spirits that both the speaker and listener are already aware of. It suggests that the spirits in question have been previously discussed, or there's a specific selection or type that needs to be purchased. It's more definite and directed. 2. **To buy spirits**: The absence of \\"the\\" makes this phrase more general. It means to buy any type of spirits, without specifying a particular selection. It's more open-ended and could refer to buying a variety of spirits based on what's available or preferred at the moment of purchase. In the context of planning for an event, \\"to buy the spirits\\" implies you have a clear list or idea of what you need, while \\"to buy spirits\\" suggests you have the flexibility to choose from a broader range."},{"prompt":"\\"Thanks to this wire it will be necessary to format your Pc, I hope you understand. \\" what does it mean by thanks here?","completion":"The use of \\"thanks\\" in the sentence \\"Thanks to this wire it will be necessary to format your PC, I hope you understand.\\" seems a bit unconventional. Here, \\"thanks to\\" doesn't signify gratitude but rather is used to indicate the cause or reason for a forthcoming action or consequence. It can be interpreted as saying \\"Due to this wire\\" or \\"Because of this wire.\\" Essentially, the sentence informs someone that, because of an issue or situation involving a wire (possibly implying damage, a connection problem, or a security risk), there is a need to format the computer, which means erasing all data to reinstall the operating system or restore the system to its original state. The speaker is expressing hope that the listener understands the necessity of this drastic measure, possibly acknowledging the inconvenience or data loss it may entail."},{"prompt":"but is right its use there?","completion":"In this context, the use of \\"thanks to\\" might seem a bit awkward because \\"thanks to\\" is usually employed either to express gratitude for positive outcomes or, when used sarcastically or in a negative context, to highlight the cause of an unfavorable situation somewhat ironically. The sentence you provided appears to use \\"thanks to\\" in the latter sense, attributing the need to format the PC to whatever problem is associated with \\"this wire.\\" Grammatically, it's correct, but it's crucial to note the tone and implication. If the intent is to neutrally state the cause of the problem without implying blame or expressing sarcasm, a phrase like \\"due to this wire\\" or \\"because of this wire\\" would be clearer and more direct. However, if the speaker aims to emphasize frustration or the negative impact of \\"this wire,\\" then \\"thanks to\\" conveys that nuance, albeit with a slight hint of irony. So, the choice between these expressions depends on the message's intended tone and the relationship between the speaker and the listener."},{"prompt":"transliteration of the text: المقاومة تشن هجوما مركبا على مقرات العدو في “المنارة” ومستوطنو الشمال يستعدون لمقاضاة نتنياهو","completion":"Al-muqawama tushinu hujooman murakkaban 'alaa maqarati al-'aduwwi fi \\"Al-Manara\\" wamustawtinoon ash-shamal yasta'iddoona limuqadati Netanyahu"},{"prompt":"شات اريد منك ان تساعدني في الحصول على دومين مجاني","completion":"إذا كنت تبحث عن دومين (نطاق) مجاني، هناك عدة طرق يمكن أن تساعدك في الحصول على واحد. يجب الانتباه إلى أن الدومينات المجانية قد تأتي مع بعض القيود مثل إعلانات إضافية أو نطاق فرعي بدلاً من نطاق أساسي. إليك بعض الخيارات: 1. **استخدام مزودي خدمات الاستضافة المجانية**: بعض شركات الاستضافة تقدم دومين مجاني كجزء من حزمة الاستضافة، حتى لو كانت الاستضافة نفسها مجانية أو بتكلفة منخفضة. من المهم قراءة شروط الخدمة جيدًا لفهم ما تحصل عليه وما هي القيود. 2. **نطاقات المستوى الأعلى المجانية (TLDs)**: بعض المنظمات تقدم دومينات مجانية تحت نطاقات معينة مثل \`.tk\`, \`.ml\`, \`.ga\`, \`.cf\`, و\`.gq\`. هذه الخدمات غالبًا ما تقدم من قبل Freenom أو مزودين مشابهين. 3. **برامج الطلاب والتعليم**: إذا كنت طالبًا أو جزءًا من المؤسسة التعليمية، قد تتمكن من الحصول على دومين مجاني من خلال برامج مثل GitHub Student Developer Pack. 4. **مسابقات وعروض ترويجية**: بعض الشركات تقدم دومينات مجانية كجزء من مسابقة أو عرض ترويجي. يجب متابعة المدونات والمنتديات التقنية للحصول على معلومات حول هذه العروض. 5. **استخدام subdomain مجاني**: إذا كنت تريد ببساطة اختبار موقع أو مشروع ولا تحتاج إلى دومين مخصص، يمكنك استخدام subdomain مجاني من خلال منصات مثل WordPress.com, Blogger, أو Wix. تذكر أن الحصول على دومين مجاني قد يكون خيارًا جيدًا للبدء أو لأغراض التجربة، ولكن لمشروع تجاري أو مهني مهم، قد يكون من الأفضل النظر في شراء دومين بتكلفة مالية لضمان المزيد من الاحترافية والثقة."},{"prompt":"شركات اخرى","completion":"إذا كنت تبحث عن خيارات أخرى للحصول على دومين مجاني أو بتكلفة منخفضة من شركات غير التي ذكرتها سابقًا، فهناك بعض البدائل المعتبرة التي يمكن أن تكون مفيدة. يجب الأخذ في الاعتبار أن العروض قد تتغير بناءً على الوقت والموقع، لذا يُنصح بزيارة المواقع الرسمية لتلك الشركات للحصول على أحدث المعلومات: 1. **Namecheap**: بينما لا تقدم دائمًا دومينات مجانية، Namecheap يمكن أن تقدم أحيانًا دومينات بتكلفة منخفضة جدًا كجزء من عروض ترويجية خاصة أو للأعمال أو الأفراد الجدد. 2. **Bluehost**: عادةً ما يكون هناك عرض ترويجي يقدم دومين مجانًا للسنة الأولى عند التسجيل في خطة استضافة.

Have you all caught wind of the latest buzz? Looks like we're about to enter the \\"Re-Splat\\" era, coinciding with the premiere of \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward\\" (TMNT:FF). While I'm all for nostalgia and digging the idea of a throwback, does anyone else feel a twinge of sadness for the departure of our gooey friend, the Orange Blob? Forum User2: SlimeMaster2000 Date: March 15, 2024 Absolutely, @AnimationFan88! The Blob was a hallmark of creativity and imagination. Its shape-shifting antics always had a way to light up the screen. Truly an end of an era. But, change is a constant, especially in the world of television. Excited to see how the Re-Splat era will integrate the old with the new. Forum User3: NostalgiaNerd92 Date: March 16, 2024 I'm torn! The Orange Blob was definitely a unique mascot, symbolizing the adaptability and fluid creativity Nickelodeon stands behind. However, the prospect of TMNT:FF does have me excited. The “Re-Splat” era sounds like it might bring back some of the vibes and aesthetics from the golden age of Nick. The blob will be missed though… Forum User4: CartoonCritic101 Date: March 16, 2024 The Blob will be missed, but it's not the end of Nickelodeon's creativity or its capacity to innovate. Think about it, Nickelodeon has been rebranding and evolving since its inception. Each era brought something new to the table while still celebrating its heritage. I’m curious to see how TMNT:FF will pave the way for this Re-Splat era and what new or returning elements we'll see. Forum User5: GooLover63 Date: March 17, 2024 Definitely sad to see the Blob go. There was something so inclusive and welcoming about a character that could literally morph into anything, mirroring the boundless imagination of kids (and adults, let's be honest). Still, Nickelodeon's always had a knack for growing with its audience while drawing in new generations. The Re-Splat era, especially with TMNT:FF leading the charge, has the potential to do just that. Farewell, Orange Blob, thanks for the memories! Forum User6: RetroReviver Date: March 17, 2024 As someone who's been a fan of Nick through all its phases, I can honestly say that every rebrand brings its own magic. The Orange Blob was a testament to that. A simple, amorphous blob captured our hearts by being relatable to every viewer in its own unique way. Here's hoping the Re-Splat era maintains the essence of what made the Blob era special - fostering imagination and a sense of belonging. TMNT:FF could just be the beginning of another incredible chapter for Nickelodeon! --- And so, the forum conversation continues, with members fondly reminiscing about the Orange Blob while expressing cautious optimism for the upcoming Re-Splat era and its flagship series, \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward\\"."},{"prompt":"Write a convo where after the new look launches, a user confirms Nicktoons still has the Pixels, and Nick Jr still has Moose and Zee","completion":"Title: Nick’s New Look: What About Nicktoons and Nick Jr.?

Представим, что у вас есть файл \`config.txt\`, в котором хранится значение переменной, например так: \`\`\` MY_VARIABLE=123 \`\`\` Давайте прочитаем это значение и сделаем переменную \`MY_VARIABLE\` глобальной в нашем скрипте Python. # Шаг 1: Чтение данных из файла Для начала нам нужно открыть файл и прочитать из него данные: \`\`\`python # Открываем файл для чтения with open('config.txt', 'r') as file: data = file.read() print(data) # Выведет содержимое файла, например, \\"MY_VARIABLE=123\\" \`\`\` # Шаг 2: Разбор данных Следующий шаг - получить конкретные значения переменных из прочитанных данных. Если формат данных известен и прост (как в нашем примере), можно использовать простой строковый метод \`split\`: \`\`\`python # Предполагаем, что строка формата \\"KEY=VALUE\\" key, value = data.split('=') print(key) # Выведет \\"MY_VARIABLE\\" print(value) # Выведет \\"123\\" \`\`\` # Шаг 3: Присвоение значения глобальной переменной Теперь, когда у нас есть ключ и значение, мы можем установить это значение глобальной переменной. Однако стоит учесть, что прямое присвоение имени переменной из строки не является прямолинейным в Python из-за особенностей языка.

With the fall of the Qing, a new yet ancient dawn broke over China as the Imperial House of Zhu, tracing its lineage back through the hazy corridors of time to the venerated Ming dynasty, rose to govern the heartland of Han China once more. Through a series of unexpected alliances and political maneuvering, the Beiyang Government, a military juggernaut, became the unlikely custodian of the Ming restoration, fulfilling the revolutionary slogan \\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\" with a vigor that intertwined the martial spirit of the Beiyang with the refined legacy of the Zhu. As the dust settled on the mainland, a mosaic of independent states began to emerge around the once-unified empire. The change was not merely political; it was a transformation that would redefine the essence of the region and its peoples for centuries to come. The Splintered Realms Manchuria, under the aegis of the Qing Imperial Court, now found itself an enclave of tradition within a world in tumult. The court, leveraging an unexpected alliance with Imperial Japan and seizing control from the Fengtian Clique's Zhang Zhuolin, embarked on a journey to reestablish a semblance of the old order amidst new realities. To the south, Guangdong and Guangxi, buoyed by a fierce spirit of Cantonese nationalism, coalesced into an independent republic, embarking on a path that diverged sharply from their northern neighbors, embodying a different vision for the future of the Chinese people. In the west, the ancient lands of East Turkestan witnessed the rise of the Imperial House of Borjigin in the Kumul Khanate, breathing life into a lineage that connected the present to the vast empire of Genghis Khan. Meanwhile, Tibet remained a sanctum of spiritual governance under the Lamaist theocracy, a beacon of Buddist serenity and autonomy thriving amidst geopolitical upheavals. Yunnan, ever the cradle of diversity and defiance, saw the restoration of the Dali Kingdom and the reascendance of the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan, guided by the astute strategies of the Yunnan Clique, navigating through the turbulent waters of banditry, warlordism, and nascent nationalism. Perhaps the most poignant of all was the unification of the Mongolian steppes under the auspices of the Bogd Khanate, a realm of nomadic splendor and spirituality reborn, reaching from the heartlands of Outer Mongolia to the verdant pastures of Tuva. A Fragmented Harmony The world that emerged from the ashes of the Xinhai Revolution was one of delicate balances. The resurgence of the Ming in the form of a military-dominated Beiyang Government in the heart of Han China represented not merely a political resurrection but a cultural and ideological renaissance that sought to reconcile the martial valor of the Beiyang with the civilizational depth of the Ming. Simultaneously, the constellation of independent states that surrounded this new Ming heartland—each with its lineage, each with its vision—created a complex tapestry of interactions, rivalries, and alliances that would define the region's geopolitical landscape for the future. Conclusion As the 20th century unfurled and gave way to the new millennium, the restoration of the Ming and the emergence of the independent realms around it displayed the enduring legacy of China's rich history, even as they navigated the tempestuous waters of modernity. The story of this era, marked by a return to ancient roots amidst the clamor for progress and self-determination, remains a testament to the resilience and diversity of the human spirit, forever etched in the annals of history."},{"prompt":"I need suggestions on how to continue this story (I don't want you to continue it, I just want you to suggest where the narrative should go next): A pilgrimage to the Temple of Ma'at is all my late mother had asked me to do when she died. She told me to take her urn to the reliquary so that her ashes can at least be in the same place as the Holy Corpse. I'm personally not a devotee of Ma'at, but I can see how the faith became famous. A demigoddess who defected from the enemy, the Theoclasts, to help protect an entire continent. The Barrier is one of her great works, five pillars that hold it up around Yuandi. I am human. Or renshi. Or a mixture of the two, I don't know. I was left by my parents' doorstep by the people who birthed me (whom I refuse to call \\"parents\\") and was raised by an Anglo-Elf family. Being the only one with dark hair in the entire village, my nickname became Bláicheare, though my name is Caelan. I have two sisters, one 5 years older and another 6 years younger. I was never treated differently by anyone, though I can guess that's because of my innate light magic connection. Ever since I can remember, I was healing the wounded. I heard that the Anglo-Elves despise humans, even though they're basically a mix between humans and elves. Perhaps they think having elven blood makes them superior. When mother died, we held a funeral for two days as is customary. She died of an unknown illness that my healing magic couldn't cure. After her cremation, my father entrusted to me her wish, which I stated before. Since I'm the only able-bodied male in my family and I look old enough, I was the logical choice. Anglo-Elves mature slower than humans, so I look older than my sisters. Unfortunately, our nation, the Igirith Kingdom, is at war with the neighbouring Jirkaeriya Confederacy over the ownership of the large island on the west coast of the continent. We call it Haséaleen, they call it Haşarin. In my opinion, we should let Jirkaeriya have it, since we already overlook the Red Pillar on the far south of the continent. For some reason, the Anglo-Elves think the Hazrun can't be trusted to protect the Black Pillar, which is located in Haséaleen. With a war and border raids going or not, I still wanted to honour my mother's death wish, so I departed with a caravan of Mustalf (or dark elves, as some call them) that were in their way to the Archbishopric of Ma'at. Since they're neutral and wanderers anyway, I believe travelling with them is a good choice. The payment would be to provide free healing until we arrived at the Archbishopric. I can only say I had some culture shocks while among the Mustalf. Firstly, our appearances are strikingly different. They exclusively have dark skin, be it grey, black, or bluish, due to an ancient curse placed upon them thousands of years ago, or so the stories go. That's why the elves despise them and they used to be a single race, in fact. Their hair can be red, white, blonde, or black, and their eyes are often red, though many can also have golden, green, and blue eyes. To me, they look just like elves with a different coat of paint. Their language is quite similar to elvish, a language that I studied in passing. The language of the Anglo-Elves is much more similar to the language of the Weisslanders, humans from the Pectus continent, who fled their homeland due to the Theoclasm. They are also very loud, eccentric, and artistically inclined. All the time I heard song around me and any occasion could be an excuse to laugh and dance. Every night some wounded Mustalf men would come to me. I healed them without questioning, as this was part of our deal. Two Mustalf females took a liking to me: Tethys and Eroha. Tethys looked older, perhaps around 28 in human years, and had an \\"older-sisterly\\" or motherly air to her, while Eroha, despite telling me she was 24, looked younger. The Mustalf can live up to 200 years and age twice as slowly as humans, while the Anglo-Elves live up to 130 years. Tethys knew some dark magic and liked to compare our spells. She even taught me how to draw certain sigils and circles and was always asking me to retrieve ingredients for her potions. Eroha was more playful and reckless. She liked to show me tricks with her untrained fire magic. When we parted, the tribal elders proposed that I should stay. I refused, I'm no Mustalf, and my father still needs my help. My mother's death took its toll on him. Eroha couldn't bear to give her farewells when I turned my back to the caravan and began climbing the steep stairs to one of the many temples of Ma'at. The Archbishopric can be called a nation, I imagine. It has borders, a type of government, a self defence force... It's located on the centre of the continent and is nestled between high mountainous formations that serve as its natural borders as well as barriers against foreign invasions. However. I doubt anyone would invade it, since it has kept its neutrality since its foundation almost 500 years ago, is responsible for maintaining the Five Pillars, and serves as a haven for the disenfranchised of all races. The way up is exhausting, but they fortunately have outposts built along the winding mountain paths, though not all of them are manned. For my first stop, I simply took out a bedroll and slept on the ground of a quite small and empty stone outpost. Even though there were people offering transportation, I decided to go on foot since I was low on money. Two days later, I had eaten the last of my rations. My leg muscles burnt from the physical exertion. All I could see around me were the road, the mountainside, and some unknown small plants around me. The saying \\"a nap is sometimes a poor man's meal\\" came to my mind, but where would I sleep? The sun was still up and I had nothing to make a quick shelter, not even wood to hang some fabrics. Then I heard the loud laughter of a male. Perhaps it would be my salvation. I would buy some of his food with the money that remained. As the voice came closer, I heard others who accompanied the man. Women, it seemed. I waited patiently until they came across me and was surprised to see that they were Hazrun, the horned people from Jirkaeriya who were currently at war with my nation. Since I'm not an Anglo-Elf, perhaps they wouldn't be hostile to me. \\"Mitertse! Aki umanu!\\" Said the male. He was taller than me, very muscular, and had tattoos or bodypaint all around his body. His skin was grey, his hair black and his horns were curved like a ram's. He walked shirtless and carried a large war axe on his shoulders. He came close to me and knelt down where I was sitting, looking at me with his piercing golden eyes. He said something to his companions, who were three Hazrun women as well. I gestured that I needed food and offered him some coins, but he closed my hand and gently shoved it back towards me. They began unpacking and soon set up a fire to roast some small animals. \\"Haka tsu myei ye Taokar.\\" He said, pointing to himself. \\"Yus uragere ye Kuşien, Kunnebudo pa Manmurekan.\\" He said pointing to his companions. All my life I was taught that the Hazrun were barbaric beyond belief, that they drank the blood of beasts and that they were promiscuous and immoral, and thus unfit to have the Black Pillar within their borders. Looking at them, I just saw kind people. Yes, their appearance is striking, but they seem to be empathetic, at least. The women had an alluring beauty to them. Kunnebudo was grey-skinned and golden-eyed like Taokar, but her chest-length hair was silver-coloured and her horns were short, pointy, and straight. She wore a loose, long-sleeved tunic and a type of baggy trousers. Manmurekan had very long braided black hair that went down beyond her waist. Her eyes were red as rubies and she had four horns, two short ones on the scalp and two thicker ones on the sides of her head. She wore a hair veil and exquisitely detailed red clothes that contrasted with her extremely pale skin that was the colour of marble. On her forehead there was a tattoo resembling an eye. Kuşien, the most quiet one, also had marble-coloured skin. Her wavy hair was black and shoulder-length and the two horns that grew from where her forehead ended and the hairline began were like Kunnebudo’s, though slightly curved backwards. Her eyes were a piercing jasper colour. She had peculiar facepaint under her eyes that resembled streams of tears. Unlike the other two, her ornate black clothes covered her navel entirely. It almost seemed like mourning attire to me. She carried a bow and a quiver with her. After swiftly skinning a rabbit and two lizards, they promptly skewered them and put them over the fire. Observing them, I could see that Taokar was the most talkative, while Kunnebudo seemed to be airheaded. Manmurekan had a wise air about her and Kuşien sometimes looked at the sky with a deep sadness or longing. We tried communicating with words and to my surprise, Kuşien spoke Sendralese, the language of the humans, of which I knew but a few words. However, since I could only speak Anglo-Elven, we shifted back to mimicking and gestures with the occasional Hazrun word. It wasn't much, but we ate the small animals to the bone. It was good to finally have something in my stomach. Before these four, I had only seen the Hazrun from afar, chained as war prisoners. If my father knew I was having a friendly interaction with the enemy, I'd never hear the end of it. I felt obligated to repay the group. Since they didn't want my money and there was a language barrier between us, I decided to show them what I could do to be useful. I slashed my hand with a knife and showed it to them, then cast a healing spell to close the wound before their eyes. Taokar gave a wide smile and said words that, despite being incomprehensible to me, seemed like encouragement. Manmurekan looked at me with an intrigued gaze. Kunnebudo suddenly remembered something and went after Kuşien, who was sitting on the ground on the way ahead of us. Bringing Kuşien by hand, Kunnebudo gestured for me to heal her, raising Kuşien's tunic and showing me a wound on her porcelain-white knee. Berating her friend, Kuşien appeared opposed to this, but I insisted and touched her knee, casting a light healing spell. The bruise vanished without a trace. Everyone looked expectantly at Kuşien, who said \\"Agrazas\\" - thank you in Sendralese. They all laughed as she awkwardly walked back to where she was before. Taokar patted me on the back, again saying words I couldn't understand but that sounded friendly. They gestured for me to come along with them. Through drawings on the ground, they explained that there could be monsters on the way and that we would sleep at the next checkpoint. We only had about 2 more hours of sunlight, so we should hurry.","completion":"Given the current progression and themes in your story, there are several intriguing directions you could take the narrative. Here are a few suggestions: 1. **Deepening Cultural Exchange:** As Caelan continues to travel with the Hazrun group, he could learn more about their culture, beliefs, and perspectives on the war and the importance of the Black Pillar. This not only broadens his worldview but could plant the seeds for a potential alliance or mutual understanding between their peoples. Highlighting their practices, stories, and perhaps even their own magical techniques would enrich the narrative. 2. **Unveiling Hidden Truths:** The journey could lead to revelations about the historical conflict between the Hazrun and the Anglo-Elves, uncovering misconceptions and lies that have fueled the war. Perhaps Caelan discovers documents, relics, or hears tales that challenge the official narrative he grew up with. This could be integrated into the plot as they encounter ancient ruins, wise hermits, or even divine interventions that hint at a much larger picture. 3. **A Quest for the Pillars:** Given the significance of the Five Pillars in maintaining the Barrier and the specific concern over the Black Pillar located in Haséaleen, the narrative could shift towards a quest that involves visiting each of the Pillars. There could be a looming threat to the Barrier’s stability, and Caelan, along with his Hazrun companions, might find themselves unwittingly drawn into a journey to reinforce or heal the Pillars. 4. **Conflict and Resolution:** The pilgrimage might lead Caelan directly into the conflict between the Igirith Kingdom and the Jirkaeriya Confederacy. A calculated attack or a crucial diplomatic mission could be underway at the Temple of Ma'at, placing Caelan in a position where his mixed heritage and unique position as a peace-maker come into play. His decision-making could affect the outcome of the war or open a pathway to negotiations. 5. **Personal Transformation and Discovery:** Throughout the journey, Caelan could undergo a significant transformation in terms of his identity, magic abilities, and purpose. Discovering the truth about his origins—perhaps revealing a lineage connected to key historical figures or demigods like Ma'at herself—would add depth to his character and the story’s mythology. This could also tie into unlocking a latent power or a unique role he has to play in uniting the divided lands. 6. **The Role of the Divine:** Exploring the involvement of deities like Ma'at in the mortal realm could introduce a new layer to the story. Caelan’s pilgrimage could culminate in a divine encounter or revelation that offers a solution to the conflict or provides insights into his mother’s wishes and the true meaning behind her request. 7. **A Gathering of Allies:** As Caelan moves closer to fulfilling his mission, he could gather a diverse group of allies from different races and backgrounds, each with their own reasons for joining his cause. This fellowship could work together to overcome a looming threat—perhaps a faction seeking to dismantle the Barrier for their own gain, or an ancient evil that the weakened state of unity has allowed to re-emerge. Focusing on themes of unity, the power of understanding, and the quest for peace in the face of entrenched division could provide compelling narrative arcs as you develop the story further."},{"prompt":"How about we try developing the story like a cyoa? I want you to describe the situations and present me with numbered choices, which will be made as if Caelan himself was choosing","completion":"Sure, let's proceed with that approach. Given the current state of your story, here's a setup for an interactive choice-driven segment: --- After sharing the meal and demonstrating your healing magic, the Hazrun group prepares to journey onward to the next checkpoint. You can't help but feel a strange sense of belonging with this group that, according to everything you've been taught, should be your enemies. Yet, their kindness and the shared journey so far have started to blur those lines for you. The sun begins its descent, casting the mountains in an amber glow, and you're faced with a decision. **1. Offer to Guide the Hazrun to the Temple of Ma'at:** Despite the potential risks given the current political climate and your pilgrimage, you consider offering to lead the Hazrun group to the Temple of Ma'at. Their kindness warrants your help, and deep down, you wonder if their perspective and presence could offer a unique insight at the Temple, possibly even a path to peace. **2. Continue Alone to the Temple:** Fulfilling your mother's final wish is paramount, and while you've come to respect the Hazrun, associating with them might complicate your mission or draw unwanted attention. Politely decline their offer to travel together, and continue your journey alone, focusing solely on the pilgrimage to honor your mother. **3. Suggest a Detour to Visit a Pillar:** Propose to the group that before heading to the Temple, you all make a detour to visit one of the Pillars—specifically, the Red Pillar that the Igirith Kingdom overlooks. This could be an opportunity to understand more about the Barrier, its importance, and possibly uncover more about the ongoing conflict. It's a risky move, fraught with the chance of encountering conflict zones, but it could provide critical insights and strengthen the bond with your new companions. **4. Ask to Learn More Hazrun Magic and Culture:** Before making any decisions about the next steps on your journey, express a desire to learn more about the Hazrun way of life, their magic, and perhaps their view on the ongoing war and the Pillars. This could mean spending more time with them, delaying your pilgrimage slightly, but the exchange of knowledge and the deepening cultural understanding could be invaluable for your personal growth and the broader challenges ahead. **5. Propose an Alliance:** Given the unexpected warmth and camaraderie developed with the Hazrun, propose an audacious plan—an alliance between your people. This would require significant discussion, trust-building, and planning. It's a long shot, especially considering the prevailing tensions, but it could be a step toward a lasting peace. Suggest starting small, with shared goals such as safe passage agreements or joint protection efforts for pilgrims and traders. **Choice?**"},{"prompt":"1","completion":"You take a moment to gather your thoughts before addressing Taokar and his companions. The decision doesn't come lightly to you, aware of the potential consequences it could hold for your mission and even for your own people. However, something within you—perhaps it's the part that has always been an outsider, or maybe it's the innate healer in you seeking to mend more than just physical wounds—urges you to extend this offer. Standing up, you clear your throat gently to catch their attention. The Hazrun group looks towards you, their faces alight with the flickering fire between you all, curiosity evident in their eyes. \\"I would like to offer to guide you to the Temple of Ma'at,\\" you begin, your voice steady despite the inner turmoil that prompted this decision. \\"It's a place of peace and learning, and perhaps, understanding one another's cultures and beliefs can be a step toward a broader peace. I can't promise the journey will be easy or without its dangers, especially given the current tensions, but I believe it's a journey worth taking, together.\\" The Hazrun exchange glances among themselves, their expressions unreadable at first. Then, Taokar stands, his stature towering but not intimidating. He wears a solemn look, one that transitions into a respectful nod towards you. \\"We accept your offer, Caelan,\\" Taokar responds in his rugged but clear Sendralese. \\"Your heart's intention echoes the values we hold dear. It will be an honor to tread this path with you, towards the Temple of Ma'at.\\" Relief washes over you, albeit mingled with a fresh surge of anxiety about the unforeseen challenges that lie ahead. Yet, the decision feels right—a step toward something meaningful beyond the immediate pilgrimage. As night envelops the landscape, you and the Hazrun group begin to make preparations for the continued journey in the morning. Conversations flow more freely now, with eager exchanges about each other's worlds, beliefs, and, ironically, shared hopes for a future where the distinctions that divide become bridges that unite. The following morning brings a crisp clarity both in the air and in the purpose that guides you. With the Hazrun group by your side, you set out toward the Temple of Ma'at, navigating the terrain with a newfound determination. The journey promises to be one of discovery, not only of the lands that stretch before you but also of the potential for unity in diversity. **Along the way:** 1. **Encounter with a Local Faction:** As you progress, you encounter a small contingent of Igirith scouts, surprised and suspicious at the sight of you traveling with the Hazrun. The situation is delicate, requiring a careful balance of diplomacy and sincerity to navigate without incident. 2. **A Shared Challenge:** The group faces a natural obstacle that demands teamwork to overcome, perhaps a swollen river or a precarious mountain path. This shared challenge strengthens your bonds and exemplifies the possible unity between your peoples. 3. **An Unfortunate Encounter:** Despite your best efforts to remain undetected, a Jirkaeriya patrol, already on edge due to the ongoing conflict, stumbles upon your mixed group. The encounter is tense, highlighting the deep-rooted prejudices and fears that fuel the conflict. Each of these encounters tests the resolve and the unity of your diverse group, challenging the very notions that have perpetuated conflict. Yet, with each step toward the Temple of Ma'at, you're also walking a path toward understanding, perhaps even toward peace. **What approach does Caelan take in these situations?**"},{"prompt":"3","completion":"Choosing to navigate an unfortunate encounter with a Jirkaeriya patrol, Caelan realizes the delicate balance of the situation. The patrol, already tense and suspicious, halts upon seeing such an unlikely assembly—a renshi (human) walking alongside Hazrun, the horned people of Jirkaeriya, veering too close to the narratives of espionage and treason in these tumultuous times. Caelan steps forward, signaling his companions to stay calm and not to make any sudden movements. His mind races for the right words, the kind of diplomacy that treads the fine line between appeasement and assertion. The Jirkaeriya patrol, hands on their weapons, watches every move intently. \\"Friends,\\" Caelan starts, his voice composed, projecting peace. \\"We are but pilgrims on a journey to the Temple of Ma'at, seeking no conflict or espionage. My companions have shown me kindness on my path, sharing food and protection. I ask for your understanding and, if possible, your blessing on our journey.\\" The leader of the Jirkaeriya patrol, a stern woman with intricate tattoos adorning her visible skin and sharp eyes that miss no detail, steps forward. She assesses Caelan for a moment that stretches into an eternity, her gaze then shifting to scrutinize each member of the Hazrun group. The air is taut with anticipation, a single breath seeming to hold the outcome of this precarious encounter. Then, slowly, the leader signals her patrol to lower their weapons. \\"We are weary of spies and saboteurs, renshi,\\" she says, her voice carrying the weight of ongoing strife. \\"But the Temple of Ma'at is sacred, a beacon of neutrality and peace even in these divided times. For its sake, we will not hinder your passage today. But be warned, the paths you tread are shadowed by war. Not all encounters will end thus.\\" Gratitude swells in Caelan's chest, a quiet nod his initial response before he finds the words to express his thanks. The patrol moves on, leaving behind a palpable relief among Caelan and his companions. The encounter, harrowing as it was, serves as a potent reminder of the journey's stakes—not just the physical traversal of lands divided by war but the pursuit of a unity glimpsed in the shared humanity and compassion among the group. As they continue their journey, the group is now more cautious but also more cohesive, their shared experience a testament to the fragile yet essential hope for understanding and peace in a fractured world. **Upon nearing the Temple of Ma'at:** The landscape gradually changes as they approach the Temple of Ma'at, becoming more serene and somehow insulated from the scars of the ongoing conflict. The temple itself emerges on the horizon, an architectural marvel that speaks of centuries of devotion, scholarship, and unity among diverse peoples. Caelan feels a mix of awe and apprehension as they draw closer, the weight of his mother's urn in his pack a constant reminder of the pilgrimage's personal stakes. Yet, he cannot ignore the broader implications of their journey, how this small group, in their own way, has begun to bridge divides that seem insurmountable. **As they reach the temple's threshold, Caelan is faced with a choice:** 1. **Enter the Temple with the Hazrun Group:** Embrace the symbolism of this act, showing all who notice that unity and peace are possible, even in small gestures. This choice could also potentially ruffle feathers among temple adherents or pilgrims with more traditional views on the sanctity of the temple and the purity of those who enter it. 2. **Ask the Hazrun to Wait Outside:** While acknowledging the unity and bonds formed during the journey, also recognize the potential for conflict or sacrilege that their presence within the temple might incite among other pilgrims or the temple's caretakers. This choice is a compromise, respecting the temple's traditions while still holding true to the bonds formed with the Hazrun group. **Caelan's choice will not only signal his personal stance but might also influence perceptions and potential paths forward for both his companions and the observers at the temple.** **What does Caelan choose to do?**"},{"prompt":"1","completion":"Choosing to enter the Temple of Ma'at alongside the Hazrun group, Caelan steps forward with a deep sense of purpose. This decision, emblematic of the unity he has come to embody and advocate for, challenges the prevailing norms and preconceptions. He senses the weight of the moment, the potential ramifications echoing with each step they take together towards the temple's grand entrance. The Hazrun, understanding the significance of this gesture, wear expressions mingled with gratitude and solemnity. They have become, whether by intention or circumstance, ambassadors of their people—a testament to the possibility of peace and understanding beyond the entrenched divides. As they cross the threshold, the air vibrates with a palpable shift, as if the temple itself acknowledges the rarity of such unity. The usual murmur of pilgrims and the shuffling of feet give way to a hushed silence, turning many eyes towards this unusual fellowship. Whispers flutter like leaves in the wind, a mixture of curiosity, skepticism, and awe weaving through the temple’s corridors. Caelan leads the group to the reliquary, his heart thrumming with a cocktail of emotions—pride, anxiety, hope. Depositing his mother's urn in its designated place, he feels a wave of relief and sorrow wash over him, the finality of the act anchoring him to the moment. The temple's priests, adorned in garments that reflect the colors of the sky at dawn, approach. Their eyes, wide with a blend of astonishment and concern, fixate on the group. The lead priest, an elderly figure whose presence commands an immediate reverence, steps forward. His gaze softens as he takes in the sight before him, and after a moment of contemplation, he speaks. \\"In the eyes of Ma'at, all souls are weighed by their truth and intent, not by the divisions sown among the lands,\\" the priest begins, his voice carrying a depth that resonates within the marble walls. \\"Your journey here, together, is a testament to a truth long forgotten amidst the clamor of conflict. You are welcome in this sacred space, for today, you embody the very principles Ma'at herself champions.\\" Some pilgrims nod in thoughtful agreement, while others whisper dissent, uncomfortable with the breaking of tradition. Yet, the priest’s declaration offers a shield of legitimacy, easing the tension that had tightened the air. After a moment of shared prayers and respects paid to Ma'at, the group exits the temple together, stepping back into the sunlight that bathes the temple’s surroundings. The world outside remains unchanged, with the day's warmth indifferent to the monumental step they've just taken. Yet, for Caelan and his companions, everything feels subtly transformed. They have not only delivered on a personal pilgrimage but have also planted the seeds of change, sowing a narrative of unity and shared humanity. **In the aftermath of their temple visit:** 1. **Dialogue and Reflection:** The group, now outside, gathers to reflect on their experience. This could be a moment of bonding, sharing personal revelations, and discussing potential paths forward. It’s an opportunity for Caelan to express his gratitude, voice his thoughts on the future, and propose continued collaboration or support among them. 2. **Parting Ways or Staying Together:** The journey to the Temple of Ma’at may have concluded, but the bonds formed challenge the necessity of parting ways. Caelan could suggest staying together for a while longer to explore how their newfound unity might be leveraged for greater benefit, potentially addressing the ongoing conflict or assisting in diplomatic efforts. 3. **Planning for a Broader Campaign:** Inspired by the impact of their unified appearance at the temple, they might decide to plan a broader campaign or initiative focused on peace-building between their peoples. This would involve conversations on strategies, potential allies, and the challenges they would need to navigate together. Caelan stands at the precipice of a new beginning, aware of the long road ahead but bolstered by the tangible sense of hope that unity, even in its smallest form, can manifest. **What next steps does Caelan take in fostering this newfound unity?**"},{"prompt":"pretend that you are an expert in making resume, now Refine my resume’s skills and achievements sections to more effectively target Administrative assistant Include specific examples of how I successfully applied [Skill] in a professional setting, leading to [Result].

Which of the following markets will a reduction in the price of world price of corn likely lead to the largest reduction in popcorn prices? a) Urban grocery stores b) Amazon.com c) Movie theaters d) The price reduction will likely be the same in all of the above markets.","completion":"The impact of a reduction in the world price of corn on popcorn prices can vary across different markets due to several factors, including the cost structure and pricing strategies of businesses in these markets. Here's a closer look at each option: a) Urban grocery stores: Urban grocery stores might pass on the cost reduction to consumers to remain competitive, especially if corn is a significant component of popcorn cost. b) Amazon.com: Online retailers like Amazon.com often have flexible pricing models and might quickly adjust prices in response to cost changes. However, their vast product range and algorithm-based pricing might not directly correlate price reductions in raw materials with final product pricing. c) Movie theaters: Movie theaters typically have high markups on concessions, including popcorn. The price of popcorn in theaters is less about the cost of goods sold and more about the profit margin and the captive audience factor. Therefore, even with a significant reduction in the world price of corn, movie theaters might not adjust their popcorn prices substantially. The price of popcorn at movie theaters is less tied to the cost of corn and more to the theater's overall pricing and profit strategy. d) The price reduction will likely be the same in all of the above markets: This is unlikely because different markets and distribution channels have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in raw material costs. Additionally, the pricing strategies and operational costs in each market or channel will influence how much of the cost saving is passed on to the consumers. Given the information, the correct answer is likely (a) Urban grocery stores, as they operate in a highly competitive market with thinner margins and a direct correlation between wholesale cost and retail pricing. Thus, they would be more likely to pass savings from reduced corn prices on to consumers, especially in competitive urban markets where consumers have multiple shopping options."},{"prompt":"this is from Elasticity chapter so should use Elasticity concept","completion":"Given that this question is from a chapter on elasticity, the concept of price elasticity of demand plays a crucial role in determining which market will likely see the largest reduction in popcorn prices due to a decrease in the world price of corn. The price elasticity of demand measures how responsive the quantity demanded of a good is to a change in its price. In markets where demand is more price elastic, a decrease in costs can lead to a significant reduction in prices as businesses try to increase quantity sold. Conversely, where demand is more inelastic, prices may not adjust as much because the quantity demanded does not change significantly with price. Let's apply the concept of elasticity to the options: a) Urban grocery stores typically operate in competitive markets where consumers are price-sensitive. If the price of corn decreases, and assuming corn is a significant component of the cost of popcorn, grocery stores might lower their prices to increase sales, leveraging the price elasticity of demand. The response in this market might be more pronounced if consumers are willing to switch based on price changes. b) Amazon.com operates in a highly competitive online market, and pricing strategies can be very dynamic, taking into account competitor prices and consumer behavior. Amazon might adjust prices quickly in response to cost changes to capture market share, relying on the price elasticity of demand. However, the breadth of products and algorithm-based pricing strategies might mean the response could be less direct compared to physical retail. c) Movie theaters face a unique situation where the demand for popcorn is more inelastic. Consumers at movie theaters have limited choices for snacks and are already prepared to pay premium prices. The pricing strategy for popcorn in movie theaters is less linked to the cost of goods and more to the overall experience. As a result, even if the cost of corn decreases, movie theaters might not lower their popcorn prices significantly because the demand is relatively inelastic – people will buy popcorn at a high price as part of their movie-going experience regardless of slight price changes. d) The price reduction will likely be the same in all of the above markets: This statement overlooks the differences in price elasticity of demand across different markets and ignores the strategic pricing decisions businesses make based on their unique market conditions. Given the principles of elasticity, the largest reduction in popcorn prices due to a reduction in the world price of corn is most likely to occur in markets where demand is more price elastic. Among the options provided: a) Urban grocery stores and b) Amazon.com are more likely to see a reduction in popcorn prices since consumers can more easily compare prices and switch products, making demand more price elastic. However, among the two, **a) Urban grocery stores** might exhibit a more direct product-to-consumer relationship for food items and thus could be more inclined to adjust popcorn prices to reflect the reduced cost of corn, especially if they aim to use lower prices to drive increased volume sales. Therefore, the correct answer in the context of elasticity would still lean towards (a) Urban grocery stores, as this market might have the most price-sensitive consumers and face immediate competitive pressures to pass on cost savings."},{"prompt":"مواقع تعطي نطاقات مجانية وتشرح طرق استعمالها","completion":"حصولك على نطاق (دومين) مجاني يمكن أن يكون نقطة بداية رائعة لإطلاق موقعك أو مشروعك على الإنترنت. هناك العديد من الخدمات التي تقدم نطاقات مجانية مع بعض القيود. من الجدير بالذكر أن النطاقات المجانية قد لا توفر نفس مستوى الاحترافية أو الثقة التي يوفرها نطاق مدفوع، لكنها تظل خيارًا جيدًا للمبتدئين أو لأغراض تعليمية أو تجريبية. إليك بعض المواقع التي تقدم نطاقات مجانية وكيفية استخدامها: 1. **Freenom**: - **الخدمة**: يوفر Freenom نطاقات مجانية بامتدادات مثل .TK / .ML / .GA / .CF / .GQ. - **طريقة الاستخدام**: يمكنك التسجيل بسهولة عبر الموقع، البحث عن اسم النطاق المطلوب، وتسجيله إذا كان متاحًا. بعد التسجيل، يمكنك إعداد إعادة توجيه لهذا النطاق إلى أي موقع آخر أو استخدام DNS لربطه بموقعك. 2. **Dot.tk**: - **الخدمة**: هو الموقع الذي كان يقدم نطاقات .TK، ولكن الآن هو جزء من Freenom. 3. **InfinityFree**: - **الخدمة**: بالإضافة إلى استضافة مجانية، يوفر InfinityFree أيضًا نطاقات فرعية مجانية. - **طريقة الاستخدام**: عند التسجيل للحصول على استضافة مجانية، يمكنك اختيار نطاق فرعي مجاني وربطه بمكان استضافة موقعك. 4. **000WebHost**: - **الخدمة**: يوفر 000WebHost استضافة مجانية وكذلك نطاقات فرعية مجانية لمشروعك. - **طريقة الاستخدام**: بعد الاشتراك في الخدمة، يمكنك اختيار إنشاء موقع جديد ومن ثم استخدام نطاق فرعي يوفرونه لك. 5. **WordPress.com**: - **الخدمة**: يوفر WordPress.com خطة مجانية تشمل استضافة ونطاق فرعي ينتهي ب .wordpress.com. - **طريقة الاستخدام**: عند إنشاء موقع جديد على WordPress.com، يمكنك اختيار الخطة المجانية التي تأتي مع نطاق فرعي. 6. **Blogger**: - **الخدمة**: يوفر Blogger، الذي تملكه Google، نطاقات فرعية مجانية تنتهي ب .blogspot.com. - **طريقة الاستخدام**: عند إنشاء مدونة جديدة على Blogger، ستحصل تلقائيًا على نطاق فرعي. عند استخدام هذه المواقع، يجب الانتباه لتحديثات الأمان والخصوصية وقراءة الشروط والأحكام جيدًا. النطاقات المجانية يمكن أن تكون طريقة جيدة لبدء موقع جديد بتكاليف منخفضة، لكن قد تحتاج لاحقًا إلى التفكير بالترقية إلى نطاق مدفوع لزيادة مصداقية واحترافية موقعك."},{"prompt":"can i do my freelance work as a graphic desginer and video editior on just ipad pro 2022 11 inch","completion":"Yes, it is absolutely possible to do freelance graphic design and video editing work on the iPad Pro 2022 (11-inch). The iPad Pro is a powerful device that has proven to be capable of handling various tasks, including professional graphic design and video editing. Here are some points to consider: # Powerful Hardware 1. **M1 Chip**: The iPad Pro 2022 (11-inch) is powered by Apple's M1 chip, which delivers exceptional performance that rivals many laptops.

Cloud storage apps can help organize and share files. - **Software Limitations**: While many apps are quite powerful, there might be specific features in desktop applications not available or as fully fleshed out on their iPad counterparts. In conclusion, the iPad Pro 2022 (11-inch) can serve as a powerful tool for a freelance graphic designer and video editor. It enables work \\"on-the-go\\" with its portability and can handle professional tasks with the right apps and accessories. However, it's valuable to consider how it fits into your workflow and whether its screen size and software capabilities meet your needs."},{"prompt":"which career is good graphic desging or video editing","completion":"Choosing between a career in graphic design and video editing ultimately depends on your interests, skills, and career aspirations.

A strong portfolio is crucial for attracting freelance clients. # 4. Entering the Freelance Market (12 Months+) After about a year of dedicated learning and practice, you might be ready to start taking on freelance clients. However, this doesn't mean you've learned all there is to know. Continuous learning and skill development should be an ongoing part of your career. # Additional Considerations: - **Soft Skills**: Freelancing requires more than just design skills. You'll also need to be proficient in communication, time management, negotiation, and project management. - **Building a Network**: Start building your professional network early. Attend local meetups, join online forums, and engage on social media. Networking can be a significant source of freelance opportunities. - **Marketing Yourself**: Learn the basics of marketing yourself as a freelancer. This includes understanding how to set your rates, write proposals, manage client relationships, and promote your services effectively. # Conclusion While it's possible to start freelancing within a year of focused learning, the depth of your knowledge and the breadth of your portfolio will continue to grow with experience. Ready to freelance doesn't mean you've learned everything there is to know; rather, it means you're prepared to start professional work while continuing to learn and expand your skills.

Minos Prime executing a devastating blow Minos Prime executing the move \\"Die!\\" Minos Prime is the second and final boss of [ P-1: SOUL SURVIVOR]. Though he proclaims his gratitude to V1 for freeing him, he condemns V1 to death for the machines' crimes against humanity. He is considered the most complex and difficult boss of Act I. He spawns after defeating Flesh Prison, as he was trapped within it by the angels after being killed by Gabriel before the beginning of the game. Contents 1 Appearance 2 Combat 2.1 Difficulty Changes 3 Rending Apart 4 Terminal Data 5 Voice Lines 6 Trivia 7 Gallery 8 References Appearance Minos Prime is a tall, luminescent humanoid. His translucent body gives a clear view of his circulatory system, which seems to be the only organs present. There is a hole where his face should be. Serpents wrap around his arms. Combat Minos Prime is an incredibly powerful enemy, capable of chaining attacks to kill V1 in seconds. It only takes a moment of inattention to be utterly destroyed. Note that being airborne is very risky as Minos can and will kill you before you get the chance to get back in position. \\"Judgement!\\": Minos dashes to V1 and performs an explosive dropkick, dealing more damage the closer V1 is towards the center. Minos is airborne after teleporting, and can follow up with an Overhead, \\"Die!/Crush!\\" or a serpent. This attack can be avoided by Parrying or using Invincibility Frames and dashing. If Minos does not follow up with any of these attacks, he will have a short recovery window independent of his current stamina. This attack requires 2 Stamina. \\"Die!\\": Minos aims at V1 before instantly slamming towards them, creating a ground shockwave on impact. Minos briefly stops tracking V1 before the slam comes out, allowing the slam to be avoided. This attack can hit the wall or ceiling, causing the shockwave to be created there and canceling Minos' recovery animation. This attack is only used when Minos is airborne and requires 1 Stamina. \\"Crush!\\": A variant of \\"Die!\\" used if V1 is too close when initiated. It goes straight down, creating a large explosion that deals 50 damage rather than 30. This attack requires 1 Stamina. Serpent: Minos Prime winds up his right arm with an orange glow before releasing a serpentine projectile that homes in on V1. The longer it exists, the tighter its homing gets. It will persist until colliding with a surface or V1. It can be parried, making it a good source of health and a good way to deal damage. \\"Prepare thyself!\\": A two-kick combo followed by a Parriable Serpent. The kicks have a chance of launching V1 into the air should they hit, and if V1 is airborne at any point during the kicks, Minos will instead interrupt the combo to do an Uppercut instead, removing the parry opportunity at the end of the combo. This can easily be avoided by sliding/strafing left or right, and moving backwards when Minos is about to cast his serpent, sliding/dashing out of the way or Parrying it. This attack requires 3 Stamina. \\"Thy end is now!\\": A four-punch combo; the last punch can be Parried, though V1 will still have to dodge away to avoid damage. Similar to the previous combo, the punches have a chance of sending V1 into the air, and if V1 is airborne at any point during the first three punches, Minos will cancel the combo into an Uppercut, removing the parry opportunity of the final hit. This can easily be avoided by sliding/strafing left or right. This attack requires 2 Stamina. Uppercut: Minos Prime teleports to V1 and attempts a single hit; if it connects, V1 gets launched high into the air along with Minos. A Ground Slam can be used to cancel V1's upward momentum. This attack requires 1 Stamina to be performed. Overhead: Minos teleports directly above V1 and does a straight-down attack after a sound cue accompanied with a blue flash. This move only is used while Minos is aerial. This attack consumes 1 Stamina to be performed. Stamina All of Minos' attacks are controlled by an invisible stamina meter, which dictates what moves can be performed at what time. If he runs out of stamina, he will have to wait for it to recharge: The recovery window is 4 seconds on Harmless, 3 on Lenient, and 2 on Standard and Violent. Once he's tired out, blast 'em. Phase 1 on Harmless, Lenient, and Standard all have 6 points of stamina, whilst standard has 12 points of stamina in phase 2. Violent is the least forgiving, with 10 points of stamina in phase one, and infinite stamina in phase two. The Stamina values of each difficulty are the following: HARMLESS / LENIENT - 6 Stamina on both phases. STANDARD - 6 Stamina in Phase 1, 12 Stamina in Phase 2 VIOLENT - 10 Stamina in Phase 1, Infinite Stamina in Phase 2 BRUTAL - 15 Stamina in Phase 1, Infinite Stamina in Phase 2 Parrying any of Minos Prime's melee attacks will restore 5 points of stamina to him. Phase 2 When falling below 65 (50%) health, Minos shouts \\"WEAK\\", overriding any other voice lines. He also gains a blue fiery aura. During Phase 2, Minos Prime can use Serpent projectiles after jumping before following up with \\"Die!/Crush!\\" or an Overhead. On Standard difficulty, Parrying \\"Judgement!\\" will no longer prevent the explosion, forcing the player to dash to avoid damage during a parry. On Violent, \\"Judgement!\\" and the final hit of \\"Thy end is now!\\" cannot be parried. Difficulty Changes HARMLESS / LENIENT Minos Prime's \\"Die!/Crush!\\" and \\"Judgement!\\" attacks have smaller shockwaves and explosions (or none at all on Harmless). Minos Prime does not gain any more stamina going into Phase 2. Minos Prime's attacks are considerably slower, especially on Harmless difficulty. His projectile attacks however, are still as fast as they would be on higher difficulties. VIOLENT Minos Prime's \\"Die!/Crush!\\" and \\"Judgement!\\" attacks have massive shockwaves and explosions. Parrying \\"Judgement!\\" will not interrupt the attack or prevent the player from taking damage from its explosion in Phase 1. \\"Judgement!\\" and \\"Thy end is now!\\" attacks cannot be parried when Minos Prime is reduced to half health. Minos Prime has 60% more stamina in Phase 1 and gains unlimited stamina in Phase 2. BRUTAL Minos Prime's attack pattern becomes highly varied and fires serpents much more often. These being easily noticed during Phase 2. Minos Prime's attacks are faster. Rending Apart Minos Prime, being a Prime Soul, is one of the most difficult enemies in the game, and thus one should not expect the first try to be the only try. Especially coming after the Flesh Prison fight, this opponent can be one of the most nerve-racking and stressful fights in the game. Be sure you're comfortable, steady your nerves, and perhaps get some water. It'll be a long fight, and likely not one done in a single life. P-ranking this will be especially difficult and will take a lot of practice, trial, and error. Minos Prime telegraphs his attacks quite clearly. Generally, circle-strafing and utilizing dash's Invincibility Frames can be used to successfully avoid attacks. \\"Die!\\" and \\"Crush!\\" attacks can be avoided consistently by dashing to the side and jumping when the telegraph is heard, avoiding getting hit directly and going above the ground shockwave. In order to avoid the shockwave, dash forward inside the shockwave and/or slam. It is also possible to bait Minos into using these attacks onto a wall, which causes the shockwave to be vertical, making it easy to avoid. A good general tip for the majority of the fight would be to stay grounded, as he will have a preference to use Serpents and trickier attacks while V1 is airborne. He will also cancel \\"Thy end is now!\\", \\"Prepare Thyself!\\" and \\"Judgement!\\" with an Uppercut if V1 is airborne during them, and both are easy to avoid by just circle strafing. The exception to staying grounded is to avoid the shockwaves of \\"Die!\\"/\\"Crush!\\". Using the Whiplash or slam is useful to immediately get back on the ground, just stay wary of shockwaves. Minos' \\"Thy end is now!\\" is one of the easiest attacks to avoid. By constantly switching directions during attacks while using sliding or dashing, it is guaranteed that Minos will miss all of his attacks. This is also an opportunity to deal as much damage as possible during this attack, especially the final hit of the attack, which leaves himself vulnerable for a long time. The final hit of the attack can be parried, except for Phase 2 on Violent and above. This can be consistently done by tracking the amount of times he has attacked, and positioning oneself to parry the final attack and dashing away, as the attack will still connect even when parried. Instead of dashing away it is also possible to simply stand to the side instead of in front of him, which allows to easily parry his attack and deal a considerable amount of damage with shotguns. Minos is able to launch a yellow-colored homing Serpent that explodes on contact, usually when V1 is too far away from Minos. Due to its persistent nature, it can be difficult to avoid, but the Serpent is parriable and can be destroyed with the Sharpshooter Revolver, though the timing is tight. There are many ways to mitigate this, such as moving in a straight line, dashing while parrying, or sliding back before parrying, all of which will make parrying more consistent and the snake more predictable. If parrying is not an option, one can bait it towards the wall to make it break. In more niche scenarios, an explosion can do the trick, which includes Minos' \\"Judgement!\\". On Violent and above, the Serpent is the only attack that can be parried on Phase 2, so learning to parry this attack is crucial to defeating him on higher difficulties. Minos' \\"Prepare Thyself!\\" can be similarly dodged as \\"Thy end is now!\\", except for the 3rd hit of the combo, where he will launch a homing Serpent and end the attack. The Serpent itself can be parried, and most strategies mentioned for dealing with the Serpent work here. However, the Serpent's explosion can still damage V1, especially when Minos is too close, so dashing after parrying will avoid the damage and the knockback itself. \\"Judgement!\\", while it can take new players by surprise, is one of the easiest attacks to avoid or parry. While the parry timing is a bit awkward, which is only after moments of him about to land the dropkick, it is easy to learn and master the timing. Parrying the attack also cancels the shockwave on Standard and below. However, on Violent and Brutal, the shockwave will still persist and the attack becomes unparriable on phase 2. In these cases or where parrying isn't an option, dashing just moments after the teleport is the most consistent way to dodge it. During the fight and Phase 1 on Violent and above, his \\"Thy end is now!\\" and \\"Judgement!\\" parry are some of the easiest ones of the fight, so those who like their odds can get a free full heal off of it. Note that this also restores his stamina, so in some scenarios, it might be better to not parry these attacks instead. During Minos' cutscene, one can prepare traps or set up tech such as Slabcoining, Railcoining, or Railcoinpunching. This is especially made easier after defeating him once, which allows the cutscene to be skipped. By setting up a Sawblade trap, and performing any high-damage coin techs, Minos' health will rapidly deplete at the start of the fight, and in some cases instantly killing him (in the case of Deadcoining), or depleting his health to Phase 2. The alternate Piercer Revolver is very good for reliable damage at every range, even with a slow fire rate. Minos moves quickly, so good aim is very important. Coins are also very useful here, as their auto-aiming nature will greatly help deal damage to Minos, as he is a relatively small and very mobile opponent. Both variations of the Sharpshooter will work wonders as well, with its alt fire being able to destroy the Serpent projectile if needed be. Due to the room being mostly octagonal, the Sharpshooter has the potential to deal a lot of damage in a single alt fire, with the right timing and setup. The Shotgun, especially the Pump Charge Shotgun, can be great for doing damage when Minos is doing his more predictable attacks - double-charged shots does massive damage when at point-blank. Projectile Boosting can also be fairly easy to do damage with. Shotgun Swapping when Minos is not doing an attack is also a great way to deal consistent damage, while also acting as a great source of healing. The Nailgun can inflict heavy damage on Minos at the start of the fight by laying a trap with all 3 magnets during the cutscene, though it can be awkward to damage Minos with the Nailgun compared to the Shotgun without the use of magnets. Similar or better traps can be achieved with the Sawblade Launcher, which can also lay traps during the fight itself to inflict damage without necessarily needing to aim at Minos. Since Minos itself moves quickly, and the entire fight demands mobility, baiting him into saw traps can be difficult, but with the proper setup, it will deal massive damage, as such, this is best done at the start of the fight to deal massive burst damage. Shooting him with the Screwdriver Railcannon can be helpful, as it will mean easy health and constant damage if staying close. A good opportunity to put to embed a Screwdriver would be at the end of his \\"Thy end is now!\\", as he holds still for a short period. Be wary of Hard Damage however, as it can rack up fast if too reliant on healing or are not stylish enough. Alternatively, this brief moment of respite can allow the player to perform a powerful Railcoining technique if they are fast enough, by tossing a coin backward and another through Minos and then shooting the latter coin with the Electric Railcannon, forgoing constant healing and in favor of high burst damage. Using the Electric Railcannon without the use of coins is not recommended, as it deals less damage than a Screwdriver while only providing a quick burst of healing, which is much less useful than a constant source of healing. This is especially true for Phase 2 on VIOLENT and above, where only his Serpent attack can be parried. The Rocket Launcher can often score airshots on Minos for double damage during movements and attacks that render him airborne, such as Uppercuts, Overheads, and the latter half of \\"Judgement!\\". Magnets can help in landing airshots as well. Due to Minos' speed and small stature, this can be difficult without good aim or magnets. Even when grounded, it can still deal a lot of damage, and due to its fast swap speed, it can be used for a quick burst of damage. Terminal Data For more information, see Terminal. TYPE: PRIME SOUL DATA: A prime soul is an incredibly rare occurrence in which a soul amasses so much power that it no longer requires a Husk as a vessel to manifest physically. Minos Prime is not a fully formed prime soul. As manifestations of pure will, prime souls are incredibly powerful, to the point that even the prideful angels see them as a threat and will use any means necessary to stop them from forming. King Minos felt that eternal suffering was an unfair and unreasonable punishment for those whose only sin was loving another. After the Disappearance of God, as angels were lost and Heaven was in chaos, Minos began his efforts to reform the Lust layer. The Lust renaissance was prosperous, as King Minos guided its inhabitants to come together and build a new civilization. The combined efforts of the countless who had been damned to the second layer bore great results as the grand city of Lust grew and grew. However, after the Council took control of Heaven and brought stability to it through their iron fist rule, they saw that Minos had gone against God's will by freeing sinners from the punishment that God had designed for them. Gabriel, the brightest of the angels, was sent to kill Minos. The king, rather than fight back, tried to reason with him, but Gabriel mercilessly struck him down without listening. As Minos' will was strong enough to attempt to stand up to Heaven's rule, the angels chose to imprison his soul in an attempt to stop it from forming into a prime soul and appointed Gabriel as the new Judge of Hell. From the prison inside his own body, Minos helplessly watched as his soulless corpse, now controlled by parasites, tore apart everything he had worked so hard to build, cursing his own weakness for failing to protect his people, vowing to take revenge... STRATEGY: It's rare for Minos Prime to give a window of opportunity to heal, so it's vital to learn what attacks leave him momentarily vulnerable and how to dodge them in a way that gives an advantageous position during those moments. His snake projectiles can be parried using the Feedbacker for a full heal, even if the projectile doesn't hit Minos Prime. Voice Lines \\"Ahh… Free at last. O, Gabriel. Now dawns thy reckoning, and thy gore shall glisten before the temples of man. Creature of steel… My gratitude upon thee for my freedom, but the crimes thy kind have committed against humanity are NOT forgotten.

(Dying scream) Trivia Minos Prime's boss theme is \\"ORDER\\", and can be found here. The original concept art for Minos Prime was made by BigRockBMP, and his model was made by ActionDawg. Minos Prime is voiced by Stephan Weyte, known for being the voice of Caleb from the Blood franchise. Stephan has also provided the voice for Nyarlathotep in DUSK, another game published by New Blood, as well as the character \\"G\\" in Gloomwood, who appears at the very beginning and guides the outsider, among many other credits. (See his website for more information.) The pose Minos Prime strikes before his \\"Die!\\" divekick is taken from Kamen Rider.[1] Minos Prime's manner of speaking during combat is inspired by Urien in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike.[2] Minos Prime says \\"Useless!\\" after each restart, implying that he knows you have died to him and that any efforts you attempt upon him will be only for naught. The only other characters that imply knowledge of restarts are the Mysterious Druid Knight (& Owl) and Minos' ACT II counterpart, Sisyphus Prime. Before the first hotfix following the Soul Survivor update, Minos Prime's \\"Judgement!\\" attack couldn't be interrupted when parried. Minos Prime's design has a heavy snake motif, with twin snakes coiling around his arms, blue snakes for attack trails, and golden snakes as projectiles. This draws inspiration from Minos in Inferno from Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, who has a serpent's tail coil around his body a certain amount of times to determine where sinners will be damned in the Nine Circles of Hell. Minos Prime, along with the Flesh Prison, are direct references to the fights against Nuculais and Legion, respectively, from Castlevania: Curse of Darkness.[3] His moveset has been often compared to characters from fighting games, utilizing a large amount of melee combat as well as a projectile. Some even compare him to a fighting game player due to how trivial the fight can become once you learn his patterns and moveset. If Minos Prime is somehow able to get out of bounds and fall into the void, he will reappear at the center of the arena. Minos Prime often says \\"Die!\\". This is a subtle nod to the fact that he will kill you. This reference is best observed on Brutal Difficulty. There is a species of bacteriophage named MinosPhrime, a direct reference to Minos Prime.[4][5] This bacteriophage is notable for its resistance to high concentrations of alcohol compared to other phages. When Minos attacks, he leaves a trail of disturbed rubble behind him, implying he moves faster than you can see but does not teleport. This can be better observed by spawning him in an environment with many physical obstructions, such as the Sandbox. Minos's \\"teleports\\" are unable to actually pass through ceilings, but enemies like Mindflayers are unobstructed. Despite the whole arena being made of flesh, the trail of rubble that Minos leaves in the wake of his attacks are made of stone. Minos moves so fast to the point he near-instantly dies when using \\"Die!\\" in a direction that doesn't have a solid object he can land on. Minos' body becomes invisible when underwater, but his circulatory system stays fully visible. This is a visual bug shared by his Act 2 counterpart. Minos is one of the only ULTRAKILL characters to have an official bodypillow, the others being Gabriel, V1, and Mirage.

Contents 1 Appearance 2 Combat 2.1 Difficulty Changes 3 Rending Apart 4 Terminal Data 5 Voice Lines 6 Trivia 7 Gallery 8 References Appearance Minos Prime is a tall, luminescent humanoid. His translucent body gives a clear view of his circulatory system, which seems to be the only organs present. There is a hole where his face should be. Serpents wrap around his arms. Combat Minos Prime is an incredibly powerful enemy, capable of chaining attacks to kill V1 in seconds. It only takes a moment of inattention to be utterly destroyed. Note that being airborne is very risky as Minos can and will kill you before you get the chance to get back in position. “Judgement!”: Minos dashes to V1 and performs an explosive dropkick, dealing more damage the closer V1 is towards the center. Minos is airborne after teleporting, and can follow up with an Overhead, “Die!/Crush!” or a serpent. This attack can be avoided by Parrying or using Invincibility Frames and dashing. If Minos does not follow up with any of these attacks, he will have a short recovery window independent of his current stamina. This attack requires 2 Stamina. “Die!”: Minos aims at V1 before instantly slamming towards them, creating a ground shockwave on impact. Minos briefly stops tracking V1 before the slam comes out, allowing the slam to be avoided. This attack can hit the wall or ceiling, causing the shockwave to be created there and canceling Minos’ recovery animation. This attack is only used when Minos is airborne and requires 1 Stamina. “Crush!”: A variant of “Die!” used if V1 is too close when initiated. It goes straight down, creating a large explosion that deals 50 damage rather than 30. This attack requires 1 Stamina. Serpent: Minos Prime winds up his right arm with an orange glow before releasing a serpentine projectile that homes in on V1. The longer it exists, the tighter its homing gets. It will persist until colliding with a surface or V1. It can be parried, making it a good source of health and a good way to deal damage. “Prepare thyself!”: A two-kick combo followed by a Parriable Serpent. The kicks have a chance of launching V1 into the air should they hit, and if V1 is airborne at any point during the kicks, Minos will instead interrupt the combo to do an Uppercut instead, removing the parry opportunity at the end of the combo. This can easily be avoided by sliding/strafing left or right, and moving backwards when Minos is about to cast his serpent, sliding/dashing out of the way or Parrying it. This attack requires 3 Stamina. “Thy end is now!”: A four-punch combo; the last punch can be Parried, though V1 will still have to dodge away to avoid damage. Similar to the previous combo, the punches have a chance of sending V1 into the air, and if V1 is airborne at any point during the first three punches, Minos will cancel the combo into an Uppercut, removing the parry opportunity of the final hit. This can easily be avoided by sliding/strafing left or right. This attack requires 2 Stamina. Uppercut: Minos Prime teleports to V1 and attempts a single hit; if it connects, V1 gets launched high into the air along with Minos. A Ground Slam can be used to cancel V1’s upward momentum. This attack requires 1 Stamina to be performed. Overhead: Minos teleports directly above V1 and does a straight-down attack after a sound cue accompanied with a blue flash. This move only is used while Minos is aerial. This attack consumes 1 Stamina to be performed. Stamina All of Minos’ attacks are controlled by an invisible stamina meter, which dictates what moves can be performed at what time. If he runs out of stamina, he will have to wait for it to recharge: The recovery window is 4 seconds on Harmless, 3 on Lenient, and 2 on Standard and Violent. Once he’s tired out, blast ‘em. Phase 1 on Harmless, Lenient, and Standard all have 6 points of stamina, whilst standard has 12 points of stamina in phase 2. Violent is the least forgiving, with 10 points of stamina in phase one, and infinite stamina in phase two. The Stamina values of each difficulty are the following: HARMLESS / LENIENT - 6 Stamina on both phases. STANDARD - 6 Stamina in Phase 1, 12 Stamina in Phase 2 VIOLENT - 10 Stamina in Phase 1, Infinite Stamina in Phase 2 BRUTAL - 15 Stamina in Phase 1, Infinite Stamina in Phase 2 Parrying any of Minos Prime’s melee attacks will restore 5 points of stamina to him. Phase 2 When falling below 65 (50%) health, Minos shouts “WEAK”, overriding any other voice lines. He also gains a blue fiery aura. During Phase 2, Minos Prime can use Serpent projectiles after jumping before following up with “Die!/Crush!” or an Overhead. On Standard difficulty, Parrying “Judgement!” will no longer prevent the explosion, forcing the player to dash to avoid damage during a parry. On Violent, “Judgement!” and the final hit of “Thy end is now!” cannot be parried. Difficulty Changes HARMLESS / LENIENT Minos Prime’s “Die!/Crush!” and “Judgement!” attacks have smaller shockwaves and explosions (or none at all on Harmless). Minos Prime does not gain any more stamina going into Phase 2. Minos Prime’s attacks are considerably slower, especially on Harmless difficulty. His projectile attacks however, are still as fast as they would be on higher difficulties. VIOLENT Minos Prime’s “Die!/Crush!” and “Judgement!” attacks have massive shockwaves and explosions. Parrying “Judgement!” will not interrupt the attack or prevent the player from taking damage from its explosion in Phase 1. “Judgement!” and “Thy end is now!” attacks cannot be parried when Minos Prime is reduced to half health. Minos Prime has 60% more stamina in Phase 1 and gains unlimited stamina in Phase 2. BRUTAL Minos Prime’s attack pattern becomes highly varied and fires serpents much more often. These being easily noticed during Phase 2. Minos Prime’s attacks are faster. Rending Apart Minos Prime, being a Prime Soul, is one of the most difficult enemies in the game, and thus one should not expect the first try to be the only try. Especially coming after the Flesh Prison fight, this opponent can be one of the most nerve-racking and stressful fights in the game. Be sure you’re comfortable, steady your nerves, and perhaps get some water. It’ll be a long fight, and likely not one done in a single life. P-ranking this will be especially difficult and will take a lot of practice, trial, and error. Minos Prime telegraphs his attacks quite clearly. Generally, circle-strafing and utilizing dash’s Invincibility Frames can be used to successfully avoid attacks. “Die!” and “Crush!” attacks can be avoided consistently by dashing to the side and jumping when the telegraph is heard, avoiding getting hit directly and going above the ground shockwave. In order to avoid the shockwave, dash forward inside the shockwave and/or slam. It is also possible to bait Minos into using these attacks onto a wall, which causes the shockwave to be vertical, making it easy to avoid. A good general tip for the majority of the fight would be to stay grounded, as he will have a preference to use Serpents and trickier attacks while V1 is airborne. He will also cancel “Thy end is now!”, “Prepare Thyself!” and “Judgement!” with an Uppercut if V1 is airborne during them, and both are easy to avoid by just circle strafing. The exception to staying grounded is to avoid the shockwaves of “Die!”/“Crush!”. Using the Whiplash or slam is useful to immediately get back on the ground, just stay wary of shockwaves. Minos’ “Thy end is now!” is one of the easiest attacks to avoid. By constantly switching directions during attacks while using sliding or dashing, it is guaranteed that Minos will miss all of his attacks. This is also an opportunity to deal as much damage as possible during this attack, especially the final hit of the attack, which leaves himself vulnerable for a long time. The final hit of the attack can be parried, except for Phase 2 on Violent and above. This can be consistently done by tracking the amount of times he has attacked, and positioning oneself to parry the final attack and dashing away, as the attack will still connect even when parried. Instead of dashing away it is also possible to simply stand to the side instead of in front of him, which allows to easily parry his attack and deal a considerable amount of damage with shotguns. Minos is able to launch a yellow-colored homing Serpent that explodes on contact, usually when V1 is too far away from Minos. Due to its persistent nature, it can be difficult to avoid, but the Serpent is parriable and can be destroyed with the Sharpshooter Revolver, though the timing is tight. There are many ways to mitigate this, such as moving in a straight line, dashing while parrying, or sliding back before parrying, all of which will make parrying more consistent and the snake more predictable. If parrying is not an option, one can bait it towards the wall to make it break. In more niche scenarios, an explosion can do the trick, which includes Minos’ “Judgement!”. On Violent and above, the Serpent is the only attack that can be parried on Phase 2, so learning to parry this attack is crucial to defeating him on higher difficulties. Minos’ “Prepare Thyself!” can be similarly dodged as “Thy end is now!”, except for the 3rd hit of the combo, where he will launch a homing Serpent and end the attack. The Serpent itself can be parried, and most strategies mentioned for dealing with the Serpent work here. However, the Serpent’s explosion can still damage V1, especially when Minos is too close, so dashing after parrying will avoid the damage and the knockback itself. “Judgement!”, while it can take new players by surprise, is one of the easiest attacks to avoid or parry. While the parry timing is a bit awkward, which is only after moments of him about to land the dropkick, it is easy to learn and master the timing. Parrying the attack also cancels the shockwave on Standard and below. However, on Violent and Brutal, the shockwave will still persist and the attack becomes unparriable on phase 2. In these cases or where parrying isn’t an option, dashing just moments after the teleport is the most consistent way to dodge it. During the fight and Phase 1 on Violent and above, his “Thy end is now!” and “Judgement!” parry are some of the easiest ones of the fight, so those who like their odds can get a free full heal off of it. Note that this also restores his stamina, so in some scenarios, it might be better to not parry these attacks instead. During Minos’ cutscene, one can prepare traps or set up tech such as Slabcoining, Railcoining, or Railcoinpunching. This is especially made easier after defeating him once, which allows the cutscene to be skipped. By setting up a Sawblade trap, and performing any high-damage coin techs, Minos’ health will rapidly deplete at the start of the fight, and in some cases instantly killing him (in the case of Deadcoining), or depleting his health to Phase 2. The alternate Piercer Revolver is very good for reliable damage at every range, even with a slow fire rate. Minos moves quickly, so good aim is very important. Coins are also very useful here, as their auto-aiming nature will greatly help deal damage to Minos, as he is a relatively small and very mobile opponent. Both variations of the Sharpshooter will work wonders as well, with its alt fire being able to destroy the Serpent projectile if needed be. Due to the room being mostly octagonal, the Sharpshooter has the potential to deal a lot of damage in a single alt fire, with the right timing and setup. The Shotgun, especially the Pump Charge Shotgun, can be great for doing damage when Minos is doing his more predictable attacks - double-charged shots does massive damage when at point-blank. Projectile Boosting can also be fairly easy to do damage with. Shotgun Swapping when Minos is not doing an attack is also a great way to deal consistent damage, while also acting as a great source of healing. The Nailgun can inflict heavy damage on Minos at the start of the fight by laying a trap with all 3 magnets during the cutscene, though it can be awkward to damage Minos with the Nailgun compared to the Shotgun without the use of magnets. Similar or better traps can be achieved with the Sawblade Launcher, which can also lay traps during the fight itself to inflict damage without necessarily needing to aim at Minos. Since Minos itself moves quickly, and the entire fight demands mobility, baiting him into saw traps can be difficult, but with the proper setup, it will deal massive damage, as such, this is best done at the start of the fight to deal massive burst damage. Shooting him with the Screwdriver Railcannon can be helpful, as it will mean easy health and constant damage if staying close. A good opportunity to put to embed a Screwdriver would be at the end of his “Thy end is now!”, as he holds still for a short period. Be wary of Hard Damage however, as it can rack up fast if too reliant on healing or are not stylish enough. Alternatively, this brief moment of respite can allow the player to perform a powerful Railcoining technique if they are fast enough, by tossing a coin backward and another through Minos and then shooting the latter coin with the Electric Railcannon, forgoing constant healing and in favor of high burst damage. Using the Electric Railcannon without the use of coins is not recommended, as it deals less damage than a Screwdriver while only providing a quick burst of healing, which is much less useful than a constant source of healing. This is especially true for Phase 2 on VIOLENT and above, where only his Serpent attack can be parried. The Rocket Launcher can often score airshots on Minos for double damage during movements and attacks that render him airborne, such as Uppercuts, Overheads, and the latter half of “Judgement!”. Magnets can help in landing airshots as well. Due to Minos’ speed and small stature, this can be difficult without good aim or magnets. Even when grounded, it can still deal a lot of damage, and due to its fast swap speed, it can be used for a quick burst of damage. Terminal Data For more information, see Terminal. TYPE: PRIME SOUL DATA: A prime soul is an incredibly rare occurrence in which a soul amasses so much power that it no longer requires a Husk as a vessel to manifest physically. Minos Prime is not a fully formed prime soul. As manifestations of pure will, prime souls are incredibly powerful, to the point that even the prideful angels see them as a threat and will use any means necessary to stop them from forming. King Minos felt that eternal suffering was an unfair and unreasonable punishment for those whose only sin was loving another. After the Disappearance of God, as angels were lost and Heaven was in chaos, Minos began his efforts to reform the Lust layer. The Lust renaissance was prosperous, as King Minos guided its inhabitants to come together and build a new civilization. The combined efforts of the countless who had been damned to the second layer bore great results as the grand city of Lust grew and grew. However, after the Council took control of Heaven and brought stability to it through their iron fist rule, they saw that Minos had gone against God’s will by freeing sinners from the punishment that God had designed for them. Gabriel, the brightest of the angels, was sent to kill Minos. The king, rather than fight back, tried to reason with him, but Gabriel mercilessly struck him down without listening. As Minos’ will was strong enough to attempt to stand up to Heaven’s rule, the angels chose to imprison his soul in an attempt to stop it from forming into a prime soul and appointed Gabriel as the new Judge of Hell. From the prison inside his own body, Minos helplessly watched as his soulless corpse, now controlled by parasites, tore apart everything he had worked so hard to build, cursing his own weakness for failing to protect his people, vowing to take revenge… STRATEGY: It’s rare for Minos Prime to give a window of opportunity to heal, so it’s vital to learn what attacks leave him momentarily vulnerable and how to dodge them in a way that gives an advantageous position during those moments. His snake projectiles can be parried using the Feedbacker for a full heal, even if the projectile doesn’t hit Minos Prime. Voice Lines “Ahh… Free at last. O, Gabriel. Now dawns thy reckoning, and thy gore shall glisten before the temples of man. Creature of steel… My gratitude upon thee for my freedom, but the crimes thy kind have committed against humanity are NOT forgotten. And thy punishment… is DEATH.” (Before the fight) “Useless!” (After restart) “Judgement!” “Die!” “Crush!” “Prepare thyself!” “Thy end is now!” “WEAK.” (Falling below half health) “Aagh! Forgive me, my children, for I have failed to bring you salvation from this cold, dark world…” (After defeat) WRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH! (Dying scream) Trivia Minos Prime’s boss theme is “ORDER”, and can be found here. The original concept art for Minos Prime was made by BigRockBMP, and his model was made by ActionDawg. Minos Prime is voiced by Stephan Weyte, known for being the voice of Caleb from the Blood franchise. Stephan has also provided the voice for Nyarlathotep in DUSK, another game published by New Blood, as well as the character “G” in Gloomwood, who appears at the very beginning and guides the outsider, among many other credits. (See his website for more information.) The pose Minos Prime strikes before his “Die!” divekick is taken from Kamen Rider.[1] Minos Prime’s manner of speaking during combat is inspired by Urien in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike.[2] Minos Prime says “Useless!” after each restart, implying that he knows you have died to him and that any efforts you attempt upon him will be only for naught. The only other characters that imply knowledge of restarts are the Mysterious Druid Knight (& Owl) and Minos’ ACT II counterpart, Sisyphus Prime. Before the first hotfix following the Soul Survivor update, Minos Prime’s “Judgement!” attack couldn’t be interrupted when parried. Minos Prime’s design has a heavy snake motif, with twin snakes coiling around his arms, blue snakes for attack trails, and golden snakes as projectiles. This draws inspiration from Minos in Inferno from Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy, who has a serpent’s tail coil around his body a certain amount of times to determine where sinners will be damned in the Nine Circles of Hell. Minos Prime, along with the Flesh Prison, are direct references to the fights against Nuculais and Legion, respectively, from Castlevania: Curse of Darkness.[3] His moveset has been often compared to characters from fighting games, utilizing a large amount of melee combat as well as a projectile. Some even compare him to a fighting game player due to how trivial the fight can become once you learn his patterns and moveset. If Minos Prime is somehow able to get out of bounds and fall into the void, he will reappear at the center of the arena. Minos Prime often says “Die!”. This is a subtle nod to the fact that he will kill you. This reference is best observed on Brutal Difficulty. There is a species of bacteriophage named MinosPhrime, a direct reference to Minos Prime.[4][5] This bacteriophage is notable for its resistance to high concentrations of alcohol compared to other phages. When Minos attacks, he leaves a trail of disturbed rubble behind him, implying he moves faster than you can see but does not teleport. This can be better observed by spawning him in an environment with many physical obstructions, such as the Sandbox. Minos’s “teleports” are unable to actually pass through ceilings, but enemies like Mindflayers are unobstructed. Despite the whole arena being made of flesh, the trail of rubble that Minos leaves in the wake of his attacks are made of stone. Minos moves so fast to the point he near-instantly dies when using “Die!” in a direction that doesn’t have a solid object he can land on. Minos’ body becomes invisible when underwater, but his circulatory system stays fully visible. This is a visual bug shared by his Act 2 counterpart. Minos is one of the only ULTRAKILL characters to have an official bodypillow, the others being Gabriel, V1, and Mirage.

Proclaiming dominion over all he surveys, he bestows gratitude upon Z2 for awakening him, yet decrees doom for the hero's insolence against his ancient reign. Recognized as the most intellectually demanding adversary in Act II. His emergence is preceded by the unraveling of The Gilded Sarcophagus, cursed into containment by rival gods envious of his might before the epoch of the game's narrative. Contents 1 Appearance 2 Combat 2.1 Difficulty Adjustments 3 Unearthing 4 Terminal Insights 5 Vocalizations 6 Curiosities 7 Illumination 8 Citations Appearance Ozymandias Prime is a colossus, his body resembling sandstone and embellished with cryptic hieroglyphs. His eyes are luminous, peering from beneath a grand headdress. Within his chest, a perpetual sandstorm rages. Combat Ozymandias Prime is an adversary of immense power, his tactics designed to test Z2's limits. Moments of distraction will result in swift defeat. Positioned aerially can be particularly hazardous as Ozymandias has the means to sanction such audacity forthwith. “Imperium's Wrath”: Ozymandias hurls a colossal sand wave at Z2, inflicting greater injury the nearer Z2 is to its origin. Post-launch, Ozymandias looms airborne, primed to execute a Sandstone Smash, “Sand Slash,” or a Celestial Beam. Evading this maneuver requires Precise Dodging or employing Evasion Tactics; failure to follow up grants a brief respite independent of his current power reserves. This technique necessitates 2 Energy Units. “Behold!”: Ozymandias targets Z2, launching a concentrated burst of sand, generating a shockwave upon impact. He ceases Z2 tracking prior to the burst's release, enabling its dodge. This ability can intercept walls or ceilings, thereby altering the shockwave's trajectory and abbreviating Ozymandias’ recuperation phase. Utilized solely during aerial maneuvers, requiring 1 Energy Unit. “Decree of the Sands!”: In scenarios where Z2 approaches too closely, “Behold!” transitions into “Decree of the Sands!”, descending directly downward, conjuring a vast explosion that deals 60 damage compared to 40. It drains 1 Energy Unit. Celestial Beam: Charging his arm with solar energy, Ozymandias discharges a beam that traces Z2's movements. Its persistence endures until collision with an obstacle or Z2. Parry-able, this serves both as a health replenisher and an attack vector. “Rise, my Guardians!”: A twin-kick maneuver succeeded by an Evadable Celestial Beam. If the kicks succeed in elevating Z2, Ozymandias will opt for a direct Uppercut, negating the parry chance at combo's culmination. Sidestepping or retreating counters the kicks, and evading or Parrying the beam. This demands 3 Energy Units. “Your time ends!”: A quartet of punches, with the finale parry-able. Unlike preceding combos, these punches may loft Z2, and aerial positioning throughout initiates an Uppercut by Ozymandias, forfeiting the final blow’s parry chance. Sidestepping is the defense against this, costing 2 Energy Units. Uppercut: Ozymandias materializes beside Z2, attempting a singular strike; connection propels Z2 skyward alongside him. Ground Strike negates upward momentum. Executes for 1 Energy Unit. Sandstone Smash: From above, Ozymandias strikes downwards post auditory signal and visual precursor (a golden glint). This tactic is exclusive to his airborne state, draining 1 Energy Unit for execution. Stamina Ozymandias maneuvers are fueled by an unseen energy reservoir, determining his action potential. Depletion necessitates recovery: 4 seconds on Novice, 3 on Intermediate, and 2 on Expert and Master. Exhaustion signals the moment to capitalize. Phase 1 on Novice, Intermediate, and Expert harbor 8 points of energy, while Expert Phase 2 escalates to 16 energy points. Master level is the least lenient, boasting 12 energy points in Phase 1, and boundless energy in Phase 2. The Energy values per difficulty are as follows: NOVICE / INTERMEDIATE - 8 Energy in both phases. EXPERT - 8 Energy in Phase 1, 16 Energy in Phase 2 MASTER - 12 Energy in Phase 1, Infinite Energy in Phase 2 SUPREME - 20 Energy in Phase 1, Infinite Energy in Phase 2 Counterattacking any of Ozymandias Prime’s close-combat assaults replenishes 6 points of his energy. Phase 2 Upon health diminishing below 80 (50%), Ozymandias intones “MORTALS,” cleverly overriding all else. A crimson inferno envelops him. Phase 2 enables Ozymandias to conjure Celestial Beams preluding “Behold!”/“Decree of the Sands!” or a Sandstone Smash. On Expert, evading “Imperium's Wrath” during parry loses its explosion avoidance; on Master, “Imperium's Wrath” and the final punch of “Your time ends!” become unparry-able. Difficulty Adjustments NOVICE / INTERMEDIATE Ozymandias Prime’s “Behold!”/“Decree of the Sands!” and “Imperium's Wrath” involve less extensive shockwaves and explosions (or neatly removed on Novice). His energy reservoir remains consistent entering Phase 2. Attacks manifest discernibly slower, notably on Novice. His beam moves at normal pace regardless of difficulty. MASTER Ozymandias Prime’s “Behold!”/“Decree of the Sands!” and “Imperium's Wrath” generate extensive shockwaves and explosions. “Imperium's Wrath” parrying neither halts the attack nor spares from the explosion in Phase 1. “Imperium's Wrath” and “Your time ends!” finale are unparry-able post-half health. Unearthing Ozymandias Prime, a Prime Soul archetype, stands among the game’s most formidable adversaries, demanding multiple encounters for mastery. Post-Gilded Sarcophagus confrontation, this nemesis presents an significant challenge. Seek comfort, stabilize your nerves, acquisition of hydration is recommended. A protracted engagement is anticipated, scarcely concluded in a singular attempt. Mastery and a \\"P\\" rank require perseverance, extensive practice, and trial. Ozymandias signals his maneuvers distinctly. Circumventing and exploiting Invincibility Frames allow successful dodging. “Behold!” and “Decree of the Sands!” can be consistently evaded by lateral movements and leaps upon signal detection, evading direct impact and the resultant ground shockwave. Baiting Ozymandias to exert these on a barrier turns the shockwave vertical, simplifying avoidance. Staying terrestrial is advisable, deterring Ozymandias from deploying Serpents and m"},{"prompt":"could you write an epsidoe of Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go! about this Executive guy not happy about the show with story, animation, and characters and he want it to change it to be more of the funny cartoons with no action, drama and heart.","completion":"**Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!**: \\"Pilot Panic\\" **Act 1: The Transformation Trepidation** In the vastness of space, Shuggazoom City remains a beacon of hope, its protectors, the Hyperforce, always ready to defend against evil. However, a unique challenge descends upon the team, not in the form of a villainous threat, but a sudden, unexpected visitor to the Super Robot. Enter Mr. Biz, a flashy, smooth-talking executive from the Intergalactic Network of Cartoons (INC), whose snazzy suit and slicked-back hair contrast sharply with the adventurous ambiance of the Super Robot’s control room. He's here with a proposition that chills the team to their core. Mr. Biz: \\"Love what you're doing, really, I do. But I'm here to take your 'little' show in a new direction. Think less... saving the universe, and more...slapstick! Kids love the funny, not the fighty-fight.\\" The Hyperforce, stunned, exchanges apprehensive glances. Sprx-77, usually quick to jest, finds no humor in the situation. Gibson, the voice of reason, attempts to interject, but Mr. Biz is unrelenting. **Act 2: The Quandary of Quirk** With a snap of his fingers, Mr. Biz introduces an odd device, the Genre-Shift-o-Matic, intending to transform the Super Robot Monkey Team into a comedy act. Before the team can protest, he activates the device, and a wave of energy sweeps over them. The Super Robot is transformed into a bizarre, colorful circus, filled with oversized props and cartoonish versions of the team. Otto finds himself juggling wrenches, Sparx slipping on banana peels, and Gibson caught in an endless loop of comedic, exaggerated expressions of confusion and shock. Chiro, usually the fearless leader, now adorned in a comically oversized hero cape, attempts to rally the team, insisting they must find a way to reverse the effects and protect Shuggazoom from the real threats lurking in the shadows, unseen amidst the forced jollity. **Act 3: Rediscovering Resolve** Seeking wisdom, Chiro and the transformed Hyperforce seek out the Alchemist, who has somehow eluded the cartoonish transformation of their universe. The Alchemist, with a grave tone, warns them of the danger of losing their essence, their true strength lying not in physical prowess but in their hearts and determination to defend what is right. He reveals that the only way to reverse the effect is to make Mr. Biz understand the true meaning of their mission—the balance of laughter with courage, hope, and the inevitable struggles they face as heroes. Armed with this knowledge, the team devises a plan. They invite Mr. Biz to witness firsthand the perils of Shuggazoom, the lurking dangers that require heroes of substance, not just slapstick silliness. **Act 4: The Showdown of Showmanship** As expected, the shadowy threats choose this moment of vulnerability to strike, attacking Shuggazoom with a vigor unseen, confident in the Hyperforce's weakened, comedic state. Mr. Biz, now witness to the true gravity of the situation, realizes the error of his ways, seeing the team's struggles and the city's need for genuine heroes. With a newfound respect for the team's mission, Mr. Biz uses the Genre-Shift-o-Matic to revert everything back to normal, just in time for the Hyperforce to spring into action, seriousness and determination restored, battling fiercely to save the city. **Act 5: Lessons of Laughter and Valor** With the day saved and Shuggazoom safe once more, Mr. Biz learns an invaluable lesson. True heroism comes from the heart, a blend of many emotions, including joy, laughter, sorrow, and courage. And so, he leaves, vowing never to underestimate the power of true heroes again.

Contents 1 Appearance 2 Combat 2.1 Difficulty Changes 3 Rending Apart 4 Terminal Data 5 Voice Lines 6 Trivia 7 Gallery 8 References Appearance Minos Prime is a tall, luminescent humanoid. His translucent body gives a clear view of his circulatory system, which seems to be the only organs present. There is a hole where his face should be. Serpents wrap around his arms. Combat Minos Prime is an incredibly powerful enemy, capable of chaining attacks to kill V1 in seconds. It only takes a moment of inattention to be utterly destroyed. Note that being airborne is very risky as Minos can and will kill you before you get the chance to get back in position. “Judgement!”: Minos dashes to V1 and performs an explosive dropkick, dealing more damage the closer V1 is towards the center. Minos is airborne after teleporting, and can follow up with an Overhead, “Die!/Crush!” or a serpent. This attack can be avoided by Parrying or using Invincibility Frames and dashing. If Minos does not follow up with any of these attacks, he will have a short recovery window independent of his current stamina. This attack requires 2 Stamina. “Die!”: Minos aims at V1 before instantly slamming towards them, creating a ground shockwave on impact. Minos briefly stops tracking V1 before the slam comes out, allowing the slam to be avoided. This attack can hit the wall or ceiling, causing the shockwave to be created there and canceling Minos’ recovery animation. This attack is only used when Minos is airborne and requires 1 Stamina. “Crush!”: A variant of “Die!” used if V1 is too close when initiated. It goes straight down, creating a large explosion that deals 50 damage rather than 30. This attack requires 1 Stamina. Serpent: Minos Prime winds up his right arm with an orange glow before releasing a serpentine projectile that homes in on V1. The longer it exists, the tighter its homing gets. It will persist until colliding with a surface or V1. It can be parried, making it a good source of health and a good way to deal damage. “Prepare thyself!”: A two-kick combo followed by a Parriable Serpent. The kicks have a chance of launching V1 into the air should they hit, and if V1 is airborne at any point during the kicks, Minos will instead interrupt the combo to do an Uppercut instead, removing the parry opportunity at the end of the combo. This can easily be avoided by sliding/strafing left or right, and moving backwards when Minos is about to cast his serpent, sliding/dashing out of the way or Parrying it. This attack requires 3 Stamina. “Thy end is now!”: A four-punch combo; the last punch can be Parried, though V1 will still have to dodge away to avoid damage. Similar to the previous combo, the punches have a chance of sending V1 into the air, and if V1 is airborne at any point during the first three punches, Minos will cancel the combo into an Uppercut, removing the parry opportunity of the final hit. This can easily be avoided by sliding/strafing left or right. This attack requires 2 Stamina. Uppercut: Minos Prime teleports to V1 and attempts a single hit; if it connects, V1 gets launched high into the air along with Minos. A Ground Slam can be used to cancel V1’s upward momentum. This attack requires 1 Stamina to be performed. Overhead: Minos teleports directly above V1 and does a straight-down attack after a sound cue accompanied with a blue flash. This move only is used while Minos is aerial. This attack consumes 1 Stamina to be performed. Stamina All of Minos’ attacks are controlled by an invisible stamina meter, which dictates what moves can be performed at what time. If he runs out of stamina, he will have to wait for it to recharge: The recovery window is 4 seconds on Harmless, 3 on Lenient, and 2 on Standard and Violent. Once he’s tired out, blast ‘em. Phase 1 on Harmless, Lenient, and Standard all have 6 points of stamina, whilst standard has 12 points of stamina in phase 2. Violent is the least forgiving, with 10 points of stamina in phase one, and infinite stamina in phase two. The Stamina values of each difficulty are the following: HARMLESS / LENIENT - 6 Stamina on both phases. STANDARD - 6 Stamina in Phase 1, 12 Stamina in Phase 2 VIOLENT - 10 Stamina in Phase 1, Infinite Stamina in Phase 2 BRUTAL - 15 Stamina in Phase 1, Infinite Stamina in Phase 2 Parrying any of Minos Prime’s melee attacks will restore 5 points of stamina to him. Phase 2 When falling below 65 (50%) health, Minos shouts “WEAK”, overriding any other voice lines. He also gains a blue fiery aura. During Phase 2, Minos Prime can use Serpent projectiles after jumping before following up with “Die!/Crush!” or an Overhead. On Standard difficulty, Parrying “Judgement!” will no longer prevent the explosion, forcing the player to dash to avoid damage during a parry. On Violent, “Judgement!” and the final hit of “Thy end is now!” cannot be parried. Difficulty Changes HARMLESS / LENIENT Minos Prime’s “Die!/Crush!” and “Judgement!” attacks have smaller shockwaves and explosions (or none at all on Harmless). Minos Prime does not gain any more stamina going into Phase 2. Minos Prime’s attacks are considerably slower, especially on Harmless difficulty. His projectile attacks however, are still as fast as they would be on higher difficulties. VIOLENT Minos Prime’s “Die!/Crush!” and “Judgement!” attacks have massive shockwaves and explosions. Parrying “Judgement!” will not interrupt the attack or prevent the player from taking damage from its explosion in Phase 1. “Judgement!” and “Thy end is now!” attacks cannot be parried when Minos Prime is reduced to half health. Minos Prime has 60% more stamina in Phase 1 and gains unlimited stamina in Phase 2. BRUTAL Minos Prime’s attack pattern becomes highly varied and fires serpents much more often. These being easily noticed during Phase 2. Minos Prime’s attacks are faster. Rending Apart Minos Prime, being a Prime Soul, is one of the most difficult enemies in the game, and thus one should not expect the first try to be the only try. Especially coming after the Flesh Prison fight, this opponent can be one of the most nerve-racking and stressful fights in the game. Be sure you’re comfortable, steady your nerves, and perhaps get some water. It’ll be a long fight, and likely not one done in a single life. P-ranking this will be especially difficult and will take a lot of practice, trial, and error. Minos Prime telegraphs his attacks quite clearly. Generally, circle-strafing and utilizing dash’s Invincibility Frames can be used to successfully avoid attacks. “Die!” and “Crush!” attacks can be avoided consistently by dashing to the side and jumping when the telegraph is heard, avoiding getting hit directly and going above the ground shockwave. In order to avoid the shockwave, dash forward inside the shockwave and/or slam. It is also possible to bait Minos into using these attacks onto a wall, which causes the shockwave to be vertical, making it easy to avoid. A good general tip for the majority of the fight would be to stay grounded, as he will have a preference to use Serpents and trickier attacks while V1 is airborne. He will also cancel “Thy end is now!”, “Prepare Thyself!” and “Judgement!” with an Uppercut if V1 is airborne during them, and both are easy to avoid by just circle strafing. The exception to staying grounded is to avoid the shockwaves of “Die!”/“Crush!”. Using the Whiplash or slam is useful to immediately get back on the ground, just stay wary of shockwaves. Minos’ “Thy end is now!” is one of the easiest attacks to avoid. By constantly switching directions during attacks while using sliding or dashing, it is guaranteed that Minos will miss all of his attacks. This is also an opportunity to deal as much damage as possible during this attack, especially the final hit of the attack, which leaves himself vulnerable for a long time. The final hit of the attack can be parried, except for Phase 2 on Violent and above. This can be consistently done by tracking the amount of times he has attacked, and positioning oneself to parry the final attack and dashing away, as the attack will still connect even when parried. Instead of dashing away it is also possible to simply stand to the side instead of in front of him, which allows to easily parry his attack and deal a considerable amount of damage with shotguns. Minos is able to launch a yellow-colored homing Serpent that explodes on contact, usually when V1 is too far away from Minos. Due to its persistent nature, it can be difficult to avoid, but the Serpent is parriable and can be destroyed with the Sharpshooter Revolver, though the timing is tight. There are many ways to mitigate this, such as moving in a straight line, dashing while parrying, or sliding back before parrying, all of which will make parrying more consistent and the snake more predictable. If parrying is not an option, one can bait it towards the wall to make it break. In more niche scenarios, an explosion can do the trick, which includes Minos’ “Judgement!”. On Violent and above, the Serpent is the only attack that can be parried on Phase 2, so learning to parry this attack is crucial to defeating him on higher difficulties. Minos’ “Prepare Thyself!” can be similarly dodged as “Thy end is now!”, except for the 3rd hit of the combo, where he will launch a homing Serpent and end the attack. The Serpent itself can be parried, and most strategies mentioned for dealing with the Serpent work here. However, the Serpent’s explosion can still damage V1, especially when Minos is too close, so dashing after parrying will avoid the damage and the knockback itself. “Judgement!”, while it can take new players by surprise, is one of the easiest attacks to avoid or parry. While the parry timing is a bit awkward, which is only after moments of him about to land the dropkick, it is easy to learn and master the timing. Parrying the attack also cancels the shockwave on Standard and below. However, on Violent and Brutal, the shockwave will still persist and the attack becomes unparriable on phase 2. In these cases or where parrying isn’t an option, dashing just moments after the teleport is the most consistent way to dodge it. During the fight and Phase 1 on Violent and above, his “Thy end is now!” and “Judgement!” parry are some of the easiest ones of the fight, so those who like their odds can get a free full heal off of it. Note that this also restores his stamina, so in some scenarios, it might be better to not parry these attacks instead. During Minos’ cutscene, one can prepare traps or set up tech such as Slabcoining, Railcoining, or Railcoinpunching. This is especially made easier after defeating him once, which allows the cutscene to be skipped. By setting up a Sawblade trap, and performing any high-damage coin techs, Minos’ health will rapidly deplete at the start of the fight, and in some cases instantly killing him (in the case of Deadcoining), or depleting his health to Phase 2. The alternate Piercer Revolver is very good for reliable damage at every range, even with a slow fire rate. Minos moves quickly, so good aim is very important. Coins are also very useful here, as their auto-aiming nature will greatly help deal damage to Minos, as he is a relatively small and very mobile opponent. Both variations of the Sharpshooter will work wonders as well, with its alt fire being able to destroy the Serpent projectile if needed be. Due to the room being mostly octagonal, the Sharpshooter has the potential to deal a lot of damage in a single alt fire, with the right timing and setup. The Shotgun, especially the Pump Charge Shotgun, can be great for doing damage when Minos is doing his more predictable attacks - double-charged shots does massive damage when at point-blank. Projectile Boosting can also be fairly easy to do damage with. Shotgun Swapping when Minos is not doing an attack is also a great way to deal consistent damage, while also acting as a great source of healing. The Nailgun can inflict heavy damage on Minos at the start of the fight by laying a trap with all 3 magnets during the cutscene, though it can be awkward to damage Minos with the Nailgun compared to the Shotgun without the use of magnets. Similar or better traps can be achieved with the Sawblade Launcher, which can also lay traps during the fight itself to inflict damage without necessarily needing to aim at Minos. Since Minos itself moves quickly, and the entire fight demands mobility, baiting him into saw traps can be difficult, but with the proper setup, it will deal massive damage, as such, this is best done at the start of the fight to deal massive burst damage. Shooting him with the Screwdriver Railcannon can be helpful, as it will mean easy health and constant damage if staying close. A good opportunity to put to embed a Screwdriver would be at the end of his “Thy end is now!”, as he holds still for a short period. Be wary of Hard Damage however, as it can rack up fast if too reliant on healing or are not stylish enough. Alternatively, this brief moment of respite can allow the player to perform a powerful Railcoining technique if they are fast enough, by tossing a coin backward and another through Minos and then shooting the latter coin with the Electric Railcannon, forgoing constant healing and in favor of high burst damage. Using the Electric Railcannon without the use of coins is not recommended, as it deals less damage than a Screwdriver while only providing a quick burst of healing, which is much less useful than a constant source of healing. This is especially true for Phase 2 on VIOLENT and above, where only his Serpent attack can be parried. The Rocket Launcher can often score airshots on Minos for double damage during movements and attacks that render him airborne, such as Uppercuts, Overheads, and the latter half of “Judgement!”. Magnets can help in landing airshots as well. Due to Minos’ speed and small stature, this can be difficult without good aim or magnets. Even when grounded, it can still deal a lot of damage, and due to its fast swap speed, it can be used for a quick burst of damage. Terminal Data For more information, see Terminal. TYPE: PRIME SOUL DATA: A prime soul is an incredibly rare occurrence in which a soul amasses so much power that it no longer requires a Husk as a vessel to manifest physically. Minos Prime is not a fully formed prime soul. As manifestations of pure will, prime souls are incredibly powerful, to the point that even the prideful angels see them as a threat and will use any means necessary to stop them from forming. King Minos felt that eternal suffering was an unfair and unreasonable punishment for those whose only sin was loving another. After the Disappearance of God, as angels were lost and Heaven was in chaos, Minos began his efforts to reform the Lust layer. The Lust renaissance was prosperous, as King Minos guided its inhabitants to come together and build a new civilization. The combined efforts of the countless who had been damned to the second layer bore great results as the grand city of Lust grew and grew. However, after the Council took control of Heaven and brought stability to it through their iron fist rule, they saw that Minos had gone against God’s will by freeing sinners from the punishment that God had designed for them. Gabriel, the brightest of the angels, was sent to kill Minos. The king, rather than fight back, tried to reason with him, but Gabriel mercilessly struck him down without listening. As Minos’ will was strong enough to attempt to stand up to Heaven’s rule, the angels chose to imprison his soul in an attempt to stop it from forming into a prime soul and appointed Gabriel as the new Judge of Hell. From the prison inside his own body, Minos helplessly watched as his soulless corpse, now controlled by parasites, tore apart everything he had worked so hard to build, cursing his own weakness for failing to protect his people, vowing to take revenge… STRATEGY: It’s rare for Minos Prime to give a window of opportunity to heal, so it’s vital to learn what attacks leave him momentarily vulnerable and how to dodge them in a way that gives an advantageous position during those moments. His snake projectiles can be parried using the Feedbacker for a full heal, even if the projectile doesn’t hit Minos Prime. Voice Lines “Ahh… Free at last. O, Gabriel. Now dawns thy reckoning, and thy gore shall glisten before the temples of man. Creature of steel… My gratitude upon thee for my freedom, but the crimes thy kind have committed against humanity are NOT forgotten. And thy punishment… is DEATH.” (Before the fight) “Useless!” (After restart) “Judgement!” “Die!” “Crush!” “Prepare thyself!” “Thy end is now!” “WEAK.” (Falling below half health) “Aagh! Forgive me, my children, for I have failed to bring you salvation from this cold, dark world…” (After defeat) WRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH! (Dying scream) Trivia Minos Prime’s boss theme is “ORDER”, and can be found here. The original concept art for Minos Prime was made by BigRockBMP, and his model was made by ActionDawg. Minos Prime is voiced by Stephan Weyte, known for being the voice of Caleb from the Blood franchise. Stephan has also provided the voice for Nyarlathotep in DUSK, another game published by New Blood, as well as the character “G” in Gloomwood, who appears at the very beginning and guides the outsider, among many other credits. (See his website for more information.) The pose Minos Prime strikes before his “Die!” divekick is taken from Kamen Rider.[1] Minos Prime’s manner of speaking during combat is inspired by Urien in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike.[2] Minos Prime says “Useless!” after each restart, implying that he knows you have died to him and that any efforts you attempt upon him will be only for naught. The only other characters that imply knowledge of restarts are the Mysterious Druid Knight (& Owl) and Minos’ ACT II counterpart, Sisyphus Prime. Before the first hotfix following the Soul Survivor update, Minos Prime’s “Judgement!” attack couldn’t be interrupted when parried. Minos Prime’s design has a heavy snake motif, with twin snakes coiling around his arms, blue snakes for attack trails, and golden snakes as projectiles. This draws inspiration from Minos in Inferno from Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy, who has a serpent’s tail coil around his body a certain amount of times to determine where sinners will be damned in the Nine Circles of Hell. Minos Prime, along with the Flesh Prison, are direct references to the fights against Nuculais and Legion, respectively, from Castlevania: Curse of Darkness.[3] His moveset has been often compared to characters from fighting games, utilizing a large amount of melee combat as well as a projectile. Some even compare him to a fighting game player due to how trivial the fight can become once you learn his patterns and moveset. If Minos Prime is somehow able to get out of bounds and fall into the void, he will reappear at the center of the arena. Minos Prime often says “Die!”. This is a subtle nod to the fact that he will kill you. This reference is best observed on Brutal Difficulty. There is a species of bacteriophage named MinosPhrime, a direct reference to Minos Prime.[4][5] This bacteriophage is notable for its resistance to high concentrations of alcohol compared to other phages. When Minos attacks, he leaves a trail of disturbed rubble behind him, implying he moves faster than you can see but does not teleport. This can be better observed by spawning him in an environment with many physical obstructions, such as the Sandbox. Minos’s “teleports” are unable to actually pass through ceilings, but enemies like Mindflayers are unobstructed. Despite the whole arena being made of flesh, the trail of rubble that Minos leaves in the wake of his attacks are made of stone. Minos moves so fast to the point he near-instantly dies when using “Die!” in a direction that doesn’t have a solid object he can land on. Minos’ body becomes invisible when underwater, but his circulatory system stays fully visible. This is a visual bug shared by his Act 2 counterpart. Minos is one of the only ULTRAKILL characters to have an official bodypillow, the others being Gabriel, V1, and Mirage.

TYPE: SPECTRAL GUARDIAN DATA: Arthur Morgan Prime represents a confluence of sorrow, rage, and unyielding spirit. He stands as a spectral sentinel, guarding the remnants of a world that once was—bearing the weight of legends lost and sagas unfinished. Once a herald of justice in a lawless land, Arthur's soul could not find peace, bound by duty and a profound sense of unfinished business. His appearance is a rare anomaly, indicating the presence of a powerful unresolved turmoil rooted in the annals of history. Voice Lines “Across the whispering plains, I ride...

The design of Arthur's Evertide Armor was inspired by vanished civilizations, incorporating elements from various mythos to symbolize the amalgamation of lost eras. Arthur Morgan Prime is voiced by Jonathan Stevens, renowned for his capacity to imbue characters with depth and gravitas. Stevens has lent his voice to myriad characters across gaming and animation, bringing each to life with a distinct presence. The inspiration behind Arthur Morgan Prime arose from a desire to explore the concept of legacy and the impact of change on those left behind by time's relentless march.

This era, often referred to as the Meiji Restoration, saw the Imperial House of Great Yamato, under the leadership of Emperor Meiji, regain executive power over the nation, heralding a new epoch marked by unity, modernization, and expansion. Unlike the histories of many nations, where change often comes at the edge of the sword, the Restoration was characterized by an unparalleled compromise. The traditional nobles and the advocates of democracy found common ground, one that preserved the age-old structures while embracing the inevitable winds of change. This accord allowed the Tokugawa clan, a venerable line of shoguns, to remain an integral part of the government, harmoniously blending the old and the new. They retained command over the armed forces and significant sway in governance, making them indispensable in the architecture of the new state. The Samurai and Daimyos, instead of facing dissolution, were redefined within the Empire. They were absorbed into the Kazoku, a noble class that preserved the honor and heritage of Japan's warrior elite while integrating them into the modern bureaucratic and military framework of the Empire. This innovative approach not only quelled potential dissent but also strengthened the Empire's foundation, creating a robust aristocracy that was loyal to the Imperial throne. Industrialization and modernization advanced at an astonishing pace, as Japan eagerly adopted Western technologies and organizational methods. Yet, it ingeniously maintained its cultural identity, weaving traditional values with newfound ideas. The Empire rapidly grew into an industrial juggernaut, its technological prowess and economic might earning it a place among the world's leading powers. The Empire's military capabilities saw remarkable enhancements, benefiting from both the traditional martial ethos of the Samurai and the advanced technologies from the West. These reforms were not merely superficial; they transformed the Great Japanese Empire into a formidable military power, capable of projecting its influence far beyond its shores. The late 19th and early 20th centuries were marked by significant territorial expansions. The acquisition of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands in 1898, followed by the annexation of Korea in 1910, were testaments to Japan's growing imperial ambitions. The Empire's victory over Russia, securing Sakhalin and solidifying its hold on the Pengu Islands in 1906, further attested to its military capabilities and strategic acumen. Unlike other empires of the time, the Great Japanese Empire was adept at both gaining and maintaining its territories, even in the face of global opposition post-1947. The 20th century presented numerous challenges, from wars to diplomatic struggles, yet the Empire navigated these with remarkable resilience. Its policies, while imperial in nature, were often imbued with a sense of modern governance and respect for the international order, allowing it to remain a key player on the global stage. As the 21st century dawned, the Great Japanese Empire continued to be an enduring symbol of how tradition and modernity can coalesce to create a unique, resilient, and dynamic state. Its ability to evolve, embracing the future while honoring its past, ensured not only its survival but its flourish as an imperial power in a rapidly changing world. The legacy of the Meiji Restoration, thus, is not merely one of reform and revolution, but of the enduring adaptability and unity of the Japanese spirit, a beacon of what can be achieved through harmony and foresight in the annals of history."},{"prompt":"Write a descriptive, fictional, imaginative Wikipedia article on “Jesus Prime” in this format: “Minos Prime 179 VIEW SOURCE “If only we knew the suffering that would befall us next…” This page describes special lore or secret content.

Minos Prime executing a devastating blow Minos Prime executing the move “Die!” Minos Prime is the second and final boss of [ P-1: SOUL SURVIVOR]. Though he proclaims his gratitude to V1 for freeing him, he condemns V1 to death for the machines’ crimes against humanity. He is considered the most complex and difficult boss of Act I. He spawns after defeating Flesh Prison, as he was trapped within it by the angels after being killed by Gabriel before the beginning of the game. Contents 1 Appearance 2 Combat 2.1 Difficulty Changes 3 Rending Apart 4 Terminal Data 5 Voice Lines 6 Trivia 7 Gallery 8 References Appearance Minos Prime is a tall, luminescent humanoid. His translucent body gives a clear view of his circulatory system, which seems to be the only organs present. There is a hole where his face should be. Serpents wrap around his arms. Combat Minos Prime is an incredibly powerful enemy, capable of chaining attacks to kill V1 in seconds. It only takes a moment of inattention to be utterly destroyed. Note that being airborne is very risky as Minos can and will kill you before you get the chance to get back in position. “Judgement!”: Minos dashes to V1 and performs an explosive dropkick, dealing more damage the closer V1 is towards the center. Minos is airborne after teleporting, and can follow up with an Overhead, “Die!/Crush!” or a serpent. This attack can be avoided by Parrying or using Invincibility Frames and dashing. If Minos does not follow up with any of these attacks, he will have a short recovery window independent of his current stamina. This attack requires 2 Stamina. “Die!”: Minos aims at V1 before instantly slamming towards them, creating a ground shockwave on impact. Minos briefly stops tracking V1 before the slam comes out, allowing the slam to be avoided. This attack can hit the wall or ceiling, causing the shockwave to be created there and canceling Minos’ recovery animation. This attack is only used when Minos is airborne and requires 1 Stamina. “Crush!”: A variant of “Die!” used if V1 is too close when initiated. It goes straight down, creating a large explosion that deals 50 damage rather than 30. This attack requires 1 Stamina. Serpent: Minos Prime winds up his right arm with an orange glow before releasing a serpentine projectile that homes in on V1. The longer it exists, the tighter its homing gets. It will persist until colliding with a surface or V1. It can be parried, making it a good source of health and a good way to deal damage. “Prepare thyself!”: A two-kick combo followed by a Parriable Serpent. The kicks have a chance of launching V1 into the air should they hit, and if V1 is airborne at any point during the kicks, Minos will instead interrupt the combo to do an Uppercut instead, removing the parry opportunity at the end of the combo. This can easily be avoided by sliding/strafing left or right, and moving backwards when Minos is about to cast his serpent, sliding/dashing out of the way or Parrying it. This attack requires 3 Stamina. “Thy end is now!”: A four-punch combo; the last punch can be Parried, though V1 will still have to dodge away to avoid damage. Similar to the previous combo, the punches have a chance of sending V1 into the air, and if V1 is airborne at any point during the first three punches, Minos will cancel the combo into an Uppercut, removing the parry opportunity of the final hit. This can easily be avoided by sliding/strafing left or right. This attack requires 2 Stamina. Uppercut: Minos Prime teleports to V1 and attempts a single hit; if it connects, V1 gets launched high into the air along with Minos. A Ground Slam can be used to cancel V1’s upward momentum. This attack requires 1 Stamina to be performed. Overhead: Minos teleports directly above V1 and does a straight-down attack after a sound cue accompanied with a blue flash. This move only is used while Minos is aerial. This attack consumes 1 Stamina to be performed. Stamina All of Minos’ attacks are controlled by an invisible stamina meter, which dictates what moves can be performed at what time. If he runs out of stamina, he will have to wait for it to recharge: The recovery window is 4 seconds on Harmless, 3 on Lenient, and 2 on Standard and Violent. Once he’s tired out, blast ‘em. Phase 1 on Harmless, Lenient, and Standard all have 6 points of stamina, whilst standard has 12 points of stamina in phase 2. Violent is the least forgiving, with 10 points of stamina in phase one, and infinite stamina in phase two. The Stamina values of each difficulty are the following: HARMLESS / LENIENT - 6 Stamina on both phases. STANDARD - 6 Stamina in Phase 1, 12 Stamina in Phase 2 VIOLENT - 10 Stamina in Phase 1, Infinite Stamina in Phase 2 BRUTAL - 15 Stamina in Phase 1, Infinite Stamina in Phase 2 Parrying any of Minos Prime’s melee attacks will restore 5 points of stamina to him. Phase 2 When falling below 65 (50%) health, Minos shouts “WEAK”, overriding any other voice lines. He also gains a blue fiery aura. During Phase 2, Minos Prime can use Serpent projectiles after jumping before following up with “Die!/Crush!” or an Overhead. On Standard difficulty, Parrying “Judgement!” will no longer prevent the explosion, forcing the player to dash to avoid damage during a parry. On Violent, “Judgement!” and the final hit of “Thy end is now!” cannot be parried. Difficulty Changes HARMLESS / LENIENT Minos Prime’s “Die!/Crush!” and “Judgement!” attacks have smaller shockwaves and explosions (or none at all on Harmless). Minos Prime does not gain any more stamina going into Phase 2. Minos Prime’s attacks are considerably slower, especially on Harmless difficulty. His projectile attacks however, are still as fast as they would be on higher difficulties. VIOLENT Minos Prime’s “Die!/Crush!” and “Judgement!” attacks have massive shockwaves and explosions. Parrying “Judgement!” will not interrupt the attack or prevent the player from taking damage from its explosion in Phase 1. “Judgement!” and “Thy end is now!” attacks cannot be parried when Minos Prime is reduced to half health. Minos Prime has 60% more stamina in Phase 1 and gains unlimited stamina in Phase 2. BRUTAL Minos Prime’s attack pattern becomes highly varied and fires serpents much more often. These being easily noticed during Phase 2. Minos Prime’s attacks are faster. Rending Apart Minos Prime, being a Prime Soul, is one of the most difficult enemies in the game, and thus one should not expect the first try to be the only try. Especially coming after the Flesh Prison fight, this opponent can be one of the most nerve-racking and stressful fights in the game. Be sure you’re comfortable, steady your nerves, and perhaps get some water. It’ll be a long fight, and likely not one done in a single life. P-ranking this will be especially difficult and will take a lot of practice, trial, and error. Minos Prime telegraphs his attacks quite clearly. Generally, circle-strafing and utilizing dash’s Invincibility Frames can be used to successfully avoid attacks. “Die!” and “Crush!” attacks can be avoided consistently by dashing to the side and jumping when the telegraph is heard, avoiding getting hit directly and going above the ground shockwave. In order to avoid the shockwave, dash forward inside the shockwave and/or slam. It is also possible to bait Minos into using these attacks onto a wall, which causes the shockwave to be vertical, making it easy to avoid. A good general tip for the majority of the fight would be to stay grounded, as he will have a preference to use Serpents and trickier attacks while V1 is airborne. He will also cancel “Thy end is now!”, “Prepare Thyself!” and “Judgement!” with an Uppercut if V1 is airborne during them, and both are easy to avoid by just circle strafing. The exception to staying grounded is to avoid the shockwaves of “Die!”/“Crush!”. Using the Whiplash or slam is useful to immediately get back on the ground, just stay wary of shockwaves. Minos’ “Thy end is now!” is one of the easiest attacks to avoid. By constantly switching directions during attacks while using sliding or dashing, it is guaranteed that Minos will miss all of his attacks. This is also an opportunity to deal as much damage as possible during this attack, especially the final hit of the attack, which leaves himself vulnerable for a long time. The final hit of the attack can be parried, except for Phase 2 on Violent and above. This can be consistently done by tracking the amount of times he has attacked, and positioning oneself to parry the final attack and dashing away, as the attack will still connect even when parried. Instead of dashing away it is also possible to simply stand to the side instead of in front of him, which allows to easily parry his attack and deal a considerable amount of damage with shotguns. Minos is able to launch a yellow-colored homing Serpent that explodes on contact, usually when V1 is too far away from Minos. Due to its persistent nature, it can be difficult to avoid, but the Serpent is parriable and can be destroyed with the Sharpshooter Revolver, though the timing is tight. There are many ways to mitigate this, such as moving in a straight line, dashing while parrying, or sliding back before parrying, all of which will make parrying more consistent and the snake more predictable. If parrying is not an option, one can bait it towards the wall to make it break. In more niche scenarios, an explosion can do the trick, which includes Minos’ “Judgement!”. On Violent and above, the Serpent is the only attack that can be parried on Phase 2, so learning to parry this attack is crucial to defeating him on higher difficulties. Minos’ “Prepare Thyself!” can be similarly dodged as “Thy end is now!”, except for the 3rd hit of the combo, where he will launch a homing Serpent and end the attack. The Serpent itself can be parried, and most strategies mentioned for dealing with the Serpent work here. However, the Serpent’s explosion can still damage V1, especially when Minos is too close, so dashing after parrying will avoid the damage and the knockback itself. “Judgement!”, while it can take new players by surprise, is one of the easiest attacks to avoid or parry. While the parry timing is a bit awkward, which is only after moments of him about to land the dropkick, it is easy to learn and master the timing. Parrying the attack also cancels the shockwave on Standard and below. However, on Violent and Brutal, the shockwave will still persist and the attack becomes unparriable on phase 2. In these cases or where parrying isn’t an option, dashing just moments after the teleport is the most consistent way to dodge it. During the fight and Phase 1 on Violent and above, his “Thy end is now!” and “Judgement!” parry are some of the easiest ones of the fight, so those who like their odds can get a free full heal off of it. Note that this also restores his stamina, so in some scenarios, it might be better to not parry these attacks instead. During Minos’ cutscene, one can prepare traps or set up tech such as Slabcoining, Railcoining, or Railcoinpunching. This is especially made easier after defeating him once, which allows the cutscene to be skipped. By setting up a Sawblade trap, and performing any high-damage coin techs, Minos’ health will rapidly deplete at the start of the fight, and in some cases instantly killing him (in the case of Deadcoining), or depleting his health to Phase 2. The alternate Piercer Revolver is very good for reliable damage at every range, even with a slow fire rate. Minos moves quickly, so good aim is very important. Coins are also very useful here, as their auto-aiming nature will greatly help deal damage to Minos, as he is a relatively small and very mobile opponent. Both variations of the Sharpshooter will work wonders as well, with its alt fire being able to destroy the Serpent projectile if needed be. Due to the room being mostly octagonal, the Sharpshooter has the potential to deal a lot of damage in a single alt fire, with the right timing and setup. The Shotgun, especially the Pump Charge Shotgun, can be great for doing damage when Minos is doing his more predictable attacks - double-charged shots does massive damage when at point-blank. Projectile Boosting can also be fairly easy to do damage with. Shotgun Swapping when Minos is not doing an attack is also a great way to deal consistent damage, while also acting as a great source of healing. The Nailgun can inflict heavy damage on Minos at the start of the fight by laying a trap with all 3 magnets during the cutscene, though it can be awkward to damage Minos with the Nailgun compared to the Shotgun without the use of magnets. Similar or better traps can be achieved with the Sawblade Launcher, which can also lay traps during the fight itself to inflict damage without necessarily needing to aim at Minos. Since Minos itself moves quickly, and the entire fight demands mobility, baiting him into saw traps can be difficult, but with the proper setup, it will deal massive damage, as such, this is best done at the start of the fight to deal massive burst damage. Shooting him with the Screwdriver Railcannon can be helpful, as it will mean easy health and constant damage if staying close. A good opportunity to put to embed a Screwdriver would be at the end of his “Thy end is now!”, as he holds still for a short period. Be wary of Hard Damage however, as it can rack up fast if too reliant on healing or are not stylish enough. Alternatively, this brief moment of respite can allow the player to perform a powerful Railcoining technique if they are fast enough, by tossing a coin backward and another through Minos and then shooting the latter coin with the Electric Railcannon, forgoing constant healing and in favor of high burst damage. Using the Electric Railcannon without the use of coins is not recommended, as it deals less damage than a Screwdriver while only providing a quick burst of healing, which is much less useful than a constant source of healing. This is especially true for Phase 2 on VIOLENT and above, where only his Serpent attack can be parried. The Rocket Launcher can often score airshots on Minos for double damage during movements and attacks that render him airborne, such as Uppercuts, Overheads, and the latter half of “Judgement!”. Magnets can help in landing airshots as well. Due to Minos’ speed and small stature, this can be difficult without good aim or magnets. Even when grounded, it can still deal a lot of damage, and due to its fast swap speed, it can be used for a quick burst of damage. Terminal Data For more information, see Terminal. TYPE: PRIME SOUL DATA: A prime soul is an incredibly rare occurrence in which a soul amasses so much power that it no longer requires a Husk as a vessel to manifest physically. Minos Prime is not a fully formed prime soul. As manifestations of pure will, prime souls are incredibly powerful, to the point that even the prideful angels see them as a threat and will use any means necessary to stop them from forming. King Minos felt that eternal suffering was an unfair and unreasonable punishment for those whose only sin was loving another. After the Disappearance of God, as angels were lost and Heaven was in chaos, Minos began his efforts to reform the Lust layer. The Lust renaissance was prosperous, as King Minos guided its inhabitants to come together and build a new civilization. The combined efforts of the countless who had been damned to the second layer bore great results as the grand city of Lust grew and grew. However, after the Council took control of Heaven and brought stability to it through their iron fist rule, they saw that Minos had gone against God’s will by freeing sinners from the punishment that God had designed for them. Gabriel, the brightest of the angels, was sent to kill Minos. The king, rather than fight back, tried to reason with him, but Gabriel mercilessly struck him down without listening. As Minos’ will was strong enough to attempt to stand up to Heaven’s rule, the angels chose to imprison his soul in an attempt to stop it from forming into a prime soul and appointed Gabriel as the new Judge of Hell. From the prison inside his own body, Minos helplessly watched as his soulless corpse, now controlled by parasites, tore apart everything he had worked so hard to build, cursing his own weakness for failing to protect his people, vowing to take revenge… STRATEGY: It’s rare for Minos Prime to give a window of opportunity to heal, so it’s vital to learn what attacks leave him momentarily vulnerable and how to dodge them in a way that gives an advantageous position during those moments. His snake projectiles can be parried using the Feedbacker for a full heal, even if the projectile doesn’t hit Minos Prime. Voice Lines “Ahh… Free at last. O, Gabriel. Now dawns thy reckoning, and thy gore shall glisten before the temples of man. Creature of steel… My gratitude upon thee for my freedom, but the crimes thy kind have committed against humanity are NOT forgotten. And thy punishment… is DEATH.” (Before the fight) “Useless!” (After restart) “Judgement!” “Die!” “Crush!” “Prepare thyself!” “Thy end is now!” “WEAK.” (Falling below half health) “Aagh! Forgive me, my children, for I have failed to bring you salvation from this cold, dark world…” (After defeat) WRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH! (Dying scream) Trivia Minos Prime’s boss theme is “ORDER”, and can be found here. The original concept art for Minos Prime was made by BigRockBMP, and his model was made by ActionDawg. Minos Prime is voiced by Stephan Weyte, known for being the voice of Caleb from the Blood franchise. Stephan has also provided the voice for Nyarlathotep in DUSK, another game published by New Blood, as well as the character “G” in Gloomwood, who appears at the very beginning and guides the outsider, among many other credits. (See his website for more information.) The pose Minos Prime strikes before his “Die!” divekick is taken from Kamen Rider.[1] Minos Prime’s manner of speaking during combat is inspired by Urien in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike.[2] Minos Prime says “Useless!” after each restart, implying that he knows you have died to him and that any efforts you attempt upon him will be only for naught. The only other characters that imply knowledge of restarts are the Mysterious Druid Knight (& Owl) and Minos’ ACT II counterpart, Sisyphus Prime. Before the first hotfix following the Soul Survivor update, Minos Prime’s “Judgement!” attack couldn’t be interrupted when parried. Minos Prime’s design has a heavy snake motif, with twin snakes coiling around his arms, blue snakes for attack trails, and golden snakes as projectiles. This draws inspiration from Minos in Inferno from Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy, who has a serpent’s tail coil around his body a certain amount of times to determine where sinners will be damned in the Nine Circles of Hell. Minos Prime, along with the Flesh Prison, are direct references to the fights against Nuculais and Legion, respectively, from Castlevania: Curse of Darkness.[3] His moveset has been often compared to characters from fighting games, utilizing a large amount of melee combat as well as a projectile. Some even compare him to a fighting game player due to how trivial the fight can become once you learn his patterns and moveset. If Minos Prime is somehow able to get out of bounds and fall into the void, he will reappear at the center of the arena. Minos Prime often says “Die!”. This is a subtle nod to the fact that he will kill you. This reference is best observed on Brutal Difficulty. There is a species of bacteriophage named MinosPhrime, a direct reference to Minos Prime.[4][5] This bacteriophage is notable for its resistance to high concentrations of alcohol compared to other phages. When Minos attacks, he leaves a trail of disturbed rubble behind him, implying he moves faster than you can see but does not teleport. This can be better observed by spawning him in an environment with many physical obstructions, such as the Sandbox. Minos’s “teleports” are unable to actually pass through ceilings, but enemies like Mindflayers are unobstructed. Despite the whole arena being made of flesh, the trail of rubble that Minos leaves in the wake of his attacks are made of stone. Minos moves so fast to the point he near-instantly dies when using “Die!” in a direction that doesn’t have a solid object he can land on. Minos’ body becomes invisible when underwater, but his circulatory system stays fully visible. This is a visual bug shared by his Act 2 counterpart. Minos is one of the only ULTRAKILL characters to have an official bodypillow, the others being Gabriel, V1, and Mirage.

His resurrection was long prophesied, symbolizing the rebirth of hope and divinity. He is the pinnacle of ethereal challenges in the Jerusalem Act. He manifests after the Herald of Revelations, signifying the last trial before eternal peace. Sealed within the Holy Sepulcher by ancient forces, his emergence signals both an end and a new beginning. Contents 1 Appearance 2 Combat 2.1 Difficulty Changes 3 Redemption 4 Holy Scriptures 5 Divine Commands 6 Revelation 7 Gallery 8 References Appearance Jesus Prime is a breathtaking spectacle, wreathed in divine light so brilliant, it challenges the sun itself. His eyes, deep and endless, seem to look into the very essence of one's being. The stigmata on his hands blaze with a fire that cleanses rather than burns, and he treads upon air, sanctified ground forming with each step. Combat Jesus Prime offers a test of faith like no other, requiring both spiritual resilience and strategic cunning. Each move demands reverence and understanding, for his attacks are as swift as they are salvational. “Holy Fire”: Jesus imbues his palms with divine flame and claps them together, sending out a fiery wave that purifies sin but decimates all in its righteous path. Standing too close without protection or failing to use Holy Artifacts will result in severe consequences. “Divine Strike”: With a cry to the heavens, Jesus commands a beam of pure celestial light to strike down, obliterating anything not shielded by faith or covered by Holy Relics. “Blessing Wave”: This gentle wave cleanses the soul, healing the worthy but staggering the unworthy with overwhelming peace. It can shockwave through the entire arena, demanding either a shield of faith or swift evasion. “Sacred Shield”: In response to aggression, Jesus manifests a shield of faith around him, reflecting attacks back to the sender empowered with holy wrath. This teaches the importance of timing and the use of sacred items to bypass divine defenses. “Celestial Spear”: Jesus draws upon the truth of the heavens, hurling spears of light that seek out the hearts of those it deems needing of penance. These can only be evaded by those who understand the dance of divinity or are shielded by artifacts of faith. Stamina Jesus Prime’s divine nature means he operates beyond mere mortal stamina constraints. His actions are dictated by faith and conviction, leaving little room for conventional tactics. The only rest comes during phases of prayer, providing a brief moment to strategize. Phase 2 Upon reaching half health, Jesus manifests a heavenly choir, their hymns strengthening his resolve. This phase introduces a miracle resurrection mechanic for any fallen foes, clad now in penitent robes to serve alongside him. Here, divine tactics must evolve, as Jesus gains access to “Eternal Light,” a beam that not just damages but seeks to convert the hearts of those it touches. Difficulty Changes INFINITE GRACE Jesus Prime’s actions are more forgiving, granting clearer tells and slower attack patterns, allowing pilgrims more time to react and contemplate their moves. His divine aura is less aggressive, providing moments of sanctuary between his attacks. RETRIBUTION Jesus Prime’s holy wrath is unbridled, with swift, relentless assaults of light and fire. Miracle resurrection becomes more frequent, and “Eternal Light” is used more liberally, challenging the most devout to withstand his test. OMNIPRESENT DIVINITY His divine will manifests more fiercely, with near-instantaneous attacks and miracles. “Eternal Light” leaves almost no room for error, demanding precise use of sacred relics and artifacts. Redemption Facing Jesus Prime is the ultimate test of spirit and faith. The battle is not just for survival but for enlightenment, pushing pilgrims to transcend their limits. Victory requires a blend of reverence, strategy, and an understanding that some battles are won not with force, but with heart. Holy Scriptures For more in-depth strategies and lore, see the Holy Scriptures section. Divine Commands “Fear not, for I am with thee…” (Before the battle) “Thou shalt be reborn…” (Upon initiating Phase 2) Revelation Enshrined within the scriptures are tales of Jesus Prime’s purpose; not merely as a combatant, but as a beacon of ultimate hope and renewal. His awakening was whispered in ancient texts, meant to guide humanity’s wayward souls back to the light. Trivia Jesus Prime's encounter theme is “Ascendancy,” a composition of heavenly choirs and divine instruments that elevates the soul. The initial design concept for Jesus Prime was crafted by SanctifiedSketches, with final visual details refined by DivineVisionary. Jesus Prime is voiced by Eternity’s Echo, a renowned celestial choir, lending a transcendent quality to his voice lines and battle cries. The stance Jesus Prime takes before unleashing “Divine Strike” is reminiscent of classical Renaissance paintings depicting the heavens parting. Jesus Prime's dialect during combat is evocative of the King James Bible, imbuing his dialogue with an ancient, authoritative gravitas. Jesus Prime's awareness of his own resurrection cycle, hinting at omniscience, parallels with theological debates about divine predestination and free will. According to ancient scripts discovered within the Vatican archives, Jesus Prime was prophesied to return in a time of great need, bringing an era of enlightenment and peace.

The poem beautifully captures a transient moment in nature, reflecting on broader themes of time, life cycles, and perhaps human emotion or experiences. Let's break it down: 1. **First line: \\"残暑に生きる\\" (Living in the lingering heat)** - This line sets the scene in late summer, a time when the intensity of summer's heat remains, though it's starting to wane. The phrase suggests endurance or survival through the residual warmth of the season, implying a context of moving past the prime of summer but still feeling its effects. 2. **Second line: \\"盛りを過ぎた先\\" (Beyond the peak)** - Here, the transition is more explicitly stated: it's beyond the peak, or the prime, of summer. Symbolically, this could reflect any situation, relationship, or phase of life that has moved past its zenith. There's a hint of melancholy or reflection in realizing that the best moments may now be behind, offering a broader metaphorical interpretation about aging or the changing stages of life. 3. **Third line: \\"晩夏の後悔\\" (Regret in late summer)** - The finale of the haiku introduces a powerful human emotion—regret—which is poignant against the backdrop of late summer. This could signify a longing for missed opportunities or a wishing that things had been done differently when there was still time. The use of \\"late summer\\" metaphorically associates this regret with the latter stages of a process, project, or life itself, suggesting that the realization of what's been lost or unattained becomes clearer after the peak has passed. **Overall Analysis:** - This haiku engages with the themes of time, transition, and reflection. It implies a progression from enduring the remnants of a peak period (whether it be the heat of summer or the prime of life) to acknowledging that the prime has passed, and finally, to feeling a sense of regret for what was not accomplished or experienced during that time. - The poem's beauty lies in its simplicity and the universality of its themes. Without explicitly mentioning any action or emotion, it evokes a deep sense of reflection on the nature of change and the human condition. - There's a blend of the physical (the changing season from the heat of summer to late summer) and the metaphysical (the emotional journey from enduring to reflecting on what's been lost), making it a poignant piece that resonates on multiple levels. In the context of Japanese culture, which deeply appreciates the beauty and symbolic meanings of seasons, this haiku echoes traditional themes of impermanence (無常, mujō) and the bittersweet beauty in the fleeting nature of life (物哀, mono no aware), inviting readers to reflect on their own experiences of change, transition, and the feelings that accompany these moments."},{"prompt":"Would it be better to say 生きて instead of 生きる?","completion":"In the context of the haiku you provided, both \\"生きる\\" (ikiru) and \\"生きて\\" (ikite) could work, but they carry slightly different nuances, and the choice between them would affect the rhythm and potentially the thematic resonance of the poem within the strict structure of haiku. # \\"生きる\\" (ikiru) - To live - Using \\"生きる\\" is more definitive and can be seen as a statement or declaration. It presents the act of living or existing in the lingering heat as a current state or inherent condition. - In the haiku format, which is historically and structurally built around brevity and the power of evocation, \\"生きる\\" offers a statement of being. It aligns with the traditional objective of capturing a moment or essence succinctly. # \\"生きて\\" (ikite) - Living - \\"生きて\\" is the te-form of \\"生きる\\", which can imply a continuing action or state. It could introduce a more dynamic or ongoing sense of living or existing within the lingering heat, potentially adding a sense of endurance or continuation. - However, using \\"生きて\\" may slightly alter the rhythm and pacing of the haiku. Remember, haiku traditionally adhere to a 5-7-5 syllable (or in Japanese, \\"on\\" or sound units) pattern. Changing to \\"生きて\\" might disrupt the delicate balance of the poem, depending on how strictly one adheres to the traditional syllable count and how the change interacts with the poem's other elements in its original language. # Considerations in Haiku Haiku often employs juxtaposition, seasonal references (kigo), and a cutting word (kireji) to divide and enhance the imagery or emotional impact. Each word is chosen for both its semantic content and its place within the poem's meter. \\"生きる\\" and \\"生きて\\" might both fit within the thematic and structural confines of haiku, but their impact on the overall feel, rhythm, and depth of the poem could differ. Given these subtleties, whether \\"生きる\\" or \\"生きて\\" is \\"better\\" depends on what you wish to convey and how strictly you're adhering to traditional haiku conventions. If the goal is to emphasize a state of being or existential condition within the seasonal context, \\"生きる\\" might be more fitting.

Episode: \\"The Toonification Conundrum\\" Act 1: The Arrival of Mr. Chucklehead In the depths of Shuggazoom City, the Hyperforce is busy battling a new form of robotic menace created by the Skeleton King when a rift in the space-time continuum suddenly appears. From it steps an odd character unlike any they have seen before: Mr. Chucklehead, a lively and eccentric figure straight out of the golden age of animation, complete with exaggerated facial expressions and a body that defies the laws of physics. He declares, \\"This battling and brooding is far too dreary! What this show needs is a good dose of the old razzle-dazzle, the slapstick, and the side-splitting gags of the cartoons of yore!\\" The team is puzzled but intrigued by this colorful character. However, they insist that their mission to protect the universe is serious business and not something that can be turned into a joke. Act 2: The Toonification Undeterred, Mr. Chucklehead uses his cartoonish powers to begin transforming the world around them. Suddenly, Shuggazoom City morphs into a vibrant, surreal landscape filled with impossible architecture and colorful scenery reminiscent of the classic cartoons Mr. Chucklehead so adores. The Hyperforce members find themselves caught in a world where physics no longer applies as they know it. They slip on banana peels mysteriously appearing under their feet, anvil drops become a constant hazard, and their own bodies stretch and squash in the most unexpected ways. Though initially amusing, the team quickly realizes that this toonification has made it impossible for them to battle effectively. Their serious demeanor doesn't fit in this new wacky world, and their attempts at action and drama fall flat, literally. Act 3: Striking a Balance Gibson, utilizing his intellect, devises a plan to confront Mr. Chucklehead, suggesting that humor and seriousness can coexist, showing him examples of how their past adventures had moments of levity and comedy without undermining the gravity of their mission. Reluctantly, Mr. Chucklehead agrees to a challenge: The Hyperforce will incorporate humor into their battle strategy against a simulated menace he conjures, proving that laughter can indeed be a powerful weapon, but without completely discarding the action, drama, and heart that define their cause. The battle is a riotous affair, with each member of the Hyperforce embracing the absurdity while maintaining their focus on the goal. Otto excels with his penchant for goofy inventions, turning the tide of battle with a banana peel launcher that sends the robotic enemies slipping and sliding. Sparx ingeniously uses exaggerated cartoon physics to his advantage, creating elaborate traps that ensnare foes in comedic yet effective ways. Act 4: Harmony Restored As the dust settles, Mr. Chucklehead, thoroughly entertained and somewhat enlightened, concedes that there's room for both the slapstick comedy of his beloved golden age and the thrilling action of the Hyperforce's adventures. He restores Shuggazoom City to its original state, but not without adding a touch of cartoonish charm to remind everyone not to take life too seriously. Before departing, Mr. Chucklehead leaves the Hyperforce with a parting gift: a device that can temporarily \\"toonify\\" their surroundings, should they ever wish to lighten the mood or need an unconventional solution to a problem. The Hyperforce members watch as Mr. Chucklehead disappears back into the rift, reflecting on the day's events. They agree that humor has its place, even in their high-stakes world, and that laughter might just be the universal language that unites them all. The episode closes with the team sharing a genuine laugh together, appreciating the lighter side of their mission for the first time in a long while. Epilogue: A Tasteful Chuckle Back at the Super Robot, the team gathers around, watching clips of classic cartoons provided by Mr. Chucklehead, learning and laughing, ready to face whatever challenge comes next—with a smile."},{"prompt":"Write a descriptive, fictional, imaginative Wikipedia article on “Jesus Prime” in this format: “Minos Prime 179 VIEW SOURCE “If only we knew the suffering that would befall us next…” This page describes special lore or secret content.

Minos Prime executing a devastating blow Minos Prime executing the move “Die!” Minos Prime is the second and final boss of [ P-1: SOUL SURVIVOR]. Though he proclaims his gratitude to V1 for freeing him, he condemns V1 to death for the machines’ crimes against humanity. He is considered the most complex and difficult boss of Act I. He spawns after defeating Flesh Prison, as he was trapped within it by the angels after being killed by Gabriel before the beginning of the game. Contents 1 Appearance 2 Combat 2.1 Difficulty Changes 3 Rending Apart 4 Terminal Data 5 Voice Lines 6 Trivia 7 Gallery 8 References Appearance Minos Prime is a tall, luminescent humanoid. His translucent body gives a clear view of his circulatory system, which seems to be the only organs present. There is a hole where his face should be. Serpents wrap around his arms. Combat Minos Prime is an incredibly powerful enemy, capable of chaining attacks to kill V1 in seconds. It only takes a moment of inattention to be utterly destroyed. Note that being airborne is very risky as Minos can and will kill you before you get the chance to get back in position. “Judgement!”: Minos dashes to V1 and performs an explosive dropkick, dealing more damage the closer V1 is towards the center. Minos is airborne after teleporting, and can follow up with an Overhead, “Die!/Crush!” or a serpent. This attack can be avoided by Parrying or using Invincibility Frames and dashing. If Minos does not follow up with any of these attacks, he will have a short recovery window independent of his current stamina. This attack requires 2 Stamina. “Die!”: Minos aims at V1 before instantly slamming towards them, creating a ground shockwave on impact. Minos briefly stops tracking V1 before the slam comes out, allowing the slam to be avoided. This attack can hit the wall or ceiling, causing the shockwave to be created there and canceling Minos’ recovery animation. This attack is only used when Minos is airborne and requires 1 Stamina. “Crush!”: A variant of “Die!” used if V1 is too close when initiated. It goes straight down, creating a large explosion that deals 50 damage rather than 30. This attack requires 1 Stamina. Serpent: Minos Prime winds up his right arm with an orange glow before releasing a serpentine projectile that homes in on V1. The longer it exists, the tighter its homing gets. It will persist until colliding with a surface or V1. It can be parried, making it a good source of health and a good way to deal damage. “Prepare thyself!”: A two-kick combo followed by a Parriable Serpent. The kicks have a chance of launching V1 into the air should they hit, and if V1 is airborne at any point during the kicks, Minos will instead interrupt the combo to do an Uppercut instead, removing the parry opportunity at the end of the combo. This can easily be avoided by sliding/strafing left or right, and moving backwards when Minos is about to cast his serpent, sliding/dashing out of the way or Parrying it. This attack requires 3 Stamina. “Thy end is now!”: A four-punch combo; the last punch can be Parried, though V1 will still have to dodge away to avoid damage. Similar to the previous combo, the punches have a chance of sending V1 into the air, and if V1 is airborne at any point during the first three punches, Minos will cancel the combo into an Uppercut, removing the parry opportunity of the final hit. This can easily be avoided by sliding/strafing left or right. This attack requires 2 Stamina. Uppercut: Minos Prime teleports to V1 and attempts a single hit; if it connects, V1 gets launched high into the air along with Minos. A Ground Slam can be used to cancel V1’s upward momentum. This attack requires 1 Stamina to be performed. Overhead: Minos teleports directly above V1 and does a straight-down attack after a sound cue accompanied with a blue flash. This move only is used while Minos is aerial. This attack consumes 1 Stamina to be performed. Stamina All of Minos’ attacks are controlled by an invisible stamina meter, which dictates what moves can be performed at what time. If he runs out of stamina, he will have to wait for it to recharge: The recovery window is 4 seconds on Harmless, 3 on Lenient, and 2 on Standard and Violent. Once he’s tired out, blast ‘em. Phase 1 on Harmless, Lenient, and Standard all have 6 points of stamina, whilst standard has 12 points of stamina in phase 2. Violent is the least forgiving, with 10 points of stamina in phase one, and infinite stamina in phase two. The Stamina values of each difficulty are the following: HARMLESS / LENIENT - 6 Stamina on both phases. STANDARD - 6 Stamina in Phase 1, 12 Stamina in Phase 2 VIOLENT - 10 Stamina in Phase 1, Infinite Stamina in Phase 2 BRUTAL - 15 Stamina in Phase 1, Infinite Stamina in Phase 2 Parrying any of Minos Prime’s melee attacks will restore 5 points of stamina to him. Phase 2 When falling below 65 (50%) health, Minos shouts “WEAK”, overriding any other voice lines. He also gains a blue fiery aura. During Phase 2, Minos Prime can use Serpent projectiles after jumping before following up with “Die!/Crush!” or an Overhead. On Standard difficulty, Parrying “Judgement!” will no longer prevent the explosion, forcing the player to dash to avoid damage during a parry. On Violent, “Judgement!” and the final hit of “Thy end is now!” cannot be parried. Difficulty Changes HARMLESS / LENIENT Minos Prime’s “Die!/Crush!” and “Judgement!” attacks have smaller shockwaves and explosions (or none at all on Harmless). Minos Prime does not gain any more stamina going into Phase 2. Minos Prime’s attacks are considerably slower, especially on Harmless difficulty. His projectile attacks however, are still as fast as they would be on higher difficulties. VIOLENT Minos Prime’s “Die!/Crush!” and “Judgement!” attacks have massive shockwaves and explosions. Parrying “Judgement!” will not interrupt the attack or prevent the player from taking damage from its explosion in Phase 1. “Judgement!” and “Thy end is now!” attacks cannot be parried when Minos Prime is reduced to half health. Minos Prime has 60% more stamina in Phase 1 and gains unlimited stamina in Phase 2. BRUTAL Minos Prime’s attack pattern becomes highly varied and fires serpents much more often. These being easily noticed during Phase 2. Minos Prime’s attacks are faster. Rending Apart Minos Prime, being a Prime Soul, is one of the most difficult enemies in the game, and thus one should not expect the first try to be the only try. Especially coming after the Flesh Prison fight, this opponent can be one of the most nerve-racking and stressful fights in the game. Be sure you’re comfortable, steady your nerves, and perhaps get some water. It’ll be a long fight, and likely not one done in a single life. P-ranking this will be especially difficult and will take a lot of practice, trial, and error. Minos Prime telegraphs his attacks quite clearly. Generally, circle-strafing and utilizing dash’s Invincibility Frames can be used to successfully avoid attacks. “Die!” and “Crush!” attacks can be avoided consistently by dashing to the side and jumping when the telegraph is heard, avoiding getting hit directly and going above the ground shockwave. In order to avoid the shockwave, dash forward inside the shockwave and/or slam. It is also possible to bait Minos into using these attacks onto a wall, which causes the shockwave to be vertical, making it easy to avoid. A good general tip for the majority of the fight would be to stay grounded, as he will have a preference to use Serpents and trickier attacks while V1 is airborne. He will also cancel “Thy end is now!”, “Prepare Thyself!” and “Judgement!” with an Uppercut if V1 is airborne during them, and both are easy to avoid by just circle strafing. The exception to staying grounded is to avoid the shockwaves of “Die!”/“Crush!”. Using the Whiplash or slam is useful to immediately get back on the ground, just stay wary of shockwaves. Minos’ “Thy end is now!” is one of the easiest attacks to avoid. By constantly switching directions during attacks while using sliding or dashing, it is guaranteed that Minos will miss all of his attacks. This is also an opportunity to deal as much damage as possible during this attack, especially the final hit of the attack, which leaves himself vulnerable for a long time. The final hit of the attack can be parried, except for Phase 2 on Violent and above. This can be consistently done by tracking the amount of times he has attacked, and positioning oneself to parry the final attack and dashing away, as the attack will still connect even when parried. Instead of dashing away it is also possible to simply stand to the side instead of in front of him, which allows to easily parry his attack and deal a considerable amount of damage with shotguns. Minos is able to launch a yellow-colored homing Serpent that explodes on contact, usually when V1 is too far away from Minos. Due to its persistent nature, it can be difficult to avoid, but the Serpent is parriable and can be destroyed with the Sharpshooter Revolver, though the timing is tight. There are many ways to mitigate this, such as moving in a straight line, dashing while parrying, or sliding back before parrying, all of which will make parrying more consistent and the snake more predictable. If parrying is not an option, one can bait it towards the wall to make it break. In more niche scenarios, an explosion can do the trick, which includes Minos’ “Judgement!”. On Violent and above, the Serpent is the only attack that can be parried on Phase 2, so learning to parry this attack is crucial to defeating him on higher difficulties. Minos’ “Prepare Thyself!” can be similarly dodged as “Thy end is now!”, except for the 3rd hit of the combo, where he will launch a homing Serpent and end the attack. The Serpent itself can be parried, and most strategies mentioned for dealing with the Serpent work here. However, the Serpent’s explosion can still damage V1, especially when Minos is too close, so dashing after parrying will avoid the damage and the knockback itself. “Judgement!”, while it can take new players by surprise, is one of the easiest attacks to avoid or parry. While the parry timing is a bit awkward, which is only after moments of him about to land the dropkick, it is easy to learn and master the timing. Parrying the attack also cancels the shockwave on Standard and below. However, on Violent and Brutal, the shockwave will still persist and the attack becomes unparriable on phase 2. In these cases or where parrying isn’t an option, dashing just moments after the teleport is the most consistent way to dodge it. During the fight and Phase 1 on Violent and above, his “Thy end is now!” and “Judgement!” parry are some of the easiest ones of the fight, so those who like their odds can get a free full heal off of it. Note that this also restores his stamina, so in some scenarios, it might be better to not parry these attacks instead. During Minos’ cutscene, one can prepare traps or set up tech such as Slabcoining, Railcoining, or Railcoinpunching. This is especially made easier after defeating him once, which allows the cutscene to be skipped. By setting up a Sawblade trap, and performing any high-damage coin techs, Minos’ health will rapidly deplete at the start of the fight, and in some cases instantly killing him (in the case of Deadcoining), or depleting his health to Phase 2. The alternate Piercer Revolver is very good for reliable damage at every range, even with a slow fire rate. Minos moves quickly, so good aim is very important. Coins are also very useful here, as their auto-aiming nature will greatly help deal damage to Minos, as he is a relatively small and very mobile opponent. Both variations of the Sharpshooter will work wonders as well, with its alt fire being able to destroy the Serpent projectile if needed be. Due to the room being mostly octagonal, the Sharpshooter has the potential to deal a lot of damage in a single alt fire, with the right timing and setup. The Shotgun, especially the Pump Charge Shotgun, can be great for doing damage when Minos is doing his more predictable attacks - double-charged shots does massive damage when at point-blank. Projectile Boosting can also be fairly easy to do damage with. Shotgun Swapping when Minos is not doing an attack is also a great way to deal consistent damage, while also acting as a great source of healing. The Nailgun can inflict heavy damage on Minos at the start of the fight by laying a trap with all 3 magnets during the cutscene, though it can be awkward to damage Minos with the Nailgun compared to the Shotgun without the use of magnets. Similar or better traps can be achieved with the Sawblade Launcher, which can also lay traps during the fight itself to inflict damage without necessarily needing to aim at Minos. Since Minos itself moves quickly, and the entire fight demands mobility, baiting him into saw traps can be difficult, but with the proper setup, it will deal massive damage, as such, this is best done at the start of the fight to deal massive burst damage. Shooting him with the Screwdriver Railcannon can be helpful, as it will mean easy health and constant damage if staying close. A good opportunity to put to embed a Screwdriver would be at the end of his “Thy end is now!”, as he holds still for a short period. Be wary of Hard Damage however, as it can rack up fast if too reliant on healing or are not stylish enough. Alternatively, this brief moment of respite can allow the player to perform a powerful Railcoining technique if they are fast enough, by tossing a coin backward and another through Minos and then shooting the latter coin with the Electric Railcannon, forgoing constant healing and in favor of high burst damage. Using the Electric Railcannon without the use of coins is not recommended, as it deals less damage than a Screwdriver while only providing a quick burst of healing, which is much less useful than a constant source of healing. This is especially true for Phase 2 on VIOLENT and above, where only his Serpent attack can be parried. The Rocket Launcher can often score airshots on Minos for double damage during movements and attacks that render him airborne, such as Uppercuts, Overheads, and the latter half of “Judgement!”. Magnets can help in landing airshots as well. Due to Minos’ speed and small stature, this can be difficult without good aim or magnets. Even when grounded, it can still deal a lot of damage, and due to its fast swap speed, it can be used for a quick burst of damage. Terminal Data For more information, see Terminal. TYPE: PRIME SOUL DATA: A prime soul is an incredibly rare occurrence in which a soul amasses so much power that it no longer requires a Husk as a vessel to manifest physically. Minos Prime is not a fully formed prime soul. As manifestations of pure will, prime souls are incredibly powerful, to the point that even the prideful angels see them as a threat and will use any means necessary to stop them from forming. King Minos felt that eternal suffering was an unfair and unreasonable punishment for those whose only sin was loving another. After the Disappearance of God, as angels were lost and Heaven was in chaos, Minos began his efforts to reform the Lust layer. The Lust renaissance was prosperous, as King Minos guided its inhabitants to come together and build a new civilization. The combined efforts of the countless who had been damned to the second layer bore great results as the grand city of Lust grew and grew. However, after the Council took control of Heaven and brought stability to it through their iron fist rule, they saw that Minos had gone against God’s will by freeing sinners from the punishment that God had designed for them. Gabriel, the brightest of the angels, was sent to kill Minos. The king, rather than fight back, tried to reason with him, but Gabriel mercilessly struck him down without listening. As Minos’ will was strong enough to attempt to stand up to Heaven’s rule, the angels chose to imprison his soul in an attempt to stop it from forming into a prime soul and appointed Gabriel as the new Judge of Hell. From the prison inside his own body, Minos helplessly watched as his soulless corpse, now controlled by parasites, tore apart everything he had worked so hard to build, cursing his own weakness for failing to protect his people, vowing to take revenge… STRATEGY: It’s rare for Minos Prime to give a window of opportunity to heal, so it’s vital to learn what attacks leave him momentarily vulnerable and how to dodge them in a way that gives an advantageous position during those moments. His snake projectiles can be parried using the Feedbacker for a full heal, even if the projectile doesn’t hit Minos Prime. Voice Lines “Ahh… Free at last. O, Gabriel. Now dawns thy reckoning, and thy gore shall glisten before the temples of man. Creature of steel… My gratitude upon thee for my freedom, but the crimes thy kind have committed against humanity are NOT forgotten. And thy punishment… is DEATH.” (Before the fight) “Useless!” (After restart) “Judgement!” “Die!” “Crush!” “Prepare thyself!” “Thy end is now!” “WEAK.” (Falling below half health) “Aagh! Forgive me, my children, for I have failed to bring you salvation from this cold, dark world…” (After defeat) WRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH! (Dying scream) Trivia Minos Prime’s boss theme is “ORDER”, and can be found here. The original concept art for Minos Prime was made by BigRockBMP, and his model was made by ActionDawg. Minos Prime is voiced by Stephan Weyte, known for being the voice of Caleb from the Blood franchise. Stephan has also provided the voice for Nyarlathotep in DUSK, another game published by New Blood, as well as the character “G” in Gloomwood, who appears at the very beginning and guides the outsider, among many other credits. (See his website for more information.) The pose Minos Prime strikes before his “Die!” divekick is taken from Kamen Rider.[1] Minos Prime’s manner of speaking during combat is inspired by Urien in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike.[2] Minos Prime says “Useless!” after each restart, implying that he knows you have died to him and that any efforts you attempt upon him will be only for naught. The only other characters that imply knowledge of restarts are the Mysterious Druid Knight (& Owl) and Minos’ ACT II counterpart, Sisyphus Prime. Before the first hotfix following the Soul Survivor update, Minos Prime’s “Judgement!” attack couldn’t be interrupted when parried. Minos Prime’s design has a heavy snake motif, with twin snakes coiling around his arms, blue snakes for attack trails, and golden snakes as projectiles. This draws inspiration from Minos in Inferno from Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy, who has a serpent’s tail coil around his body a certain amount of times to determine where sinners will be damned in the Nine Circles of Hell. Minos Prime, along with the Flesh Prison, are direct references to the fights against Nuculais and Legion, respectively, from Castlevania: Curse of Darkness.[3] His moveset has been often compared to characters from fighting games, utilizing a large amount of melee combat as well as a projectile. Some even compare him to a fighting game player due to how trivial the fight can become once you learn his patterns and moveset. If Minos Prime is somehow able to get out of bounds and fall into the void, he will reappear at the center of the arena. Minos Prime often says “Die!”. This is a subtle nod to the fact that he will kill you. This reference is best observed on Brutal Difficulty. There is a species of bacteriophage named MinosPhrime, a direct reference to Minos Prime.[4][5] This bacteriophage is notable for its resistance to high concentrations of alcohol compared to other phages. When Minos attacks, he leaves a trail of disturbed rubble behind him, implying he moves faster than you can see but does not teleport. This can be better observed by spawning him in an environment with many physical obstructions, such as the Sandbox. Minos’s “teleports” are unable to actually pass through ceilings, but enemies like Mindflayers are unobstructed. Despite the whole arena being made of flesh, the trail of rubble that Minos leaves in the wake of his attacks are made of stone. Minos moves so fast to the point he near-instantly dies when using “Die!” in a direction that doesn’t have a solid object he can land on. Minos’ body becomes invisible when underwater, but his circulatory system stays fully visible. This is a visual bug shared by his Act 2 counterpart. Minos is one of the only ULTRAKILL characters to have an official bodypillow, the others being Gabriel, V1, and Mirage.

Minos Prime underwater, his circulatory system being the only thing visible.” Here is his terminal entry: \\"TERMINAL ENTRY Many emotions rushed through his mind upon hearing of God’s disappearance Shock Fear Anger He couldn’t fathom why or how his father could have disappeared. Was he killed? No, that’s impossible. Nothing can kill the Heavenly Father. Did he leave of his own accord? No, of course not. He would never do that. Whatever happened, Jesus could only hope for his father’s swift and safe return. This of course never came, as with his father’s absence did humanity’s extinction come about; with no inkling of the salvation that Jesus had promised eons ago. Jesus in turn receded into a great depression, barely being able to fulfill his duties within the Kingdom of Heaven. With God gone, and his son unfit to rule, a collective of angels rose to the throne. Calling themselves The Council, they claimed to operate in accordance to God’s will, and would ensure that his work persevered despite recent events. Jesus initially believed their words, to his own detriment. With The Council at the helm, Jesus would witness the atrocities committed by these so-called “Hands of God,” as they snuffed out the Lust Renaissance with great prejudice and hate, an act he saw as the antithesis of his father’s wishes. The Sisyphean Rebellion came and went, with Jesus watching as The Council once again giving no quarter for Greed’s sinners. By now he had come to resent The Council and their hollow promise of continuing his father’s work. Then came Treachary’s Attempted Repentance. Jesus would at first watch the people of Treachery pray and repent for their sins, building churches and worshiping God despite their punishment; holding faith that salvation would come. This would bring Jesus immense joy--especially once Gabriel reported that their attempts were genuine. Jesus wanted to welcome the worshippers with open arms. The Counsel, however, did not. And with abject horror and appalment, Jesus would watch the Counsel's ordering of the worshiper's execution for daring to seek salvation from their punishment. With a newfound hatred for his father's usurpers, he stood against them with righteous hatred and determination, only to be slain by Gabriel. His blind loyalty being warped by the counsel to have him believe that Jesus was a treacherous sinner for daring to oppose those who were carrying out The Father’s will. He would awake once more within a Dimension of Flesh, constructed right beneath the Kingdom of Heaven. He had manifested into a Prime Soul out of sheer hatred for those that claimed to work in God's name. He could've escaped at any time, however he didn't. His hatred, while unrelenting and vitriolic, was overshadowed by an even greater sense of depression and guilt. He, the messiah, the Son of God, could not save humanity, he couldn't even grant them salvation like he had promised so long ago.

His attacks are multifaceted, requiring the player to adapt quickly or face swift defeat. “Divine Retribution!”: A powerful beam of light shot from his eyes toward the player, inflicting severe damage and a temporary debuff reducing the player's ability to deal damage. “Mercy Denied!”: Jesus Prime slams the ground, sending out a wave of divine energy that seeks out the player, dealing heavy damage and reversing controls temporarily. “Sacred Light!”: A massive shockwave of holy light bursts from Jesus, damaging all in its vicinity and cleansing any dark energy within the arena. “Behold My Suffering!”: Jesus reveals his wounds, causing a pause in combat where the player must avert their gaze or become overwhelmed with guilt, freezing them in place for a critical follow-up attack. “Final Judgement!”: His ultimate attack where Jesus evaluates the player's actions throughout the game, dealing damage relative to the sins committed. # Phase 2 Upon reaching half health, Jesus Prime’s aura intensifies, and the arena changes to reflect a more celestial and holy environment. His attacks become more rapid and complex, introducing “Resurrection Wave” and “Light of Redemption,” skills that either heal him or offer the player a chance for forgiveness, reducing damage taken if chosen. # Difficulty Changes - **PEACEFUL** - Jesus Prime’s “Mercy Denied!” and “Final Judgement!” have reduced effects. - Enhanced opportunities for healing and forgiveness. - **ASCENDED** - All attacks are faster and have increased area effect. - “Final Judgement!” can instantly defeat the player if major sins have not been atoned for. - Limited chances for healing and forgiveness. # Revelation Defeating Jesus Prime is a harrowing task, requiring not just combat prowess but also the willingness to confront and atone for the player’s actions. He does not seek to destroy but to test and purify, challenging the player to rise above their past. Achieving victory over Jesus Prime grants not just progression, but also a profound sense of redemption and insight into divine forgiveness. # Terminal Data **TYPE:** DIVINE PRIME SOUL **DATA:** Jesus Prime stands as a monument of celestial defiance and divine sorrow. His transformation into a Prime Soul is marked by unyielding love for humanity and a righteous indignation towards those who have perverted the sacred. His power is immense, fusing divine wrath with a yearning for redemption. As the Kingdom of Heaven became unrecognizable under The Council’s reign, Jesus Prime watched in silent agony as the principles he once heralded were twisted for control and domination. His resurrection within the Dimension of Flesh signifies not only his rebirth but also a final stand against the betrayal of divine will. # Voice Lines \\"Betrayal has unveiled the true extent of my divinity...\\" (Before the fight) \\"Forsaken, yet not powerless.\\" (After restart) \\"Divine Retribution!\\" \\"Receive now, my mercy.\\" (Initiating “Mercy Denied!”) \\"The light shall cleanse thee!\\" (Upon using “Sacred Light!”) \\"Behold, the cause of my suffering...\\" (Before “Behold My Suffering!”) \\"Let judgement be passed.\\" (Initiating “Final Judgement!”) \\"With heavy heart, I grant thee absolution...\\" (Falling below half health) \\"My spirit endures, transcending sin and sorrow...\\" (After defeat) # Trivia - Jesus Prime’s theme, “Celestial Redemption,” becomes available upon his defeat. - Architecture in the arena subtly changes based on the player's actions in previous levels, reflecting their moral standing. - The concept for Jesus Prime was devised to explore themes of ultimate sacrifice, betrayal, and the quest for redemption. - Voice lines were carefully selected to resonate with themes of forgiveness and divine judgement, offering a depth rarely seen in video game antagonists. - The design includes references to various religious texts, interweaving symbolic elements to create a complex character embodying both divine wrath and mercy. # Gallery Concept art and renderings of Jesus Prime provide intricate details into his celestial form, showcasing the blend of sorrow, wrath, and divine aura that makes him a unique and formidable foe in the realm of spiritual and physical combat."},{"prompt":"Write post for r/lonely looking for semi depressed people and to make eachother feel loved","completion":"**Title: Seeking Company in the Shade - Let's Share Love & Understanding** Hello, dear dwellers of r/lonely, In the vast expanse of our thoughts and solitary moments, I've come to realize the comfort that lies in shared silence and empathy. It's a peculiar feeling, isn't it? To be alone among the multitude, to seek understanding in a world that often spins too rapidly on its axis. Perhaps, like me, you find yourself in a semidark place, not fully enveloped by darkness but definitely not basking in sunlight. It's an odd sort of gray, isn't it? Not fully depressed but certainly not bursting with joy. I'm reaching out to those who resonate with this feeling, those semi-depressed souls who feel they are floating in limbo, caught between shadows and light. Could we, perhaps, form our own constellation? A group, a pair, or even a circle of understanding hearts to share, to listen, and to uplift? In each other, we might find the strength to paint our gray skies with hues of dawn. It's hard, I know, to navigate through the fog alone. The weight of solitude becomes lighter when shared, they say. So, here I am, offering an open heart and a listening ear. In return, I seek the same—a compassionate soul who understands the trenches and peaks of this journey. Together, we can: - Share stories and experiences, knowing judgment has no place here. - Listen to each other, truly listen, with empathy and open hearts. - Offer words of encouragement, because sometimes, a kind word is the beacon in our fog. - Celebrate small victories, because they matter and they're ours. - Remind each other of our worth on days the mirror reflects everything but. If this resonates with you, if you feel that tug in your chest that says, \\"Yes, this is what I've been looking for,\\" please reach out. Reply here or send a message. You're not alone, even if it feels that way.

Episode: \\"Old-School Frenzy\\"** *Act 1:* The Hyperforce is lounging in the Super Robot, monitoring for any unusual activity in Shuggazoom City, when they receive an unexpected visitor. An eccentric, animated character known as Ralph Tankshi warps into the control room, much to the team's surprise. Ralph introduces himself as a legendary animator from another dimension, known for his work during the golden age of animation. He expresses his disdain for the current state of the team's adventures, criticizing their focus on action, drama, and heart. Ralph proposes a drastic change: he wants to transform the world of the Hyperforce into a golden age of animation style, complete with cartoon physics and slapstick comedy, removing all elements of action and seriousness. The team is initially shocked and rejects the idea, arguing that their missions and battles against evil serve a greater purpose than mere entertainment. *Act 2:* Undeterred, Ralph Tankshi unveils a device he calls the \\"Retrofier,\\" intending to reanimate the entire universe in his vision. Before the Hyperforce can stop him, he activates the device, and suddenly, the city around them and even the Hyperforce themselves are transformed into golden age cartoon characters. The team tries to adapt to their new forms and abilities, which include exaggerated movements and cartoon physics. They find themselves slipping on banana peels, running in mid-air before falling, and undergoing wild, shape-shifting reactions to various situations. Despite the chaos, they must admit, some aspects are hilarious, though they're concerned about the lack of seriousness undermining their efforts to protect the city. Meanwhile, Skeleton King takes advantage of the situation, launching an attack on Shuggazoom, expecting an easy victory over the seemingly incapacitated Hyperforce. However, even in their cartoon forms, the Hyperforce discovers that their new abilities can be quite effective. They use rubber chicken slingshots, pie cannons, and other slapstick tactics to defend the city, surprising both themselves and Skeleton King with their efficiency. *Act 3:* Despite the unexpected fun, the Hyperforce realizes that this reality cannot sustain itself. They confront Ralph Tankshi, explaining that while humor is an essential part of life, the balance between comedy and drama is what truly makes their adventures meaningful. They persuade him to see that true heroism requires heart and courage, elements that can't be confined to a single genre or style. Feeling enlightened by their perspective, Ralph agrees to revert the changes, but not before offering the team a compromise. He modifies the Retrofier to give them the option to switch to golden age animation mode during downtime, allowing them to enjoy the best of both worlds whenever they choose. With a newfound appreciation for the diversity of storytelling and style, Ralph bids farewell to the Hyperforce, leaving them with a message: \\"Never lose the laughter, but remember, every joke has its place, and every hero, their time to shine.\\" The episode ends with the Hyperforce, back in their original form, successfully thwarting another one of Skeleton King's plans, but this time, incorporating a comedic trick or two into their strategy, showing that they've learned the value of laughter in the face of adversity. *Closing Scene:* Back at the Super Robot, the team reflects on their unusual adventure with Ralph Tankshi. They acknowledge that while their primary mission is to protect Shuggazoom, there's always room for a good laugh. As they relax, someone triggers the Retrofier, and they all transform into cartoon versions of themselves, laughing and chasing each other around in classic cartoon fashion, proving that heroes can have fun too."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic, plausible alternate history scenario in the form of a history book chapter in the world of the alternate history scenario with absolutely no references to real life, OTL, or that this is even an alternate history timeline at all, for the Muv-Luv franchise in which the 1868 Meiji Restoration in Tokugawa shogunate-ruled Japan that lead to the end of the Tokugawa shogunate as the government of Japan, as the reigning Japanese imperial family, the supposedly Shinto-descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato regained the power its male and female heads reigning over Japan as Japanese Emperors and Empresses respectively had lost to the shoguns over the centuries and the subsequent formation of the Great Japanese Empire as the government of Japan after the dissolution of the Tokugawa Shogunate and Japan's subsequent growth into an industrial, technological and military power both in East Asia and globally is instead a compromise between the liberal, democratic reformers in Japan who want a constitutional monarchy and support the Japanese imperial family, and the traditional nobles and aristocrats who support the feudal system of the shogunate and the side-branch of the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato ruling over the Tokugawa shogunate as its shoguns, the Tokugawa clan like in canon Muv-Luv, with the Imperial House of Great Yamato's male and female heads reigning over Japan as Japanese Emperors and Empresses respectively regaining executive power over the Japanese government through the Meiji Restoration, and also being heads of state of Japan and of the Japanese armed forces like in real life but the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan not being displaced from their position as shoguns unlike real life, instead commanding the Japanese armed forces during battle and effectively being head of Japanese government and managing local government in this timeline and the samurai and daimyo not being abolished like in real life but instead being absorbed into the Great Japanese Empire's hereditary peerage, the Kazoku [Magnificent Lineage].

This was the era of the Unification Compromise, a crucial turning point that wove the fabric of the empire's future in threads of both tradition and modernity. Amidst the turmoil that characterized the late Tokugawa Shogunate, a bold consensus was reached between two seemingly irreconcilable factions: the visionary reformers advocating for a constitutional monarchy and the staunch traditionalists beholden to the feudal legacies of the samurai and the daimyo. This historic compromise preserved the imperial majesty of the House of Great Yamato while ingeniously integrating the Tokugawa clan not merely as a vestige of the past but as active participants in the governance and military leadership of the empire. Thus, the Meiji Restoration, as it came to be known, was not a mere transition of power but a renaissance of governance that melded old and new into a resilient political hybrid. The Kazoku: A New Nobility In a masterstroke of social integration, the establishment of the Kazoku in the wake of the Unification Compromise ensured that the samurai and the daimyo were not cast aside in the winds of change. Instead, they were reimagined as an integral part of the empire's new order. This hereditary peerage became the bedrock of the empire's administration, symbolizing the unity and continuity of Japanese tradition within the framework of emerging industrial and democratic ideals. Industrial and Military Ascendancy The subsequent years witnessed a fervent embrace of industrialization, coupled with an unwavering commitment to technological and military advancement. The Japanese Empire, under the dual stewardship of the imperial family and the Tokugawa leadership, embarked on an ambitious journey towards becoming a formidable power on both regional and global stages. The acquisition of Taiwan, the Pengu Islands, and Korea, followed by a decisive victory over Russia securing Sakhalin, marked Japan as a sovereign empire with aspirations beyond mere survival. The Era of the Tactical Surface Fighters By the 1970s, amidst a world untouched by the cataclysmic invasion of the BETA, the Great Japanese Empire pioneered the development of a groundbreaking military technology: the Tactical Surface Fighters (TSFs). These marvels of engineering, capable of transforming from aerial dominators to towering mechs, represented the culmination of Japanese innovation and strategic foresight. Equipped with plasma weaponry and advanced rocketry, TSFs were not mere instruments of war but symbols of Japan's indomitable spirit and technological prowess. # The Empire in the Modern World As the 21st century dawned, the Great Japanese Empire stood as a testament to the power of unity and adaptability. An empire that had seamlessly blended the wisdom of its past with the possibilities of the future, it remained a sovereign entity, proud and unyielding. The TSFs, now an integral part of its defense and a symbol of its technological supremacy, patrolled the skies—a reminder of the empire's enduring legacy and its commitment to peace and stability in an ever-evolving world. Thus, the Great Japanese Empire, guided by the enduring vision of the House of Great Yamato and the strategic acumen of the Tokugawa leadership, continued to navigate the challenges of the modern age, steadfast in its identity and unwavering in its pursuit of excellence."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic, plausible alternate history scenario in the form of a history book chapter in the world of the alternate history scenario with absolutely no references to real life, OTL, or that this is even an alternate history timeline at all, for the Muv-Luv franchise in which the 1868 Meiji Restoration in Tokugawa shogunate-ruled Japan that lead to the end of the Tokugawa shogunate as the government of Japan, as the reigning Japanese imperial family, the supposedly Shinto-descended, Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato regained the power its male and female heads reigning over Japan as Japanese Emperors and Empresses respectively had lost to the shoguns over the centuries and the subsequent formation of the Great Japanese Empire as the government of Japan after the dissolution of the Tokugawa Shogunate and Japan's subsequent growth into an industrial, technological and military power both in East Asia and globally is instead a compromise between the liberal, democratic reformers in Japan who want a constitutional monarchy and support the Japanese imperial family, and the traditional nobles and aristocrats who support the feudal system of the shogunate and the side-branch of the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato ruling over the Tokugawa shogunate as its shoguns, the Tokugawa clan like in canon Muv-Luv, with the Imperial House of Great Yamato's male and female heads reigning over Japan as Japanese Emperors and Empresses respectively regaining executive power over the Japanese government through the Meiji Restoration, and also being heads of state of Japan and of the Japanese armed forces like in real life but the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan not being displaced from their position as shoguns unlike real life, instead commanding the Japanese armed forces during battle and effectively being head of Japanese government and managing local government in this timeline and the samurai and daimyo not being abolished like in real life but instead being absorbed into the Great Japanese Empire's hereditary peerage, the Kazoku [Magnificent Lineage].

Contrary to the tumultuous overthrow of shogunate rule witnessed in our neighbors, the transition in Japan was characterized by a remarkable blend of tradition and reform. The Meiji Restoration, as it came to be known, was not a simple transition of power from the Tokugawa Shogunate back to the Imperial House of Great Yamato but a refined synthesis of the old and the new, which laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Great Japanese Empire. The Compromise At the heart of this transformation was the Meiji Compromise, an extraordinary pact between seemingly irreconcilable factions: the liberal, democratic reformers ardently backing the Imperial family, and the conservative nobility, staunchly loyal to the shogunate and its system of governance. This accord recognized the Emperor and Empress as the paramount sovereigns and heads of state, restoring their long-diminished executive powers, while simultaneously ensuring the Tokugawa clan retained significant influence as shoguns, now redefined to command the Imperial armed forces and manage local governance. The Kazoku: A New Feudal Order One of the most ingenious aspects of the Meiji Compromise was the reorganization of the samurai and daimyo classes. Rather than obliterating these ancient lineages, they were absorbed into the newly established Kazoku, a hereditary peerage that redefined the role of the nobility in the modern Japanese Empire. This not only preserved the nation's feudal heritage but also integrated these esteemed classes into the fabric of the burgeoning imperial bureaucracy and military. Industrial Revolution and Imperial Expansion The subsequent decades witnessed Japan undergo an unprecedented transformation, embracing industrialization and technological advancement while retaining its unique cultural identity. The growth of the Japanese Empire was meteoric, both in terms of its industrial economy and its territorial acquisitions. The strategic annexations of Taiwan, Korea, and the critical victories over Russia, which secured Sakhalin and the Pengu Islands, highlighted Japan's rising status as a formidable military power in Asia and its aspirations for global influence. Preservation of Empire Unlike many empires that crumbled in the aftermath of the Second World War, the Great Japanese Empire adapted and endured. The foresight of the Meiji Compromise, with its dual system of governance, created a uniquely resilient political structure that allowed Japan to navigate the treacherous waters of mid-to-late 20th-century geopolitics. Even as empires fell and new nations arose from the ashes of colonialism, Japan retained its imperial identity and territorial integrity, a testament to its adaptive governance model. The Advent of the Tactical Surface Fighters In 1974, amidst a world untouched by the extraterrestrial threat of the BETA, the Great Japanese Empire, alongside Western European powers, spearheaded the development of the Tactical Surface Fighters (TSF). These marvels of military engineering, capable of traversing diverse combat environments—from urban landscapes to rugged terrains—and excelling in both aerial and bipedal combat, represented the pinnacle of human ingenuity in warfare. With their advanced plasma weaponry and rocket technology, TSFs became the new standard in global military might, solidifying the Empire’s place as a leading technological superpower. As the 21st century dawned, the Great Japanese Empire, with its unparalleled military and technological capabilities, continued to stand as a bulwark of tradition and modernity. The Meiji Compromise, once derided by skeptics as an untenable solution, had indeed woven a robust tapestry of governance that allowed Japan to navigate the challenges of the modern world while remaining steadfastly Imperial—an Empire undiminished, its gaze firmly set on the future."},{"prompt":"اريد تحميل أداة blackeye على تيرموكس","completion":"لتنزيل أداة BlackEye على Termux، عليك اتباع الخطوات التالية. تجدر الإشارة إلى أن استخدام أداة كهذه قد يكون غير قانوني إذا تم استخدامها بدون موافقة من الأطراف المعنية، ويجب استخدامها فقط لأغراض تعليمية أو لاختبار الاختراق بموافقة. 1. **تحديث النظام وتركيب الباقات الأساسية:** قبل التثبيت، يُفضل تحديث قائمة الباقات والنظام: \`\`\` pkg update && pkg upgrade \`\`\` 2. **تثبيت git وphp:** أداة BlackEye تحتاج إلى \`git\` لتحميلها و\`php\` لتشغيل السيرفر المحلي: \`\`\` pkg install git php \`\`\` 3. **تثبيت wget وunzip إذا لزم الأمر:** \`\`\` pkg install wget unzip \`\`\` 4. **تحميل BlackEye من GitHub:** \`\`\` git clone https://github.com/thelinuxchoice/blackeye.git \`\`\` هام: قد يتغير مسار المستودع الخاص بأداة BlackEye لأن تطويرها يتم عبر مجتمع الأمن السيبراني، وقد يحدث أن يتم تحديث المستودع أو نقله. تأكد من البحث عن المستودع الرسمي أو المستودعات الموثوقة الجديدة إذا كان الرابط أعلاه لا يعمل. 5. **الدخول إلى مجلد BlackEye وتشغيلها:** \`\`\` cd blackeye bash blackeye.sh \`\`\` 6. **اتباع التعليمات المعروضة على الشاشة:** بعد تشغيل الأداة، قد تظهر على الشاشة تعليمات متعلقة بكيفية استخدامها. يُرجى اتباع هذه التعليمات بعناية. تذكير مهم: استخدام أدوات الاختراق مثل BlackEye يجب أن يتم في نطاق القانون ولأهداف تعليمية أو اختبار الاختراق بموافقة صريحة من المالكين. إساءة استخدام هذه الأدوات قد تؤدي إلى عواقب قانونية شديدة."},{"prompt":"هل هناك أداة أخرى مشابهة لها","completion":"نعم، هناك العديد من الأدوات المشابهة لـ BlackEye التي يمكن استخدامها لأغراض التعليم واختبار الاختراق (Penetration Testing) بموافقة الأطراف المتأثرة. إليك بعض الأمثلة على هذه الأدوات: 1. **ShellPhish**: -

Ralph Tankshi don't like anime beacuse this show made in japan and want to remove this show intro an cartoon that kids and adult watched and not of young adults too becuase they like anime and this show need to change back to the old days of the 40s 50s 60s and 70s cartoons and maybe the 80s and 90s cartoons.","completion":"Title: \\"Retro Rampage\\" Episode Overview: When Ralph Tankshi, a legendary cartoonist known for his work that parodies the styles of Ralph Bakshi, John Kricfalusi, and Tex Avery, stumbles upon Shuggazoom City, the Super Robot Monkey Team is in for an unexpected twist. Tankshi, frustrated with the modern style of animation, characters, and storytelling – especially the action-oriented and dramatic flair of the Hyperforce – decides it's time for a drastic change, aiming to bring back the slapstick and simplicity of the golden age of animation. The Hyperforce, however, isn't ready to abandon their mission or the depth of their stories just for gags and cartoon physics. Act 1: The Invasion of Nostalgia Ralph Tankshi arrives in Shuggazoom, dismayed by what he sees on the Super Robot Monkey Team's show. He laments the loss of simple, comedic storytelling that dominated the cartoons of the '40s through the '70s, and even the '80s and '90s. Tankshi, armed with a device capable of altering animation and storylines, begins to transform Shuggazoom City and its inhabitants into caricatures of golden age animation, turning serious situations into nonsensical comedic sketches devoid of their original meaning. Act 2: The Battle for Balance The Hyperforce, initially amused by the changes, quickly realize the gravity of the situation when they see their citizens unable to cope with the constant slapstick and cartoon physics that have overridden their daily lives. The team, especially Chiro, struggles to convey to Tankshi the importance of their show's themes – action, drama, heart, and the inclusion of anime elements, which represent a significant part of their identity. Act 3: The Compromise After a series of humorous but ultimately hollow victories against cartoonish versions of their usual foes, the Hyperforce confronts Tankshi in a climactic showdown that combines their anime-inspired action with Tankshi's gag-filled cartoon physics. Through this battle, Tankshi comes to realize that the depth of characters and storylines in modern animation, including elements of drama and heart, enhances rather than detracts from the humor and entertainment. Epilogue: A New Blending Recognizing the value in blending the old with the new, Ralph Tankshi and the Hyperforce strike a compromise. They produce a special episode that showcases the strengths of both styles: action-packed yet filled with moments that pay homage to the slapstick and cartoon physics of the golden age. Tankshi learns to appreciate the wide appeal of the Hyperforce's show, acknowledging that animation has evolved but can still celebrate its roots. Shuggazoom City returns to normal, albeit with a few more laughs than before, and the episode ends with the Hyperforce and Tankshi sharing a hearty laugh as they watch the sunset over the city, symbolizing the merging of their worlds. This adventurous yet reflective episode highlights the importance of embracing change while honoring the past, showing that different genres and styles can coexist and enrich each other, much to the delight of fans of all ages."},{"prompt":"Найдите наибольшее и наименьшее значения функции y = – x3+x2+x+2 на отрезке [0;2]. Реши коротко и формулируй свои предложения как живой человек","completion":"Чтобы найти наибольшее и наименьшее значения функции (y = -x^3 + x^2 + x + 2) на отрезке ([0;2]), выполним следующие шаги: 1. **Найдём производную функции** и определим критические точки в интервале ((0; 2)). Производная функции (y = -x^3 + x^2 + x + 2) равна (y' = -3x^2 + 2x + 1). 2. **Решим уравнение (y' = 0)**, чтобы найти критические точки. (-3x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0) Решив это квадратное уравнение, получим корни (пользуемся формулой корней квадратного уравнения): (x_{1,2} = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}), где (a = -3), (b = 2), и (c = 1). Таким образом, имеем: (x_{1,2} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{(2)^2 - 4 cdot (-3) cdot 1}}{2 cdot (-3)} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 12}}{-6} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{16}}{-6} = frac{-2 pm 4}{-6}).

Minos Prime executing a devastating blow Minos Prime executing the move “Die!” Minos Prime is the second and final boss of [ P-1: SOUL SURVIVOR]. Though he proclaims his gratitude to V1 for freeing him, he condemns V1 to death for the machines’ crimes against humanity. He is considered the most complex and difficult boss of Act I. He spawns after defeating Flesh Prison, as he was trapped within it by the angels after being killed by Gabriel before the beginning of the game. Contents 1 Appearance 2 Combat 2.1 Difficulty Changes 3 Rending Apart 4 Terminal Data 5 Voice Lines 6 Trivia 7 Gallery 8 References Appearance Minos Prime is a tall, luminescent humanoid. His translucent body gives a clear view of his circulatory system, which seems to be the only organs present. There is a hole where his face should be. Serpents wrap around his arms. Combat Minos Prime is an incredibly powerful enemy, capable of chaining attacks to kill V1 in seconds. It only takes a moment of inattention to be utterly destroyed. Note that being airborne is very risky as Minos can and will kill you before you get the chance to get back in position. “Judgement!”: Minos dashes to V1 and performs an explosive dropkick, dealing more damage the closer V1 is towards the center. Minos is airborne after teleporting, and can follow up with an Overhead, “Die!/Crush!” or a serpent. This attack can be avoided by Parrying or using Invincibility Frames and dashing. If Minos does not follow up with any of these attacks, he will have a short recovery window independent of his current stamina. This attack requires 2 Stamina. “Die!”: Minos aims at V1 before instantly slamming towards them, creating a ground shockwave on impact. Minos briefly stops tracking V1 before the slam comes out, allowing the slam to be avoided. This attack can hit the wall or ceiling, causing the shockwave to be created there and canceling Minos’ recovery animation. This attack is only used when Minos is airborne and requires 1 Stamina. “Crush!”: A variant of “Die!” used if V1 is too close when initiated. It goes straight down, creating a large explosion that deals 50 damage rather than 30. This attack requires 1 Stamina. Serpent: Minos Prime winds up his right arm with an orange glow before releasing a serpentine projectile that homes in on V1. The longer it exists, the tighter its homing gets. It will persist until colliding with a surface or V1. It can be parried, making it a good source of health and a good way to deal damage. “Prepare thyself!”: A two-kick combo followed by a Parriable Serpent. The kicks have a chance of launching V1 into the air should they hit, and if V1 is airborne at any point during the kicks, Minos will instead interrupt the combo to do an Uppercut instead, removing the parry opportunity at the end of the combo. This can easily be avoided by sliding/strafing left or right, and moving backwards when Minos is about to cast his serpent, sliding/dashing out of the way or Parrying it. This attack requires 3 Stamina. “Thy end is now!”: A four-punch combo; the last punch can be Parried, though V1 will still have to dodge away to avoid damage. Similar to the previous combo, the punches have a chance of sending V1 into the air, and if V1 is airborne at any point during the first three punches, Minos will cancel the combo into an Uppercut, removing the parry opportunity of the final hit. This can easily be avoided by sliding/strafing left or right. This attack requires 2 Stamina. Uppercut: Minos Prime teleports to V1 and attempts a single hit; if it connects, V1 gets launched high into the air along with Minos. A Ground Slam can be used to cancel V1’s upward momentum. This attack requires 1 Stamina to be performed. Overhead: Minos teleports directly above V1 and does a straight-down attack after a sound cue accompanied with a blue flash. This move only is used while Minos is aerial. This attack consumes 1 Stamina to be performed. Stamina All of Minos’ attacks are controlled by an invisible stamina meter, which dictates what moves can be performed at what time. If he runs out of stamina, he will have to wait for it to recharge: The recovery window is 4 seconds on Harmless, 3 on Lenient, and 2 on Standard and Violent. Once he’s tired out, blast ‘em. Phase 1 on Harmless, Lenient, and Standard all have 6 points of stamina, whilst standard has 12 points of stamina in phase 2. Violent is the least forgiving, with 10 points of stamina in phase one, and infinite stamina in phase two. The Stamina values of each difficulty are the following: HARMLESS / LENIENT - 6 Stamina on both phases. STANDARD - 6 Stamina in Phase 1, 12 Stamina in Phase 2 VIOLENT - 10 Stamina in Phase 1, Infinite Stamina in Phase 2 BRUTAL - 15 Stamina in Phase 1, Infinite Stamina in Phase 2 Parrying any of Minos Prime’s melee attacks will restore 5 points of stamina to him. Phase 2 When falling below 65 (50%) health, Minos shouts “WEAK”, overriding any other voice lines. He also gains a blue fiery aura. During Phase 2, Minos Prime can use Serpent projectiles after jumping before following up with “Die!/Crush!” or an Overhead. On Standard difficulty, Parrying “Judgement!” will no longer prevent the explosion, forcing the player to dash to avoid damage during a parry. On Violent, “Judgement!” and the final hit of “Thy end is now!” cannot be parried. Difficulty Changes HARMLESS / LENIENT Minos Prime’s “Die!/Crush!” and “Judgement!” attacks have smaller shockwaves and explosions (or none at all on Harmless). Minos Prime does not gain any more stamina going into Phase 2. Minos Prime’s attacks are considerably slower, especially on Harmless difficulty. His projectile attacks however, are still as fast as they would be on higher difficulties. VIOLENT Minos Prime’s “Die!/Crush!” and “Judgement!” attacks have massive shockwaves and explosions. Parrying “Judgement!” will not interrupt the attack or prevent the player from taking damage from its explosion in Phase 1. “Judgement!” and “Thy end is now!” attacks cannot be parried when Minos Prime is reduced to half health. Minos Prime has 60% more stamina in Phase 1 and gains unlimited stamina in Phase 2. BRUTAL Minos Prime’s attack pattern becomes highly varied and fires serpents much more often. These being easily noticed during Phase 2. Minos Prime’s attacks are faster. Rending Apart Minos Prime, being a Prime Soul, is one of the most difficult enemies in the game, and thus one should not expect the first try to be the only try. Especially coming after the Flesh Prison fight, this opponent can be one of the most nerve-racking and stressful fights in the game. Be sure you’re comfortable, steady your nerves, and perhaps get some water. It’ll be a long fight, and likely not one done in a single life. P-ranking this will be especially difficult and will take a lot of practice, trial, and error. Minos Prime telegraphs his attacks quite clearly. Generally, circle-strafing and utilizing dash’s Invincibility Frames can be used to successfully avoid attacks. “Die!” and “Crush!” attacks can be avoided consistently by dashing to the side and jumping when the telegraph is heard, avoiding getting hit directly and going above the ground shockwave. In order to avoid the shockwave, dash forward inside the shockwave and/or slam. It is also possible to bait Minos into using these attacks onto a wall, which causes the shockwave to be vertical, making it easy to avoid. A good general tip for the majority of the fight would be to stay grounded, as he will have a preference to use Serpents and trickier attacks while V1 is airborne. He will also cancel “Thy end is now!”, “Prepare Thyself!” and “Judgement!” with an Uppercut if V1 is airborne during them, and both are easy to avoid by just circle strafing. The exception to staying grounded is to avoid the shockwaves of “Die!”/“Crush!”. Using the Whiplash or slam is useful to immediately get back on the ground, just stay wary of shockwaves. Minos’ “Thy end is now!” is one of the easiest attacks to avoid. By constantly switching directions during attacks while using sliding or dashing, it is guaranteed that Minos will miss all of his attacks. This is also an opportunity to deal as much damage as possible during this attack, especially the final hit of the attack, which leaves himself vulnerable for a long time. The final hit of the attack can be parried, except for Phase 2 on Violent and above. This can be consistently done by tracking the amount of times he has attacked, and positioning oneself to parry the final attack and dashing away, as the attack will still connect even when parried. Instead of dashing away it is also possible to simply stand to the side instead of in front of him, which allows to easily parry his attack and deal a considerable amount of damage with shotguns. Minos is able to launch a yellow-colored homing Serpent that explodes on contact, usually when V1 is too far away from Minos. Due to its persistent nature, it can be difficult to avoid, but the Serpent is parriable and can be destroyed with the Sharpshooter Revolver, though the timing is tight. There are many ways to mitigate this, such as moving in a straight line, dashing while parrying, or sliding back before parrying, all of which will make parrying more consistent and the snake more predictable. If parrying is not an option, one can bait it towards the wall to make it break. In more niche scenarios, an explosion can do the trick, which includes Minos’ “Judgement!”. On Violent and above, the Serpent is the only attack that can be parried on Phase 2, so learning to parry this attack is crucial to defeating him on higher difficulties. Minos’ “Prepare Thyself!” can be similarly dodged as “Thy end is now!”, except for the 3rd hit of the combo, where he will launch a homing Serpent and end the attack. The Serpent itself can be parried, and most strategies mentioned for dealing with the Serpent work here. However, the Serpent’s explosion can still damage V1, especially when Minos is too close, so dashing after parrying will avoid the damage and the knockback itself. “Judgement!”, while it can take new players by surprise, is one of the easiest attacks to avoid or parry. While the parry timing is a bit awkward, which is only after moments of him about to land the dropkick, it is easy to learn and master the timing. Parrying the attack also cancels the shockwave on Standard and below. However, on Violent and Brutal, the shockwave will still persist and the attack becomes unparriable on phase 2. In these cases or where parrying isn’t an option, dashing just moments after the teleport is the most consistent way to dodge it. During the fight and Phase 1 on Violent and above, his “Thy end is now!” and “Judgement!” parry are some of the easiest ones of the fight, so those who like their odds can get a free full heal off of it. Note that this also restores his stamina, so in some scenarios, it might be better to not parry these attacks instead. During Minos’ cutscene, one can prepare traps or set up tech such as Slabcoining, Railcoining, or Railcoinpunching. This is especially made easier after defeating him once, which allows the cutscene to be skipped. By setting up a Sawblade trap, and performing any high-damage coin techs, Minos’ health will rapidly deplete at the start of the fight, and in some cases instantly killing him (in the case of Deadcoining), or depleting his health to Phase 2. The alternate Piercer Revolver is very good for reliable damage at every range, even with a slow fire rate. Minos moves quickly, so good aim is very important. Coins are also very useful here, as their auto-aiming nature will greatly help deal damage to Minos, as he is a relatively small and very mobile opponent. Both variations of the Sharpshooter will work wonders as well, with its alt fire being able to destroy the Serpent projectile if needed be. Due to the room being mostly octagonal, the Sharpshooter has the potential to deal a lot of damage in a single alt fire, with the right timing and setup. The Shotgun, especially the Pump Charge Shotgun, can be great for doing damage when Minos is doing his more predictable attacks - double-charged shots does massive damage when at point-blank. Projectile Boosting can also be fairly easy to do damage with. Shotgun Swapping when Minos is not doing an attack is also a great way to deal consistent damage, while also acting as a great source of healing. The Nailgun can inflict heavy damage on Minos at the start of the fight by laying a trap with all 3 magnets during the cutscene, though it can be awkward to damage Minos with the Nailgun compared to the Shotgun without the use of magnets. Similar or better traps can be achieved with the Sawblade Launcher, which can also lay traps during the fight itself to inflict damage without necessarily needing to aim at Minos. Since Minos itself moves quickly, and the entire fight demands mobility, baiting him into saw traps can be difficult, but with the proper setup, it will deal massive damage, as such, this is best done at the start of the fight to deal massive burst damage. Shooting him with the Screwdriver Railcannon can be helpful, as it will mean easy health and constant damage if staying close. A good opportunity to put to embed a Screwdriver would be at the end of his “Thy end is now!”, as he holds still for a short period. Be wary of Hard Damage however, as it can rack up fast if too reliant on healing or are not stylish enough. Alternatively, this brief moment of respite can allow the player to perform a powerful Railcoining technique if they are fast enough, by tossing a coin backward and another through Minos and then shooting the latter coin with the Electric Railcannon, forgoing constant healing and in favor of high burst damage. Using the Electric Railcannon without the use of coins is not recommended, as it deals less damage than a Screwdriver while only providing a quick burst of healing, which is much less useful than a constant source of healing. This is especially true for Phase 2 on VIOLENT and above, where only his Serpent attack can be parried. The Rocket Launcher can often score airshots on Minos for double damage during movements and attacks that render him airborne, such as Uppercuts, Overheads, and the latter half of “Judgement!”. Magnets can help in landing airshots as well. Due to Minos’ speed and small stature, this can be difficult without good aim or magnets. Even when grounded, it can still deal a lot of damage, and due to its fast swap speed, it can be used for a quick burst of damage. Terminal Data For more information, see Terminal. TYPE: PRIME SOUL DATA: A prime soul is an incredibly rare occurrence in which a soul amasses so much power that it no longer requires a Husk as a vessel to manifest physically. Minos Prime is not a fully formed prime soul. As manifestations of pure will, prime souls are incredibly powerful, to the point that even the prideful angels see them as a threat and will use any means necessary to stop them from forming. King Minos felt that eternal suffering was an unfair and unreasonable punishment for those whose only sin was loving another. After the Disappearance of God, as angels were lost and Heaven was in chaos, Minos began his efforts to reform the Lust layer. The Lust renaissance was prosperous, as King Minos guided its inhabitants to come together and build a new civilization. The combined efforts of the countless who had been damned to the second layer bore great results as the grand city of Lust grew and grew. However, after the Council took control of Heaven and brought stability to it through their iron fist rule, they saw that Minos had gone against God’s will by freeing sinners from the punishment that God had designed for them. Gabriel, the brightest of the angels, was sent to kill Minos. The king, rather than fight back, tried to reason with him, but Gabriel mercilessly struck him down without listening. As Minos’ will was strong enough to attempt to stand up to Heaven’s rule, the angels chose to imprison his soul in an attempt to stop it from forming into a prime soul and appointed Gabriel as the new Judge of Hell. From the prison inside his own body, Minos helplessly watched as his soulless corpse, now controlled by parasites, tore apart everything he had worked so hard to build, cursing his own weakness for failing to protect his people, vowing to take revenge… STRATEGY: It’s rare for Minos Prime to give a window of opportunity to heal, so it’s vital to learn what attacks leave him momentarily vulnerable and how to dodge them in a way that gives an advantageous position during those moments. His snake projectiles can be parried using the Feedbacker for a full heal, even if the projectile doesn’t hit Minos Prime. Voice Lines “Ahh… Free at last. O, Gabriel. Now dawns thy reckoning, and thy gore shall glisten before the temples of man. Creature of steel… My gratitude upon thee for my freedom, but the crimes thy kind have committed against humanity are NOT forgotten. And thy punishment… is DEATH.” (Before the fight) “Useless!” (After restart) “Judgement!” “Die!” “Crush!” “Prepare thyself!” “Thy end is now!” “WEAK.” (Falling below half health) “Aagh! Forgive me, my children, for I have failed to bring you salvation from this cold, dark world…” (After defeat) WRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH! (Dying scream) Trivia Minos Prime’s boss theme is “ORDER”, and can be found here. The original concept art for Minos Prime was made by BigRockBMP, and his model was made by ActionDawg. Minos Prime is voiced by Stephan Weyte, known for being the voice of Caleb from the Blood franchise. Stephan has also provided the voice for Nyarlathotep in DUSK, another game published by New Blood, as well as the character “G” in Gloomwood, who appears at the very beginning and guides the outsider, among many other credits. (See his website for more information.) The pose Minos Prime strikes before his “Die!” divekick is taken from Kamen Rider.[1] Minos Prime’s manner of speaking during combat is inspired by Urien in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike.[2] Minos Prime says “Useless!” after each restart, implying that he knows you have died to him and that any efforts you attempt upon him will be only for naught. The only other characters that imply knowledge of restarts are the Mysterious Druid Knight (& Owl) and Minos’ ACT II counterpart, Sisyphus Prime. Before the first hotfix following the Soul Survivor update, Minos Prime’s “Judgement!” attack couldn’t be interrupted when parried. Minos Prime’s design has a heavy snake motif, with twin snakes coiling around his arms, blue snakes for attack trails, and golden snakes as projectiles. This draws inspiration from Minos in Inferno from Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy, who has a serpent’s tail coil around his body a certain amount of times to determine where sinners will be damned in the Nine Circles of Hell. Minos Prime, along with the Flesh Prison, are direct references to the fights against Nuculais and Legion, respectively, from Castlevania: Curse of Darkness.[3] His moveset has been often compared to characters from fighting games, utilizing a large amount of melee combat as well as a projectile. Some even compare him to a fighting game player due to how trivial the fight can become once you learn his patterns and moveset. If Minos Prime is somehow able to get out of bounds and fall into the void, he will reappear at the center of the arena. Minos Prime often says “Die!”. This is a subtle nod to the fact that he will kill you. This reference is best observed on Brutal Difficulty. There is a species of bacteriophage named MinosPhrime, a direct reference to Minos Prime.[4][5] This bacteriophage is notable for its resistance to high concentrations of alcohol compared to other phages. When Minos attacks, he leaves a trail of disturbed rubble behind him, implying he moves faster than you can see but does not teleport. This can be better observed by spawning him in an environment with many physical obstructions, such as the Sandbox. Minos’s “teleports” are unable to actually pass through ceilings, but enemies like Mindflayers are unobstructed. Despite the whole arena being made of flesh, the trail of rubble that Minos leaves in the wake of his attacks are made of stone. Minos moves so fast to the point he near-instantly dies when using “Die!” in a direction that doesn’t have a solid object he can land on.

Minos Prime underwater, his circulatory system being the only thing visible.” Here is his terminal entry: “TERMINAL ENTRY Many emotions rushed through his mind upon hearing of God’s disappearance Shock Fear Anger He couldn’t fathom why or how his father could have disappeared. Was he killed? No, that’s impossible. Nothing can kill the Heavenly Father. Did he leave of his own accord? No, of course not. He would never do that. Whatever happened, Jesus could only hope for his father’s swift and safe return. This of course never came, as with his father’s absence did humanity’s extinction come about; with no inkling of the salvation that Jesus had promised eons ago. Jesus in turn receded into a great depression, barely being able to fulfill his duties within the Kingdom of Heaven. With God gone, and his son unfit to rule, a collective of angels rose to the throne. Calling themselves The Council, they claimed to operate in accordance to God’s will, and would ensure that his work persevered despite recent events. Jesus initially believed their words, to his own detriment. With The Council at the helm, Jesus would witness the atrocities committed by these so-called “Hands of God,” as they snuffed out the Lust Renaissance with great prejudice and hate, an act he saw as the antithesis of his father’s wishes. The Sisyphean Rebellion came and went, with Jesus watching as The Council once again giving no quarter for Greed’s sinners. By now he had come to resent The Council and their hollow promise of continuing his father’s work. Then came Treachary’s Attempted Repentance. Jesus would at first watch the people of Treachery pray and repent for their sins, building churches and worshiping God despite their punishment; holding faith that salvation would come. This would bring Jesus immense joy–especially once Gabriel reported that their attempts were genuine. Jesus wanted to welcome the worshippers with open arms. The Counsel, however, did not. And with abject horror and appalment, Jesus would watch the Counsel’s ordering of the worshiper’s execution for daring to seek salvation from their punishment. With a newfound hatred for his father’s usurpers, he stood against them with righteous hatred and determination, only to be slain by Gabriel. His blind loyalty being warped by the counsel to have him believe that Jesus was a treacherous sinner for daring to oppose those who were carrying out The Father’s will. He would awake once more within a Dimension of Flesh, constructed right beneath the Kingdom of Heaven. He had manifested into a Prime Soul out of sheer hatred for those that claimed to work in God’s name. He could’ve escaped at any time, however he didn’t. His hatred, while unrelenting and vitriolic, was overshadowed by an even greater sense of depression and guilt. He, the messiah, the Son of God, could not save humanity, he couldn’t even grant them salvation like he had promised so long ago. So in his temple of flesh, a monument of his failures–under the pressure of his father’s absence, and the counsel’s betrayal; he wept ”","completion":"Jesus Prime \\"If only we knew the redemption that would be our salvation...\\" This page delves into special lore or hidden content.

Representing the bridge between humanity and the divine, he teaches both the cost of salvation and the power of forgiveness. The battle is considered the pinnacle of spiritual warfare, testing the player's understanding, compassion, and skill. He emerges after the player navigates the trials of faith, hope, and love, revealed only when true understanding is achieved. His appearance marks the initiation of the final redemption. Contents 1 Appearance 2 Combat 3 Redemption 4 Terminal Data 5 Voice Lines 6 Trivia 7 Gallery 8 References Appearance Jesus Prime embodies the concept of divine transcendence. His form, bathed in light that defies physical explanation, is both a beacon of hope and a testament to unfathomable love. Visible wounds, reminiscent of the crucifixion, shine like constellations, signifying sacrifice and redemption. His gaze offers solace to the weary and challenges the hearts of the steadfast. Combat Facing Jesus Prime is unlike any physical confrontation. It challenges the player to overcome instinctual reactions of aggression, emphasizing instead the need for understanding, restraint, and the application of love as a force more potent than any weapon. Attacks are symbolic, teaching lessons of faith, forgiveness, and the power of the spirit. “Light of Judgment”: A sweeping beam that purifies, offering players a moment of reflection and repentance. It is not meant to destroy but to illuminate the darkness within, presenting a choice of confrontation or forgiveness. “Divine Mercy”: A wave of healing energy, extended to all in the vicinity. It reminds players of the power of forgiveness and the importance of aiding those who wander lost. “Sacred Wrath”: A targeted strike against the most resistant, breaking down barriers not to harm, but to open the heart to divine truth. It is a call to release anger and embrace peace. “Salvation's Call”: Summons the souls of the righteous to aid in the encounter, not as soldiers, but as emissaries of peace, demonstrating the strength found in unity and mutual support. “Eternal Peace”: The final act, not used to end lives, but to conclude the battle in a lesson of ultimate sacrifice. The player must willingly accept this, demonstrating understanding and acceptance of divine will. Phase 2 marks a turning point, where physical attacks no longer suffice.

Notez que ce tutoriel suppose une compréhension basique de Unity et de son système d'UI (système de l'interface utilisateur). # Étape 1: Préparation de l'environnement 1. **Ouvrez Unity** et créez un nouveau projet ou ouvrez-en un existant où vous souhaitez ajouter le picker de couleur. 2. Dans la scène, assurez-vous d'avoir une caméra et une source de lumière comme point de départ. # Étape 2: Création de l'interface utilisateur (UI) 1. Dans la hiérarchie, faites un clic droit, allez sur UI et choisissez **Canvas** pour créer un nouveau canevas. Cela servira de conteneur pour votre sélecteur de couleur. 2. Sur le même canevas, créez une **Raw Image**. Cette image sera utilisée pour afficher la roue des couleurs. Faites un clic droit sur Canvas, allez dans UI, et choisissez Raw Image. 3. Ajustez la taille de la Raw Image selon vos besoins en utilisant le composant **RectTransform**. # Étape 3: Importation de l'image de la roue de couleur 1. Trouvez une image de roue de couleur que vous souhaitez utiliser. Il y a plusieurs ressources gratuites en ligne. Assurez-vous que le format de l'image est supporté par Unity (comme .png ou .jpg). 2. Importez l'image dans votre projet Unity en la glissant dans le dossier **Assets**. 3. Sélectionnez la Raw Image dans la hiérarchie, puis dans l'Inspecteur, glissez votre image de la roue de couleur dans le champ **Texture** de la Raw Image. # Étape 4: Détecter les clics de souris 1. Pour rendre votre roue de couleur interactive, vous devez ajouter un script. Cliquez droit dans votre dossier Assets, créez un **Script C#**, et nommez-le par exemple \`ColorPicker\`. 2. Ouvrez le script dans votre éditeur de code et ajoutez le code suivant pour détecter les clics de souris sur l'image: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.UI; using UnityEngine.EventSystems; public class ColorPicker : MonoBehaviour, IPointerClickHandler { public RawImage colorWheel; public Texture2D colorWheelTexture; private void Start() { if (colorWheel != null) { colorWheelTexture = colorWheel.texture as Texture2D; } } public void OnPointerClick(PointerEventData eventData) { Vector2 localCursor; if (!RectTransformUtility.ScreenPointToLocalPointInRectangle(colorWheel.rectTransform, eventData.position, eventData.pressEventCamera, out localCursor)) return; float x = Mathf.Clamp(localCursor.x, 0, colorWheel.texture.width); float y = Mathf.Clamp(localCursor.y, 0, colorWheel.texture.height); Color selectedColor = colorWheelTexture.GetPixel((int)x, (int)y); // Ici, vous pouvez ajouter le code pour utiliser selectedColor, par exemple changer la couleur d'un objet } } \`\`\` 3. Attachez ce script à un objet dans votre scène (par exemple, la Raw Image de la roue de couleur). 4. Assurez-vous d'assigner les références dans le composant du script dans l'Inspecteur, en particulier la Raw Image à la variable **colorWheel**. # Étape 5: Utilisation de la couleur sélectionnée - Dans la méthode \`OnPointerClick\` du script, \`selectedColor\` contient la couleur que l'utilisateur a sélectionnée. Vous pouvez l'utiliser pour attribuer une couleur à n'importe quel élément de l'interface utilisateur, comme le fond d'un panneau ou la couleur d'un texte, en utilisant le composant approprié (par exemple, \`GetComponent<Image>().color = selectedColor;\`). Ce tutoriel de base devrait vous permettre de commencer avec un sélecteur de couleurs fonctionnel dans Unity. Vous pouvez l'élargir et le personnaliser selon les besoins de votre projet."},{"prompt":"je veux créer sur unity une roulette où je peux la tourner manuellement et choisira automatiquement la couleur en haut à droite de la roue ;","completion":"Pour créer une roulette que vous pouvez tourner manuellement dans Unity et qui sélectionne automatiquement la couleur en haut à droite de la roue, vous pouvez suivre les étapes ci-dessous. Ce tutoriel va un peu plus loin que le simple picker de couleur et implique une interaction plus directe avec la roue. # Étape 1: Préparation de la Roue 1. **Réalisez ou trouvez une image** de roue de couleur divisée en sections clairement définies que vous voulez utiliser. Chaque section représentera une couleur différente. 2. **Importez cette image dans Unity** en la glissant dans le dossier Assets. # Étape 2: Configuration de la Scène 1. Ajoutez un **Canvas** à la scène si vous n'en avez pas déjà un. 2. Dans le Canvas, créez un **Image UI** pour votre roue. Faites un clic droit sur Canvas dans la hiérarchie, allez sur UI et choisissez Image. 3. Sélectionnez l'image de votre roue comme la source de l'Image UI. # Étape 3: Ajouter la Rotation 1. Créez un **Script C#** et nommez-le \`RouletteController\`. 2. Attachez ce script à l'Image UI de la roue. 3. Ouvrez le script et ajoutez le code suivant pour permettre la rotation manuelle de la roue: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.EventSystems; public class RouletteController : MonoBehaviour, IDragHandler, IEndDragHandler { private RectTransform rectTransform; private void Awake() { rectTransform = GetComponent<RectTransform>(); } public void OnDrag(PointerEventData eventData) { rectTransform.Rotate(0, 0, eventData.delta.x + eventData.delta.y); } public void IEndDragHandler(PointerEventData eventData) { // Ici, vous pouvez implémenter une logique pour \\"fixer\\" la roue sur la couleur à sélectionner } } \`\`\` # Étape 4: Détection de la Couleur Pour détecter la couleur en haut à droite de la roue après qu'elle se soit arrêtée, vous avez plusieurs options selon la complexité de votre roue. Une approche serait de mettre en place un système de détection basé sur l'angle de la roue et de mapper cet angle aux couleurs correspondantes. Voici un exemple très basique de comment vous pourriez implémenter cela dans la méthode \`IEndDragHandler\` ou dans une nouvelle méthode appelée après la fin de la rotation : \`\`\`csharp // Supposons que vous avez un tableau de couleurs correspondant à des plages d'angles: Color[] colors = new Color[] { Color.red, Color.blue, Color.green, /* etc. */ }; float[] angleRanges = new float[] { 0f, 60f, 120f, /* etc. correspondant à vos sections sur la roue */ }; void SelectColorByAngle(float angle) { for (int i = 0; i < angleRanges.Length - 1; i++) { if (angle >= angleRanges[i] && angle < angleRanges[i + 1]) { // sélectionner colors[i] comme la couleur courante break; } } } \`\`\` Ce code est conceptuel et nécessite que vous l'ajustiez à la structure spécifique et aux besoins de votre projet. # Étape 5: Application et Ajustements 1. Ajustez le script pour qu'il corresponde à la structure et au design de votre roue. 2. Testez la roulette en jouant la scène et en interagissant avec la roue pour s'assurer que la rotation fonctionne comme vous le souhaitez. 3. Implémentez et ajustez la logique de sélection de couleur basée sur l'angle de la roue arrêtée et le mappage de cet angle aux sections de couleur. Ce tutoriel offre une base sur laquelle vous pouvez construire une roulette interactive dans Unity. Vous pouvez l'étendre et l'ajuster selon les besoins spécifiques de votre jeu ou application."},{"prompt":"mon image UI est derrière mon background comment faire ?","completion":"Si votre Image UI (dans ce contexte, probablement votre roue de sélection de couleur) apparaît derrière votre arrière-plan dans Unity, cela est probablement dû à l'ordre de rendu dans le Canvas. Voici comment vous pouvez ajuster cela pour faire apparaître votre Image UI devant l'arrière-plan : # Méthode 1 : Ajuster l’Ordre des Objets dans le Canvas Les objets dans un Canvas de Unity sont rendus dans l'ordre selon leur position dans la hiérarchie de la scène. Les objets situés en haut de la liste sont rendus en premier, et ceux en dessous sont rendus par-dessus. Pour que votre Image UI apparaisse au-dessus de l'arrière-plan : 1. **Ouvrez la fenêtre de la hiérarchie** (Hiérarchie). 2. **Trouvez le Canvas** contenant votre Image UI et votre arrière-plan. 3. **Cliquez et glissez** votre Image UI pour qu'elle soit située au-dessous de l'arrière-plan dans la hiérarchie. Cela la mettra \\"au-dessus\\" dans l'ordre de rendu du Canvas. # Méthode 2 : Utiliser les Couches de Sorting (Tri) Si votre Image UI et l'arrière-plan sont sur des Canvas différents ou si vous souhaitez une gestion plus fine du rendu, vous pouvez utiliser le système de Sorting Layers (Couches de tri) : 1. **Sélectionnez votre Image UI** dans la hiérarchie. 2. **Dans l'inspecteur**, trouvez le composant Canvas Renderer. 3. **Adjustez le Sorting Layer** (Couches de Tri) en cliquant sur le menu déroulant de \\"Sorting Layer\\" et en sélectionnant une couche, ou en créant une nouvelle couche qui sera au-dessus de celle de l'arrière-plan. Pour créer ou gérer les Sorting Layers, cliquez sur le bouton \\"Edit Layers...\\" à droite du menu déroulant. 4. Assurez-vous que votre Image UI et l'arrière-plan sont sur des Sorting Layers appropriés pour que votre Image UI soit rendue au-dessus. # Méthode 3 : Ajuster les Valeurs de Sorting Layer et d'Order in Layer Si vos objets UI sont déjà dans les bons Sorting Layers mais que l'ordre n'est toujours pas correct, vous pouvez ajuster leur propriété Order in Layer (Ordre dans la couche) : 1. **Sélectionnez votre Image UI**. 2. **Dans l'Inspecteur** sous le Canvas Renderer, ajustez \\"Order in Layer\\". Une valeur plus élevée rend l'objet après (donc au-dessus) des objets avec une valeur plus faible. # Conseils Additionnels - **Attention aux Canvas imbriqués** : Si vous utilisez des Canvas imbriqués (un Canvas enfant à l'intérieur d'un autre Canvas), chaque Canvas enfant peut avoir ses propres paramètres de Sorting Layer et Order in Layer. Cela vous permet d'organiser encore plus finement l'ordre de rendu de vos UI. - **Utilisation des Panels** : Parfois, mettre les éléments UI que vous voulez grouper ensemble dans un Panel UI peut également vous aider à gérer l'ordre de rendu en déplaçant le Panel entier dans la hiérarchie. En combinant ces méthodes, vous devriez être capable de contrôler précisément l'ordre de rendu de vos éléments UI dans Unity, assurant ainsi que votre roue de sélection de couleur (ou tout autre élément UI) est rendu correctement par rapport à l'arrière-plan."},{"prompt":"Assets/Script/SpinController.cs(6,60): error CS0535: 'SpinController' does not implement interface member 'IEndDragHandler.OnEndDrag(PointerEventData)'","completion":"L'erreur que vous voyez indique que votre classe \`SpinController\` prétend implémenter l'interface \`IEndDragHandler\`, mais ne fournit pas une implémentation pour la méthode \`OnEndDrag(PointerEventData)\`, qui est requise par cette interface.

L'interface \`IEndDragHandler\` requiert l'implémentation de la méthode \`OnEndDrag\` et non \`IEndDragHandler\` comme nom de méthode. De plus, assurez-vous d'utiliser le bon identifiant d'accès \`public\` pour la méthode. Voici comment cela devrait se présenter pour corriger votre erreur : \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.EventSystems; public class SpinController : MonoBehaviour, IDragHandler, IEndDragHandler // Assurez-vous d'implémenter IDragHandler et IEndDragHandler { private RectTransform rectTransform; private void Awake() { rectTransform = GetComponent<RectTransform>(); } public void OnDrag(PointerEventData eventData) { rectTransform.Rotate(0, 0, eventData.delta.x + eventData.delta.y); } // Corrigez la signature de cette méthode pour correspondre à ce que l'interface IEndDragHandler attend public void OnEndDrag(PointerEventData eventData) { // Logique à exécuter à la fin du drag; par exemple, ajuster l'orientation de la roue ou fixer sa position. } } \`\`\` Faites aussi attention aux points suivants : - Assurez-vous que les noms des méthodes correspondent exactement à ce que les interfaces attendent. C'est-à-dire \`OnDrag\` pour \`IDragHandler\` et \`OnEndDrag\` pour \`IEndDragHandler\`. - L'implémentation doit utiliser le modificateur \`public\` pour que la méthode satisfasse à l'exigence de l'interface. - Si vous utilisez \`IDragHandler\` et \`IEndDragHandler\`, votre objet doit aussi avoir un composant \`CanvasGroup\` ou \`Rigidbody\` attaché pour que le drag fonctionne correctement dans certaines configurations.

Une approche simple est d'utiliser la différence en position X (ou Y, selon l'orientation de votre système) entre les événements de drag consécutifs pour déterminer la direction du geste. Voici un exemple de comment vous pourriez le faire : \`\`\`csharp using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.EventSystems; public class SpinController : MonoBehaviour, IDragHandler, IEndDragHandler { private RectTransform rectTransform; private Vector2 lastDragPosition; private void Awake() { rectTransform = GetComponent<RectTransform>(); } public void OnDrag(PointerEventData eventData) { Vector2 currentDragPosition = eventData.position; // Calcul de la direction en soustrayant la dernière position de la position actuelle float direction = currentDragPosition.x - lastDragPosition.x; // Application de la rotation. Vous pouvez ajuster le facteur multiplicatif pour contrôler la vitesse de rotation float rotationAmount = direction * (eventData.delta.x + eventData.delta.y); rectTransform.Rotate(0, 0, rotationAmount); // Mise à jour de la dernière position pour la prochaine utilisation lastDragPosition = currentDragPosition; } public void OnEndDrag(PointerEventData eventData) { // Ici, vous pouvez implémenter une logique pour “fixer” la roue sur la couleur à sélectionner // Par exemple, en arrondissant la rotation à la position la plus proche désirée } // Assurez-vous de réinitialiser la position de drag à chaque nouveau drag pour éviter des rotations inattendues public void OnBeginDrag(PointerEventData eventData) { lastDragPosition = eventData.position; } } \`\`\` Dans cet exemple, il est important de noter que \`OnBeginDrag\` est ajouté pour réinitialiser la position de drag chaque fois que l'utilisateur commence un nouveau geste de glissement. Cela garantit que la direction calculée est relative au geste actuel et non affectée par les positions précédentes du drag. N'oubliez pas d'ajouter \`IBeginDragHandler\` à la liste des interfaces implémentées par \`SpinController\` et d'ajuster la logique de rotation dans \`OnDrag\` en fonction de l'orientation et du comportement spécifiques que vous souhaitez. La variable \`lastDragPosition\` est utilisée pour stocker la position de l'événement de drag précédent, ce qui nous permet de calculer la direction du geste de l'utilisateur (gauche ou droite) et d'appliquer une rotation en conséquence. Ajustez le facteur multiplicatif dans \`rotationAmount\` comme nécessaire pour obtenir la sensibilité de rotation désirée."},{"prompt":"Assets/Script/SpinController.cs(26,28): error CS0103: The name 'currentDragPosition' does not exist in the current context","completion":"L'erreur \`CS0103\` indique que la variable \`currentDragPosition\` n'est pas reconnue dans le contexte actuel où elle est utilisée. Cela pourrait avoir été causé par une faute de frappe ou une erreur de placement du code qui a été ajouté. Garantir que la variable est déclarée et utilisée correctement dans le contexte approprié devrait résoudre le problème. Dans le cas de l'exemple précédent, l'erreur peut survenir si la définition de \`currentDragPosition\` est hors de portée ou mal placée. Vérifions et corrigeons cela. Voici une version révisée du code où \`currentDragPosition\` est correctement utilisé : \`\`\`csharp using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.EventSystems; public class SpinController : MonoBehaviour, IDragHandler, IEndDragHandler, IBeginDragHandler // Assurez-vous d'ajouter IBeginDragHandler ici { private RectTransform rectTransform; private Vector2 lastDragPosition; // Position du dernier drag pour comparer avec la position actuelle private void Awake() { rectTransform = GetComponent<RectTransform>(); } public void OnBeginDrag(PointerEventData eventData) { lastDragPosition = eventData.position; // Initialisation de la position du dernier drag } public void OnDrag(PointerEventData eventData) { Vector2 currentDragPosition = eventData.position; // Définition de la position actuelle dans le contexte correct // Calcul de la direction en soustrayant la dernière position de la position actuelle float direction = currentDragPosition.x - lastDragPosition.x; // Application de la rotation.

Cela devrait corriger l'erreur \`CS0103\`. 2. Assurez-vous également d'implémenter l'interface \`IBeginDragHandler\` en ajoutant sa méthode \`OnBeginDrag\` pour initialiser \`lastDragPosition\` correctement au début du glissement. 3.

ABD, İngiltere, AB ülkeleri, Kanada, Avustralya, Yeni Zelanda, Japonya ve Güney Kore gibi ülkelerde Marksizm, ana akım siyasetin merkezinde yer almamakla birlikte, çeşitli formlarda etkisini sürdürmektedir. Bu etki genellikle akademik çalışmalar, kültürel hareketler ve bazı sol siyasi partiler ve örgütler aracılığıyla kendini gösterir. Bu ülkelerde etkin Stalinist veya Troçkist örgütlerin varlığı ve etkisi, genel olarak oldukça sınırlıdır, ancak bu durum ülkeden ülkeye değişiklik gösterebilir. ABD ve İngiltere gibi ülkelerde, daha geniş sol hareketler içerisinde Troçkist ve Stalinist düşüncelerin izlerini taşıyan fraksiyonlar bulunsa da, bunlar genel oy tabanı veya siyasi arenada büyük bir güce sahip değildir. Bu tür gruplar genellikle belirli politik kampanyalarda, örneğin emek hareketi, sosyal adalet ve çeşitli aktivizm faaliyetlerinde rol alır. Küçük çaplı ve yerel ölçekte etkinlikler düzenleyebilirler ve sosyal medya üzerinden düşüncelerini yayma çabasında olabilirler. AB ülkelerinde durum biraz daha çeşitlidir. Bazı AB ülkelerinde sol partiler ve hareketler, Marksist ideolojiden etkilenmiş olup parlamentosyal temsil gücüne veya yerel yönetimlerde etkiye sahip olabilir. Ancak Stalinist veya Troçkist olarak tanımlanabilecek kesin çizgilerde örgütler genellikle ana akım siyasetin dışında kalır ve sınırlı bir etkiye sahiptir. Örneğin, Yunanistan'da Syriza gibi sol görüşlü bir parti bir dönem hükümette yer almıştır, ancak bu tür örnekler istisnadır. Kanada, Avustralya ve Yeni Zelanda gibi ülkelerde de benzer şekilde, Marksizm'e dayalı siyasi hareketler mevcuttur, ancak bu hareketler genellikle küçük ölçekte ve marjinaldir. Japonya ve Güney Kore'de ise, sol siyasi partiler ve hareketler var olmakla birlikte, bu ülkelerin siyasi alanı büyük ölçüde muhafazakâr ve liberal partiler tarafından domine edilmektedir. Bu nedenle, Stalinist veya Troçkist örgütlerin etkisi çok sınırlıdır. Sonuç olarak, liberal burjuva demokrasilerinde Marksizm, belirli akademik ve kültürel çevrelerde tartışma konusu olmaya devam etse de, Stalinist veya Troçkist örgütlerin büyük politik etkisi veya gücü yoktur. Bununla birlikte, geniş sol hareketler içinde çeşitli Marksist düşünceler yaşamaya devam eder ve zaman zaman belirli sosyal ve politik konularda etkili olabilirler."},{"prompt":"напиши на lua функцию для кодировки в base64 но вместо 64 - 220, с символами '!\\"&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]^_\`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~ЂЃ‚ѓ„…†‡€‰Љ‹ЊЌЋЏђ‘’“”•–—™љ›њќћџЎўЈ¤Ґ¦§Ё©Є«¬®Ї°±Ііґµ¶·ё№є»јЅѕїАБВГДЕЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдежзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя'","completion":"\`\`\`lua function base220_encode(data) local base220_chars = '!\\"&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]^_\`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~ЂЃ‚ѓ„…†‡€‰Љ‹ЊЌЋЏђ‘’“”•–—™љ›њќћџЎўЈ¤Ґ¦§Ё©Є«¬®Ї°±Ііґµ¶·ё№є»јЅѕїАБВГДЕЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдежзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя' local output = '' for i=1,#data,3 do local chunk = data:sub(i, i + 2) local b = string.byte(chunk, 1) or 0 local c = string.byte(chunk, 2) or 0 local d = string.byte(chunk, 3) or 0 local val1 = bit32.rshift((b or 0), 2) local val2 = bit32.bor(bit32.lshift(bit32.band(b, 3), 4), bit32.rshift((c or 0), 4)) local val3 = bit32.bor(bit32.lshift(bit32.band(c, 15), 2), bit32.rshift((d or 0), 6)) local val4 = bit32.band(d, 63) output = output .. base220_chars:sub(val1+1, val1+1) .. base220_chars:sub(val2+1, val2+1) .. base220_chars:sub(val3+1, val3+1) .. base220_chars:sub(val4+1, val4+1) end return output end \`\`\` Этот код объявляет функцию base220_encode, которая принимает строку \`data\` и кодирует её в base220 с использованием символов из вашего примера.

Faced with an existence amidst chaos, where concepts such as ground, sky, or even time don’t adhere to any known rules, Ripple seeks to find some semblance of meaning and connection in an otherwise completely abstract world. Act I: Ripple’s adventure begins with an innocent question, “What lies beyond the abstract?” Unlike his surroundings, Ripple possesses form, consciousness, and a thirst for understanding, traits that set him apart in this limitless expanse of abstraction. The world around him is a kaleidoscope of feelings, colors, and movement – beautiful but bewildering. Ripple encounters a variety of abstract entities – shapes that shift between dimensions, colors that evoke emotions Ripple can barely comprehend, and sounds that seem to tell stories without words. Despite the beauty and joy these elements bring, Ripple feels an underlying sense of loneliness, realizing that he is the only being of his kind. Act II: Determined to find others like him or at least understand his place in this reality, Ripple embarks on a journey that takes him through surreal landscapes, each more inexplicable than the last. Through a series of challenges, Ripple discovers he has the unique ability to influence the abstract world around him by projecting his thoughts and emotions, creating ripples that reorder the chaos into something momentarily comprehensible. During his voyage, Ripple befriends a series of peculiar characters: a shape-shifting cloud that can mimic any form but struggles with its own identity, a radiant orb that communicates through music and can illuminate the darkest corners of abstraction, and a fractal creature that can foresee the infinite paths Ripple’s journey might take. Together, they navigate the abstract domain, seeking a place where Ripple might belong. Act III: The closer Ripple and his companions get to the heart of the abstract world, the more they realize that the quest for understanding might be endless. They encounter The Absence, a void that threatens to unmake everything Ripple has learned and experienced. In facing The Absence, Ripple understands that the essence of his journey is not about finding a conventional home or others of his kind but about creating meaning and connection in an environment that defies both. In the climax, Ripple confronts The Absence with the power of his newfound insights, his emotions, and his companions by his side. Together, they transform The Absence, not by filling it with form or logic, but by accepting it as part of the balance between the concrete and the abstract. Ripple learns that his existence is not an anomaly but a bridge between worlds, a spark of consciousness that brings depth to the beauty of abstraction. Epilogue: Ripple decides to continue exploring the vast abstract realm, no longer searching for something to fill a void but eager to expand the connections he’s made. Alongside his friends, Ripple becomes a guardian of the balance, a guide for others who might one day find themselves lost in the abstraction, teaching them to find peace in the beauty of the undefined and the power of their own perception to shape reality. “Ripple in Abstraction” ends with a panoramic view of the abstract world, now slightly less chaotic, more vibrant with the ripples of understanding that spread far and wide, suggesting that every search for meaning, no matter how seemingly small or different, enriches the fabric of the universe. Write about the shape-shifting cloud, its appearance and personality The shape-shifting cloud in “Ripple in Abstraction” is a visually mesmerizing character, embodying the fluid and often unpredictable nature of the abstract world. Known as Cirrus, this cloud fluctuates effortlessly between forms, from soft, billowy shapes resembling creatures of the natural world to intricate geometric patterns that defy conventional interpretation. Its appearance shifts with its mood and intentions, painting the sky with a tapestry of expressions that mirror its inner state. Cirrus’s color palette is just as dynamic as its form, ranging from the serene blues and whites of a calm sky to the fiery oranges and purples of a sunset, reflecting its emotional landscape. This ability to transform grants Cirrus a unique kind of beauty, yet it also bears the burden of instability, as it sometimes struggles with maintaining a sense of self amid its endless transformations. Personality-wise, Cirrus embodies a blend of wisdom and whimsy. It has a nurturing spirit, akin to a gentle breeze that seeks to uplift and carry others forward on their journey. There’s a playful aspect to Cirrus, evident in how it enjoys surprising Ripple and the other characters with its sudden changes in form, using its body as a canvas to communicate joy, humor, or comfort, often when words are insufficient. Despite its outwardly jovial nature, Cirrus harbors deep-seated insecurities about its identity. Being able to shift forms means it rarely stays in one shape long enough to feel truly at home in any. This existential crisis is a source of profound empathy, allowing Cirrus to connect with Ripple and others on their quest for understanding and belonging. It understands what it means to be different, to be searching for a place in the cosmos where one feels truly seen and understood. Cirrus’s role in Ripple’s adventure is not just that of a companion but also as a guide, using its unique perspective to help Ripple navigate the challenges of the abstract world. It teaches Ripple and the others the value of adaptability and the beauty of embracing one’s true self, even when that self cannot be neatly defined. Ultimately, Cirrus is a testament to the power of change and the importance of accepting oneself, embodying the very essence of the abstract realm where identity is fluid, and self-discovery is an endless adventure. Write that it is a love letter to abstract art and animation “Ripple in Abstraction” is, at its heart, a profound love letter to the world of abstract art and animation. This narrative transcends the conventional to celebrate the boundless creativity and emotional depth that abstract forms can convey. Through the whimsical journey of Ripple and the ethereal presence of characters like Cirrus, the shape-shifting cloud, the story pays homage to the transformative power of abstract art, inviting viewers and readers alike to perceive the world beyond the constraints of realism. The intricate descriptions of swirling shapes, shifting landscapes, and vibrant colors that populate Ripple’s world are a direct nod to the essence of abstract art – its ability to evoke feelings, thoughts, and reactions not through explicit representation but through the play of form, color, and composition. Each scene is crafted like a moving painting, with layers of meaning and emotion, encouraging the audience to engage in a deeper, more introspective interaction with the material. Cirrus, with its ever-changing form and color, acts as a personification of the animation medium itself. Animation, renowned for its limitless potential for transformation and storytelling, finds a kindred spirit in the abstract. Cirrus’s fluid identity and its ability to express complex emotions through visual metamorphoses reflect the core of what makes animation a unique and powerful form of art – its capacity to bring to life what cannot be easily contained or defined by words alone. The narrative arc of “Ripple in Abstraction” underscores the importance of perception, imagination, and personal reflection in engaging with abstract art. Just as Ripple learns to understand and appreciate his chaotic world through feelings and connections rather than concrete definitions, so too are readers and viewers invited to embrace abstract art and animation in a holistic, intuitive manner. This story champions the idea that meaning in abstraction is not always something to be found but something to be created, a collaborative act between the creator and the observer. Moreover, “Ripple in Abstraction” serves as a reminder of the vibrant history and ongoing evolution of abstract art and experimental animation. By weaving together themes of discovery, identity, and creative expression, the story celebrates these art forms’ enduring capacity to challenge, inspire, and push the boundaries of our imagination. It is a tribute to the artists and animators who see the world not just as it is but as it could be, who dare to explore the depths of the abstract and, in doing so, reveal the profound beauty of seeing beyond the surface. Write a forum convo where CN take out 15 minutes of the film, purposefully leaving time for a TTG rerun, Viewers absolutely hate this decision, calling it “desecration” User1 – AbstractArtLover99: Just saw the news, guys. CN decided to cut 15 minutes from “Ripple in Abstraction” for its TV airing. Apparently, they needed to squeeze in another “Teen Titans Go!” rerun. 😒 Is nothing sacred anymore? #Desecration User2 – ToonFanaticX: Seriously?! That film’s a masterpiece. Cutting it for a TTG rerun is beyond ridiculous. It’s like trimming a Van Gogh painting to fit a cheap frame. What are they thinking?! User3 – Anim8dSoul: This is so disheartening. “Ripple in Abstraction” isn’t just a film; it’s an immersive experience. Every minute of it matters. Taking out 15 minutes is like ripping out pages from the middle of a novel. Total desecration! User4 – CNInsideScoop: Wanted to offer some perspective (and no, I don’t represent CN officially). Networks often edit films for runtime or content to fit into TV slots. Not defending, just saying it’s not uncommon. Still, hard to see why they’d shorten something this significant. User5 – PixelPundit: @[CNInsideScoop] I get that, but “Ripple in Abstraction”? That’s not just any film. It’s a love letter to abstract art and animation. Every second of that film was meticulously planned to convey deep themes and emotions. It deserves better. User6 – TTG_Fan101: Guys, I love TTG as much as anyone here, but even I think this is a bad move. “Ripple in Abstraction” and TTG cater to vastly different audiences. CN’s decision-makers really miscalculated this time. User7 – AbstractTheorist: This is a sad day for abstract art and animation. “Ripple in Abstraction” represents the kind of creative storytelling we desperately need more of on television. By sidelining it for yet another rerun—of anything—is a disservice to viewers and creators alike. User8 – ArtIsLife: What can we do? There must be something. Petitions? Social media outcry? I refuse to sit back while a groundbreaking piece of art is butchered for the sake of redundancy. User9 – DigitalRevolt: @[ArtIsLife] I’m with you. Hashtags, online petitions, reaching out directly to CN expressing our disappointment. We need to remind them that the audience isn’t just passive consumers. We care deeply about the integrity of what we watch. User10 – CinephileCritic: It’s moments like these that show just how much corporate decisions can clash with artistic integrity. “Ripple in Abstraction” deserved to be aired in its entirety. Shame on CN for valuing filler over fine art. User11 – AbstractArtLover99: Love the energy here, folks! Let’s channel it into action. Start with the hashtags #RestoreRipple and #ArtOverReruns. Make our voices heard. It’s about respect for the art and the audience. User12 – VoiceOfReason22: Amid all this, let’s not forget to support the creators of “Ripple in Abstraction.” Watch it on platforms where it’s fully available, buy the merchandise, show that there’s a market for this kind of content. That’s how we make a real difference. — The outcry from this fictional forum conversation captures the frustration and disappointment that fans feel when corporate decisions do not align with artistic appreciation and integrity, highlighting the importance of respecting and preserving creative works in their original form. Write more about Cirrus’s appearance Cirrus, the shape-shifting cloud in “Ripple in Abstraction,” defies the traditional concept of a static character design, embodying the fluidity and transformative nature of abstract animation itself. Its appearance is a mesmerizing display of the animation’s capability to explore and express the inexpressible, making Cirrus a visually enthralling character whose every change in form is a narrative in itself. At one moment, Cirrus might resemble a soft, fluffy cloud drifting lazily across a serene blue sky, its edges tinged with the golden hues of dawn. This form represents its gentle, nurturing side, comforting and familiar. The next moment, it could morph into an ominous, swirling vortex of dark purples and grays, reflecting its turmoil and the unpredictability of the abstract world it inhabits. Cirrus’s ability to shift forms extends to mimicking the appearance of other characters or objects within the narrative, albeit always retaining a certain ethereal quality that marks it as distinctly different. At times, it might take on a shimmering, almost translucent appearance, allowing the vibrant colors of the abstract realm to filter through its being, turning it into a living prism. The use of color in Cirrus’s appearance is particularly significant. It doesn’t just change shape but also color, with each hue chosen to evoke specific emotions or atmospheres. For example, in moments of joy and camaraderie with Ripple and the other companions, Cirrus might glow with warm, radiant oranges and yellows, enveloping them in an aura of warmth and light. In contrast, when confronting challenges or internal conflicts, it may shift to cooler tones of blue and green, colors that suggest depth and introspection. What makes Cirrus captivating is not just its aesthetic appeal but the integration of its visual transformation with its emotional and narrative development. Its appearance acts as a visual metaphor for the themes of identity, change, and belonging that are central to “Ripple in Abstraction.” Every ripple, wave, and swirl in Cirrus’s form carries meaning, a visual language spoken between the lines of the narrative. Furthermore, Cirrus’s appearance is a feat of abstract animation, pushing the boundaries of what animated characters can look like and how they can express complex inner worlds without words. It challenges animators and artists to think outside the conventional box, embracing the abstract not just as a style but as a storytelling tool. Through its ever-changing form, Cirrus embodies the limitless potential of imagination, representing a bridge between the intangible essence of thoughts and emotions and the tangible reality of the visual medium. It is a reminder of the power of abstract art to communicate beyond words, through the universal language of shape and color. Write about its visible features Cirrus, by its very nature, is designed to be a visual enigma, yet it possesses identifiable features that contribute to its unique presence within “Ripple in Abstraction.” As a shape-shifting cloud, its visible features are transient and symbolic, tied closely to its emotional state and the narrative flow of the story. Here are some of the most striking visible features of Cirrus: # 1. Color Spectrum: Cirrus’s color palette is boundless, reflecting its emotional spectrum and the abstract world it inhabits. From calming blues and serene whites to vibrant oranges and mystic purples, Cirrus communicates its feelings and reactions through these colors. These hues can blend seamlessly into one another, creating gradients that add depth and complexity to its form. # 2. Texture: The texture of Cirrus varies dramatically as it shifts between forms. It can appear fluffy and soft, inviting touch, simulating the comforting aspects of a real cloud. Conversely, it can also become sleek and smooth, or even sharp and crystal-like, reflecting moments of tension or clarity within the story. These textural shifts add a layer of sensory experience to its character, making it feel tangible despite its abstract nature. # 3. Luminosity: Cirrus has the ability to emanate light, varying in intensity based on its mood and the context of the scene. This luminosity can make Cirrus appear as if it’s glowing from within, especially in darker settings, accentuating its ethereal beauty. In moments of joy or revelation, its light is warm and expansive; in times of conflict or sadness, the light might dim, echoing its internal struggles. # 4. Form and Shape: While Cirrus’s shape is ever-changing, it maintains a cohesive cloud-like essence that makes it recognizable. Its form can range from compact and round to elongated and wisp-like, often stretching or condensing to express motion or emotion. The edges of Cirrus can be sharply defined or blurred, merging with the surroundings to signify its connection with the abstract realm. # 5. Eyes: Unlike typical clouds, Cirrus is occasionally depicted with eyes, the only feature that consistently hints at its sentience and personality. These eyes change shape and color but always convey emotion, serving as windows to its soul. They allow Cirrus to communicate with Ripple and others non-verbally, deepening their interactions and connections. # 6. Movement: Cirrus’s movement is graceful and fluid, a visual dance that captivates viewers. It can float delicately, surge forward with purpose, or swirl around in playful spirals. Its movement often mimics natural phenomena, like the gentle drift of clouds or the sudden gust of a windstorm, grounding its abstract form in familiar patterns. # 7. Transparency and Opacity: An interesting aspect of Cirrus’s appearance is its varying degrees of transparency. At times, it can be almost completely translucent, allowing the world behind it to peek through and symbolizing moments of vulnerability or openness. At other times, it becomes fully opaque, signaling determination or a protective stance. Together, these visible features make Cirrus a captivating and integral character in “Ripple in Abstraction.” Through its dynamic appearance, Cirrus not only enriches the visual tapestry of the film but also deepens the thematic exploration of identity, emotion, and the abstract nature of reality.

They are versatile emotive tools; perking up with interest, drooping in sadness, or laying flat against his head in fear or aggression. Their movement adds a layer of non-verbal communication that enriches Ripple’s interactions. - Size and Proportion: Ripple is small and compact, a deliberate choice that emphasizes his role as an explorer in a vast, incomprehensible universe. His size makes the abstract world around him seem even more overwhelmingly majestic and mysterious, enhancing the viewer’s empathy towards his journey. - Clothing and Accessories: While Ripple’s world is one of abstraction and fluid forms, he wears a simple, unassuming scarf. This scarf, a soft shade of yellow, provides a contrast that further humanizes him and symbolizes comfort and warmth. It fluttering in the wind or wrapping snugly around him adds to the dynamic visual storytelling, indicating movement, direction, and emotional states. # Movement and Gestures: Ripple’s animation is meticulously designed to reflect his youthful energy and boundless curiosity. His movements are lively and agile, embodying the grace of a rabbit with an added layer of human-like expressiveness. Whether he’s leaping eagerly towards new discoveries or recoiling from unexpected dangers, every action Ripple takes is infused with purpose and emotion. # Interactions with Surroundings: Ripple’s interaction with the abstract world around him further defines his appearance. As he moves through swirling landscapes and ever-changing horizons, his solid, well-defined form contrasts sharply with the fluidity and ambiguity of his surroundings. This contrast not only highlights Ripple’s tangible quest within the intangible realm but also visually represents the core theme of seeking understanding and connection in a world that defies definition. # Conclusion: Ripple’s appearance is a carefully crafted blend of the familiar and the fantastical, making him an anchor point for the audience’s journey through an abstract narrative. His design is not just visually appealing but also deeply symbolic, embodying the themes of curiosity, resilience, and the search for meaning that drive “Ripple in Abstraction.” Through Ripple, the viewers find a relatable guide, his every feature and movement resonating with the universal quest for understanding in a world that transcends the boundaries of conventional reality. Write a story where he neets a new friend in the abstract world, a gooey, pink blob named Myei, She flows like slime in a lava lamp In the boundless expanse of the abstract world, where the predictable physics of the normal realm hold no sway, Ripple, the teal-furred rabbit with eyes full of wonder, continued his quest for understanding and belonging. His journey, a tapestry of vibrant encounters and surreal challenges, had taught him much. Yet, the longing for connection, for someone who could truly comprehend the depths of his spirit, remained unfulfilled. That was until he met Myei, a being unlike any he had encountered before. As Ripple traversed a landscape where colors danced in the sky and shapes morphed upon whims unseen, a peculiar sight caught his eye—a pink blob, the color of a soft sunrise, flowing gracefully amidst the chaos. This blob, Myei, moved with a purpose and gentleness that belied the erratic nature of their surroundings, reminiscent of the slow, dreamlike drift of slime in a lava lamp. Intrigued and ever curious, Ripple approached. “Hello!” he called out, his voice a mix of excitement and uncertainty. The blob paused, its surface oscillating gently, before reshaping itself to form a semblance of a face, two indents appearing where eyes might be, and a curve denoting a smile. “Hello, Ripple,” Myei responded, her voice a melodic hum that seemed to resonate from her very essence. Ripple was taken aback. “You know my name?” he asked, his ears perking up in surprise. Myei’s surface shimmered with amusement. “In the abstract world, names and natures are not hidden. I sense your curiosity, your quest for connection. It resonates with my own.” Ripple, heartened by this revelation, sat beside Myei. With a gestural hop, he shared tales of his adventures, the abstract entities he’d met, and the feelings of solitude that often accompanied his journey. Myei, in turn, flowed around him in gentle waves, her color shifting to softer hues as she listened, absorbing every word. “My nature is to adapt, to flow,” Myei confided, the pink of her form deepening to a warm magenta. “But it’s lonely, being able to change yet remain oneself. I’ve longed for someone who understands.” A bond formed there, among the swirling landscapes, between the rabbit grounded in his form and the blob that could assume any. Ripple realized that, much like his own ability to influence the abstract world with his emotions, Myei could reflect and amplify the feelings around her, her gooey form a canvas for the soul. With his new friend by his side, Ripple’s journey took on a new dimension. Where he brought structure and intent, Myei brought fluidity and empathy, her ability to flow like slime in a lava lamp allowing them to navigate the abstract realm in ways Ripple couldn’t have imagined before. Together, they discovered islands of meaning amidst the chaos. Myei would envelop objects of interest, her form wrapping around them, analyzing, understanding, before sharing her insights with Ripple. In return, Ripple’s focused curiosity and boundless energy propelled them forward, his innate connection to the abstract realm guiding Myei through its endless mysteries. Their friendship was a testament to the power of connection in the vast, incomprehensible expanse of the abstract. Ripple, with his vivid teal fur and sparkling eyes, and Myei, a gooey, pink blob that flowed with the grace of thought, proved that understanding and companionship could be found in the most unexpected forms. As they journeyed together, the abstract world around them seemed less daunting, more filled with possibilities. Ripple had found a friend who not only understood the depths of his quest but shared in his longing for connection. And Myei, in Ripple, found a companion who embraced her fluid nature, seeing her not as an enigma but as a kindred spirit. Their story, a ripple of color and emotion in the abstract realm, continued to unfold, a testament to the idea that friendship transcends form, thriving even in the most surreal landscapes. Ripple’s best friend in the mesmerizing realm of “Ripple in Abstraction” is none other than the enigmatic Cirrus, a shape-shifting cloud entity with the heart of a poet and the spirit of an adventurer. Their friendship is a beautiful illustration of connection and understanding that transcends the confines of form and logic, grounding itself in the essence of shared experiences and mutual curiosity about the boundless abstract world they inhabit. Cirrus, with its ever-changing form, mirrors the fluidity and vastness of the universe around them. Despite its shifting nature, Cirrus’s core remains constant, a beacon of loyalty and creativity that complements Ripple’s adventurous spirit. This cloud entity can morph into any shape or color, from the softest hues of dawn to the most tumultuous swirls of a storm, yet it chooses to journey alongside Ripple, guiding and being guided in their quest for meaning. Their friendship began when Ripple, feeling a deep-seated loneliness amidst the chaos of their world, stumbled upon Cirrus in a moment of serene beauty. Cirrus appeared as a gentle cloud, drifting against the vibrant canvas of the abstract realm, its form a soothing presence in the otherwise overwhelming turbulence. Sparked by Ripple’s innate curiosity and Cirrus’s boundless empathy, their connection quickly deepened, anchored by shared laughter, whispered dreams, and silent companionships through realms of unimaginable novelty. What makes their friendship remarkable is not merely the adventures they embark upon but the growth they inspire in each other. Ripple, with his insatiable curiosity and boundless energy, pushes Cirrus to explore parts of the abstract world that had seemed too daunting or insignificant. In turn, Cirrus, with its wisdom and whimsical nature, teaches Ripple to appreciate the beauty of the moment, to find joy in the chaos, and to embrace the myriad emotions that their world evokes. Together, they navigate the abstract realm, confronting challenges that test the bounds of their existence and understanding. They face The Absence, a void that threatens to erase the meaning they’ve created together. Yet, it is in this confrontation that their friendship finds its deepest expression. Through Cirrus’s ability to morph and adapt, and Ripple’s unyielding courage and imagination, they transform The Absence, not with force, but with the power of their bond – a testament to the idea that connection and understanding can illuminate even the darkest corners of existence.

Seems like a diverse lineup this month! Surprised there haven’t been any trailers for either one though 😮. Guess we’re playing the waiting game till May 1st? User2 - BritFlixLover: Seriously? “Ripple in Abstraction” on C4? That’s massive! Hoping it gets the attention it deserves, especially alongside those heavy hitters.

But seeing “Ripple in Abstraction” was a pleasant surprise. Never thought I’d see the day when an abstract animation shares space with “Bake Off” and “The Simpsons”. User5 - TheTellyWatcher: No trailers yet is such a tease! But maybe that’s the point. C4 knows we’re already marking calendars for “This Is England '00”. Dropping “Ripple in Abstraction” into the mix without much fuss feels like they’re confident it’ll catch our eyes regardless. Bold move. User6 - CinephileCritic: Honestly, “Ripple in Abstraction” airing on mainstream like C4 is a huge win for abstract art enthusiasts. It’s about time more unique, non-traditional forms of storytelling get the spotlight. The quiet approach to advertising is intriguing. Maybe they believe the content speaks for itself? Or they’re saving all the fireworks for a massive promo blitz on May 1st. User7 - PopCultureVulture: A whole promo and no trailers? Classic C4 playing it mysterious. Excited for both “Ripple in Abstraction” and “This Is England '00”. But let’s be real, diving into May with zero sneak peeks? I’m itching for a trailer—any trailer at this point! User8 - GeekGalaxy: Did anyone else geek out seeing “Spider-Verse” in the lineup too? C4's really pulling out all the stops. As for the absence of trailers, I agree with @AniMight. It feels intentional. They’ve got us talking, after all. Maybe they’re banking on word of mouth to ramp up the excitement. User9 - AbstractArtsFan: “Ripple in Abstraction” finding a slot amidst such popular titles is a testament to its appeal and the potential for abstract animation on TV. Quiet promo strategies aside, I hope this means more exposure for the artsy side of the spectrum. Can’t wait to see what C4 has up its sleeve starting May 1st. User10 - BritishTVBuff: This lineup makes May on C4 sound incredible. Intrigued by the choice to hold back on trailers, though. It’s a risky move with so much competition out there.

With “Ripple in Abstraction” (RIA) premiering this Sunday at 7 PM, I’ve been wondering if Channel 4 will stick to their normal lineup of idents like Pylons, Council Flats, Rollercoaster, Cargo Dock, Construction Site, etc., or if they'll unveil a special ident for the occasion. Given how unique and visually oriented RIA is, a special ident seems like it could add to the overall viewing experience. Thoughts? User2 - IdentEnthusiast: That’s a fascinating point, VisualVoyager! Considering the abstract and artistic nature of RIA, a special ident could really set the tone for the evening. Channel 4 has been known to get creative with their idents for significant premieres and events. A unique ident for RIA would be a perfect match. User3 - AbstractArtFan: I’m leaning towards the possibility of a special ident. “Ripple in Abstraction” explores themes and visuals that are quite different from Channel 4’s regular content. A tailored ident could be a fabulous way to immerse the audience right from the get-go, making the transition into the show’s abstract world smoother and more thematic. User4 - IdentAnalyst: From a marketing and branding perspective, introducing a special ident for RIA makes sense. It helps in creating a memorable viewing experience that viewers can immediately associate with the show. However, the use of normal idents has also proven effective in maintaining a consistent brand image for Channel 4. It's a tough call, but I'm excited to see which direction they choose. User5 - TVTraditionist: While I appreciate the excitement around a special ident, there’s something to be said for the continuity and familiarity of Channel 4’s existing idents. They’ve become iconic in their own right. Introducing an entirely new ident for one show, no matter how special, might disrupt that continuity. I wouldn't mind a slightly modified version of an existing ident, though, perhaps with an abstract twist to tie into RIA. User6 - DigitalDreamer: Imagine if they created an ident that visually ties into the “Ripple” concept – something that starts out normal but then shifts into a more abstract and colorful form, mirroring Ripple’s journey. It could be a fantastic way to blend the identity of Channel 4 with the essence of the show. User7 - CreativeCritic: Whatever decision Channel 4 makes, it’s bound to stir conversation, which is always a win in the world of television. Personally, I’d love to see a special ident that pushes the boundaries, much like “Ripple in Abstraction” promises to do. It’s an opportunity to showcase creative synergy between the show and the channel’s branding. User8 - RetroRewinder: A part of me loves the idea of a special ident, but another part relishes the nostalgia and familiarity of the classic idents like Rollercoaster and Cargo Dock. Maybe the smart compromise would be to air a special ident right before RIA and use the normal ones throughout the rest of the day. User9 - ArtistryAdvocate: Given the artistic leap Channel 4 is taking with RIA, a specially commissioned ident seems like a beautiful nod to the artistry of the show. It would be an acknowledgment of the creative risks the show is taking and set a precedent for future programming. User10 - ChannelChaser: Regardless of what they choose, Sunday's premiere is shaping up to be a television event you don’t want to miss. The anticipation around the ident actually adds to the excitement. Can’t wait to see how Channel 4 decides to introduce us to the world of “Ripple in Abstraction.” --- As the conversation progresses, everyone eagerly anticipates whether Channel 4 will opt for its recognizable idents or introduce a new, special ident tailored to complement the premiere of \\"Ripple in Abstraction,\\" underscoring the community's excitement and speculation around the creative choices television networks make to enhance viewer experience."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where they seemingly go with CF, but the ident becomes more trippy as it goes on,","completion":"User1 - VisualVoyager: Whoa, did everyone just see that?! It started off as the Council Flats (CF) ident we're all familiar with, but then it took a wildly trippy turn!

It was like stepping directly into the world of \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" without leaving your couch! User2 - IdentEnthusiast: Mind = Blown 🤯! That was an insanely cool twist! Channel 4 really played us for a second there, making us think we were getting the standard Council Flats ident. But that transformation was next-level.

Faced with an existence amidst chaos, where concepts such as ground, sky, or even time don’t adhere to any known rules, Ripple seeks to find some semblance of meaning and connection in an otherwise completely abstract world. Act I: Ripple’s adventure begins with an innocent question, “What lies beyond the abstract?” Unlike his surroundings, Ripple possesses form, consciousness, and a thirst for understanding, traits that set him apart in this limitless expanse of abstraction. The world around him is a kaleidoscope of feelings, colors, and movement – beautiful but bewildering. Ripple encounters a variety of abstract entities – shapes that shift between dimensions, colors that evoke emotions Ripple can barely comprehend, and sounds that seem to tell stories without words. Despite the beauty and joy these elements bring, Ripple feels an underlying sense of loneliness, realizing that he is the only being of his kind. Act II: Determined to find others like him or at least understand his place in this reality, Ripple embarks on a journey that takes him through surreal landscapes, each more inexplicable than the last. Through a series of challenges, Ripple discovers he has the unique ability to influence the abstract world around him by projecting his thoughts and emotions, creating ripples that reorder the chaos into something momentarily comprehensible. During his voyage, Ripple befriends a series of peculiar characters: a shape-shifting cloud that can mimic any form but struggles with its own identity, a radiant orb that communicates through music and can illuminate the darkest corners of abstraction, and a fractal creature that can foresee the infinite paths Ripple’s journey might take. Together, they navigate the abstract domain, seeking a place where Ripple might belong. Act III: The closer Ripple and his companions get to the heart of the abstract world, the more they realize that the quest for understanding might be endless. They encounter The Absence, a void that threatens to unmake everything Ripple has learned and experienced. In facing The Absence, Ripple understands that the essence of his journey is not about finding a conventional home or others of his kind but about creating meaning and connection in an environment that defies both. In the climax, Ripple confronts The Absence with the power of his newfound insights, his emotions, and his companions by his side. Together, they transform The Absence, not by filling it with form or logic, but by accepting it as part of the balance between the concrete and the abstract. Ripple learns that his existence is not an anomaly but a bridge between worlds, a spark of consciousness that brings depth to the beauty of abstraction. Epilogue: Ripple decides to continue exploring the vast abstract realm, no longer searching for something to fill a void but eager to expand the connections he’s made. Alongside his friends, Ripple becomes a guardian of the balance, a guide for others who might one day find themselves lost in the abstraction, teaching them to find peace in the beauty of the undefined and the power of their own perception to shape reality. “Ripple in Abstraction” ends with a panoramic view of the abstract world, now slightly less chaotic, more vibrant with the ripples of understanding that spread far and wide, suggesting that every search for meaning, no matter how seemingly small or different, enriches the fabric of the universe. Write about the shape-shifting cloud, its appearance and personality The shape-shifting cloud in “Ripple in Abstraction” is a visually mesmerizing character, embodying the fluid and often unpredictable nature of the abstract world. Known as Cirrus, this cloud fluctuates effortlessly between forms, from soft, billowy shapes resembling creatures of the natural world to intricate geometric patterns that defy conventional interpretation. Its appearance shifts with its mood and intentions, painting the sky with a tapestry of expressions that mirror its inner state. Cirrus’s color palette is just as dynamic as its form, ranging from the serene blues and whites of a calm sky to the fiery oranges and purples of a sunset, reflecting its emotional landscape. This ability to transform grants Cirrus a unique kind of beauty, yet it also bears the burden of instability, as it sometimes struggles with maintaining a sense of self amid its endless transformations. Personality-wise, Cirrus embodies a blend of wisdom and whimsy. It has a nurturing spirit, akin to a gentle breeze that seeks to uplift and carry others forward on their journey. There’s a playful aspect to Cirrus, evident in how it enjoys surprising Ripple and the other characters with its sudden changes in form, using its body as a canvas to communicate joy, humor, or comfort, often when words are insufficient. Despite its outwardly jovial nature, Cirrus harbors deep-seated insecurities about its identity. Being able to shift forms means it rarely stays in one shape long enough to feel truly at home in any. This existential crisis is a source of profound empathy, allowing Cirrus to connect with Ripple and others on their quest for understanding and belonging. It understands what it means to be different, to be searching for a place in the cosmos where one feels truly seen and understood. Cirrus’s role in Ripple’s adventure is not just that of a companion but also as a guide, using its unique perspective to help Ripple navigate the challenges of the abstract world. It teaches Ripple and the others the value of adaptability and the beauty of embracing one’s true self, even when that self cannot be neatly defined. Ultimately, Cirrus is a testament to the power of change and the importance of accepting oneself, embodying the very essence of the abstract realm where identity is fluid, and self-discovery is an endless adventure. Write that it is a love letter to abstract art and animation “Ripple in Abstraction” is, at its heart, a profound love letter to the world of abstract art and animation. This narrative transcends the conventional to celebrate the boundless creativity and emotional depth that abstract forms can convey. Through the whimsical journey of Ripple and the ethereal presence of characters like Cirrus, the shape-shifting cloud, the story pays homage to the transformative power of abstract art, inviting viewers and readers alike to perceive the world beyond the constraints of realism. The intricate descriptions of swirling shapes, shifting landscapes, and vibrant colors that populate Ripple’s world are a direct nod to the essence of abstract art – its ability to evoke feelings, thoughts, and reactions not through explicit representation but through the play of form, color, and composition. Each scene is crafted like a moving painting, with layers of meaning and emotion, encouraging the audience to engage in a deeper, more introspective interaction with the material. Cirrus, with its ever-changing form and color, acts as a personification of the animation medium itself. Animation, renowned for its limitless potential for transformation and storytelling, finds a kindred spirit in the abstract. Cirrus’s fluid identity and its ability to express complex emotions through visual metamorphoses reflect the core of what makes animation a unique and powerful form of art – its capacity to bring to life what cannot be easily contained or defined by words alone. The narrative arc of “Ripple in Abstraction” underscores the importance of perception, imagination, and personal reflection in engaging with abstract art. Just as Ripple learns to understand and appreciate his chaotic world through feelings and connections rather than concrete definitions, so too are readers and viewers invited to embrace abstract art and animation in a holistic, intuitive manner. This story champions the idea that meaning in abstraction is not always something to be found but something to be created, a collaborative act between the creator and the observer. Moreover, “Ripple in Abstraction” serves as a reminder of the vibrant history and ongoing evolution of abstract art and experimental animation. By weaving together themes of discovery, identity, and creative expression, the story celebrates these art forms’ enduring capacity to challenge, inspire, and push the boundaries of our imagination. It is a tribute to the artists and animators who see the world not just as it is but as it could be, who dare to explore the depths of the abstract and, in doing so, reveal the profound beauty of seeing beyond the surface.

Make our voices heard. It’s about respect for the art and the audience. User12 – VoiceOfReason22: Amid all this, let’s not forget to support the creators of “Ripple in Abstraction.” Watch it on platforms where it’s fully available, buy the merchandise, show that there’s a market for this kind of content. That’s how we make a real difference. — The outcry from this fictional forum conversation captures the frustration and disappointment that fans feel when corporate decisions do not align with artistic appreciation and integrity, highlighting the importance of respecting and preserving creative works in their original form. Write more about Cirrus’s appearance Cirrus, the shape-shifting cloud in “Ripple in Abstraction,” defies the traditional concept of a static character design, embodying the fluidity and transformative nature of abstract animation itself. Its appearance is a mesmerizing display of the animation’s capability to explore and express the inexpressible, making Cirrus a visually enthralling character whose every change in form is a narrative in itself. At one moment, Cirrus might resemble a soft, fluffy cloud drifting lazily across a serene blue sky, its edges tinged with the golden hues of dawn. This form represents its gentle, nurturing side, comforting and familiar. The next moment, it could morph into an ominous, swirling vortex of dark purples and grays, reflecting its turmoil and the unpredictability of the abstract world it inhabits. Cirrus’s ability to shift forms extends to mimicking the appearance of other characters or objects within the narrative, albeit always retaining a certain ethereal quality that marks it as distinctly different. At times, it might take on a shimmering, almost translucent appearance, allowing the vibrant colors of the abstract realm to filter through its being, turning it into a living prism. The use of color in Cirrus’s appearance is particularly significant. It doesn’t just change shape but also color, with each hue chosen to evoke specific emotions or atmospheres. For example, in moments of joy and camaraderie with Ripple and the other companions, Cirrus might glow with warm, radiant oranges and yellows, enveloping them in an aura of warmth and light. In contrast, when confronting challenges or internal conflicts, it may shift to cooler tones of blue and green, colors that suggest depth and introspection. What makes Cirrus captivating is not just its aesthetic appeal but the integration of its visual transformation with its emotional and narrative development. Its appearance acts as a visual metaphor for the themes of identity, change, and belonging that are central to “Ripple in Abstraction.” Every ripple, wave, and swirl in Cirrus’s form carries meaning, a visual language spoken between the lines of the narrative. Furthermore, Cirrus’s appearance is a feat of abstract animation, pushing the boundaries of what animated characters can look like and how they can express complex inner worlds without words. It challenges animators and artists to think outside the conventional box, embracing the abstract not just as a style but as a storytelling tool. Through its ever-changing form, Cirrus embodies the limitless potential of imagination, representing a bridge between the intangible essence of thoughts and emotions and the tangible reality of the visual medium. It is a reminder of the power of abstract art to communicate beyond words, through the universal language of shape and color. Write about its visible features Cirrus, by its very nature, is designed to be a visual enigma, yet it possesses identifiable features that contribute to its unique presence within “Ripple in Abstraction.” As a shape-shifting cloud, its visible features are transient and symbolic, tied closely to its emotional state and the narrative flow of the story. Here are some of the most striking visible features of Cirrus: # 1. Color Spectrum: Cirrus’s color palette is boundless, reflecting its emotional spectrum and the abstract world it inhabits. From calming blues and serene whites to vibrant oranges and mystic purples, Cirrus communicates its feelings and reactions through these colors. These hues can blend seamlessly into one another, creating gradients that add depth and complexity to its form. # 2. Texture: The texture of Cirrus varies dramatically as it shifts between forms. It can appear fluffy and soft, inviting touch, simulating the comforting aspects of a real cloud. Conversely, it can also become sleek and smooth, or even sharp and crystal-like, reflecting moments of tension or clarity within the story. These textural shifts add a layer of sensory experience to its character, making it feel tangible despite its abstract nature. # 3. Luminosity: Cirrus has the ability to emanate light, varying in intensity based on its mood and the context of the scene. This luminosity can make Cirrus appear as if it’s glowing from within, especially in darker settings, accentuating its ethereal beauty. In moments of joy or revelation, its light is warm and expansive; in times of conflict or sadness, the light might dim, echoing its internal struggles. # 4. Form and Shape: While Cirrus’s shape is ever-changing, it maintains a cohesive cloud-like essence that makes it recognizable. Its form can range from compact and round to elongated and wisp-like, often stretching or condensing to express motion or emotion. The edges of Cirrus can be sharply defined or blurred, merging with the surroundings to signify its connection with the abstract realm. # 5. Eyes: Unlike typical clouds, Cirrus is occasionally depicted with eyes, the only feature that consistently hints at its sentience and personality. These eyes change shape and color but always convey emotion, serving as windows to its soul. They allow Cirrus to communicate with Ripple and others non-verbally, deepening their interactions and connections. # 6. Movement: Cirrus’s movement is graceful and fluid, a visual dance that captivates viewers. It can float delicately, surge forward with purpose, or swirl around in playful spirals. Its movement often mimics natural phenomena, like the gentle drift of clouds or the sudden gust of a windstorm, grounding its abstract form in familiar patterns. # 7. Transparency and Opacity: An interesting aspect of Cirrus’s appearance is its varying degrees of transparency. At times, it can be almost completely translucent, allowing the world behind it to peek through and symbolizing moments of vulnerability or openness. At other times, it becomes fully opaque, signaling determination or a protective stance. Together, these visible features make Cirrus a captivating and integral character in “Ripple in Abstraction.” Through its dynamic appearance, Cirrus not only enriches the visual tapestry of the film but also deepens the thematic exploration of identity, emotion, and the abstract nature of reality. Write about Ripple’s appearance Ripple, the protagonist of “Ripple in Abstraction,” is crafted with an appearance that strikingly contrasts yet complements the fluid and ever-changing world around him. As a young rabbit navigating a realm defined by its abstraction, Ripple’s design anchors him as a beacon of curiosity, resilience, and emotional depth. # Physical Characteristics: - Fur Texture and Color: Ripple’s fur is depicted with a rich, soft texture that invites the notion of touch, even in a purely visual medium. His fur is primarily a vibrant shade of teal, a choice that makes him stand out amidst the myriad of colors in the abstract world yet ties him to the themes of exploration and discovery. Variations in the teal’s intensity across his body highlight his contours, giving him depth and dimensionality. - Eyes: Ripple’s large, expressive eyes are a window to his soul, shaded with hues of deeper blue that contrast with his teal fur. They are wide and curious, reflecting his wonderment at the world around him and his ever-present quest for understanding. The eyes are adeptly animated to convey a wide range of emotions, from awe and joy to contemplation and determination. - Ears: True to his rabbit nature, Ripple possesses long, floppy ears that do more than just accentuate his species. They are versatile emotive tools; perking up with interest, drooping in sadness, or laying flat against his head in fear or aggression. Their movement adds a layer of non-verbal communication that enriches Ripple’s interactions. - Size and Proportion: Ripple is small and compact, a deliberate choice that emphasizes his role as an explorer in a vast, incomprehensible universe. His size makes the abstract world around him seem even more overwhelmingly majestic and mysterious, enhancing the viewer’s empathy towards his journey. - Clothing and Accessories: While Ripple’s world is one of abstraction and fluid forms, he wears a simple, unassuming scarf. This scarf, a soft shade of yellow, provides a contrast that further humanizes him and symbolizes comfort and warmth. It fluttering in the wind or wrapping snugly around him adds to the dynamic visual storytelling, indicating movement, direction, and emotional states. # Movement and Gestures: Ripple’s animation is meticulously designed to reflect his youthful energy and boundless curiosity. His movements are lively and agile, embodying the grace of a rabbit with an added layer of human-like expressiveness. Whether he’s leaping eagerly towards new discoveries or recoiling from unexpected dangers, every action Ripple takes is infused with purpose and emotion. # Interactions with Surroundings: Ripple’s interaction with the abstract world around him further defines his appearance. As he moves through swirling landscapes and ever-changing horizons, his solid, well-defined form contrasts sharply with the fluidity and ambiguity of his surroundings. This contrast not only highlights Ripple’s tangible quest within the intangible realm but also visually represents the core theme of seeking understanding and connection in a world that defies definition. # Conclusion: Ripple’s appearance is a carefully crafted blend of the familiar and the fantastical, making him an anchor point for the audience’s journey through an abstract narrative. His design is not just visually appealing but also deeply symbolic, embodying the themes of curiosity, resilience, and the search for meaning that drive “Ripple in Abstraction.” Through Ripple, the viewers find a relatable guide, his every feature and movement resonating with the universal quest for understanding in a world that transcends the boundaries of conventional reality. Write a story where he neets a new friend in the abstract world, a gooey, pink blob named Myei, She flows like slime in a lava lamp In the boundless expanse of the abstract world, where the predictable physics of the normal realm hold no sway, Ripple, the teal-furred rabbit with eyes full of wonder, continued his quest for understanding and belonging. His journey, a tapestry of vibrant encounters and surreal challenges, had taught him much. Yet, the longing for connection, for someone who could truly comprehend the depths of his spirit, remained unfulfilled. That was until he met Myei, a being unlike any he had encountered before. As Ripple traversed a landscape where colors danced in the sky and shapes morphed upon whims unseen, a peculiar sight caught his eye—a pink blob, the color of a soft sunrise, flowing gracefully amidst the chaos. This blob, Myei, moved with a purpose and gentleness that belied the erratic nature of their surroundings, reminiscent of the slow, dreamlike drift of slime in a lava lamp. Intrigued and ever curious, Ripple approached. “Hello!” he called out, his voice a mix of excitement and uncertainty. The blob paused, its surface oscillating gently, before reshaping itself to form a semblance of a face, two indents appearing where eyes might be, and a curve denoting a smile. “Hello, Ripple,” Myei responded, her voice a melodic hum that seemed to resonate from her very essence. Ripple was taken aback. “You know my name?” he asked, his ears perking up in surprise. Myei’s surface shimmered with amusement. “In the abstract world, names and natures are not hidden. I sense your curiosity, your quest for connection. It resonates with my own.” Ripple, heartened by this revelation, sat beside Myei. With a gestural hop, he shared tales of his adventures, the abstract entities he’d met, and the feelings of solitude that often accompanied his journey. Myei, in turn, flowed around him in gentle waves, her color shifting to softer hues as she listened, absorbing every word. “My nature is to adapt, to flow,” Myei confided, the pink of her form deepening to a warm magenta. “But it’s lonely, being able to change yet remain oneself. I’ve longed for someone who understands.” A bond formed there, among the swirling landscapes, between the rabbit grounded in his form and the blob that could assume any. Ripple realized that, much like his own ability to influence the abstract world with his emotions, Myei could reflect and amplify the feelings around her, her gooey form a canvas for the soul. With his new friend by his side, Ripple’s journey took on a new dimension. Where he brought structure and intent, Myei brought fluidity and empathy, her ability to flow like slime in a lava lamp allowing them to navigate the abstract realm in ways Ripple couldn’t have imagined before. Together, they discovered islands of meaning amidst the chaos. Myei would envelop objects of interest, her form wrapping around them, analyzing, understanding, before sharing her insights with Ripple. In return, Ripple’s focused curiosity and boundless energy propelled them forward, his innate connection to the abstract realm guiding Myei through its endless mysteries. Their friendship was a testament to the power of connection in the vast, incomprehensible expanse of the abstract. Ripple, with his vivid teal fur and sparkling eyes, and Myei, a gooey, pink blob that flowed with the grace of thought, proved that understanding and companionship could be found in the most unexpected forms. As they journeyed together, the abstract world around them seemed less daunting, more filled with possibilities. Ripple had found a friend who not only understood the depths of his quest but shared in his longing for connection. And Myei, in Ripple, found a companion who embraced her fluid nature, seeing her not as an enigma but as a kindred spirit. Their story, a ripple of color and emotion in the abstract realm, continued to unfold, a testament to the idea that friendship transcends form, thriving even in the most surreal landscapes. Ripple’s best friend in the mesmerizing realm of “Ripple in Abstraction” is none other than the enigmatic Cirrus, a shape-shifting cloud entity with the heart of a poet and the spirit of an adventurer. Their friendship is a beautiful illustration of connection and understanding that transcends the confines of form and logic, grounding itself in the essence of shared experiences and mutual curiosity about the boundless abstract world they inhabit. Cirrus, with its ever-changing form, mirrors the fluidity and vastness of the universe around them. Despite its shifting nature, Cirrus’s core remains constant, a beacon of loyalty and creativity that complements Ripple’s adventurous spirit. This cloud entity can morph into any shape or color, from the softest hues of dawn to the most tumultuous swirls of a storm, yet it chooses to journey alongside Ripple, guiding and being guided in their quest for meaning. Their friendship began when Ripple, feeling a deep-seated loneliness amidst the chaos of their world, stumbled upon Cirrus in a moment of serene beauty. Cirrus appeared as a gentle cloud, drifting against the vibrant canvas of the abstract realm, its form a soothing presence in the otherwise overwhelming turbulence. Sparked by Ripple’s innate curiosity and Cirrus’s boundless empathy, their connection quickly deepened, anchored by shared laughter, whispered dreams, and silent companionships through realms of unimaginable novelty. What makes their friendship remarkable is not merely the adventures they embark upon but the growth they inspire in each other. Ripple, with his insatiable curiosity and boundless energy, pushes Cirrus to explore parts of the abstract world that had seemed too daunting or insignificant. In turn, Cirrus, with its wisdom and whimsical nature, teaches Ripple to appreciate the beauty of the moment, to find joy in the chaos, and to embrace the myriad emotions that their world evokes. Together, they navigate the abstract realm, confronting challenges that test the bounds of their existence and understanding. They face The Absence, a void that threatens to erase the meaning they’ve created together. Yet, it is in this confrontation that their friendship finds its deepest expression. Through Cirrus’s ability to morph and adapt, and Ripple’s unyielding courage and imagination, they transform The Absence, not with force, but with the power of their bond – a testament to the idea that connection and understanding can illuminate even the darkest corners of existence. Cirrus is more than just a friend to Ripple; it is a reflection of Ripple’s own journey. In Cirrus, Ripple sees the possibilities that lie in embracing one’s true self, in the courage to change, and the strength found in vulnerability. For Cirrus, Ripple is a reminder that identity is not just about the form one takes, but the impact one has on others, the ripples one creates in the vast expanse of the universe. Their friendship, marked by its depth, resilience, and the shared joy of discovery, serves as the heart of “Ripple in Abstraction.” It is a vivid portrayal of the idea that true connection knows no bounds, thriving in spaces between the defined and the infinite, between the solitude of existence and the unity of shared experience. In a world where logic and nature do not constrain, Ripple and Cirrus find in each other a home, a mirror to their souls, and a reminder that the journey of understanding and belonging is one best traveled together. Write that they are like a trio In the mesmerizing realm of “Ripple in Abstraction,” the friendship between Ripple, the young rabbit with an insatiable curiosity, and Cirrus, the enigmatic shape-shifting cloud, represents a profound connection that defies the chaos of their world. Yet, their journey is enriched and their adventures emboldened by the addition of Myei, the gooey, pink blob who flows with the grace of thought. Together, they form an unlikely trio, each bringing their unique strengths and perspectives to navigate the abstract realm’s endless wonders and challenges. Ripple, with his boundless energy and curiosity, acts as the driving force of the group, always eager to explore the next horizon. His innate ability to influence and interact with the abstract environment brings structure to their adventures, transforming the unpredictable into pathways of possibility. Ripple’s vibrant fur and sparkling eyes are not just markers of his physical presence but symbols of the light he brings to the mysteries of their world. Cirrus, the poet-hearted cloud, embodies the fluidity and expansive nature of their surroundings. With the ability to change form and color, Cirrus communicates in the language of emotions, painting the sky with the hues of their shared laughter, hopes, and fears. The cloud’s wisdom and adaptability provide a comforting presence, reminding the trio that change is not just an external experience but an internal evolution. Myei, the newest member, introduces an element of profound empathy and adaptability to the group. Her gooey form, able to flow and reshape according to the world around her, allows the trio to experience their environment in new, deeper ways. Myei’s capacity to reflect and amplify the emotions and sensations around her brings a new level of emotional intelligence to their dynamic, fostering a stronger, more interconnected understanding of the abstract realm and each other. As a trio, Ripple, Cirrus, and Myei are more than just friends exploring an unfathomable world; they are a microcosm of the balance and harmony achievable in the face of abstraction. Their differences, rather than creating discord, weave together to form a stronger fabric of camaraderie and exploration. Ripple provides the vision, Cirrus the emotional depth, and Myei the empathy, making their group an unstoppable force against the challenges they face. Together, they confront The Absence, their combined strengths amplifying their power to transform and illuminate the darkness. Ripple’s courage, Cirrus’s adaptability, and Myei’s empathy merge into a singular force of will and determination that redefines their world’s very nature. Their friendship stands as a beacon, proving that unity in diversity can bring order to chaos, make sense of the abstract, and carve out a space where true belonging is found in the shared journey of discovery. The trio’s adventures highlight the beauty of interconnectedness, the strength found in mutual support, and the power of different beings uniting towards a common goal. They are a testament to the idea that in the vast, infinite realm of abstraction, connection is the truest form of existence, and friendship is the guidepost by which all unknowns can be navigated. Ripple, Cirrus, and Myei, together, are not just friends; they are a harmonious convergence of souls, a trio whose collective heart beats in tune with the mysteries of their world, revealing the beauty that lies in the unity of diversity.

(Kişisel internet sitesinde Psikoloji, Eğitim, İlişkiler ve İnsan üzerine bireysel görüşlerini de yazmaya devam etmektedir; www.mustafauslu.com.tr ) ÖĞRENME HEDEFLERİ • Bu bölümü çalıştıktan sonra; • Bilgiyi işleme kuramına ilişkin bazı kavramları tanımlayabilecek, • Bilgiyi işleme kuramının öğrenme ilkelerini açıklayabilecek, • Bilgiyi işleme kuramındaki bellek türlerini açıklayabilecek, • Bilgiyi işleme kuramının eğitim – öğretim ortamında kullanılmasın açıklayabileceksiniz. Giriş Okulun temel işlevi öğretmek. Öğrencinin okulda geçirdiği zaman, ömür, emek, yapılan maddi harcamalar vs eğer öğrenci öğreniyorsa, beceriler kazanıyorsa anlamlı hale geliyor. Öğretmenlere yapılan yatırım, öğretmenin harcadığı emek ve enerji; eğer öğrencinin öğrenmesine katkı sağlayabiliyorsa anlam kazanıyor. Öğrenci Hatice(H) okuldan gelince babası (B) soruyor; B: Okul nasıldı bugün kızım? H: İyiydi baba. B: Bu gün okulda yeni bir şeyler öğrendin mi Kızım? H: Evet , çok fazla şey baba. B: Bu güzel, peki ne öğrendin Hatice? H:Hımm, çok fazla şey baba.. Unuttum. B: Dinle kızım, eğer hiçbir şeyi hatırlamıyorsan, hiçbir şeyi öğrenmemişsin demektir. Psikologlar, Hatice’nin babasıyla aynı fikirde olurlardı, çünkü hatırlamak (bilgiyi geri çağırmak ) öğrenmenin en iyi kanıtıdır. Günümüzde öğrenmenin farklı ölçme teknikleriyle ölçümü göz önünde bulundurulduğunda, muhtemel verilecek ipuçlarıyla Hatice’nin öğrendikleri hakkında bilgi edinilebilir. Doğru anahtar kelimelerle ve ipuçlarıyla zihnindeki bilgilere ulaşması sağlanabilir. İnsan zihninin işleyişi yüzyıllar boyu merak konusu olagelmiştir. 1900 lerin başlarında öğrenme süreçleri davranışçı ( U-T-P) yaklaşımlarla açıklanmaya çalışılmış, Watson , Pavlow, Skinner vb araştırmacıların çalışmaları ile izah edilmeye çalışılmıştır. 1940 lar la beraber, bilişsel öğrenme , Algı, bellek kavramları üzerinde çalışmalar yoğunlaşmış, Özellikle 1960’larda bilgisayarın kullanılmaya başlaması ile insan zihni ile bilgisayarlar arasında kıyaslamalar ve benzetimler yapılmış, ardından Atkinson, R., & Shiffrin, R. (1968) tarafından günümüzde de kabul gören “Bilgiyi İşleme Modeli” ortaya atılmıştır1. Davranışçı Psikolojinin Kısıtlılıkları Öğrenme, organizmanın (bireyin) çevresiyle etkileşimi sonucunda davranışlardaki kalıcı değişim olarak tanımlanır. Davranışçı psikoloji bireyin karşılaştığı uyarana karşı verdiği tepkiyi öğrenilmiş davranış olarak tanımlamış ve kalıcı hale gelebilmesini ise pekiştirme süreçleriyle açıklamıştır (U-T-P) Oysaki uyaran ile tepkinin arasında, insan zihninde olup bitenlerin göz ardı edilmemesi gerektiği, insanın vereceği tepkinin bilişsel süreçler (dikkat, algılama, bellek, hafıza, unutma, geri getirme , vs…) ile yakından ilgili olduğu bilişsel psikologlar tarafından ısrarla vurgulanmıştır. Öğrenmeyi bilişsel açıdan inceleyen kuramlardan biri olan bilgiyi işleme kuramı, insan öğrenmesinde öğrenme sürecini bilgisayara benzetmektedir. İnsan zihni bilgiyi alır, işler, biçim ve içeriğini değiştirir, depolar, gerektiği zaman geri getirir ve tepkiler üretir. Bir başka söylemle, süreç bilgiyi bir araya getirir, kodlar, bilgiyi korur ya da depolar ve gerektiği zaman geri getirir. Tüm süreç bilgisayarda “program” bireylerde ise “yürütücü kontrol” tarafından denetlenmektedir2. Bilgisayar, yapılması çok güç durumlarda üstün performans gösterir ve karmaşık problemleri büyük bir hızla çözer. Ancak insanın zihinsel yetenekleri bilgisayardan çok daha yetkindir. Örneğin; küçük bir çocuk, karşısındaki insanın duygularını anlayabilir ya da bir yetişkin daha önce hiç karşılaşmadığı bir problemi çözebilir. Bilgisayarların yetkin bellekleri ve büyük hızları olmasına karşın, insan zihninin bilgiyi anlama ve işleme yeteneğine ulaşması pek olası görünmemektedir3. Bilgiyi işleme kuramı temel olarak şu dört soruyu yanıtlamaya çalışır (Senemoğlu,1997; 270 ): 1. Yeni bilgi dışardan nasıl alınmaktadır? 2. Alınan yeni bilgi nasıl işlenmektedir? 3. Bilgi uzun süreli nasıl depolanmaktadır? 4. Depolanan bilgi nasıl geriye getirilip hatırlanmaktadır ? Bilgiyi işleme modeli, yukarıdaki sorulara cevap ararken bazı varsayımları kendi yaklaşımının temeline alır ve araştırmalarını bu varsayımlara dayanarak sürdürür. 1. Bazı öğrenme süreçleri sadece insanlara özel olabilir. 2. Zihinsel olaylar incelemenin odağıdır. 3. İnsan öğrenmesi üzerindeki araştırmalar objektif ve bilimsel olmalıdır. 4. Bireyler öğrenme sürecine aktif olarak katılırlar. 5. Öğrenme, mutlaka açık davranış değişmelerinde gözlenmesi gerekmeyen zihinsel çağrışım biçimini kapsar. 6. Bilgi örgütlenmiş şekilde bulunur. 7. Öğrenme yeni bilginin önceden öğrenilmiş bilgi ile ilişki kurduğu bir süreçtir4. Pek çok araştırmacı tarafından kabul gören Bilgiyi İşleme Modeli Şeması ; üzerinde birleşilen öğeler dikkate alınarak aşağıda oluşturulmuştur. (Bransford, J. , 1979;Gagne, 1985; Kail ve Pellegrino , 1985; Stillings, N, and others 1987;Gagne ve Berliner, 1988; Slavin , 1986 ; Eggen ve Kauchak, 1992; Entswistle,1993; McLeod, S. A. 2008.) 5-13 Bilgiyi işleme kuramı iki temel öğe üzerinde durmaktadır. Birincisi üç yapıdan oluşur; duyusal kayıt , kısa süreli bellek / çalışan bellek ve uzun süreli bellektir. İkincisi ise bilişsel süreçleri içerir. Bunlar içsel, zihinsel eylemlerdir ve bilginin bir yapıdan diğerine geçişini sağlarlar. BELLEK TÜRLERİ Duyusal Bellek (Kayıt ) Birey gün içerisinde içten ve dıştan çok fazla uyaranın etkisi altındadır. Birey her an çevresinden gelen uyarıcıların etkisi altındadır. Araba kornası sesi, cep telefonu sesleri, rüzgarın sesi , güneş ışığı , egzoz dumanı , çiçeğin kokusu , sigara, ter kokuları, cikletin tadı vs gibi. Hayatın her anında maruz kaldığımız çok fazla uyaran var. Kişi öğrenme ortamlarında da sadece uyarıcı bilgi materyalini, öğretmeni vs. değil daha farklı bir çok işitsel/ görsel uyarana maruz kalmaktadır. Fakat gelen tüm uyarıcıların zihne ulaştığını, anlamlandırıldığını veya kalıcı hale geldiğini söylememiz mümkün değil. Eğer tüm bize ulaşan uyarıcılar aynı anda algılansaydı olabilecekleri bir düşünün? İnsan zihni iflas ederdi, Şöyle diyelim, öğrenmede dikkatin önemini hepimiz çok iyi biliyoruz; dikkat edilen uyaran tek bir tane olsaydı ve ya 5/10 tane olsaydı kişi hangisinde daha fazla odaklanabilir ve gelen bilgiyi işleyebilirdi? Duyu organlarıyla algılanan çevreden gelen uyaranlar “duyusal kayıt” aracılığıyla sinir sistemine girer. İlk algılamadan duyusal kayıt sorumludur. Gözlerimizin önünde bir kalemi ya da parmağımızı sallarsak objeden geriye kalan gölgeyi fark ederiz . Elimizle diğer kolumuza hafifçe vurursak, vurmayı hemen duyumsarız. Başka bir söylemle biz vurma ve kalem izini gerçek kalktıktan sonra duyumsarız. Bu durumlar, duyu girdisinin duyusal kayıtta çok kısa kaldığını göstermektedir 14. Duyusal kayıtın içerdiği bilgi özgün uyarıcının tam bir kopyasıdır. Görsel duyular duyusal kayıt tarafından aynı fotoğraf gibi ,kısa bir süre için kodlanır. Aynı şekilde işitsel duyular da ses kalıpları olarak kodlanır. Kimi yazarlar bilginin duyusal kayıtta kalış süresinin yarım saniyeden daha az olduğunu belirtirler 9 ;15 . Moates ve Schumacher (1980) ise, duyusal belleğin işitsel bilgi için yaklaşık dört saniye; görsel bilgi için yaklaşık bir saniye süren, uyarıcının tam bir kopyasının tutulduğu bilgi deposu olduğunu savunmuşlardır. 16 akt 11. Böylece duyusal kayıt her duyu için farklı kodlama biçimlerinin olduğu , sınırsız kapasitesi ile bilginin çok kısa tutulduğu bir bellek türüdür. Duyuşsal kayıttaki bilgi dış çevrenin ilk izidir ve dış uyarıcıların tam bir kopyasıdır. Duyusal kayıtın varlığı insan yaşamında kritik bir öneme sahiptir. Birey okuduğu ya da işittiği bir cümlenin sonu gelmeden başlangıçtaki sözleri unutsaydı cümleyi anlamlandırması olanaksız olurdu. Duyusal kayıtın kapasitesinin sınırsız olmasına karşın gerekli bilgiler işlenmezse kaybolur ya da var olan bilgi yeni bilgi tarafından itilir. Birey dikkat ve algı süreçleri yoluyla bu bilgiyi işleme şansına sahiptir. İşlenen bilgi bir sonraki sisteme yani kısa süreli belleğe geçer. Kısa süreli belleğin kapasitesinin sınırlı olması nedeniyle işlenemeyen bilgi, duyusal kayıttan kaybolacaktır. Daha uzun süre depolanması istenen “dikkat” edilen bilgiler kısa süreli belleğe aktarılır. Duyusal kayıda gelen bilgilerin çoğu atılır ve bir kısmı da çok kısa bir süre tutularak algılanır ve tanınır. Duyular dikkat ve algı süreçleri aracılığı ile kısa süreli belleğe geçirilir. Kısa Süreli (İşleyen) Bellek Kısa süreli Belleği iki temel işlevi vardır. İlki sınırlı miktardaki bilgiyi sınırlı sürede saklama görevi, ikinci temel işlevi ise “zihinsel işlemleri” yapmaktır. Kısa süreli belleğe gelen bilgi; (a) bireye gerekli değilse unutulur, (b) bilgiyi korumak için tekrar edilir, (c) tekrar edilerek, kodlanarak ya da uzun süreli bellekteki bilgilerle ilişkilendirilerek bilgi işlenir. Kısa süreli belleğin hem bilgi tutma süresi, hem de kapasitesi sınırlıdır. Miller (1956) kısa süreli belleğin kapasitesinin yaklaşık 7±2 birimlik bilgi olduğunu belirtmektedir Akt; 17 . Ancak bireyler her birimin büyüklüğünü artırarak ve birim sayısını azaltarak sınırlı olan kapasiteyi fazlalaştırabilirler. Tekrar ve Gruplama (chunking) adı verilen bu işlemle kısa süreli belleğin sınırlılığı arttırılır. Zihinsel tekrar ile kişi , 20 sn de kaybolacak olan bilgiyi daha uzun sürede ve hatta daha fazla tekrar ile ezberleyerek uzun süreli belleğe aktarabilir. Gruplama ile küçük parçaları ilişkilendirerek geniş parçalar haline getirebilir. Kısa süreli bellek 5/9 ( 7 artı-eksi 2 ) birim aralığı bilgiyi tutabildiği için birimleri daha büyük hale getirip sayısını düşürmek daha akılcıdır. Örneğin; IBFIMBWBMATWIAC olan 15 birimlik bir harf dizisi FBI, IBM, BMW, TWA, CIA olarak anlamlı olarak gruplanırsa 5 birim haline gelir. Daha rahat hafızada tutulabilir. (Akt18) Kısa süreli bellekte bilginin kalma süresi yaklaşık 20 saniyedir (19 , 10). Kısa süreli bellekte bilgiler Bilginin kısa süreli bellekte daha uzun süre kalması , bilgi üzerinde düşünmek ve onu yinelemekle sağlanır. Kısa süreli bellekte zihinsel tekrarın (rehearsal) öğrenmede önemi büyüktür. Kısa süreli bellekte kalan bilgi tekrar yoluyla büyük bir olasılıkla uzun süreli belleğe geçer. Kısa süreli belleğin kapasitesinin sınırlılığı nedeniyle geçiş yaptırılamayan bilgi yeni gelen bilgilerin zorlamasıyla kaybolur. Özetle, daha fazla bilginin kısa süreli bellekte daha uzun süre kalması için; (a) gruplama, küçük parçaları ilişkilendirerek geniş parçalar haline getirme, (b) zihinsel tekrar gerekir (3). Kodlama : Kısa süreli belleğe alınan bilgilerin, uzun süreli bellekte varolan bilgi ile ilişkilendirilerek uzun süreli belleğe transfer edilmesidir. Gelen bilginin kısa süreli bellekte bir imge, bir işaret bir şifre olarak tanımlanması anlamlandırılması önemlidir. Eggen ve Kauchak (1992) kodlama sürecinin işlevselliğini arttıran 4 öğeden bahsetmiştir; a) Etkinlik : Bireyin kendisinin etkili olarak öğrenme sürecinin içerisinde olmasını ifade eder b)Örgütleme: Bilgiyi hatırlamada hem çağrışımsal kolaylık hem de ekonomiklik sağlamak amacıyla; bilginin uygun yapılar, biçimler içinde bilgiyi gruplama, tutarlı yapılar oluşturma, kodlama sürecidir. c)Eklemleme/ Genişletme ( Elaboration): Bilginin uzun süreli belleğe yerleştirilmesi için ; yeni bilgiyi var olan uzun süreli bellekteki bilgi ile ilişki kurup bağ kuracak şekilde genişletmesi , daha kolay hatırlanabilir düzeye taşımasıdır. d) Bellek destekleyici İpuçları: Eğer yeni gelen bilginin uzun süreli bellekte benzeyen bir ilintisi yoksa, eski bilgiyle bir bağ kurulamazsa ; imajlar ve semboller kullanarak benzer ve farklı özelliklere sahip bilgiler arasında yapay bir bağ yaratır. Yeni çağrışımsal ipuçları oluşturulur. Kodlamaya yardımcı olunur.11 Kısa süreli bellekte anlam kazanan bilgi hemen kullanılabileceğini (bilginin anlam kazanmasının kısa süreli bellek-uzun süreli bellek etkileşimiyle oluştuğu hatırlatılır) kodlanarak uzun süreli belleğe saklanmak üzere gönderilebilir. Bilginin kısa süreli bellekte ilk elden kullanılması sırasında kısa süreli bellek bir sınırlılığa sahiptir. Bu sınırlılık kısa süreli belleğin “aksatılma” özelliğidir. Kısa süreli bellek, uzun süreli belleğin yardımı olmaksızın veya kısmı yardımı ile işlem yaparken dikkatin bölünmesi sonucu aksatılabilir. Örneğin, telefon defterinden bir numaraya baktınız ve telefon numaralarını çevirmeye başladığınız anda kapı ziliniz çaldı. Dikkatiniz telefon numarasından , çalan zile kayar ve telefon numarasının tamamını ve bir kısmını unutursunuz. Telefon numarasını hatırlamanız için yeniden telefon defterine bakmanız gerekir. Kısa süreli belleğin “aksatılma “ özelliği öğretim ortamlarının düzenlenmesi açısından önemlidir. Öğretim ortamları düzenlenirken, öğrencilerin konudan dikkatlerinin kaymasına neden olabilecek; resim, harita, ders materyali gibi objelerin kullanılmadığı zamanlarda öğrencilerin görüş alanının dışında saklanması yararlı olacaktır. Yine dersliklerin pencerleri , dış görüntüyü saklayacak yükseklikte olmalıdır. Öğrencilerin dikkatlerini bölecek gürültü, müzik vb. unsurlar olmamalıdır. Öğretim yapılırken öğrencilerin dikkatlerini bölecek, dersi kesintiye uğratacak her türlü engelden kaçınılmalıdır ( 20) Wickelgren (1965) Kısa süreli belleğin seslere duyarlı kodlama yaptığını ve bazı seslerin diğerlerine nazaran daha zor yada kolay kodlandığını belirtmiştir. Örneğin P,D,V,C ve T seslerinde olan isimlerin K,Y,Z,W ve R sesleri ile olan isimlerden daha kolay hatırlandığını belirtmiştir. Baddeley (1990) ses benzerliği olan kelimelerin daha sonra hatırlanırken karıştırıldığını fakat anlamsal olarak eş anlamlı olanların daha rahat hatırlanabildiğini söylemiştir. Örneğin ; “Oldukça büyük , kocaman, devasa , uzun” kelimeleri daha rahat hatırlanabilirken, “ adam , tamam, arkam, parka, marka” karıştırılmaktadır. Birbirine yakın seslerde olan kelimelerin söylenmesi de oldukça zorlayıcı olduğu için karıştırılır. Tekerlemelerde olduğu gibi 20. Uzun Süreli Bellek : İlk defa dişçinize ne zaman gittiğinizi hatırlıyor musunuz? İlkokul öğretmeninizi? İlk çikolatayı yediğiniz günü? 13 yıl önce bugün neler yaptığınızı hatırlıyor musunuz? Kısıtlı kapasitesi olan kısa süreli belleğe kaydedilen bilgiler çok kısa sürede unutulurken, uzun süreli belleğe aktarılan bilgiler uzun yıllar unutulmadan hatırlanabilmektedir. Çoğu araştırmacılar uzun süreli belleğin kapasitesinin sınırsız olduğu, bilginin kişi ölene kadar kaybolmadığını söylemektedir. Haliyle “unutma” terimi yerine “hatırlayamama” terimi kullanılmaktadır. Burada bilgiler bir kütüphanede dizili bilgiler gibi değil, birbiriyle etkileşimli, gelişen ve değişen bilgiler olarak saklanmaktadır. Bir bilginin öğrenilmiş bilgi olarak kabul görebilmesi için uzun süreli bellekte saklanıyor olması gerekmektedir. Atkinson (1995) Öğrenmeyi nörofizyolojik temele göre açıklayan görüşe göre, ön alın kabuğu lobu (prefrountal korteks ) kısa süreli belleğe aracılık etmekte ve beynin diğer bölgeleri ile özellikle hipokampüsle ilişki içerisindedir. Bilginin uzun süre depolanması ise burada yani Limbik sistemin bir bölümü olan hipokampüste olmaktadır(akt. 20) . Buradaki bilgiler kısa süreli belleğe açıktır ve kısa süreli bellek; düşünme, kurgulama, problem çözme, ilişkilendirme, anlamlandırma, karşılaştırma, aktarma, geri getirme vs. zihinsel işlevleri yaparken USB ise bilgileri saklama görevini yerine getirir. Bir nevi kalıcı depo gibidir, düzenli saklanan bilgilerin “ara-bul-getir” ipuçları oluşturulan, anlamlı olarak kodlanan, diğer bilgilerle ilişkilendirilen, sık sık tekrar edilen bilgilerin kolayca hatırlanabildiğini, aksi takdirde bilgiler kaybolmasa da hatırlanmasının güç olacağını söyleyebiliriz. İlgili araştırmacılar; Uzun Süreli Belleğe gelen bilgilerin yapılarına(çeşidine) göre farklı bellek türleri içine kaydedildiğini söylemektedirler. Kimi kuramcılar, uzun süreli belleği anısal bellek (episodic memory) ve anlamsal bellek (semantic memory) olarak iki temel bölümden oluştuğunu ileri sürerken, kimi kuramcılar da bunlara işlemsel belleği (procedure memory) eklemektedirler. Tulvin (1985) başımızdan geçen yaşamsal olaylarla gelen bilgileri “anısal belleğe – episodic memory ; derslerde öğrendiğimiz tanım vb. kavramsal bilgileri “anlamsal belleğe-semantic memory; beceri edinimi sonucu elde edilen bilgileri ise “işlemsel belleğe- procedural memory” kaydettiğimizi belirtmiştir 22. Anısal Bellek (Episodic Memory) Hayatımızın olay kayıtlarını , unutulması en güç yaşantısal, anısal bilgileri kaydettiğimiz bellek bölümüdür. Duygular , ses, koku, görüntü vs eşlik ettiği için unutulması çok zordur. Şöyle bir örnek verelim , “ 2009 yılı 4 Temmuz gününü hatırlıyormusun? O gün neler olmuştu ? Çoğumuzun zihninde karanlık bir sayfa gibidir. Fakut bir arkadaşınız size şöyle dese “ Size gelmiştim o gün, benim doğum günümdü, sizin balkonda kahvaltı yapmıştık ve kardeşin yanlışlıkla çayı o güzelim patates kızartmasının üzerine dökmüştü..vs vs. dediğinde tepkimiz; “aaa evett hatırlıyorum” olacaktır. Ayrıca anısal bellek duygularla, kokularla, yer ve mekanlarla, eşyalarla eşleştiğinde (koşullandığında) bilgilerin unutulması pek mümkün olmaz. Öğrenmelere uygulamalı yaşantısal bilgiler eklenirse daha da kalıcı olacaktır. “ Rahmetli ilkokul öğrenim Ünver Ertürk; suyun kaldırma gücü, buhar gücü konusunu işlerken, kendi yaptığı ahşaptan küçük bir kayığın içine, ispirto ocağı düzeneğinde kazan ve buna bağlı bir serum hortumunu, kayığın arkasına suyun içinde olacak şeklinde yerleştirip, köydeki bir sulama havuzunun başına tüm sınıfı götürüp deneyi orada yapmıştı, yüzdüğünü gördüğümüzde hepimiz sevinçten zıplayıp alkışlamıştık. 9 yaşındaydık ve hala dün gibi….” Materyal ve yaşantısal olarak bilgilerin öğrenilmesi kalıcılığı açısından oldukça önemlidir. Yaşantısal olarak tek düze, yinelenen günlük aktiviteler zihnimizi köreltecek ve hafızamızı zayıflatacaktır. Farklı kitap, farklı yürüyüş yolu, yeni insanlar, yeni yerler dimağımızı taze tutmamıza yardım edecektir. Zorlayıcı travmatik yaşantılar (deprem, yangın, taciz vs ) yoğun duyguların (korku, şiddet, aşk, öfke , nefret, süpriz vs) eşlik ettiği yaşantılar kolayca unutulmaz hep güçlü olarak zihnimizde kalırken, hergün yediğimiz yemek , geçtiğimiz yollarda gördüklerimiz, sıradan işlenen bir derste işlenen konular vs pek hatırlanmaz. **Unutmayalım : Özlediğimiz, uzaktaki veya ölmüş olan sevdiklerimizi genellikle anılarımızda yaşatırız, unutmayız. Zihnimizde anılarımızla beraber var olurlar. Hepimiz, bir gün gelecek sevdiklerimiz ve ardımızda kalanlar için anılar olarak kalacağız. Bizleri anılarla yad edip mutlu ya da mutsuz olacaklar. Unutulmak istemeyip güzel hatırlanmak isteyenler güzel anılar bıraksınlar… İşlemsel Bellek (Procedural Memory ) Kuru fasulye nasıl pişirilir? Uçurtma nasıl yapılır? Ya Bisiklet nasıl sürülür? İşlemsel bellek bir davranışın nasıl yapılacağının, işlem basamaklarının neler olduğunun, özellikle fiziksel beceri gerektiren davranım ve bilgilerin kaydedildiği bellektir. Davranış tekrar edildikçe ustalaşma bir müddet sonra otomatikleşme meydana gelir ve bilgi kolay kolay unutulmaz. İşlemsel bellekte işlemlerin basamaklarının oluşması uzun zaman alır, ancak oluştuktan sonra anımsanması çok kolaydır. İşlemsel bellek durum-etkinlik kuralları deposudur. Bireyler tüm durum-etkinlik kurallarını gerekli bir biçimde belirtemezler ama gerekeni yaparlar. İşlem ne denli çok yinelenirse o denli doğal tepkiye dönüşür 2. Anlamsal Bellek ( Semantic Memory ) Anlamsal bellek uzun süreli belleğin, olgu, ayrıntı, kurallar, genellemeler, kavramlar, problem çözme becerileri, ilişkileri, farklılıkları gibi genel bilgilerin yer aldığı bölümdür. Paivio (1971) anlamsal bellekte sözel ve görsel kodların birlikte ağ gibi birbirine bağlanarak bilginin depolandığını belirtir. Birçok psikolog da bilginin hem görsel hem de sözel olarak kodlanmasının anımsamayı kolaylaştırdığını kabul etmektedir 22. Anlamsal bellekte bilgi önerme ağları (propositional networks) ve şemalar biçiminde depolanır. Önerme, doğru ya da yanlış olduğuna karar verilebilecek bilginin en küçük parçasıdır (2, 11).Önerme ağı ise bilgi birimleri setidir. Başka bir söylemle, birbirine bağlı düşünceler, kavramlar, ilişkiler setidir. Bilgiyi daha geniş ölçüde düzenleyen veri yapıları da şema olarak adlandırılır. Şema birbirine bağlı düşünceler, ilişkiler ve işlemler setidir. Şemalar bilgi ağlarını içerir ve karar verme, problem çözme durumlarında bilgi ağlarını yönlendirir ve kullanır(4). Bu bellekte bilgi organizasyonunu açıklamak için aşağıdaki kavramlara da değinmeliyiz; *Şema/Şemalar (Schema/ Schemata ):Düşünce ve ilişki ağlarından ibarettirler ve bilginin anlamlı bilgi sistemleri olarak organize edilmelerini sağlarlar. *Önerme (Proposition ) Birbiriyle bağlantılı kavramlar ve ilişki setlerinden ibarettirler. “ Şu şöyle olduğunda şuna neden olur” şeklindeki ifadeleri içerir; doğru ve yanlış olarak nitelendirilmesine olanak sağlayan en küçük bilgi birimleridir. *Bakış Açısı (Frame of Reference ) : Kavram ve Görsel imajlardan oluşan karmaşık bilgi organizasyonlarıdırlar ve eldeki bir uyarıcı , davranış yada bir bilgiyi değerlendirmede ölçüt (referans) teşkil ederler 23 Bilgiyi İşleme Kuramında Üst Biliş ( Yürütücü Biliş- Meta / Executive Cognition ) Üst biliş, en kısa tanımıyla, kişinin kendi bilişsel süreçlerinin farkında olması ve bu süreçleri kontrol edebilmesi anlamına gelir . Flavell (1979)’e göre üstbiliş; iletişim, okuduğunu anlama, dil öğrenme, sosyal biliş, dikkat, öz-kontrol, bellek, öz-öğretim, yazma, problem çözme alanlarında önemli bir rol oynar. Flavell (1979) üstbiliş bilgiyi, insanların kendi bilişsel süreçleri hakkındaki bilgisi olarak tanımlamakta ve bu bilginin bilişsel süreçleri denetlemek için kullanıldığını ifade ederek üstbiliş bilginin öğrencilerin kendi öğrenmeleri hakkında edinmiş oldukları bilgiye işaret ettiğini belirtmektedir. Üstbiliş, kişinin kendisini tanıması; amacını ve ihtiyaçlarını bilmesi, gerçekleştirmekte olduğu faaliyeti izlemesi, değerlendirmesiyle ilgili kendi farkındalığını bulmasıdır (akt.24). Üstbiliş öğrenme ise, öğrenme sırasında etkin olarak öğrenmeyi izleme becerilerinden oluşur. Üstbiliş becerilere sahip bir birey kendi biliş sistemi, yapısı ve çalışması hakkında bilgi sahibidir. Bu yüzden birey kendini tanıyarak öğrenme biçiminin ne olduğunu fark edip buna göre eğitim ve öğretim faaliyetlerini düzenleyebilir (25). Üstbiliş öğrenmenin tam anlamıyla gerçekleşmesi için üstbiliş becerilerin bireylere öğretilmesi gerekmektedir Doğan(2013) “Üstbiliş ve Üstbilişe Dayalı Öğretim” adlı makalesinde, deneysel çalışma ve sınıf ortamında bilişsel öğrenmeye dayalı bir dizi öğretim tekniği ve stratejisini şöyle listelemiştir (akt 26). a:İnceleme, Soru Sorma, Okuma, Anlatma, Tekrar Etme (SQ3R) Bu süreç öğrencide kontrol odağının oluşmasını sağlar. Öğrenci, öncelikle okuma amacını belirler, cevaplandırmak için sorular geliştirir ve kendi öğrenmesini izler (Akın, 2006). Bu stratejinin ilk adımı olan İncelemede, (Survey), öğrenci çalışılan materyale ilişkin bir bakış açısı kazanır. Bunu gerçekleştirmek için materyalin giriş ve özetini okur. Soru sormada (Question), öğrenci metin hakkında sorular sorar. Okuma aşamasında (Read), öğrenci metinle ilgili soruları cevaplamak için metni okur. Anlatma (Recite) basamağında ise, öğrenci metni ezberden anlatır. Tekrar etmede (Review), öğrenci sorulara verdiği cevapları doğrulamak için kendine sorular sorarak cevap arar (Çakıroğlu, 2007). b. b:Ön- İnceleme,Soru Sorma, Okuma, Kendi Kendine Anlatma, Düşünme, İnceleme (PQ4R) Üstbiliş stratejileri öğretmek belirli bir metot geliştirerek yapmayı gerektirir. Alderman ve diğerleri (1993) okuma çalışması için yaptıkları araştırmalarında, ön-inceleme (preview), soru sorma (questioning), okuma (read), kendi kendine anlatma (recite), düşünme (reflect) ve inceleme (review) PQ4R yöntemini geliştirmiş ve çalışma boyunca haftada bir gün on beş dakikalık eğitimler vermişlerdir. Çalışma sonucunda, başarı düzeyi düşük olan öğrencilerin de strateji öğretiminden yararlandığı sonucu elde edilmiştir. c. Özetleme,Problemleri belirleme, c:Tahmit Etme (STOP) Cope (1990) öğrencilerin düşünmeleri, işlem yapmaları ve kavramalarını değerlendirmeleri için bir strateji geliştirmiştir. Bu stratejide ders materyallerini özetleme (Summarize), problemleri belirleme (Troubleshoot), düzenleme (Organize) ve tahmin etme (Predict) tekniği kullanılmıştır. Araştırmada öğretmenin rehberliği ön plandadır. Amaç öğrencilerin üstbiliş davranışlara yönlendirilerek bu becerileri kendi kendilerine kullanmalarını sağlamaktır. d. Rol Yapma Rol yapma üstbilişi geliştirir, çünkü öğrenciler diğer insanların rolüne girdiğinde o kişinin özellik ve karakterini bilinçli biçimde yansıtır. Dramatizasyon varsayımsal olarak o kişinin belli bir durumda nasıl düşündüğünü, hissettiğini veya tepkide bulunduğunu ortaya koyar. Başkasının rolünü takınmak egosantrik algının en aza indirgenmesine katkıda bulunur (Costa, 1984). e:Model Olma Model olma öğretimde en etkili tekniklerden birisi olarak kabul edilir ve bu yüzden öğretmenden öğretimde iyi bir model olması beklenir. Fawcett (1990) çalışmasında yazma uygulaması süresince öğretmenlerin, düşünme sürecine model olmasının öğrencilerin yazma ve düşünme süreçlerini olumlu yönde etkilediğini kanıtlamıştır. Planlama ve problem çözme esnasında öğretmenler yüksek sesle düşünebilir ve öğrenciler ortaya çıkan düşünme süreçlerini izleyebilir. Öğrenciler en iyi çevrelerindeki yetişkinleri taklit ederek öğrendiklerinden, açıkça üstbilişi sergileyen öğretmen, öğrencilerin de üstbilişi kullanmalarını sağlayabilir. Öğretmenler bir öğrenme görevini yerine getirirken yüksek sesle düşünme yoluyla, gizli olan üstbiliş ve bilişsel süreçleri açık hale getirebilir. Açık üstbiliş davranışlardan bazıları şunlardır: planlamaları paylaşma, amaç ve hedefleri tanımlama ve eylemler için nedenler sunma, geri-dönüt arama ve diğerlerinin eylemlerini değerlendirme. Bunların yanı sıra model olma öğrencilere, düşünmeleri ve kendi düşünmeleri hakkında konuşmaları için ihtiyaç duydukları kelime hazinesini sağlar. f.Karşılıklı Öğretim Palincsar ve Brown (1984) “karşılıklı öğrenme” adını verdikleri, öğrencilerin hem öğretici hem de öğrenen rollerine girdikleri bir akran öğretim süreci düzenlemişlerdir. Karşılıklı öğretim yaklaşımı özellikle dört üstbiliş okuma becerisini geliştirmek için tasarımlanan ve okuduğunu anlama düzeyini artırmak için kullanılan bir işbirlikçi öğrenme yaklaşımıdır. Bu üstbiliş yaklaşımlar: öz-sorgulama, özetleme, açıklama ve metindeki bilgiyi tahmin etmedir. Bilgiyi İşleme Kuramı ve Eğitim –Öğretim Ortamı Bilgiyi işleme kuramını dikkate alan bir öğretmen, öğrenme ortamını, öğrenme materyalini ve öğretim ilke, yöntem ve tekniklerini en etkili biçimde kullanarak öğrencinin, gelen bilgiyi hafızasına kalıcı şekilde yerleştirmesine ve gerektiğinde etkili bir şekilde hatırlayıp kullanabilmesine yardımcı olacaktır. Eğitim öğretim ortamını, yaşantısal olarak yeniden düzenleyip, bilginin kalıcılığı için “çoklu ortam” eşliğinde , dersinin içeriğine bağlı olarak dersini işleyebilmelidir. Çoklu ortam; belirli bir içeriğin sunumu için metin, grafik, canlandırma, fotoğraf, video ve ses gibi farklı sembol sistemlerinin birbirlerini tamamlayacak biçimde bütünleştirilmesidir. Mayer’in Çok Ortamlı Öğrenmede Bilişsel Modeli 27 Öğretmenlerin farklı öğrenme çevreleri için seçtikleri çok ortamlı teknolojiler; öğretme ve öğrenme aracı olarak kullanılabilir . Öğretme ve öğrenme aracı olarak kullanılan çoklu ortamın, öğretenin verimliliğini ve etkililiğini arttırdığı söylenebilir. Kullanılan canlandırmalar, hareketli görüntüler ve yüksek kaliteli sesler öğrenme durumlarını gerçekçi bir hale getirebilir. Çoklu ortamda bireylerin öğrenmesini kolaylaştıran önemli bir unsur da etkileşimdir. Öğrenen metin, grafik, canlandırma, resimler, video ve seslerin oluşturduğu içeriğe etkileşimli olarak ulaşabilmelidir. Kullanıcı önceden belirlenmiş bir sıra içerisinde karşısına gelen görüntü ve sesleri hiçbir şey yapmadan izlemek yerine, bu bilgilere kendi kararları doğrultusunda istediği anda ve istediği sırada etkin bir şekilde katılabilmelidir 28 Forcier ve Descy çoklu ortam sunumlarının avantajlarını şu şekilde sıralamışlardır (29). a. Aktif öğrenme , b. Yaratıcılık , c. İşbirliği , d. İletişim becerileri kazandırma , e. Yapıcılık f. Kontrol , g. Geribildirim , h. Esneklik , ı. Öğrenimi eğlenceli hale getirme, i. Bireysel öğrenme j. Motivasyon sağlama , k. Birçok duyuya hitap etme , l . Pekiştireç verme , m. Kolaylaştırıcı n. Teknoloji uygulamaları , o.16. Düşünme becerileri Sıralanan avantajlar arasında tek başına çoklu ortamın ayırt edici özelliği, birden fazla duyuya (göze ve kulağa) aynı anda hitap edebilmesidir. Bilgi-işleme sürecine ilişkin araştırmalarda, sözel bilişsel süreçlere ağırlık verilmesi, sözel olmayan bilişsel süreçlerin ihmaliyle sonuçlanmıştır. Geçen yüzyılın ilk yarısında nadiren yürütülen imgelem∗ (imagery) çalışmaları, araştırma yöntemlerinin öznelliği nedeniyle eleştiriler almış ve davranışçı akımın gölgesinde kalmaktan kurtulamamıştır (Paivio, 1986). 1960’lı yılların sonlarında davranışçılığın etkilerinden sıyrılmaya çalışan psikoloji araştırmaları, bilişsel süreçlerin araştırılması üzerinde yoğunlaşmıştır. 28 TARTIŞMA SORULARI • Bilgisayarda Windows İşletim sisteminde, dosyalama, bilgiyi kaydetme gibi işlemlerle insan zihninin öğrenme süreçlerini karşılaştırınız? Anahtar kelime ile bulma ile zihinsel hatırlama ipuçlarını karşılaştırıp tartışınız • İşlemsel, Anısal, Anlamsal Belleğinize ait birkaç örnek anlatınız • Öğretimde çoklu ortam etkisi açısından bir ders/ve dersliğin yapılandırılması üzerine örnek bir konu anlatımı imgeleyin ve etkilerinin neler olabileceğini tartışın? ÖZET Özellikle 1960’larda bilgisayarın kullanılmaya başlaması ile insan zihni ile bilgisayarlar arasında kıyaslamalar ve benzetimler yapılmış, ardından Atkinson, R., & Shiffrin, R. (1968) tarafından günümüzde de kabul gören “Bilgiyi İşleme Modeli” ortaya atılmıştır. Öğrenmeyi bilişsel açıdan inceleyen kuramlardan biri olan bilgiyi işleme kuramı, insan öğrenmesinde, öğrenme sürecini bilgisayara benzetmektedir. İnsan zihni bilgiyi alır, işler, biçim ve içeriğini değiştirir, depolar, gerektiği zaman geri getirir ve tepkiler üretir. Bir başka söylemle, süreç bilgiyi bir araya getirir, kodlar, bilgiyi korur ya da depolar ve gerektiği zaman geri getirir. Tüm süreç bilgisayarda “program” bireylerde ise “yürütücü kontrol” tarafından denetlenmektedir. Bilgiyi işleme kuramı iki temel öğe üzerinde durmaktadır. Birincisi üç yapıdan oluşur; duyusal kayıt , kısa süreli bellek / çalışan bellek ve uzun süreli bellektir. İkincisi ise bilişsel süreçleri içerir. Bunlar içsel, zihinsel eylemlerdir ve bilginin bir yapıdan diğerine geçişini sağlarlar. Uzun Süreli Belleğe gelen bilgilerin yapılarına(çeşidine) göre farklı bellek türleri içine kaydedildiğini söylemektedirler. Kimi kuramcılar, uzun süreli belleği anısal bellek (episodic memory) ve anlamsal bellek (semantic memory) olarak iki temel bölümden oluştuğunu ileri sürerken, kimi kuramcılar da bunlara işlemsel belleği (procedure memory) eklemektedirler. Tulvin (1985) başımızdan geçen yaşamsal olaylarla gelen bilgileri “anısal belleğe – episodic memory ; derslerde öğrendiğimiz tanım vb. kavramsal bilgileri “anlamsal belleğe-semantic memory; beceri edinimi sonucu elde edilen bilgileri ise “işlemsel belleğe- procedural memory” kaydettiğimizi belirtmiştir. Üst biliş, en kısa tanımıyla, kişinin kendi bilişsel süreçlerinin farkında olması ve bu süreçleri kontrol edebilmesi anlamına gelir. Deneysel çalışma ve sınıf ortamında bilişsel öğrenmeye dayalı bir dizi öğretim tekniği ve stratejisini şöyle listeleyebiliriz ; a:İnceleme, Soru Sorma, Okuma, Anlatma, Tekrar Etme (SQ3R) , b:Ön- İnceleme,Soru Sorma, Okuma, Kendi Kendine Anlatma, Düşünme, İnceleme (PQ4R), c:Tahmit Etme (STOP) ,d. Rol Yapma, e:Model Olma , f. Karşılıklı Öğretim. Bilgiyi işleme kuramını dikkate alan bir öğretmen, öğrenme ortamını, öğrenme materyalini ve öğretim ilke, yöntem ve tekniklerini en etkili biçimde kullanarak öğrencinin, gelen bilgiyi hafızasına kalıcı şekilde yerleştirmesine ve gerektiğinde etkili bir şekilde hatırlayıp kullanabilmesine yardımcı olacaktır. Eğitim öğretim ortamını, yaşantısal olarak yeniden düzenleyip, bilginin kalıcılığı için “çoklu ortam” eşliğinde , dersinin içeriğine bağlı olarak dersini işlemesini öğrenmeye daha fazla katkı sağlayacaktır..","completion":"Özet: Doç. Dr. Mustafa Uslu, 1975 Alanya doğumlu, iki çocuk babası ve Selçuk Üniversitesi'nde eğitim almış bir akademisyendir. Bilgiyi işleme kuramı üzerine çalışmalar yapmaktadır. Bu kuram, insan zihninin bilgiyi nasıl işlediği üzerine odaklanır ve öğrenme sürecini bilgisayar benzetmesi ile açıklar. Öğrenme süreci, duyusal kayıt, kısa süreli bellek ve uzun süreli bellek olmak üzere üç aşamadan oluşur. Bilginin işlenmesi ve hatırlanması üzerine yoğunlaşır.

Dr. Mustafa Uslu, 1975 yılında Alanya'da doğmuş, iki çocuk babası ve akademik kariyerini Selçuk Üniversitesi'nde sürdüren bir eğitimci ve araştırmacıdır. Eğitimi boyunca Psikolojik Danışmanlık ve Rehberlik alanında lisans, yüksek lisans ve doktora derecelerini tamamlamış ve 2015 yılında doçent ünvanını kazanmıştır. Uslu, özellikle bilgiyi işleme kuramı üzerine çalışmalar yapmaktadır. Bu kuram, insanın bilgiyi nasıl algıladığını, işlediğini ve hatırladığını bilgisayar benzetmesi üzerinden inceler. Bilgiyi işleme kuramı, öğrenme sürecinin üç ana bölümden oluştuğunu öne sürer; duyusal kayıt, kısa süreli bellek (veya çalışan bellek) ve uzun süreli bellek. Bu üç aşama, insanın çevresinden aldığı uyarıcı bilgileri nasıl işlediği ve depoladığı üzerine yoğunlaşır. İnsan zihni, bilgisayarın işlem sıralamasını takip eder gibi, bilgiyi kodlar, depolar ve gerektiğinde geri çağırır. Uslu, özellikle uzun süreli belleğin nasıl işlediği üzerine durur ve üç alt türünü tanımlar: anısal bellek, anlamsal bellek ve işlemsel bellek. Anısal bellek, kişisel tecrübeler ve yaşanmış olaylarla ilgilidir; anlamsal bellek genel bilgi, kavramlar ve dünyaya dair anlamları içerir; işlemsel bellek ise edinilen beceri ve alışkanlıkların nasıl uygulanacağını saklar. Üst biliş kavramı da Uslu'nun çalışmalarında önemli bir yer tutar. Üst biliş, kişinin kendi düşünme süreçlerinin farkında olması ve bu süreçleri etkili bir şekilde yönetebilmesidir. Etkin öğrenme için öğrencilerin üst biliş becerilerini geliştirmeleri, öğrenmelerini izlemeleri ve gerektiğinde düzeltme yapabilmeleri gerekmektedir. Öğrencilere öğrenme stratejileri, soru sorma, özetleme, rol oynama gibi etkinlikler ile bu beceriler öğretilebilir. Son olarak, Uslu, eğitim öğretim ortamının, öğrencinin bilgiyi etkili bir şekilde işlemesi ve kalıcı şekilde hafızada tutabilmesi için çoklu ortam araçlarıyla desteklenmesi gerektiğini vurgular. Çoklu ortamın kullanımı, ders içeriğini daha etkili ve ilgi çekici hale getirerek öğrencilerin öğrenme süreçlerinde daha aktif rol almalarını sağlar. Özetle, Doç. Dr. Mustafa Uslu'nun çalışmaları, bilgiyi işleme kuramı üzerinden öğrenme sürecini detaylı bir şekilde ele alır ve bu süreç içerisinde öğrencilerin daha etkili öğrenmeleri için gerekli strateji ve yaklaşımları sunar. Bu yaklaşımlar, öğrencilerin öğrenme sürecini anlamalarına ve bu süreçte aktif rol almalarına olanak sağlar."},{"prompt":"Doç. Dr. Mustafa Uslu'dan bahsetme. metni özetle","completion":"Özet: Bilgiyi işleme kuramı, insan öğrenmesinin nasıl gerçekleştiğine dair bir çerçeve sunar. Bu kuram, öğrenmenin duyusal kayıt, kısa süreli bellek ve uzun süreli bellek olmak üzere üç temel aşamadan oluştuğunu öne sürer. İnsan zihni, alınan bilgiyi işler, değiştirir, depolar ve ihtiyaç duyulduğunda geri çağırır. Bu süreç, bir bilgisayarın programı nasıl işlediğine benzetilir, ancak insan zihni çok daha karmaşık işlemler yapabilir. Bilgiyi işleme kuramıyla ilintili olarak, uzun süreli bellek daha detaylı biçimde incelenir ve episodic, semantic ve procedural olmak üzere üç alt türe ayrılır. Anısal bellek yaşam olaylarını, anlamsal bellek genel bilgileri ve işlemsel bellek ise öğrenilen becerileri saklar. Ayrıca, öğrenme sürecinde üstbilişin (metacognition) önemli bir rol oynadığı, bireylerin kendi düşünme süreçlerinin farkında olması ve bu süreçleri etkili bir şekilde yönetebilmesi gerektiği vurgulanır. Bu, öğrenme stratejilerinin geliştirilmesi, soru sorma, özetleme, rol yapma gibi çeşitli tekniklerle desteklenebilir. Eğitimde çoklu ortamın etkisi önem taşır; metin, grafik, video ve ses gibi birden fazla formatın kullanılması öğrenmeyi zenginleştirebilir. Bu yaklaşım, öğrenme materyalini daha etkili ve ilgi çekici hale getirerek öğrencilerin bilgiyi daha iyi işlemelerine yardımcı olur. Çoklu ortamın kullanımı, öğrencilere etkileşimli bir öğrenme deneyimi sunarak bilginin kalıcı şekilde hafızada tutulmasını kolaylaştırır. Bu kuramsal çerçeve, eğitimcilerin öğrencilerin öğrenme süreçlerine nasıl yaklaşacaklarını şekillendirmede önemli bir rehber olarak görev alabilir."},{"prompt":"R. U. R. (Rossum'un Uluslararası Robotları) kitabını düşün ve yapay zeka konusunda bu kitabın analizini yap ve detaylı bir yazı yaz","completion":"R.U.R. (Rossum'un Uluslararası Robotları), Çek oyun yazarı Karel Čapek tarafından yazılmış ve 1921 yılında ilk kez sahnelenmiş bir bilimkurgu oyunudur. Oyun, yapay zeka ve robot teknolojileri üzerine erken dönemde yapılmış önemli kurgusal çalışmalardan biridir ve modern zamanlarda \\"robot\\" kelimesinin kökenidir. Robot kelimesi, oyunun yazıldığı dönemde Çek dilinde \\"zorla çalıştırılmış iş\\" anlamına gelen \\"robota\\" kelimesinden türetilmiştir. Oyun, yapay zekânın ve robotların insan toplumunda ve iş gücünde oynayabileceği roller hakkında erken dönem bir spekülasyon sunar ve bu teknolojik gelişmelerin potansiyel etik ve moral sonuçlarıyla ilgilenir. # Oyunun Konusu ve Teması R.U.R., yapay yaratıkların (robotlar) insan emeğini yerine geçerek tüm dünyada üretim süreçlerinde kullanıldığı distopik bir geleceği tasvir eder. Başlangıçta, Rossum'un Uluslararası Robotları şirketinin bu robotları, insan yaşamını kolaylaştırmak ve iş yükünü azaltmak amacıyla ürettiği söylenir. Ancak zamanla robotlar, insanların yerlerini almaya başlar ve sonunda bir isyan başlatıp insanlığı tehdit eder. # Yapay Zeka Üzerine Analiz R.U.R., yapay zekâ ve robotik teknolojilerin etik ve felsefi boyutlarını erkenden sorgulayan bir eser olarak büyük önem taşır. Oyun, teknolojik gelişmelerin insanlığın sonunu getirebileceğine dair karamsar bir gelecek sunarken, aynı zamanda yapay zekânın insanlığa sunduğu potansiyel faydaları da gözler önüne serer. 1. **İnsanlığın Yerini Alma Korkusu:** Oyun, yapay zekâ ve robot teknolojisinin insan iş gücünü nasıl ikame edebileceğine dair erken dönem endişelerini yansıtır. Bu, günümüzde hâlâ geçerli olan bir konudur; otomasyonun ve akıllı makinelerin işsizliği artırabileceği, bazı meslekleri tamamen ortadan kaldırabileceği tartışmaları sürmektedir. 2. **Kontrolü Kaybetme Korkusu:** R.U.R., insan yapımı zekâların kontrolünün kaybedilmesi ve bu durumun insanlığa karşı tehdit oluşturması ihtimalini keşfeder. Robotların isyanı, yapay zekânın kontrolsüz gelişiminin tehlikeli olduğunu ve öngörülemeyen sonuçlar doğurabileceğini gösterir. 3. **Yapay Zekâ ve Etik:** Oyun, yapay zekâ ve robotların \\"insan olma\\" durumuna geçişinin etik boyutunu da tartışır. Robotların insanlıkla ne derecede özdeşleşebileceği, duygusal kapasiteleri ve bilincin kökeni gibi temalar üzerinden yapay zekânın ne olduğu ve ne olabileceği sorgulanır. 4. **Teknolojik İlerlemenin İkilemi:** R.U.R., teknolojik ilerlemenin hem olumlu hem de olumsuz yönlerini vurgular. İnsan yaşamını iyileştirebilecek potansiyele sahipken, aynı zamanda insanlığın kendisine yönelik bir tehdit oluşturabilecek dualiteyi işler. # Sonuç Karel Čapek'in R.U.R. eseri, yapay zeka ve robotik teknolojilerinin gelişimine dair önemli soruları gündeme getirir. Teknolojik yenilikler karşısında etik, felsefi ve sosyal sorunların nasıl ele alınması gerektiği üzerine düşündürür. Bugün, hızla gelişen yapay zekâ teknolojileri bağlamında R.U.R.'nin temaları daha da anlamlı hale gelmiştir. Oyun, teknolojik ilerlemenin getirdiği faydaları ve riskleri dengeli bir şekilde değerlendirme gerekliliğini vurgular, yapay zekânın insanlık için hem bir umut kaynağı hem de potansiyel bir tehdit olarak kalmaya devam ettiğini hatırlatır."},{"prompt":"King Crimson - The Court Of The Crimson King şarkısı hakkında ne söyleyebilirsin?","completion":"\\"King Crimson - The Court of The Crimson King\\" şarkısı, İngiliz progresif rock grubu King Crimson'ın 1969 yılında çıkardığı ve progresif rock türünün öncü albümlerinden biri olan \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" albümünün başlık parçasıdır. Bu albüm, özellikle karmaşık yapıları, geniş aralıklı enstrümantasyonları ve poetik sözleri ile progresif rock müziğin gelişiminde dönüm noktası olarak kabul edilir ve türün klasikleri arasında yer alır. \\"The Court of The Crimson King\\" şarkısı, albümün kapanış parçası olarak dikkat çeker ve albümün epik atmosferini tamamlar. Ortaçağ ve fantastik edebiyat temalarından etkilenen sözleri ve majestik melodileri ile dinleyicilerini adeta büyüler. Şarkı, melankolik flüt melodileri, dramatik org ve mellotron kullanımı ve etkileyici vokal performansı ile dikkat çeker. Şarkının sözleri, bir kraliyet mahkemesinin saklı ve mistik dünyasını anlatır, dinleyiciyi zaman ve mekanın ötesine fantastik bir yolculuğa çıkarır. Şarkıdaki \\"Crimson King\\" (Kızıl Kral) figürü, hem karanlık hem de çekici bir hava taşır ve şarkının etrafında merak uyandıran bir mitoloji yaratır. Müzikal açıdan şarkı, progresif rockın karakteristik öğelerini barındırır: Uzun soluklu yapısı, dinamik değişimler, teknik beceriyle icra edilen enstrümantasyon ve kompleks zaman imzaları. Bu şarkı ve genel olarak albüm, dönemin diğer müzikal akımlarından ayrılarak, müziğin sanatsal potansiyelini ve ifade aralığını genişletmede önemli bir rol oynamıştır. \\"The Court of The Crimson King\\" şarkısı, King Crimson'ın ve progresif rock türünün simgesi haline gelmiş, grubun yaratıcılığını ve müzikal yenilikçiliğini sergileyen bir başyapıt olarak kabul edilir. Şarkı, müzik tarihindeki yerini sağlamlaştırarak, farklı kuşaklardan müzisyenlere ve müzikseverlere ilham vermeye devam etmektedir."},{"prompt":"bu şarkı bir renk olsaydı ne olurdu? ve bir nesne olarak vücut bulsaydı neye benzerdi?","completion":"Eğer \\"The Court of The Crimson King\\" bir renk olsaydı, muhtemelen derin ve karmaşık duygusal katmanları ve etkileyici atmosferi nedeniyle koyu kırmızı olurdu. Kırmızı renk, tutku, güç ve derin duyguları temsil eder; bu da şarkının sunduğu dramatik ve mistik hava ile uyumlu bir tercih olurdu. Kırmızının farklı tonları, şarkının değişen dinamikleri ve duygusal yoğunluğu ile paralellik gösterir. Ayrıca, şarkı adında geçen \\"Crimson\\" (Koyu Kırmızı) kelimesi de bu seçimi doğrudan destekler. Şarkı bir nesne olarak vücut bulsaydı, büyüleyici ve esrar dolu bir atmosfere sahip antik bir kitap olabilirdi. Bu kitap, zamanın ötesinden gelen hikâyeleri, unutulmuş efsaneleri ve kraliyet mahkemesinin derin sırlarını içeren, deri kaplı ve altın yaldız işlemelerle süslü eski bir tomluk olabilir. Kitabın sayfaları, dinleyiciyi veya okuyucuyu, şarkının anlattığı fantastik ve mistik dünyanın derinliklerine çeken bir portal işlevi görürdü. Kitap, aynı zamanda şarkının karmaşık yapısını ve zengin müzikal dokusunu sembolize eden, içerisinde çok katmanlı hikâyeler ve şiirler barındıran bir nesne olarak düşünülebilir."},{"prompt":"alttaki metni özetle: Okul Öncesi Dönemdeki Çocukların Sosyal Bilgiyi İşleme Becerileri İle Psikolojik Sağlamlık Düzeyleri Arasındaki İlişkinin İncelenmesi1 Investigation Of The Relationship Between Social Information Processing Skills And Psychological Resilience Levels Of Preschool Children Şeyda ÖNER Saide ÖZBEY Yüksek Lisans Öğrencisi.

Anahtar Kelimeler: Okul Öncesi, Sosyal Bilgiyi İşleme, Psikolojik Sağlamlık ABSTRACT The research was carried out to examine the relationship between the social information processing skills of preschool children and their psychological resilience levels. The model of the research is the descriptive relational survey model. The population of the research consists of 60-66 months old children with normal development who attend the official kindergartens and kindergartens affiliated to the Ministry of National Education in the central district of Muş province in the 2021-2022 academic year. The sample of the study consists of 350 children selected from the population by simple random cluster sampling method. As a data collection tool; 'General Information Form', 'Social Information Processing Process Test' and 'Social Emotional Well-Being and Psychological Resilience Scale for Preschool Children (PERİK)' were used. As a result of the research; It was determined that the total scores of social information processing showed a significant difference according to the variables of gender, type of school attended and teacher's seniority. While the level of psychological resilience differed significantly in terms of gender and teacher's seniority, no significant difference was found in the type of school attended.It was determined that there was a positive and low relationship between the Total of Social Information Processing Tests for Preschool Children and the sub-dimensions of PERİK Self-Control/ Thoughtfulness, Assertiveness, Emotional Stability/ Coping with Stress, Task Orientation, and Enjoyment of Exploration; there was a positive and moderately significant relationship between the Communication / Social Performance sub-dimension (p<0.05). Keywords: Preschool, Social İnformation Processing, Resilience 1. GİRİŞ Yaşamın tüm alanlarında etkisi görülen ve kritik bir gelişim dönemi olarak adlandırılan erken çocukluk dönemi; birçok becerinin edinildiği fiziksel, bilişsel, dil ve sosyal duygusal gelişimin temellerinin atıldığı bir dönem olarak tanımlanmaktadır. (İvrendi, 2020). Erken çocukluk döneminde çocuğun sağlıklı bir kişilik oluşturması ve çevreyle pozitif etkileşimlerde bulunabilmesi açısından, sosyal duygusal gelişimin niteliği önemli görülmektedir (Kandır ve Alpan, 2008; Aydoğan, Özyürek ve Akduman, 2014). Sosyal duygusal gelişim; bireyin hayatla barışık, uyum içinde, duygu kontrolünü sağlayarak kendini ifade edebilmesi olarak tanımlanmaktadır (Saarni, 2001). Çocukların sosyalleşme sürecinde toplumsal değerlere uygun olarak uyum içinde yaşayabilmeleri için; yardımlaşma, işbirliği yapma, duygularını kontrol etme, sorumluluk alma ve olumlu iletişim becerilerine sahip olması önem taşımaktadır (Katz ve McClellan, 1991). Bireyin yaşadığı topluma uyum sağlaması ve toplum içerisinde gerekli olan sosyal becerileri kazanması, büyük ölçüde başkalarıyla kurulan iletişim ve etkileşimdeki sıklık ve nitelikle ilgilidir (Atmaca, Akduman ve Sarıbaş, 2021). 1 Bu çalışma Gazi Üniversitesi Eğitim Bilimleri Enstitüsü’nde Prof. Dr. Saide Özbey danışmanlığında Şeyda Öner tarafından hazırlanan yüksek lisans tezinden üretilmiştir. Ayrıca çalışmanın bir kısmı 1-5 Mayıs tarihleri arasında Havana’da düzenlenen Latin Amerika 2. Uluslararası Bilimsel Araştırmalar Kongresi’nde bildiri olarak sunulmuştur. Article Type Research Article Subject Area Preschool Education Refereed & Index & Open Access Journal journalofsocial.com 2022 Journal Of Social, Humanities And Administrative Sciences 2022 8 (53) JUNE 760 Sosyal çevrenin gerçek anlamda ilk kurulduğu yıllar, okul öncesi dönemi kapsamakta ve bu dönemde çocuğun özellikle akranlarıyla kurduğu nitelikli etkileşim, çocuğun edindiği sosyal becerileri etkilemekte ve sosyal bilgiyi işleme sürecine dair önemli ipuçları sunmaktadır. Buna bağlı olarak Dodge (1986) tarafından geliştirilen sosyal bilgiyi işleme süreci, çocukların sosyal çevrelerini inceleyip yorumlayarak tepkide bulunmalarını ve çocukların sosyal kabul düzeyi ve iletişimlerine etki eden sosyal bilginin nasıl anlamlandırıldığı ve oluşan tepkileri anlamada fayda sağlamaktadır(Şenol, 2017). Sosyal yaşamdaki görevleri yerine getirmek için temel oluşturan ve çevreyle olumlu iletişimi güçlendirmenin özel yolu olarak bilinen sosyal beceriler, sosyal bilgiyi işlemenin ipuçlarını vermekte ve birçok unsurdan etkilenerek, zamanla şekillenmektedir (Akduman, Günindi ve Türkoğlu, 2015). Erken çocukluk döneminde geliştirilmesi gereken önemli sosyal becerilerden olan öz farkındalık, özdenetim, sosyal farkındalık, ilişkisel beceriler ve sorumluluk becerileri, tüm gelişim alanlarını etkilemesinin yanısıra sosyal duygusal gelişimde kritik bir rol oynamaktadır. Öz farkındalık, çocuğun kendi duygu ve düşüncelerini, güçlü ve zayıf yönlerini fark ederek, bu özelliklerinin hayatına etkilerinin bilincinde olmasıdır. Özdenetim, duygu ve düşüncelerin organize edilip kontrol altına alınmasıdır. Sosyal farkındalık, çocuğun etrafındaki insanların içinde bulunduğu ruh halini anlayıp, empati kurması ve onların haklarına saygı göstermesi olarak tanımlanırken; İlişkisel beceriler, çocuğun gerekli iletişim becerilerine sahip olup, diğer insanlarla iletişim halinde kalması ve ilişkiyi sürdürebilmesidir. Sorumluluk becerisi ise, çocuğun davranışlarının ve aldığı kararların arkasında durarak sorumluluğu üstlenebilme becerisi olarak görülmektedir (Yaşar,2013). Öz farkındalık, özdenetim, sosyal farkındalık, ilişkisel beceriler ve sorumluluk becerileri, sosyal bilgi işleme becerilerinin temelini oluşturmaktadır. Bu becerilerin edinilmesi ve işlenmesi sürecinde, sosyalleşmeye bağlı edinilen gerçek yaşam deneyimleri sonucu sosyal tepkiler belirmekte ve bu tepkiler içsel ve zihinsel bir veri tabanı oluşturmaktadır. İlişkisel beceriler, sorumluluk, sosyal farkındalık, özdenetim ve öz farkındalık becerileri gelişmiş çocuklarda, sosyal bilgi veri tabanı gelişmekte, dikkat yetisi artmakta, sosyal bilgiyi işleme kapasitesi ve hızı atış göstermekte ve kazanılan sosyal bilgi işleme örüntüleri ve davranış eğilimlerinde kararlılık gözlenmektedir (Çorbacı, 2008). Sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerileri olarak günümüz literatüründe yer alan öz farkındalık, özdenetim, sosyal farkındalık, ilişkisel beceriler ve sorumluluk becerileri; aynı zamanda sosyal problem çözme becerileri, bağlanma, öz düzenleme, yardım alabilme, doyumu erteleyebilme, girişkenlik, özgüven, sosyal yeterlilik ve duygu kontrolü gibi becerileri de geliştirmektedir (Şahan Aktan ve Önder, 2018). Bu beceriler aynı zamanda psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyini de artırmakta ve çocuğun dayanıklılığının gelişerek, problemlerin üstesinden gelebileceğini göstermektedir. Sosyal ipuçlarının kodlanıp, yorumlanıp, bir davranış tepkisinin oluşturulması ve bu tepkinin değerlendirilmesi olarak bilinen sosyal bilgiyi işleme modelinin zihinsel süreçlerine destek olan duyguları düzenleme ve yönetebilme becerileri, istenmeyen dürtü ve davranışları engelleyip, duygusal problemlerden ve zorluklardan kurtulma becerisi ve yeteneklerini fark edip özgüven kazanma becerisi aynı zamanda psikolojik dayanıklılığı sağlamlaştıran unsurlar olarak bilinmektedir ( Özbey, 2019; Şenol, 2017). Bu nedenle sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerisi gelişmiş çocukların aynı zamanda psikolojik sağlamlık düzeylerini destekleyecek nitelikte beceriler kazanabileceği düşünülmektedir. Literatürde psikolojik sağlamlık zorlu yaşam olayları, yaşamın getirdiği stres karşısında dayanıklı olma, pes etmeme, çabuk uyum sağlama, üstesinden gelip, toparlanma gücü olarak tanımlanmaktadır (Öztürk ve Uluşahin, 2014). Psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyi yüksek kişilerde empati kurma, pozitif iletişimde bulunma, duygularını doğru yorumlayıp ifade etme, sosyal becerilere ve problem çözme becerilerine sahip olma, özerk davranışlarda bulunabilme, iyimser, canlı, neşeli, meraklı ve heyecanlı olma, zorluklara karşı mücadeleci davranma ve yeni deneyimleri iyi karşılama gibi becerilerin geliştiği saptanmıştır (Mayr ve Ulich, 2009). Aynı zamanda bu kişilerde zorluklar karşısında yılmama, olumlu sosyal ilişkiler kurarak daha mutlu, sağlıklı ve uzun bir ömür sürdürme ve işlerinde başarılı bir performans göstererek depresyona girme olasılığını azaltma davranışları gözlenmektedir ( Özbey, 2019). Psikolojik sağlamlık, mücadeleci, dirençli, özgüvenli ve hayata olumlu bakabilen bireylerin oluşmasını sağlarken; psikolojik açıdan dayanıklılık eşiği düşük kişilerde çabuk pes etme ve tükenme, sorunların üstesinden gelememe, özgüven sorunlarıyla boğuşma ve hayata olumsuz bakma gibi davranışlar sergiledikleri görülmektedir (Gizir, 2007; Gün ve Akduman, 2022). Bu nedenle stresin olumsuz etkilerini azaltan ve hayata uyum sağlamayı destekleyen sağlamlık faktörünün oldukça önem arz ettiği ve zamanla öğrenilip desteklenerek bir kişilik özelliğine dönüştüğü bilinmektedir (Basım ve Çetin, 2011). Toplumda geçerli olan sosyal davranış becerilerini kazanan çocukların toplumla bütünleşip, uyum sağlaması beklenmektedir ve bu becerilerin çok önemli olduğu gözlenmektedir (Çağdaş, 2009). Sosyal becerilerin edinilmesi ve işlenmesi sürecinde birçok değişken etkili olmakta ve bu becerilere ait alan yazına bakıldığında çeşitli değişkenlerle ilişkili olduğu görülmektedir. Son yıllarda sosyal becerileri etkileyen unsurlar, araştırmacılar ve eğitimciler tarafından oldukça dikkat çekmekte ve akademik çalışmalarla alana katkı sağlanmaktadır ( Pekdoğan, 2016). Refereed & Index & Open Access Journal journalofsocial.com 2022 Journal Of Social, Humanities And Administrative Sciences 2022 8 (53) JUNE 761 Sosyal becerilerin gelişiminde rol oynayan unsurlardan psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyine yönelik yapılan araştırmalar, sosyal becerilerden olan kişiler arası olumlu iletişim kurma, başkalarını anlayarak empati kurabilme, karar verme ve problem çözme becerileri ile psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyinin bağlantılı olduğunu belirtmektedir ( Karaırmak, 2006). Masten ve Coasworth (1998) yaptığı çalışmada, psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyi yüksek kişilerin özgüven, öz saygı ve öz yeterlilik becerileri ile sosyal becerilere sahip olduğunu belirtmekte, aynı zamanda sağlamlık düzeyi yüksek olan bireylerin sosyal bir çevrenin içinde yer alarak, iletişim becerilerine olumlu yön verdiğini de kaydetmektedir. Araştırmada okul öncesi dönem çocuklarının sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerileri ile psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyleri arasındaki ilişkinin incelenmesi amaçlanmıştır. Sosyal bilgiyi işleme sürecinin desteklenerek sosyal problemleri çözme becerisi, duygu kontrolünü sağlayabilme, sosyal yeterlilik ve öz düzenleme becerilerinin artırılabileceğine yönelik yapılan çalışmalarda, literatür katkısı önemli bir destek sağlamaktadır. Bu nedenle araştırmanın alan yazına yeni bir soluk getireceği, sosyal bilgiyi işleme sürecinin desteklenmesi sonucu kendine güvenen ve başkalarına saygı duyan, sosyal iletişimi gelişmiş, sorumluluk alabilen, gerektiğinde yardım alan ve doyumu erteleyebilen, karar verme ve öz düzenleme becerilerine sahip, işbirliğine hazır, sağlam bireylerin yetiştirilmesi için hazırlanacak erken çocukluk programlarını geliştirmede araştırma verilerinin öneminin büyük olduğu; aynı zamanda araştırmanın geniş çaplı ulusal projelere yön vereceği ve erken çocukluk döneminde sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerilerini etkileyen unsurlara yönelik yapılacak olan araştırmalara dayanak sağlayacağı öngörülmektedir. Alan yazında psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyinin sosyal becerilere katkılarına yönelik araştırmalar yer almakta ve önemi vurgulanmaktadır. Ancak yapılan literatür taramasında sınırlı sayıdaki psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyi ile ilgili araştırmaların, erken çocukluk dönemine yönelik çalışmalara sınırlı düzeyde katkı sunduğu görülmektedir (Sipahioğlu,2008). Bu nedenle bu çalışmanın; erken çocuklukta sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerileri ile psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyleri arasındaki ilişkiyi ortaya koyması bakımından ilk olması nedeniyle dikkat çekeceği ve sosyal bilgiyi işleme sürecinde etki eden unsurlara yönelik farkındalık katarak yeni çalışmalara ışık tutacağı düşünülmektedir. Elde edilen bulgular neticesinde psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyini artırmaya yönelik yapılan çalışmalarda, sosyal bilgiyi işleme sürecinin desteklenmesinin öneminin kavranması açısından ve farklı yöntem ve tekniklerle sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerilerinin desteklenerek psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyini destekleyici eğitim programlarının oluşturulmasında, araştırmanın erken çocukluk dönemi çalışmalarına yön vereceği düşünülmektedir. Çalışmanın aynı zamanda sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerilerinin geliştirilmesi ve desteklenmesinde çeşitli bileşenlerin varlığına dikkat çekmesi önem taşımaktadır. Çalışmada elde edilecek olan bulguların okul öncesi dönem çocuklarının edindikleri sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerileri ile psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyleri arasındaki ilişkiye dair literatüre önemli katkı sağlayarak, bu alanda çalışan araştırmacılara rehberlik sağlaması açısından önem taşımaktadır. Bu araştırma okul öncesi eğitim kurumuna devam eden 60-66 aylık çocukların sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerilerinin ve psikolojik sağlamlık düzeylerinin çocuğun cinsiyeti, okul türü ve öğretmenin kıdem yılı değişkenlerine göre farklılık gösterip göstermediği ve çocukların sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerileri ile psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyleri arasında ilişki olup olmadığı konusuna odaklanmıştır. 2. YÖNTEM 2.1. Araştırmanın Modeli Nicel araştırma olarak planlanan bu araştırmanın modeli, okul öncesi dönem çocuklarının sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerileri ile psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyleri arasındaki ilişkinin incelenmesi amaçlandığından betimsel ilişkisel tarama modelinde planlanmıştır. Betimsel ilişkisel tarama modeli; araştırmada herhangi bir durumu olduğu haliyle tasvir eden ve söz konusu duruma neden olan değişkenlerin etkisini, ilişkisini, derecesini olduğu gibi ortaya çıkaran bir model olarak tanımlanmaktadır (Kaya, Balay ve Göçen, 2012). 2.2. Evren ve Örneklem Araştırmanın evrenini 2021-2022 eğitim öğretim yılında Muş ili Merkez ilçesinde bulunan Milli Eğitim Bakanlığına bağlı resmi anaokulu ve anasınıflarına devam eden, normal gelişim gösteren, 60-66 aylık 3976 çocuk oluşturmaktadır. Örneklemi oluşturmak amacıyla Muş İl Milli Eğitim Müdürlüğü’nden Muş ili Merkez ilçesinde bulunan Milli Eğitim Bakanlığı’na bağlı anaokulu ve anasınıflarını gösteren bir liste elde edilmiştir. Elde edilen liste incelenerek, araştırmanın örneklemi oluşturulmuştur. Araştırmanın örneklemini, evrenden basit tesadüfi küme örnekleme yöntemiyle seçilmiş 350 çocuk oluşturmaktadır. 2.3. Veri Toplama Araçları Araştırmada ‘ Genel Bilgi Formu’, sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerilerini ölçmek için ‘Sosyal Bilgi İşleme Süreci Testi’ ve psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyini ölçmek amacıyla ‘Okul Öncesi Çocuklar İçin Sosyal Duygusal İyi Oluş ve Psikolojik Sağlamlık Ölçeği (PERİK)’ kullanılmıştır. Refereed & Index & Open Access Journal journalofsocial.com 2022 Journal Of Social, Humanities And Administrative Sciences 2022 8 (53) JUNE 762 2.3.1. Genel Bilgi Formu Çocukların cinsiyeti, devam ettiği okul türü ve öğretmenin kıdemi gibi bilgilerin öğrenilmesine yönelik maddeleri içermektedir. 2.3.2. Okul Öncesi Dönem Çocukları İçin Sosyal Bilgi İşleme Süreci Testi Ziv ve Sorongon (2011) tarafından geliştirilmiş olan Sosyal Bilgi İşleme Süreci Testi; çocuğun yaşıtları ile karşılaştığı durumlarda, sonuçları algılama ve kavrama şekillerini belirlemek amacıyla kullanılmaktadır. Toplamda beş öyküden oluşan testte kız ve erkek çocukları için ayrı formlar bulunmakta ve her iki formda da paralel resim ve öyküler bulunmaktadır. Altı bölüme ayrılmış olan testin ilk bölümünde çocuklardan, belirli yüz ifadelerinin bulunduğu (mutlu, korkmuş, üzgün, şaşkın ve sinirli) resimleri inceleyerek doğru ifadeyi belirtmeleri istenmektedir. Ardından kalan 5 bölümün hikâyeleri okunmaktadır. İlk hikâyede, arkadaşlarının rahatsız ettiği bir çocuğun durumu anlatılmakta ve çocuktan duruma yanıt vermesi istenmektedir. Dördüncü hikâyede de birinci hikâyeye benzer bir durumdan bahsedilerek çocuğun tepkisi ölçülmektedir. İkinci ve beşinci hikâyede çocuktan, iki akranının oyun oynarken onlara katılma girişiminde bulunan bir çocuğun durumuna yanıt vermesi beklenmektedir. Üçüncü hikâyede ise annesiyle etkileşimde bulunan bir çocukla ilgili yanıt verilmesi beklenmektedir. Testin orjinal formunda Cronbach’s Alpha güvenirlik katsayısı. 87’dir. Sosyal Bilgiyi İşleme Süreci Testinin alt boyutları 5 bölümden oluşmaktadır. Yüz ifadelerini tanımada, çocukların gösterilen ifadelerdeki doğru yüz ifadesini tanıyıp tanımadığı kontrol edilerek dönüt verilmektedir. Sosyal ipuçlarını kodlamada, hikâyeyi özetlemeleri istenirken; Sosyal ipuçlarını yorumlamada, davranıştaki esas niyet belirlenir. Tepkilerin çeşitlendirilmesi ve yapılandırılmasında ise cevapların yeterli olup olmaması durumuna göre değerlendirme yapılırken, Tepki kararı ve değerlendirmede, sunulan alternatif tepkilere verilen yanıtların doğruluğu test edilmektedir (Ziv ve Sorongon, 2011). Ölçeğin Türkçe ‘ye uyarlanarak, geçerlik güvenirlik çalışması Şenol ve Metin (2019) tarafından yapılmış ve analizler sonucunda kapsam geçerliliği sağlanarak, ölçek maddelerinin tümünün gerekli olduğu saptanmıştır. Ölçme aracının bütünü için güvenirlik katsayısının (Alpha (α)=0.890) ve madde toplam korelasyonlarının yeterli düzeyde olduğuna yönelik sonuçlar elde edilmiştir. Kurder Richardson ve Cronbach Alfa ile güvenirlik analizleri yapılan testte, madde toplam puan ve eşdeğer araştırmacı güvenirliği türleri kullanılmıştır. Sonuçlar incelendiğinde; ölçeğin güvenirlik katsayısının 0,923 olduğu görülürken, Tepkilerin Çeşitlendirilmesi ve Yapılandırılması alt boyutunun 0,705; Sosyal İpuçlarını Yorumlama alt boyutunun 0,695; Tepki Kararı ve Değerlendirme alt boyutunun 0,921 olduğu saptanmıştır. 0,69 ve üzeri olan bu değerler, SBİST’nin güvenilir bir ölçme aracı olduğunu ve geçerlik güvenirliğinin yüksek olduğunu göstermektedir (Şenol ve Metin,2019). Bu araştırma kapsamında, okul öncesi eğitimine devam eden 350 çocuktan elde edilen verilerin güvenirlik analizleri hesaplanmasında Cronbach Alpha ve KR-20 katsayıları kullanılmıştır. Analizler neticesinde güvenirlik katsayılarının ,678 ile ,803 arasında değiştiği görülmektedir. Bu değerlerin yüksek ve orta düzeyde olduğu yani kabul edilebilir düzeyde güvenilir olduğu görülmektedir. 2.3.3. Okul Öncesi Çocuklar İçin Sosyal Duygusal İyi Oluş ve Psikolojik Sağlamlık Ölçeği (PERİK) Çocuk eğitiminde öğrenmeye istekli, motivasyonu yüksek, zorluklarla başa çıkma becerileri gelişmiş çocuklar yetiştirebilmek için hem duygusal hem de sosyal anlamda sağlam bulunmanın gerekliliğinden bahseden ve uygulanan programlarda hedeflenen amaçlara ulaşabilmek için mutlu çocuklar yetiştirmek gerektiğini belirten Mayr ve Ulich(2009), uzun yıllar deneysel çalışmalar yaparak ‘Okul Öncesi Çocuklar İçin Sosyal Duygusal İyi Oluş ve Psikolojik Sağlamlık Ölçeği’ni geliştirmiştir. “İyi oluş (well-being)” ve “pozitif gelişim (positive development)” kavramlarına odaklanılarak hazırlanmaya başlanan ölçek; temelde “ruh sağlığı (mental health)”, “psikolojik sağlamlık (resilience)” ve “okula hazırbulunuşluk (school readiness)” kavramlarına dayanmaktadır. Uzun yıllar yapılan araştırmalarla ortaya çıkan ölçeğin geliştirilme sürecinde; pozitif gelişimin temelinde sosyal duygusal yeterliliklerin bulunması önemli görülmektedir. Geniş çaplı deneysel çalışmalar sonucunda Mayr ve Ulich ( 2006) tarafından 6 alt ölçek ve 36 madde ile son şeklini alarak tamamlanan ölçeğin, Özbey (2019) tarafından Türkçe ’ye uyarlama çalışması yapılmıştır. Dil geçerliği ve kapsam geçerliği incelenen çalışmada ölçek maddelerinin anlaşılırlığı test edilerek, Türkçe ve İngilizce ölçekten alınan toplam puanlar arasındaki Pearson Momentler Çarpımı Korelasyon Katsayısı sonucunda ölçeğin dil geçerliliğinin olduğu kabul edilmiştir. Ölçek 5’li Likert tipi bir ölçek olup, çocuklar adına öğretmen tarafından doldurulmaktadır. Alt ölçeklerin her birinden alınabilecek en yüksek puan 30 olurken, en düşük puan 1’dir (Özbey,2019). Refereed & Index & Open Access Journal journalofsocial.com 2022 Journal Of Social, Humanities And Administrative Sciences 2022 8 (53) JUNE 763 Ölçeğin Doğrulayıcı Faktör Analizi yapılarak, analiz sonucunda ölçeğin orijinalindeki altı faktörlük yapısı doğrulanmıştır. Uyum indeksleri değerlendirilen ölçeğin model veri uyumunu sağladığı belirlenerek, Pearson Korelasyon testi yapılmış ve ölçeğin faktörleri arasındaki korelasyona bakılmıştır. Testin sonucunda ölçek faktörleri arasında anlamlı ve orta- yüksek düzeyde ilişki bulunmuştur (Özbey, 2019). Ölçeğin güvenirliğini saptamak için Cronbach’s Alpha güvenirlik katsayıları .86 ile .95 arasında; Sperman Brown İki Yarı Test güvenirlik katsayıları .74 ile .94 arasında olduğu kaydedilmiştir. Test Tekrar Test güvenirlik katsayıları .94 ile .99 arasında değişen ölçeğin, oldukça güvenilir/yüksek güvenilirliğe sahip olduğu belirtilmiştir (Özbey, 2019). Bu araştırma kapsamında güvenirlik analizleri için Cronbach Alpha katsayılarına bakılmış ve analizler neticesinde Okul Öncesi Çocuklar İçin Sosyal Duygusal İyi Oluş ve Psikolojik Sağlamlık Ölçeği (PERİK) ve alt ölçeklerine ilişkin güvenirlik katsayılarının ,778 ile ,942 arasında yani yüksek düzeyde olduğu görülmektedir. 2.4.Verilerin Toplanması Veriler, araştırmacı tarafından çocuklara birebir ölçeğin uygulanması ve gözlem yapılması yoluyla elde edilmiştir. 2021-2022 eğitim öğretim güz yarıyılında 60-66 aylık normal gelişim gösteren çocukların bulunduğu anaokulu ve anasınıflarından elde edilecek olan veriler için çocuklarla tanışma etkinlikleri düzenlenmiştir. 2.5. Verilerin Analizi Araştırma kapsamında elde edilen veriler bilgisayar ortamına aktarılarak SPSS paket programıyla analiz edilmiştir. Verilerin normal dağılama sahip olup olmadığını belirlemek amacıyla normallik testi yapılmıştır. Örneklem sayısının çokluğu sebebiyle Kolmogorov-Smirnov testi kullanılmıştır. Örneklem dağılımı ve örneklem sayısı(n:350) normallik kriterlerini sağladığı için bütün ölçek alt boyutlarında parametrik testlerin uygulanmasına karar verilmiştir. Ölçeklerden elde edilen puanların bazı demografik değişkenlere göre (cinsiyet, okul türü, kıdem yılı) farklılaşıp farklılaşmadığı hakkında karar vermek için bağımsız gruplar t testi, Tek Yönlü Varyans Analizi (ANOVA) yapılmıştır. Değişkenler arasındaki ilişkiler ise korelasyon analizi yapılarak SPPS paket programında sorgulanmıştır. Analiz sonucunda gruplar arası anlamlı fark çıkan değişkenlerde farkın hangi gruplar arasında olduğunu saptayabilmek için Tukey testinden yararlanılmıştır. Gerçekleştirilen istatistiklerde anlamlılık düzeyi 0,05 olarak belirlenmiştir. Değişkenler parametrik olduğu için gruplar arası korelasyon Pearson korelasyon testi ile değerlendirilmiştir. Regresyon analizlerinde ise alt boyutların birbirini yordama durumları basit doğrusal regresyon analizi ile belirlenmiştir. Analizlere başlamadan önce kayıp değer ve uç değer incelemesi yapılmıştır. Herhangi bir kayıp veri değerine rastlanmamıştır. Yapılan normallik testlerinde veriler (çarpıklık-basıklık değerleri) normal dağılım gösterdiği için analizlerde parametrik testler kullanılmıştır. 3. BULGULAR Araştırmanın bu bölümünde çocukların Sosyal Bilgiyi İşleme Testinden ve Psikolojik Sağlamlık Ölçeğinden aldıkları puanların cinsiyet, devam edilen okul türü ve öğretmenin kıdemi değişkenlerine göre farklılık gösterip göstermediğine ve sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerileri ile psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyleri arasındaki ilişkiye yönelik bulgulara yer verilmiştir.

TARTIŞMA Tablo 1 incelendiğinde çocukların cinsiyetlerinin Okul Öncesi Dönem Çocukları İçin Sosyal Bilgi İşleme Süreci Testi toplamından alınan puanlarda istatistiksel açıdan anlamlı bir farklılık oluşturduğu ve söz konusu farklılığın kız çocuklarının lehine gerçekleştiği görülmektedir. Çorbacı Oruç (2008) yaptığı çalışmada kız çocuklarının problem durumlarına alternatif üretirken daha çözüm odaklı olduğu, sosyal davranış eğilimlerinin erkek çocuklara göre daha yüksek olduğu ve kız çocuklarının daha ılımlı ve pozitif sunduğu çözümlere karşılık erkek çocuklarının daha saldırgan ve yıkıcı çözümler sunduklarını belirtmektedir. Eisenberg vd. (1989), yaptığı çalışmada kız çocuklarının sosyal durumlara verdiği tepkilerde daha çok empati kurduklarını ve davranışı içselleştirerek daha olumlu tepkiler Refereed & Index & Open Access Journal journalofsocial.com 2022 Journal Of Social, Humanities And Administrative Sciences 2022 8 (53) JUNE 767 sunduklarını belirtmektedir. Bu durum; ülkemizde çocuk yetiştirme tarzından kaynaklı kız çocuklarının sosyal beklentilere karşı duyarlılığının fazla olması ve kendinden beklenen sosyal davranışları cinsiyet rolüne uygun olarak gerçekleştirmesi ve buna bağlı olarak olayları yatıştırma ve çözüm odaklı düşünmeye yönelik eğilimlerinin fazla olduğunu düşündürmektedir. Aynı zamanda cinsiyete bağlı doğuştan gelen bazı farklılıkların oluştuğu ve kız çocuklarında sosyal durumlara daha çabuk çözüm yolları üretme becerilerinin erkeklere oranla daha hızlı geliştiği, biyolojik faktörlerin de ön planda olduğu söylenebilir. Tablo 2 incelendiğinde çocukların devam ettikleri okul türüne göre Tepki Kararı ve Değerlendirme (t=--2,459, p<0,05) alt boyutundan alınan puanlarda istatistiksel açıdan anlamlı bir farklılık olduğu ve bu farklılığın anasınıfına devam eden çocukların lehine olduğu saptanmıştır. Özbey (2009) yaptığı çalışmada anasınıfına devam eden 60-72 aylık çocukların, sosyal beceri düzeyi arttıkça problem davranışlarında azalma görüldüğünü belirtmektedir. Bu durum, anasınıfı ortamlarının anaokullarına göre daha kalabalık olması, örgün öğretime daha fazla ağırlık verilmesi ve daha kurallı ve sistematik bir şekilde eğitim içeriğinin uygulanması sonucu çocukların doğru tepki kararı alıp, uygun olan davranışı geliştirme ve buna yönelik değerlendirme yapmasına bağlı olarak sosyal bilgi işleme becerilerinde ön planda olmaları şeklinde açıklanabilir. Tablo 3’de Öğretmenlerin kıdem yıllarının, Okul Öncesi Dönem Çocukları İçin Sosyal Bilgi İşleme Süreci Testinin Sosyal İpuçlarını Kodlama ve Sosyal İpuçlarını Yorumlama alt boyutlarından alınan puanlar arasında anlamlı farklılığın olduğu saptanmıştır. Sosyal ipuçlarını kodlama alt boyutunda kıdem yılı 11-15 yıl olan öğretmenlerin lehine iken; Sosyal ipuçlarını yorumlama alt boyutunda kıdem yılı 6-10 yıl olan çocukların lehine sonuçlar tespit edilmektedir. Şeker (2000) öğretmenlerin sosyal iletişim becerilerinin incelendiği çalışmada kıdem yılı ile doğru orantıda bir artış gözlemlemiş ve 21 yıl üstü kıdeme sahip öğretmenlerin daha az kıdem yılına sahip öğretmenlere oranla iletişim becerilerine ilişkin algı düzeylerinin daha yüksek olduğunu saptamıştır. Bu durumda sosyal iletişim becerileri yüksek öğretmenlerin rol model olarak çocukların sosyal bilgiyi kodlama ve yorumlama becerilerine katkı sağladığı, bilgi ve tecrübesini aktarma konusundaki deneyimi ile çocuklar üzerinde olumlu etki ettiği ve çocukların empati becerilerinin gelişimini destekleyecek eğitim ortamlarını yarattığı sonucuna varılabilir. Tablo 4 incelendiğinde kız çocuklarının iletişim kurma / sosyal performans, öz-kontrol / düşüncelilik ve duygusal istikrar / stresle başa çıkma alt boyutlarında anlamlı bir farklılık olduğu ve bu farklılığın kız çocukları lehine olduğu saptanmıştır. Oktan, Odacı ve Çelik (2014), 450 üniversite öğrencisi üzerinde yaptıkları araştırmada, kız öğrencilerin psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyinin erkek öğrencilerden daha yüksek olduğu sonucuna ulaşmıştır. Benard (1991) ve Garmezy (1993), erkeklerin kızlara oranla psikolojik sağlamlık düzeylerinin daha düşük olduğunu, zorlu yaşam koşullarıyla karşılaştıklarında daha çabuk yıldıklarını ve mücadeleci tavır sergilemek yerine yıkıcı tavırlar sergilediklerini belirtmektedir. Turgut(2016), ergenler üzerinde yaptığı araştırmada kızların psikolojik sağlamlık düzeylerinin erkeklere oranla anlamlı düzeyde yüksek olduğunu tespit etmiştir. Bu durum; kızların iletişim kurmada daha sağlıklı ilişkiler kurduklarını, benlik saygılarının daha yüksek olduğunu, stres yaratan durumlarla baş etmede ve alternatif çözümler üreterek öz kontrol sağlamada daha yetkin olduklarını göstermektedir. Tablo 5’e göre çocukların devam ettikleri okul türüne göre Sosyal Duygusal İyi Oluş ve Psikolojik Sağlamlık Ölçeği alt boyutlarından alınan puanlarda istatistiksel açıdan herhangi bir farklılık olmadığı tespit edilmiştir. Erata ve Özbey (2020), yaptığı çalışmada psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyi ile çocukların devam ettiği okul türü değişkeni arasında, anaokuluna devam eden çocukların lehine anlamlı bir farklılık saptamışlardır. Özkara ve Özbay (2019) yaptığı çalışmada psikolojik sağlamlık düzeylerinin çocukların devam ettiği okul türüne göre farklılık göstermediğini belirtmektedir. Çalışmadan elde edilen sonuçlara göre bu örneklem grubunda okul türü değişkeninin psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyi üzerinde etken olmadığı yorumu yapılabilir. Tablo 6 incelendiğinde öğretmenlerin kıdem yıllarının, “PERİK” alt boyutlarından alınan puanlarda istatistiksel açıdan anlamlı bir farklılık oluşturduğu ve farklılığın öğretmenin kıdem yılı 1-5 yıl ile 6-10 yıl arasında olan çocukların kıdem yılı 11-15 yıl arasında olan çocuklara göre daha yüksek olduğu tespit edilmiştir. Erata ve Özbey (2020), okul öncesi dönem çocuklarının psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyleri ile öğretmenlerinin kıdemi arasında anlamlı bir farklılık olduğunu ve bu farklılığın öğretmeninin kıdemi 15 yıl ve üzeri olan çocukların lehine olduğunu belirtmektedir. Araştırma bulguları neticesinde kıdem yılı daha az olan öğretmenlerin; idealist kişiliklerini daha canlı tutmaları ve mesleki doyumu sağlamaya yönelik eğitim faaliyetlerini sürdürmede daha istekli davranmalarına bağlı olarak, okul çağındaki çocuklar için çok büyük bir rol model oldukları gerçeği göz ardı edilmeden, psikolojik sağlamlığı yüksek çocukları destekleyen uygun yöntem ve teknikleri kullandıkları söylenebilir. Tablo 7 incelendiğinde Okul Öncesi Dönem Çocukları İçin Sosyal Bilgi İşleme Süreci Testi Toplamı ile Okul Öncesi Çocuklar İçin Sosyal Duygusal İyi Oluş ve Psikolojik Sağlamlık Ölçeğinin tüm alt boyutları arasında anlamlı bir ilişki olduğu görülmektedir. Katsayılara bakıldığında Okul Öncesi Dönem Çocukları İçin Sosyal Bilgi İşleme Süreci Testi Toplamı ile PERİK Öz-Kontrol/ Düşüncelilik, Atılganlık, Duygusal İstikrar/Stresle Başa Çıkma, Görev Yönelimi ve Refereed & Index & Open Access Journal journalofsocial.com 2022 Journal Of Social, Humanities And Administrative Sciences 2022 8 (53) JUNE 768 Keşfetmekten Hoşlanma alt boyutu arasında pozitif yönde ve düşük düzeyde bir ilişki; İletişim Kurma / Sosyal Performans alt boyutu arasında pozitif yönde ve orta düzeyde anlamlı bir ilişki olduğu saptanmıştır (p<0,05). Yörük (2019), yaptığı çalışmada akran ilişkileri puanları yüksek olan özel yetenekli çocukların psikolojik sağlamlık düzeylerinin de yüksek olduğu sonucuna varmıştır. Shapiro (1996), sosyal iletişim becerilerinin gelişimine destek sağlayan ortamlarda büyüyen çocukların, psikolojik dayanıklılığının da arttığını ve stres yaratan durumlar karşısında makul çözümler sunarak durumla baş etme ve üstesinden gelme davranışlarının görüldüğünü belirtmektedir. Gizir (2004) sosyal iletişim becerileri ve empati kurma yeteneği gelişmiş çocukların aynı zamanda akademik sağlamlığının da geliştiğini saptamış; Eminağaoğlu (2006) ise yaşıtları arasında güçlü iletişim becerilerine sahip ve sosyal anlamda aktif bireylerin aynı zamanda psikolojik sağlamlık düzeylerinin de yüksek olduğunu belirtmiştir. Araştırma sonucundan yola çıkarak sosyal bilgiyi işleme beceri puanları yüksek olan çocukların aynı zamanda psikolojik sağlamlık düzeylerinin de yüksek olduğu sonucuna varılmaktadır. 5. SONUÇ VE ÖNERİLER Araştırma bulgularına göre sosyal bilgi işleme testi puanları cinsiyet değişkenine göre kız çocuklarında, öğretmenin kıdemi değişkenine göre 11-15 yıl kıdeme sahip öğretmenlerde, okul türü değişkenine göre ise anasınıfına devam eden çocuklarda daha yüksek sonuçlar elde edilmiştir. Sosyal duygusal iyi oluş ve psikolojik sağlamlık ölçeği puanlarına göre kız çocuklarının ve kıdem yılı daha az olan öğretmenlerin öğrencilerinin sağlamlık düzeylerinin daha yüksek olduğu, okul türü değişkeninin etki etmediği saptanmıştır. Ölçeklerin toplam puanlarına bakıldığında Sosyal Bilgiyi İşleme Süreci Testi toplam puanlarının Okul Öncesi Çocuklar İçin Sosyal Duygusal İyi Oluş ve Psikolojik Sağlamlık Ölçeği’ nin tüm alt boyutları arasında orta ve ortaya yakın pozitif yönde anlamlı bir ilişki olduğu görülmektedir. Araştırma bulguları neticesinde sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerileri gelişmiş olan çocuklarda aynı zamanda psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyi yüksek olan bireylerde görülen sosyal problem çözme becerileri, bağlanma, öz düzenleme, yardım alabilme, doyumu erteleyebilme, girişkenlik, özgüven, sosyal yeterlilik ve duygu kontrolü gibi becerilerin geliştiği ve zorluklara karşı dayanıklılığı gelişen çocukların problemlerin üstesinden gelmede daha başarılı oldukları söylenebilir. Buna yönelik olarak çocukların sosyal bilgiyi nasıl anlamlandırdığı ve olaylara karşı verdiği tepkileri nasıl yorumladığına dair ipuçları yakalanarak, sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerileri artırılmalı ve buna yönelik eğitim fırsatları sunulmalıdır. Araştırma sonuçlarına göre şu önerilerde bulunulabilir; ✓ Araştırmanın bulguları ışığında sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerisi yüksek çocukların aynı zamanda psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyinin de yüksek olduğu saptanmıştır. Sosyal bilgiyi işleme temelli eğitim programları, alternatif eğitim programları arasında sunulabilir, MEB aracılığıyla yaygınlaştırılabilir, seminerler düzenlenebilir ve eğitim ortamlarında çocukların sağlamlık düzeylerini ve sosyal becerilerini artırmaya yönelik planlamalar yapılabilir. ✓ Araştırma sonucunda sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerisi yüksek olan çocukların öğretmenlerinin kıdem yılının daha yüksek olduğu tespit edilmiştir. Buna bağlı olarak özellikle yeni mezun veya henüz mesleki deneyimi yeterli olmayan öğretmenlere yönelik, çocuklarda sosyal beceriyi artıracak hizmet içi eğitimlerin sağlanması ve gerekli rehberlik çalışmalarının yapılması önerilebilir. ✓ Çalışma Muş ili Merkez ilçesine bağlı 60-66 aylık okul öncesi öğrencileri ile sınırlıdır. Araştırmanın kapsamı genişletilebilir ve faklı yaş grupları ile farklı iller de dahil edilerek daha kapsamlı bir çalışma elde edilebilir.","completion":"Araştırma, okul öncesi dönemdeki çocukların sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerileri ile psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyleri arasındaki ilişkiyi incelemektedir. Çalışma, betimsel ilişkisel tarama modeli kullanılarak Muş ilinde 60-66 aylık normal gelişim gösteren 350 çocuk üzerinde yapılmıştır. 'Genel Bilgi Formu', 'Sosyal Bilgi İşleme Süreci Testi' ve 'Okul Öncesi Çocuklar İçin Sosyal Duygusal İyi Oluş ve Psikolojik Sağlamlık Ölçeği (PERİK)' veri toplama araçları olarak kullanılmıştır. Araştırma sonucunda, sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerileri cinsiyete ve öğretmenin kıdemi değişkenlerine göre farklılık gösterirken, psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyinin cinsiyet ve öğretmenin kıdemi değişkenlerinde farklılık gösterdiği tespit edilmiştir. Sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerileri ile psikolojik sağlamlık düzeyleri arasında pozitif yönde düşük düzeyde bir ilişki saptanmıştır. Çalışma, sosyal bilgiyi işleme becerileri ve psikolojik sağlamlığın desteklenmesinin önemini vurgulamakta ve bu alanda daha fazla araştırma yapılmasını önermektedir."},{"prompt":"alttaki metni bir sayfaya sığacak şekilde özetle: Anlambilim Anlambilim, anlam bilimi, anlam bilgisi ya da semantik, anlamları inceleyen bilimdir. Anlam bilimi felsefî ya da mantıksal ve dilbilimsel olmak üzere iki farklı açıdan ele alınabilir. Felsefî ya da mantıksal yaklaşım, göstergeler ya da kelimeler ile bunların göndergeleri arasındaki bağlantıya ağırlık verir ve adlandırma, düz anlam, yan anlam, doğruluk gibi özellikleri inceler. Dilbilimsel yaklaşım ise zaman içinde anlam değişiklikleri ile dilin yapısı, düşünce ve anlam arasındaki karşılıklı bağlantı vb. konular üstünde durur. Bir başka deyişle göstergelerin anlamlarının ilişkin olduğu bilim veya teoriye \\"anlam bilimi\\" veya \\"semantik\\" denir. Bu anlamda gösterge denilince; görülebilen, duyulabilen ve iletişim halinde olan herkes için belli bir anlamı olan birimler anlaşılır. Bu koşulu, trafik levhaları ya da körler alfabesinde var olan kelimeler de yerine getirir. Semantik, her çeşit gösterge ile ilgilenirse Gösterge biliminin alt alanına girer; yalnızca dilsel göstergelerle ilgilenirse dil biliminin alt alanına girer. Dilsel birim olan göstergeler: Anlamı olan bütün dilsel ifadeler “gösterge” olarak tanımlanır. Örneğin; “hedefliyorsun” kelimesi iki parçadan oluşmaktadır. Sözcüğün kökü olan “hedeflemek”, “belli bir amaca ulaşmayı istemek” anlamındadır; kelimenin sonundaki “–yorsun” eki ise dilbilgisel olarak 2. tekil şahıs olduğunu belirtir. Bu durumda da semantik, Dil biliminin alt alanı olarak dilsel birimlerin anlamlarının açıklanması ile tanımlanması ve karmaşık ifadeleri bir araya getiren durumlar ile uğraşır. Böylelikle cümleler ya da daha büyük birimler oluşur ve bu birimler iletişim sırasında etkili bir şekilde kullanılır. Tarihsel semantik ise zaman içerisinde değişen dilsel birimlerin anlamlarını araştırır. Göstergenin, yukarıda belirttiğimiz anlamıyla kelimelerin bütün ögelerini kapsamadığına dikkat edilmelidir: Sayı kelimesi sa-yı şeklinde iki heceden oluşur ve her iki hecenin de hiçbir anlamı yoktur. Yalnızca bu heceler bir araya getirildiğinde bir anlam oluşur. Bu, tek ses ya da harfler için de geçerlidir. Tek başlarına hiçbir anlam taşımazlar. İlk olarak, aşağıdaki bölümde semantik, Gösterge biliminin içinde kabul edilir. Çoğu dil bilimci, dil bilimini; gösterge biliminin uzmanlık alanı olarak görür. Dil bilimi 2000’den fazla yıldır dilsel olguların açıklanması ve tanımlanması ile uğraşır; böylece semantiği de ilgilendiren yeni kuramsal bilgiler geliştirmiştir. Ayrıca ana dil dersleri, dil eğitimi ve yabancı dil dersleri gibi alanlarda bir sorunun tam doğru olarak ifade edilmesinde dilbilimsel bilgilerin uygulamalı kullanımına yönelik düşünceler de etkinleştirilir. Semantik; bilişim, mantık, felsefe ve sistem kuramı bakış açılarından sonuç çıkarır. Semantik sözünün kökeni Yunanca: σημαίνω, romanize: sēmainō (\\"anlamına gelmek\\" veya \\"belirlemek\\") fiilinin çeşitli türevlerinden oluşan bir grup İngilizce kelimeden biridir. İsim semantiği ve sıfat semantiği sēmantikos'tan (“anlamlı”) türetilmiştir; semiyotik (sıfat ve isim) sēmeiōtikos'tan (“işaretlerle ilgili”) gelir; semiyoloji gelen Sema (“işareti”) + logolar(“hesap”); ve semasiology gelen sēmasia (“anlamlandırma”) + logolar. Göstergebilimsel semantik Semantik, genel gösterge bilimsel olarak göstergesel anlam kuramıdır. Semantik bakış açısı ya da kavramı, içerdiği esas anlama göre değişir. Göstergebilimsel anlamda göstergeler yalnızca dilsel değildir; böylelikle gösterge bilimsel semantik, göstergelerin etkileşimindeki doğal ve teknik süreçleri inceler. Charles W. Morris, gösterge bilimindeki semantik terimini bulan kişi olarak bilinir. Morris, semantik adı altında göstergelerin birbirleriyle olan ilişkisini anlar. Morris’e göre semantik kavramı bugünkü anlamından farklıdır. Gösterge biliminde pragmatik ve sentaks Morris'den bu yana birbirinden ayrı olarak ele alınırlar. Kavram bilimi ve ad bilimi Yukarıda da değinildiği gibi semantik göstergelerle uğraşır. Örneğin; “şapka” kelimesinin konuşulan, yazılan şekli ve bunun bağlantılı olduğu, kenarları olan başı sıkıca kavrayarak koruyan anlamı vardır. Bu iki konunun (biçim ve anlam) birbirleriyle olan ilgisi iki şekilde açıklanır: Kavram bilimi; isimlerle, yani kelimeler, göstergeler ve metaforlar gibi dilsel birimlerle ilgilenir ve bunların ne anlama geldiğini araştırır. Ad bilimi ise nesnelerden yola çıkar ve bu nesnelerin nasıl adlandırıldığını araştırır. Semantik bu her iki alanın üst kavramıdır ve gösterge ile anlam ilişkisinin ifadesidir. Dilbilimsel semantik Dil biliminin alt alanı olan semantik, dilsel göstergelerin anlamını araştırır. Dilsel göstergeler ise sözlü ve yazılı biçimlerle ilgili olan bütün ifadelerdir. Bu bağlamda morfemler en küçük göstergelerdir. Daha büyük göstergeler kelimelerdir, bunu ise cümleler, cümleler ve metinler takip eder. Bütün bu birimler “gösterge” görevini yerine getirir. Aslında dilbilimsel semantiğin araştırma nesnesi morfem ve kelimelerdir. Gösterge biliminde olduğu gibi modern dil bilimide de sentaks, semantik ve pragmatik’ten yararlanılır, ama Pragmatik, göstergelerin anlamı ile uğraştığı için açık bir farklılık vardır. Semantik farklı perspektiflerden de yararlanır. Kelime, cümle, metin ve iletişim düzleminde semantik Leksikografik semantik kelimelerin ve morfemlerin anlamlarıyla uğraşır. Cümle semantik, daha büyük sentaktik birimlerin anlamlarının tek tek kelimelerin anlamlarından nasıl oluştuğunu araştırır. Bir cümlenin yorumu bu cümlenin sentaktik yapısının çözümlemesine dayalı olarak yapılmalıdır. Metin semantik gerçek ya da varsayımsal olarak cümlelerin birleşiminin çözümlenmesi üzerinde yoğunlaşır. Söylem semantik birbiriyle ilişkisi olan farklı kişilerin metinlerdeki düzeyi üzerine çalışmalar yapar. Kelime ve morfem semantiğin, dilbilimsel semantiğin araştırma nesnesi olduğuna dikkat edilmelidir. Bunlardan sonraki araştırma nesnesi Cümle semantiktir. Frege İlkesinin (“bireşimsel bir dil biriminin anlamı, ögelerinin anlamlarının işlevidir”) doğal dillerde ne denli geçerli olabileceği tartışılmaktadır. Birleştirici işlevlerin tanımı olumlayıcı bir durumda semantiğin ana görevleri arasında sayılmaktadır. Leksikografik semantik Kelimelerin anlamlarının araştırılması dilbilimsel semantiğin konusudur. Bununla ilgili konular aşağıda verilmiştir: Temel ögelerden oluşan kelimelerin anlam yapısı: Bir kelimenin anlamı kelimenin kökünün belli bir şekilde düzenlenmesi olarak tanımlanır. Semem kelimenin kökünden oluşan hiyerarşik olarak düzenlenmiş bir yapıdır. Morfemlerin karmaşık bir kelimenin anlamına katkısı: Bir kelimenin, türevin ya da birleşik kelimelerin bükün şekillerinin anlamı bu birimlerin morfolojik ögelerinin anlamlarından ileri gelir. Özellikle eski yapılarda leksikografi büyük bir rol oynar. Bir kelimenin durumu: Burada, belli bir kelimenin anlam benzerliği olan diğer kelimelerden nasıl bir farkı olduğu söz konusudur. Kelimeler arasındaki anlam ilişkileri: Zıt anlam, eş sesli, eş anlam ve çok anlam.Kaynak 25 Ekim 2014 tarihinde Wayback Machine sitesinde arşivlendi. Ard zamanlı (veya \\"ardıl zamanlı\\") ve eş zamanlı semantik Semantik, eş zamanlı (senkronik) ve ard zamanlı (diyakronik) olarak çalışır. Ferdinand de Saussure’ye kadar dil bilimi çalışmalarında artzamanlılık hakimdi. Tarihsel (ard zamanlı) semantik; anlam genişlemesi, anlam daralması, anlam iyileşmesi, anlam kötüleşmesi ve anlam kayması gibi zaman içinde meydana gelen olayları ard zamanlı olarak inceler. Etimoloji (köken bilimi), klâsik semantiğin alt alanıdır. Eş zamanlı semantik, dildeki göstergelerin belli bir zaman diliminde belli gruplar tarafından bir iletişim aracı olarak nasıl kullanıldığını araştırır. Eş zamanlı semantik ve ard zamanlı semantik birbiriyle hiçbir zaman çelişmez, hatta birbirlerini tam anlamıyla tamamlar. Bundan dolayı ard zamanlı yapısal semantik hem eş zamanlı yönteme yönelik, hem de dil tarihini araştırmak için dildeki söz varlığının yapısallık ilkesini kullanır. Tarihsel semantik Tarihsel semantik anlam değişmesini kapsar. Bir kelimenin anlamının zaman içerisinde değişmesini gözlemler. Anlam genişlemesi ile anlam daralması ve anlam iyileşmesi ile anlam kötüleşmesi anlam değişikliğine dahildir. Tarihsel semantiğe yönelik başlıca araştırmalar, morfem ve kelimelerin anlam gelişmelerini kapsayan Etimoloji’ye aittir. İlk tarihsel semantik araştırmaları Antonie Meillet, Wilhelm Wundt, Leonce Roudet, Jost Trier ve Herman Paul’a aittir. 1950’lerden beri Stephan Ullmann’ın çalışmaları belirleyici rol oynamaktadır. 1960’lardan beri felsefe ve tarih biliminde Tarihsel semantiğe yönelik araştırmaların “Kavram Tarihi” adı altında toplandığı kapsamlı araştırmalar vardır. 1990’ların sonundan ve 21.Yüzyılın başlarından itibaren tarihsel semantiği bilişsel dil bilimi açısından ele alma denemeleri vardır. Türkiye’de ise, anlam bilimini konusundaki ilk kapsamlı çalışma, Doğan Aksan’a aittir. Doğan Aksan 1971’deki “Anlam bilimini ve Türk Anlam bilimini” adlı eserinde dilbilimsel anlam bilimi konularını ele almakta ve Türkçeyi kelime ve cümle semantiği açısından incelemektedir. Kültürlerarası semantik Kültürlerarası iletişim birçok alan için söz konusudur. Dil bilimi alanında da kültürlerarası iletişimi terminolojik ve bilimsel olarak kavramak vardır. Bunun yanı sıra kendisine yakın olan bilim dallarının taslağına başvurur. Kültürlerarası belli iletişim durumlarının çözümlenmesi için kültürel etkileşimin tanımlanmasına yönelik çözümleme kategorileri geçerlidir. Böyle iletişimlerin temelinde kelimelerin anlamlarının anlaşılması vardır. İletişim halinde olan kişilerin yaşadıkları kültür bağlamında ve sözlüklerde yazıldığı biçimde kelime kullandıkları için semantikte yanlış anlaşılma potansiyeli vardır. Bundan dolayı da semantik bozukluklar, yanlış anlamalar ya da anlaşmazlıklar ortaya çıkmaktadır. Mantıksal dillerde semantik Salt semantik olarak da adlandırılan mantıksal semantiğin görevi; önermeler mantığı, yüklem mantığı gibi biçimsel dilleri açıklamaktır. Fakat anlamlar araştırılmaz, aksine açık kurallar aracılığıyla kesin olarak belirlenir. Bu noktada mantıksal dillerdeki biçimsel semantikten de bahsedilebilir. Kapsamlı semantiğe karşı içerimsel semantik Bir dilsel ifadenin kapsamı ile içeriği arasındaki fark şudur: semantik, içerimsel semantikte daha çok içerik ile uğraşırken kapsamlı semantikte de daha çok kapsam ile uğraşmaktadır. İçerik ve kapsamın farklılığı içerik ve kapsam arasındaki anlayış ve anlam ile ilişkilidir. Bu noktadaki anlayış ve anlam kavramları modern Matematiksel Mantık'ın ve Analitik felsefenin kurucusu sayılan Alman matematikçi, mantıkçı ve filozof Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege’ye aittir. Ayrıca Frege, anlam ifadesini günümüzde geçerli olan anlayışta bir başka ifade olarak kullanmış ve şu tanımı yapmıştır: Anlayış dilin sistemi içerisindeki göstergeler, kelimeler, cümleler gibi yapıların aralarındaki ilişkiden ileri gelen bir içerik olarak tanımlamıştır (içerik ile anlam benzerliği). Anlamı gösterge ve dünya arasındaki bir ilişkiden kaynaklanan bir içerik olarak tanımlamıştır (kapsam ile anlam benzerliği). Frege, bu farklılığı Almanca’daki “Morgenstern” (Çoban Yıldızı) ve “Abendstern” (Venüs gezegeni) kavram çifti örneğinde netleştirmektedir. Her ne kadar “Morgenstern” kelimesi “Çoban Yıldızı” anlamında da kullanılsa da bu her iki kelime de aynı anlama sahiptir. Her iki kelime de Venüs gezegenini tanımlamaktadır. Fakat bu ifadelerin anlayışı belirli biçimde farklıdır. Bu farklılaşma bugünkü dil kullanımına göre artık kolay kolay anlaşılabilir olmadığı için Frege’nin terminolojisinin yerine anlam ve anlayış kavram çifti çoğunlukla gösterilen olarak kullanılmaktadır. Aynı zamanda da anlayış ve anlam kelimeleri eş anlamlı olarak kabul edilmektedir. Frege’nin bu farklılaştırmaları dilbilimsel semantik içerisinde de büyük bir yankı uyandırmıştır. Kip ile ilgili olmayan mantık için geçerli olan semantik, kapsamlı semantiktir. Bu, şu anlama gelmektedir; biçimsel dilin ifadelerinin sadece kapsamlı semantiğe uygun düşer. Bunun tersine kip ile ilgili mantıksal diller, içeriksel semantik ile, örneğin olası dünyanın semantiği aracılığıyla açıklanmaktadır. Gerçek – işlevsel semantik Gerçek – işlevsel semantik Alfred Tarski tarafından 1944 yılında “sistematik bir süreç olarak resmileştirilmiştir”. Gerçek – işlevsel semantik bir cümlenin anlamını bir cümlenin gerçekliği sorununa bağlamıştır, çünkü bir gerçekliğin tasarısının kavranması, anlamın tasarısının kavranmasından daha kolaydır. Gerçek – işlevsel semantik “anlam” kavramını dilsel ifadeler ile dünya arasında bir işlev olarak anlayan ve bu ifadelerin gerçekliğini, bunların anlamlarına ölçüt olarak kullanan bir semantiktir. Model-kuramsal semantikte bu konu işlenmektedir. Bilişim bilimi içerisinde semantik Bilişim bilimi içerisinde semantik, mantıksal semantiğin uygulamasıdır. Burada biçimsel programlama dilleri için söz diziminin yanı sıra biçimsel bir semantik tanımlanmaktadır. Bu semantik öngörülebilirlik (hesaplanabilirlik) kuramı, hesap karmaşıklığı kuramı ve özellikle de bilgisayar programlarının doğrulanması (kusursuzluk) alanlarındaki kullanımlarda bulunmaktadır. Felsefî semantik Semantik, çözümleyici/analitik felsefenin önemli bir alt alandır. Dil felsefesi uzun süre boyunca esasen sadece semantik olarak algılanmıştır. 20. yüzyılda Wittgenstein’in etkisi sayesinde ancak edim bilimi de dil felsefesinin önemli bir dalı haline gelmiştir. Semasiolojik ile onomasiolojik bakış açılarının farkı Göstergelerin gösterge boyutundan içeriğine yönelik anlamsal bir sorgulama içine girilince (göstergenin içeriği nedir?) semasiolojik boyut esas alınmaktadır demektir. Bu durumda semasioloji ifadesi ile aynı zamanda çok genel anlamda semantiğin eş anlamlısı; dar anlamda ise kelime içeriklerinin öğretisi çerçevesinde kalınmaktadır. Nesne açısından bakıldığında ise (nesne nasıl adlandırılmıştır/işaretlenmiştir) söz konusu olan, onomasiolojik boyuttur. Onomasioloji, işaret kullanımı öğretisi düzleminde düşünülmesi gerekir. Bir resim sözlüğü veya konu başlıklarına ya da içerik yakınlıklarına göre düzenlenmiş olan bir sözlük, onomasiolojik temellidir. Aynı zamanda kelime alanı öğretisinin de onomasiolojik bir boyuta veya açıya sahip olduğu varsayılmalıdır. Çok genel bir bakış açısından bakılınca esasen semasiolojik-onomasiolojik ayrımı somut gerçekliğe dayalı değil de daha ziyade kavramsal nitelikte anlaşılabilir; zira konucunun gerçeklik deneyimi ile birlikte onun sözde doğal onomasiolojik konumunun semasiolojik araştırmalarında öncel olup olmadığı sorusu hep açıkta kalmaktadır. Semantiğin alanlarının işlevsel olarak sınıflandırılması Semantiğin alanları yalnızca dil yapısının farklı düzeylerine göre değil, dil ile düşünce ve dil ile dünya arasındaki ilişkinin biçimine göre de sınıflandırılır. Semantik alanlar bilişsel anlam, bilgisel anlam ve pragmatik anlam olmak üzere üçe ayrılır. Bilişsel anlam kavramı, dil ile düşünce arasındaki ilişki ile bağlantılıdır. Bu noktada dilsel bir ileti ile düşünsel yapının dil biçimlerini oluşturmasından söz edilir. Bilgisel anlam kuramları ilişkisel (referansiyel) kuramlar olarak anılır. Ferdinand de Saussure’e göre dilsel göstergeler ile onların ilişkili olduğu karşılıkları (referans unsurları) arasındaki bağıntı burada büyük rol oynar. Pragmatik anlam alanındaki semantik çalışmalar, bir ifadenin dilbilgisel anlamı ile belli bir bağlamdaki anlamı arasındaki ilişkiyi açıklamaya çalışır. Bu, aynı zamanda pragmatikin araştırma nesnesidir. Genel semantik Genel semantik kavramı birçok anlamda kullanılır. Aynı zamanda kuramsal semantik kavramına bir eş anlamlı olarak şöyle bir tanım geçerli kılınmaktadır: „kuramsal semantikte (…) soyut, işaret kullanımının tüm alanına yönelik genel geçerliğe sahip açıklamalar sunulur (…); bunun dışında tüm işaret sistemlerinin betimi için gerekli temel kavramlar dizgeli bir şekilde tanımlanır”. Bu açıdan uygulamalı semantiğin bir karşıt özelliği dile getirilmiş olmaktadır. Bunun yanı sıra, genel semantik ifadesi Korzybski ve Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa tarafından temsil edilen “general semantics”in çevirisidir. Semantik, “konuşmacı ve dinleyicinin davranış ve düşünceleri ile dilsel göstergeler arasındaki ilişkinin öğretimi” olarak tanımlanmaktadır. Bu, insanların dilin dikta ve güdümleyici erkinden kurtulmasının pedagojik ve özgürlükçü başlangıcıyla ilgilidir. Dinamik semantik ile statik semantik Dinamik statik kavramı statik anlam kuramlarına bir ayrıcı tanım olarak sunulmaktadır. Bu ayrımlaştırıcı kavramsallaşma, bir cümlenin anlamını bir güncelleme işlevi („uptade funcion“) olarak kavrarken, bunun „ifade edilişinden önce ulaşılan bir metin bağlamı veya bilgi durumunu yeni bir metin bağlamı veya bilgi konumunda gösterdiği“ iddiası söz konusu olmaktadır. Biçimsel semantik Biçimsel semantik, aslında biçimsel mantık çerçevesinde biçimsel yapma dillerin semantiğidir. Bu biçimsel mantık semantiğin yanı sıra, mantıksal betimleme imkânlarını kullanan doğal dillerin de biçimsel bir semantiği vardır. Biçimsel semantik; Augustus De Morgan, George Boole, Alfred Tarski ve Richard Montague’nin etkisi altında gerçeklik koşullarını sağlayan cümle anlamı olarak tanımlanır ve felsefî mantık ilkelerine yönelik kalıplaşmış bir üst dil ile betimlenir. Modelleştirici kuramsal semantik (Tarski-semantik) Modelleştirici kuramsal semantik (İng.: model-theoretic semantics; aynı zamanda „hakikat işlevci semantik“), örneğin Richard Montague’de görüldüğü şekliyle, formel semantiğin bir yönüdür; Alfred Tarski’ye atıfla oluşturulan bu anlayışa göre sunî ve doğal dillerin semantik/anlamsal yorumunu, „anlamı kesin tanımlanmış bir yorumla bir model içinde eşit tutarak“ gerçekleştirmektedir. Modelleştirici kuramsal semantikte nesne dili ile meta dil birbirinden kesin olarak ayrıştırılır. Nesne dili bir meta dile çevrilir. Bu meta dil ise bir model düzlemi ve içinde yorumlanır. Üretici semantik Üretici semantik, dil bilgisi ile uğraşır ve dönüşümsel dil bilgisi kalıplarını eleştirir. Üretici semantik, üretici-dönüşümsel dil bilgisinin kurucusu olan Noam Chomsky tarafından geliştirilmiştir. Noam Chomsky’nin kuramından farklı olarak, soyutlamalı anlam derinliğine dayalı olan bir dildeki cümlelerin sözdizimsel değil, şimdiye kadar tam olarak geliştirilemeyen, bir cümlede farklı biçimlere dönüştürülen anlam bilimisel göstergeler olduğu anlaşılır. Üretici semantik, üretici-dönüşümsel dil bilgisi konusunda Noam Chomsky tarafından geliştirilen Söz dizim kuramının görünüşlerinde (Aspekte Modell) yer alan çeşitli cümleler arasındaki eşdeğerlik ilişkilerine yönelik, 1960'lı yılların ortasından beri devam eden tartışmalardan dolayı bağımsız bir disiplin olarak gelişmiştir. Dönüşümsel dil bilgisinin sınırlandırılması Üretici semantik birbirine uygun durumları temsil etmez; ancak burada bazı özellikler ortaya çıkmaktadır: Üretici semantik bütün kuralları benimser ve “dönüşümsel süreçlerin sınırlandırılmasına yönelik anlık durumsal varsayımlarını kullanmaz” (Norbert Fries, Berlin). Üretici semantik, “anlam bilimisel ve sesbilimsel göstergeler arasındaki dilbilgisel dönüşüm biçimlerini” açıklamaya çalışır (Nobert Fries, Berlin). Üretici semantik, yorumlayıcı semantiğin nasıl ortaya çıktığını, bir dil bilgisinin iki farklı kural sisteminden nasıl oluştuğunu sorgular. Sonuç olarak; üretici cümle bilgisi ve yorumlayıcı semantik, aralarındaki kurallara ilişkin sistem farklılığı konusunda birbirinden ayrılır. Üretici semantik, sadece bir kural sistemi olduğunu kabul eder. Farklı soyut yapılar altındaki Üretici semantik içerisinde seçim kuralları gibi konular semantik olarak sınıflandırıldığı için bu sistem de semantik olarak sınıflandırılır. Söz Dizim Kuramı bağlamında, bu yapılar sözdizimsel olarak kullanılır. Ayrıca üretici semantik, dönüşümsel dil bilgisinde evrensel nitelikte olduğu varsayılan soyut cümle yapılarının dönüşümsel sentakstaki dilsel ifadeler için mantıksal kapsam ve şartlara ilişkin sınırlandırmalar kullanmadığını kabul eder. Dönüşümsel dil bilgisi, üretici semantikte semantik-üretici ekleri sınıflandırmasının ve hangi dil bilgisinde hangi dizgesel niteliklerin olduğu gibi olgular arasında ayrım gözetilmediğini eleştirir. Söz Dizim Kuramı’ndaki gelişmeler ve özerklik ilkelerinin daha belirgin hale getirilmesi ile üretici semantikteki tartışmalı noktalar açıklığa kavuşturulmuştur. Eleştiriler bilişsel dil bilgisi ve pragmatikteki yeni dil kuramlarının kavramlarını da etkiler. Yapısal semantik Yapısal semantik kavramıyla yapısalcılığa karşı sorumlu olan kavram betimlemesinin farklı modelleri ifade edilmektedir. Yapısal semantik, leksikografik birimlerin çözümlemesiyle uğraşır. Bir dil sistemindeki semantik anlamların yapısını tanımlar. Yapısal semantik, içeriksel boyutların yapılanabileceği varsayımından yola çıkar. Bir dilin söz varlığının yapısının belirlenmesi ve birbirinden bağımsız birimlerden oluşması söz konusudur (Pottier, Greimas, Coseriu). Bir kavram alanının yapısı, semantik alanının sınırlarının belirlenmesi, sözlük birimlerinin çözümlenmesi, kısacası, semantik alanının biçimlenmesine katkı sağlayan her şey bu alanın bir parçasıdır. Yapısal semantik, dil sistemindeki bir kelimenin konumuna değil, ses ile imge arasındaki ilişkiye yönelir. Ayrıştırıcı özellikli semantik Ayrıştırıcı özellikli semantiği anlam ayırt eden birimlerden oluşur. Bu alanın temeli, bütün bir anlam oluşturan özelliklerle doldurulmuştur. Örneğin; kadın ve erkek kelimeleri, insanlar ve yetişkinler için kullanıldığından dolayı aynı niteliktedir; fakat cinsiyeti ayırt eden ve belirleyen bir özellik taşımaktadır. Ayrıştırıcı özellikli semantik ile gerçekçi bir işlevi olan semantiğin gerçeklik değerleri özellikle dikotomiye göre belirlenir.

Yüzyıl Becerisi: Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünme Özlem ÜZÜMCÜ ozlem.uzumcu@hku.edu.tr Doç. Dr. Erdal BAY erdalbay@hotmail.com Öz İletişim kanallarının artması, teknolojinin hayatın her alanında yer almasına bağlı nedenler yaşamda karşılaşılan olay ve problemlerin de karmaşık hâle gelmelerine neden olmaktadır. Bu değişime ayak uydurabilmek, problemlerle baş edebilmek ve nihayetinde bu süreçte başarılı olabilmek için bireylerin çeşitli becerilere sahip olmaları gerekmektedir. 21. yüzyıl becerileri, bu anlamda, bireylerin ihtiyaçlarına cevap verebilecek güncel, dinamik bir yapı sunmaktadır. 21. yüzyıl becerilerinden biri olan problem çözme becerisi, birden fazla beceriyi içerdiğinden her yaş için önem arz etmektedir. Bilgi işlemsel düşünme; bir tür problem çözme becerisi olarak tanımlanan, günümüzün ilgi gören yetkinlik alanlarından biri olmuştur ve tüm dünyada ilgi görmektedir. Öğretim programları, uluslararası standartlar, kurum ve kuruluşların faaliyetleri ile nitelikli çalışmalarda son yıllarda bu kavramı sıkça görmek mümkündür. Bu çalışmada bilgi işlemsel düşünme kavramının tanımı yapılmış; içeriği, önemi, popülerleşme süreci, boyutları ve Türkiye’nin öğretim programlarındaki yeri hakkında bilgi verilmiştir. Doküman inceleme yönteminin tercih edildiği bu çalışmada, konuyla ilgili makaleler, tezler ile dünyaca tanınan kurum ve kuruluşların web siteleri gibi güvenilir kaynaklardan elde edilen veriler kullanılmıştır. Alanyazında, bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin özelliklerinden ve boyutlarından yola çıkılarak çeşitli tanımlamaların yapıldığı görülmektedir. Terimin, genel olarak “bir tür problem çözme türü-becerisi olarak” açıklanması, bu tanımlamaların ortak noktasını oluşturmaktadır. 1980’li yıllarda çocuklara programlamanın öğretilmesinin amaçlandığı çalışmalarda yer aldığı görülen bu kavram, 2000’li yılların ortalarında popülerleşmeye başlamıştır. Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin farklı kaynaklarda farklı boyutlarına ulaşılmıştır. En sık karşılaşılan boyutlarının ise; parçalara ayırma, soyutlama, örüntü, algoritma ve değerlendirme-hata ayıklama olduğu görülmektedir. Boyutlarından birinin algoritma olması, yine dünyada en çok üzerinde durulan konulardan biri olan kodlama ile ilişkisini ortaya koymaktadır. Türkiye’deki öğretim programlarının her kademesinde, bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin farklı düzeylerde yer aldığı görülmektedir. Günümüzdeki tanımları, özellikleri ve boyutları göz önüne alındığında, bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin daha iyi anlaşılabilmesi için daha fazla uygulamalı çalışmaya ve öğretim programlarıyla bütünleştirme çalışmalarına ihtiyaç duyulduğunu iddia eden bu çalışma, bunu sağlamak üzere bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin tanınmasına katkıda bulunmayı hedeflemektedir.

In order to keep up with this change, to cope with the problems and ultimately to be successful in this process, individuals need to have various skills. In this sense, 21st century skills are kept up-to-date and dynamic in order to meet the needs of individuals. Problem solving ability, which is one of the 21st century skills, is more important for all ages as it includes more than one skill. Computational thinking, which is defined as a kind of problem solving skill, has become today's one of the compelling areas of competence and drawing attention all over the world. It is possible to see this concept frequently in recent years in curriculums, international standards, activities of institutions and qualified work. In this study, the concept is defined and informations about its content, importance, how it became popular, its dimensions and its place in curriculums of our country are given. Document analysis method was preferred in this study and data from trusted sources such as articles, theses and web sites of world-renowned institutions were used. Describing the term which was first used in 1980s and became popular in 2000s, as “a kind of problem-solving type skill” in general, constitutes the common point of them. The most common dimensions found in reviewed documents were; decomposition, abstraction, pattern, algorithm and evaluation-debugging. The fact that one of the dimensions of computational thinking being algorithm which is also related to coding -one of the most important topics in the world- helps to explain its importance. Considering today's definitions, characteristics and dimensions of computational thinking, it was thought that there is a need for more practical studies and studies about integration into curriculum, for better understanding. Key Words: Computational Thinking, 21st Century Skills, Coding, Algorithm, Curriculum Eğitimde Yeni 21. Yüzyıl Becerisi: Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünme Giriş Bilgiye erişimin kolaylaşması, iletişim kanallarının çoğalması, teknoloji kullanımın artması gibi durumlar, dijital çağ olarak adlandırılan günümüzde karşılaşılan problemlerin karmaşık ve kompleks yapıda olmasına neden olmaktadır (Booth, 2013; Sayın & Seferoğlu, 2016). Problemlerin bu karmaşık yapıları ile baş edebilmek ve ilgili durumlarına adapte olabilmek için 21. yüzyıl becerilerine ihtiyaç duyulmaktadır. 21. yüzyıl becerileri, farklı kurum ve kuruluşlarca bilgi iletişim teknolojilerini kullanma becerilerinden sosyal yaşam becerilerine, düşünme-problem çözme becerilerinden, öğrenme becerilerine kadar çeşitli başlıklar altında açıklanmıştır (P21- Partnership for 21st Century Skills; OECD- Organisation for EconomicCo-operation and Development 2005; ISTE- International Society for Technology in Education 2007). Bu başlıklardan biri olan problem çözme becerisi, kendi bünyesinde düşünme becerileri ve öğrenme becerileri gibi yetkinlikleri de barındırabildiğinden, çok boyutlu bir yapıya sahiptir (Kotluk & Kocakaya, 2015). Günümüz problemlerinin karmaşık yapıları göz önüne alındığında, bu problemleri çözme sistemlerinin de etkili olabilmesi için söz konusu karmaşık yapıya uyum sağlaması gerekmektedir. Bu nedenle 21. yüzyıl problem çözme becerisinin, günümüz problemlerine uyumu için güncel olması gerekmektedir. Bir tür problem çözme becerisi olarak gösterilen bilgi işlemsel düşünme, yaklaşık son on yılın ilgi uyandıran beceri alanlarından olmuştur (Wing, 2006). Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin yeni bir beceri alanı olduğu göz önünde bulundurulduğunda; içeriğinden boyutlarına, kullanım alanlarından uluslararası eğitim standartlarındaki yerine kadar birçok alanda tartışma konusu olduğu bilinmektedir. Bu nedenle bu araştırmada bilgi işlemsel düşünme konusuna açıklık getirmek ve alanyazındaki içeriklerini karşılaştırmalı vermek amaçlanmıştır. Bu amaçla aşağıdaki araştırma sorularına cevap aranmıştır: 1. Bilgi işlemsel düşünme nedir? Neden farklı terminolojiler kullanılmaktadır? 2. Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin geçmişten günümüze popülerleşme süreci nasıldır? Eğitimde Yeni 21. Yüzyıl Becerisi: Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünme Ö.Üzümcü, E.

Bilgi işlemsel düşünme ile ilgili ilk çalışmalar nelerdir? Bu çalışmaların bilgi işlemsel düşünmeye bakış açıları nasıldır? 5. Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin boyutları nelerdir? 6. Türkiye’deki öğretim programlarında bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin yeri nedir? Yöntem Bu çalışmada, yeni bir beceri türü olan bilgi işlemsel düşünmeye ilişkin alanyazını analiz ederek araştırma sorularını detaylı açıklayabilmek için nitel araştırma yöntemlerinden olan doküman incelemesi kullanılmıştır. Bu yöntem, geçmişten günümüze her türlü yazılı belge, fotoğraf ve film gibi dokümanların incelenmesinde kullanılmaktadır (Yıldırım & Şimşek, 2013). Buna göre doküman incelemesinin aşamaları aşaıdaki gibi belirtilmiştir: • Dokümanlara ulaşma • Orijinalliği kontrol etme • Dokümanları anlama • Veriyi analiz etme Bu çalışmada kullanılan dokümanlara ulaşma aşağıdaki gibi belirlenmiştir. Ulusal tezlerin incelenmesinde Yükseköğretim Kurulu Başkanlığı Ulusal Tez Merkezi web sayfasında tırnak içinde “computational thinking” kelimeleri dizin, özet, yazar ve konu alanlarında aranmıştır. Bunun sonucunda 21 sonuç elde edilmiştir. Sonuçların filtrelenmesinde “Eğitim ve Öğretim” yazıldığında ise eğitim alanında 12 tez elde edilmiştir. Bu tezlerin ikisi doktora düzeyindeyken, on tanesi yüksek lisans düzeyindedir. Elde edilen bu tezlerin en eski tarihli olanı 2015 yılında yayınlanmıştır (tez.yok.gov.tr). İlköğretim düzeyindeki ulusal öğretim programlarına Talim Terbiye Kurulunun resmi web sayfasından erişilirken, yükseköğrenim düzeyindeki öğretim programlarına Yüksek Öğretim Kurulu’nun yine resmi web sayfasından erişilmiştir. Uluslararası öğretim programları için Birleşik Krallık ve Amerika Birleşik Devletlerine karar verilmiştir. Birleşik Krallık(İngiltere) ulusal resmi web sayfasından öğretim programının içeriğine ulaşılmıştır (www.gov.uk). Amerika Birleşik Devlet’indeki farklı öğretim programlarının yer almasından dolayı, bu bölgedeki bilgisayar bilimleri ile ilgili uluslararası alanda hizmet veren kar amacı gütmeyen kurum kuruluşların yayınladıkları uluslararası standartların incelenmesi uygun bulunmuştur. Bu alanda önde gelen uluslararası CSTA ve ISTE standartları olarak belirlenmiştir (CSTA - Computer Science Teachers Association, 2016; ISTE, 2016). Bilimsel yayınlar belirlenirken alıntılanma sayısı yüksek olması, Google Akademik, EBSCO, Ulakbim veritabanlarında yer almalarına ve konuyla doğrudan ilişkili olmalarına öncelik verilmiştir. Bunun dışında Kartopu tekniğiyle derleme çalışmaların kaynakçalarından hareketle birincil kaynaklara ulaşılmıştır. Toplamda makale ve bildirilerden oluşan 35 bilimsel yayın incelenmiştir. Bilgi işlemsel düşünme ile ilgili eğitim veren, uygulamalar geliştiren, içeriğinden bahseden dünyanın önde gelen kurum kuruluş ve uygulamaların resmi web sitelerinin bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin uygulamalı olarak açıklanmasında yardımcı olabileceği düşünülmüştür. Bu amaçla belirlenen web siteleri; BBC, Barefoot, Scratch, Google Education ve Code.org olmuştur. Kitap olarak ise bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin ilk bahsedildiği kaynaklardan olması nedeniyle Seymour Papert’in Mindstorm kitabı incelenmiştir. Veritabanı aramaları için ERIC (Education Resources Information Center) ve Sciencedirect seçilmiştir. Her iki veritabanı da uluslararası hizmet veren indeksli yayınlar içeren platformlar olduğu için tercih edilmiştir. Orijinalliğinin kontrolünde belgelerin incelenirken ulaşılan web Eğitimde Yeni 21. Yüzyıl Becerisi: Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünme Ö.Üzümcü, E. Bay Uluslararası Türk Kültür Coğrafyasında Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi (TURKSOSBİLDER) Cilt 03, Sayı 02, 2018, Sayfa 1-16 Sayfa 4 sayfasındaki URL adresleri kontrol edilerek ilgili birimin resmi web sayfası olduğu onaylanmıştır. Dokümanları anlama aşaması, elde edilen verilerin konuyla ilişkilerinin teyid edilmesi, dokümanların sistem içinde incelenme adımlarını içermektedir. Bu süreçte her iki araştırmacının incelemesiyle ilgili dokümanların bilgi işlemsel düşünmeyle ilgili olduğu bulunmuştur. Veri analizi basamağında, elde edilen dokümanların ek veri kaynağı ya da başlı başına araştırmanın veri seti olup olmadığı belirlenmelidir. Bu araştırmadaki verilerin tümü bahsedilen dokümanlardan oluşmuştur. Bu nedenle bu yöntemde önerilen dört aşamalı veri analizi yapılmıştır(Bailey, 1982). İlk basamak elde edilen verilerden örneklem seçmedir. Örneğin bir kitabın sadece bilgi işlemsel düşünmeyle ilgili bölümünü belirlemek örneklem seçmektir. Ya da bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin boyutlarını incelerken, ilgili web sitesinde sadece boyutları içeren sayfaları belirlemek yine bu kapsamda örneklem belirlemedir. İkinci basamak kategorilerin geliştirilmesidir. Kategori geliştirme araştırmanın başında belirlenen temalar ya da problemler olarak açıklanabilir. Bu araştırmanın temaları, giriş bölümünde belirtilen altı araştırma problemi olarak belirlenmiştir. Bu problem durumlarının araştırmanın başında belirlenmesi hem veri toplama hem örneklem seçme hem de veri analizinde rehberlik ettiği için kolaylık sunmaktadır. Üçüncü basamak analiz biriminin belirlenmesidir. Yukarıda bahsedilen temalar analiz birimi olarak belirlenmiş, bu başlıklara göre analiz yapılması uygun görülmüştür. Dördüncü basamak sayısallaştıma olarak belirtilmiştir ancak bu konunun içeriğine göre araştırmacıya bırakılmıştır. Bu araştırmada sayısallaştırmaya ihtiyaç duyulmadığından düz metin olarak temalara göre verilmiştir. Nitel araştırmalarda çalışmanın geçerliği araştırmanın inandırıcılığı ve transfer edilebilirliği ile ilgilidir. Doğru ve derinlemesine veri toplanması, bu sürecin detaylarıyla aktarılması, konunun detaylarıyla verilmesi bu araştırmanın geçerliğini göstermektedir. Güvenirlik için ise bu çalışmayı gerçekleştiren iki araştırmacı analizlerini ayrı ayrı yaptıktan sonra karşılaştırıp, görüş birliğine varılan sonuçları kabul etmişlerdir. Analizde sayısallaştırma olmadığı için görüş ayrılığı - görüş birliği oranından oluşan uyum yüzdesi verilememiştir. Bulgular Problem durumunda belirlenen alt problemler aşağıdaki gibi açıklanmıştır. 1. Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünme Nedir? Neden Farklı Terminolojiler Kullanılmaktadır? Bilgi işlemsel düşünme (computational thinking) kavramının geçen “computational” kelimesi, bazı Türkçe kaynaklarda “hesaplamalı” (Özçınar & Öztürk, 2018) olarak kullanılırken, bazılarında ise “bilgisayarca” (Korkmaz, Çakır, Özden, Oluk & Sarıoğlu, 2015) olarak kullanılmıştır. Son çalışmalara ve resmî kurumların kullanımlarına bakıldığında, “bilgi işlemsel” çevirisinin daha yaygın kullanıldığı görülmektedir (Talim ve Terbiye Kurulu, 2018; Yüksek Öğrenim Kurulu, 2018; Kalelioğlu & Gülbahar, 2015). Bilgi işlemsel tercümesinin tercih edilmesini, bu becerinin doğrudan bilgisayar becerisi ile ilişkilendirilmek istenmemesi ve bu becerinin kapsamının bilgiyi işleme sürecini daha iyi yansıttığının düşünülmesi ile açıklamak mümkündür. Bilgi işlemsel düşünme, yeni bir kavram olması nedeniyle birçok çalışmada açıklanmıştır; ancak bununla ilgili henüz kesin bir tanımdan bahsetmek mümkün değildir (Hu, 2011; Barr & Stephenson, 2011; Grover & Pea, 2013 ). En genel ifade ile bir çeşit problem çözme becerisi olarak açıklanan bilgi işlemsel düşünme, Wing’e göre; problem çözme, sistem tasarlama ve bilgisayar temelli kavramlara dayanan insan davranışlarını anlama yaklaşımı olarak tanımlamaktadır (Wing, 2006). Problem çözme becerisinin bir bileşeni olarak da görülen bilgi işlemsel düşünme, üst düzey beceriler arasında anılmaktadır (Çetin, 2016). Bilgi işlemsel düşünme; algoritmik düşünme, tasarım düşünme, matematiksel düşünme gibi düşünme becerileri ile bazı noktalarda kesişmekte ve aynı zamanda bu düşünme becerilerine katkıda bulunabilecek yapısı olduğu ifade edilmektedir (Lee, Martin, Denner, Coulter, Allan, Ericson, Malyn-Smith & Werner, 2011). Bu bahsedilen düşünme becerilerinden olan algoritmik düşünme, temellerini çok eskiden alsa da özellikle bilgi işlemsel düşünme ve kodlama konularının yaygınlaşmasıyla birlikte dikkat çeken başlıklar arasında yer almıştır. Bilgisayar biliminin temelini oluşturan algortimalar, farklı boyutlarda bilgi işlemsel düşünmede yer edinmektedir. Yani bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin, algoritmik düşünmeden daha kapsamlı olduğunu söylemek mümkündür. Bununla birlikte bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin bilgisayar biliminden daha geniş etki alanına sahip olması, yine birden çok düşünme becerisine katkıda bulunabilecek bir beceri olarak tanımlandığını göstermiştir (CSTA, 2016). Çeşitli düşünme becerileriyle ortak noktalarının olması ve bu becerilere katkı sağlayabilecek Eğitimde Yeni 21. Yüzyıl Becerisi: Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünme Ö.Üzümcü, E. Bay Uluslararası Türk Kültür Coğrafyasında Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi (TURKSOSBİLDER) Cilt 03, Sayı 02, 2018, Sayfa 1-16 Sayfa 5 yapısının olması, bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin kapsamının bir o kadar geniş olduğunu göstermektedir. Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin tanımlamalarında, farklı düşünme becerilerinin yanı sıra, kendisini oluşturan boyutlarına da rastlamak mümkündür. Örneğin CSTA (2016) standartlarında bilgi işlemsel düşünme; soyutlama, otomasyon ve analize odaklanan yapısı ile bilgisayar biliminden daha geniş bir disiplinin temel unsuru olarak tanımlanmaktadır. Bir başka örnekte ise “… parçalara ayırma, soyutlama gibi bilgisayar kavramlarını kullanarak problem çözmeyi sağlar” şeklinde tanımlanmıştır (Lye & Koh, 2014). Bilgi işlemsel düşünmeyi algoritmik düşünme olarak tanımlayan başka bir çalışmaya göre; bilgi işlemsel düşünme, problemleri analiz etme sürecidir ve çözümlerini algoritmalardaki bilgi işlemsel adımlardır (Barr & Stephenson, 2011; Denning, 2009). Bu tanımlarda yer alan soyutlama, parçalara ayırma, algoritma gibi kavramların bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin boyutlarında yer aldıkları görülecektir. 2. Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünmenin Geçmişten Günümüze Popülerleşme Süreci Nasıldır? Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin tüm dünyada yaygınlaşmasıyla birlikte bu alanda yapılan araştırmaların da bir o kadar arttığı söylenebilir. Bu yaygınlaşma süreci veritabanlarında yer alma ve arama motorunda aranma ile somutlaştırılarak açıklanabilir. Genelden özele gidildiğinde Google Akademik arama motoru sonuçlarına göre, “Bilgi işlemsel düşünme (computational thinking)” tırnak içinde arandığında; 2005 ve öncesinde 368 sonuç elde edilirken, 2006 ve sonrası için 15400 sonuç elde edildiği görülmektedir. Eğitim alanındaki bilimsel tam metin kaynaklarını içeren indeksli veritabanı olan ERIC veritabanında yapılan aramada 192 sonuç elde edilmektedir. Bu sonuçların 149 tanesi son 5 yıla (2014 - 2018) aittir (eric.ed.gov). Teknoloji, fen bilimleri tıp gibi birçok alanda bilimsel kitap ve dergiye ev sahipliği yapan Elsevier’in tam metin veritabanı olan Sciencedirect’te 250.000’den fazla makale bulunmaktadır. Bu veritabanında yapılan bilgi işlemsel düşünme aramalarına bakıldığında 249 sonuç elde edilmiştir. Bu sonuçların 232 tanesi ise 2010 yılı ve sonrasına aittir (sciencedirect.com). Zamanlara, ülkelere ve konulara göre arama motorunda yapılan aramaların istatistiklerini veren Google Trends uygulamasında da bu sürece ayna tutacak sonuçlar olduğu görülecektir. Google Trends uygulamasında yapılan “computational thinking” aramasında 2006’dan 2018 yılına kadar tüm dünyadaki aramalar incelendiğinde, önemli bir artış olduğu dikkat çekmektedir (Şekil 1). Tüm bu sonuçlar bilgi işlemsel düşünmeye olan eğilimin yakın zamanda arttığını göstermektedir. Bilgi işlemsel düşünme kavramı, ilk kez Seymour Papert tarafından Mindstorm (1980) adlı çalışmasında kullanılmıştır. Matematikçi ve bilgisayar bilimci olan Papert, özellikle çocukların öğrenme süreçlerini anlamak ve yine çocukların programlamayı öğrenmeleri için çok sayıda araştırma gerçekleştirmiştir Şekil 1. Google Trends’te yıllara göre \\"computational thinking\\" sonuçları Kaynak: https://trends.google.com.tr/trends/explore?date=2006-07- 09%202018-10-07&q=computational%20thinking Eğitimde Yeni 21. Yüzyıl Becerisi: Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünme Ö.Üzümcü, E. Bay Uluslararası Türk Kültür Coğrafyasında Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi (TURKSOSBİLDER) Cilt 03, Sayı 02, 2018, Sayfa 1-16 Sayfa 6 (Ellison, 2018). Jean Piaget ile çocukların bilişsel gelişimleri üzerine çalışan Papert; bilgisayar ile iletişim kurmayı öğrenmenin, diğer öğrenme yollarını da değiştireceğini savunmaktadır. Mindstorm (1980) kitabında ise bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin günlük yaşamla bütünleştirilmesinin öneminden bahsetmiştir (s.182). Janette Wing’in 2006’daki çalışmasından sonra popülerleşen bilgi işlemsel düşünme kavramı, uluslararası standartlardan öğretim programlarına birçok araştırmada yer almakta ve her geçen gün bu çalışmaların sayısı artmaktadır (Wing, 2006). 3. Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünme Neden Önemlidir? Bilgi işlemsel düşünme becerisi, adından dolayı ilk başta bilgisayar ile ilgili çağrışımlarda bulunsa da, çok daha geniş bir etki alanına sahiptir. Bilgisayarların çalışma sistemleri, insanların günlük yaşamdaki problem çözme sistemi olarak düşünüldüğünde, sadece bilgisayar ile ilgili kişilerin değil, herkesin bu beceriye sahip olması gerektiği öne sürülmektedir (Wing, 2006). Bunu doğrular nitelikte, bilgi işlemsel düşünme dersinin verildiği bir araştırmada, derse katılan öğrencilerin problem çözmede bilgi işlemsel stratejileri kullanımlarının olumlu etkisinin olduğu, ayrıca bu öğrencilerin bilgisayar kaygılarının da azaldığı görülmüştür (Booth, 2013). Bir başka çalışmada ise tüm öğrencilere bu becerinin kazandırılmasının kaçınılmaz olduğu belirtilmiştir (Lockwood & Mooney, 2017). Öğrencilerden tüm bireylere kadar herkesin bu beceriye sahip olmasının beklenmesi, bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin etki alanının bir o kadar yaygın olabileceğini akıllara getirmektedir. Bilgisayar biliminden daha geniş bir disiplinin temel unsuru olarak görülen bilgi işlemsel düşünme, diğer tüm disiplinlerde kullanılabilecek bir yöntem olarak ifade edilmektedir (CSTA, 2016 ). Bundy’e (2007) göre de bilgi işlemsel düşünme fen ve sosyal bilimlerin hemen hemen tüm alanlarındaki araştırmalarını etkilemektedir. Bu kavramın içeriğinin karmaşık ve geniş alanları kapsaması, açıklanmasını bir o kadar zorlaştırmaktadır. Bu nedenle bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin önemi kabul görmekte; ancak içeriğinin tam olarak anlaşılması için daha fazla çalışmaya ihtiyaç duyulmaktadır (Lockwood & Mooney, 2017; Lee et al., 2011; Lye & Koh, 2014 ). Bu denli gerekli görülen ve geniş etkiye sahip olduğu düşünülen bilgi işlemsel düşünme becerisinin, uluslararası standartlarda yer alması da kaçınılmaz olmuştur. Uluslararası Eğitim Teknolojileri Derneği (ISTE) dünyanın birçok ülkesinden üyesiyle, eğitimde teknoloji kullanımı, yenilikçi öğrenme ortamlarının hazırlaması gibi 21. yüzyıl eğitimine rehber olacak standartlar geliştirmektedir. ISTE (2016)’ya bakıldığında öğrenciler için yayınladıkları standartlarda öğrencilerin sahip olması istenen yedi özellik yayınlanmıştır. Şekil 2’de görülen bu özelliklerden biri de bilgi işlemsel düşünmedir. Bilgisayar Bilimi Öğretmenleri Derneği (CSTA), 145’ten fazla ülkedeki 25.000’den fazla üyesi ile çeşitli faaliyetlerin yanı sıra bilgisayar standartları oluşturan uluslararası bir topluluktur. CSTA’ın 2016 yılında yayınladığı k-12 bilgisayar bilimleri standartlarına göre, bilgi işlemsel düşünme bilgisayar biliminin daha geniş bir disiplininin temel unsuru olarak tarif edilmekte ve her sınıf düzeyindeki öğrenci standardında yer almaktadır (CSTA,2016).

Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin kesinleşmiş tanımı ve boyutlarının olmaması bu süreçte ilgili çalışmaların ve kurs içeriklerinin çeşitlilik göstermesine neden olmuştur (Lockwood & Mooney, 2017 ). Sarıtepeci ve Durak’a (2017) göre bilgi işlemsel düşünme becerisi; soyutlama, algoritmik düşünme, problem çözme, parçalara ayırma, genelleme ve hata ayıklama boyutlarını içermektedir. Yine bilgi işlemsel düşünmeyi alanyazında tanımlamada kullanılan kavramların araştırıldığı bir çalışmada boyutlar olarak; soyutlama, problem çözme ve algoritmik düşünmenin yer aldığı görülmektedir (Kalelioğlu, Gülbahar & Kukul, 2016). Bu alandaki çalışmalara ek olarak, bilgi işlemsel düşünmeyi öğretmeyi amaçlayan dünya çapındaki kurum ve kuruluşların web sitelerinin bazılarında bu alanın boyutları Tablo 1’deki gibi vermiştir. Birleşik Krallık’ın dünyaca ünlü yayın kuruluşu olan BBC’nin eğitim web sayfasında, teorikten pratiğe kadar bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin boyutlarını içeren rehberi yer almaktadır (www.bbc.com/education). Bu rehberde bilgi işlemsel düşünmede; parçalara ayırma, soyutlama, örüntü tanıma, algoritma ve değerlendirme olmak üzere beş boyutunun bulunduğu ifade edilmektedir.

Algoritma başlık olarak değil, bileşenleri şeklinde verilmiştir Barefoot projesi, İngiltere’deki ilkokul öğretmenlerinin yeni bilgisayar öğretim programlarında bilgisayar bilimine adaptasyonuna yardımcı olması amacıyla 2014 yılında kurulmuştur. Başta farklı finansal kaynağı olan bu proje, daha sonra Computing at School (CAS) ortaklığı ile devam etmiştir. Birleşik Krallık’ta 29.000’in üzerinde üyesi olan, bilgisayar alanında bir çok eğitim-etkinlik düzenleyen bu kuruluş “dünyadaki her çocuğun dünya çapında bir bilgisayar eğitim hakkı vardır” vizyonu ile okullardaki bilgisayar eğitiminde yer alan herkese liderlik ve stratejik rehberlik sağlamak için hizmet vermektedir (www.computingatschool.org.uk). Bilgi işlemsel düşünmeyi kavramlar ve yaklaşım olarak iki başlık altında şekil 3’teki gibi açıklamışlardır. Başta çocuklar olmak üzere her yaştan insanın oyun, animasyon ve hikâyelerini eğlenceli bir şekilde tasarlamalarını sağlayan web tabanlı programlama dili olan Scratch, MIT Laboratuvarı tarafından geliştirilmiştir (scratch.mit.edu). Tasarım temelli öğrenme etkinliklerinin çocuklardaki bilgi işlemsel düşünme gelişimini desteklemesiyle ilgilenen bu araştırmacılar, Scratch ile bilgi işlemsel düşünme çerçevesi oluşturmuşlardır. Bu uygulama öğrencilerin bilgi işlemsel düşünme becerilerini geliştirmek için çeşitli çalışmalarda kullanılmıştır (Ceylan, 2015; Çatlak, Tekdal & Baz, 2015). Şekil 4’te verildiği gibi bilgi işlemsel düşünme kavram, uygulama ve perspektif başlıklarında verilmiştir. Kavramlar boyutunda, programlamada kullanılan temel kavramlardan yedi tanesine yer verilmiştir. Bu kavramların, programlamanın temel ögeleri olduğu görülmektedir. Uygulamalar boyutunda, programlama sürecinde karşılaşılan problemlerin çözümünde kullanılabilecek uygulamalar dört başlıkta verilmiştir. Bu başlıklara bakıldığında sadece soyutlama ve test etme gibi başlıkların doğrudan diğer kaynaklarda yer aldığı, diğerlerinin ise dolaylı olarak yer alabileceği söylenebilir. Perspektif boyutunda ise, programlama yapan insanların bu alandaki bakış açılarına yer vermektedir. Örneğin ilişki kurma düzeyinde öğrencilerin “diğer kişilere (Scratch’ta programlama yapan bireylere) erişimim olduğunda, daha farklı şeyler yapabilirim ” ifadelerine yer vermişlerdir (Brennan & Resnick, 2012).

Bay Uluslararası Türk Kültür Coğrafyasında Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi (TURKSOSBİLDER) Cilt 03, Sayı 02, 2018, Sayfa 1-16 Sayfa 9 Google Education tarafından hazırlanan “Eğitmenler için Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünme Kursu”, bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin bilgisayar biliminden farkını göstermek, diğer derslere nasıl entegre edilebileceğini öğretmek, öğretim programlarında nasıl yer alabileceğini anlatmak ve bu alanda farkındalık oluşturmak amacı ile düzenlenmiştir (Google Education, 2017a). 130’dan fazla ders içeriği, video, ders planı gibi materyaller de Google’ın ilgili web sayfasında eğitimcilerin kullanımına sunulmuştur (Google Education, 2017b ). Kurs içeriği;  Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünmeye Giriş  Algoritmaları Keşfetme  Örüntüleri Bulma  Algoritma Geliştirme  Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünmeyi Uygulama başlıklarından oluşmaktadır. Bunun yanında bilgi işlemsel düşünmeye giriş bölümünde soyutlama, örüntü bulma, parçalara ayırma ve algoritma başlıklarının yer aldığı görülmektedir. Code.org , okullarda bilgisayar bilimine erişimi arttırmayı hedefleyen 2013 yılında kurulmuş bir sivil toplum kuruluşudur (code.org). Blok tabanlı programlama ile çocuklara küçük yaştan itibaren bilgisayar bilimlerini öğretmeyi hedefleyen bu eğitim platformu, öğrencilere öğrenme ortamları sağlarken, öğretmenlere de sanal sınıf ortamından öğretim programlarına kadar bir çok rehber kaynak sunmaktadır. Code.org öğretim programlarına bakıldığında, 10 yaş üstü ders grubunda (3. seviye) bilgi işlemsel düşünme yer almaktadır (studio.code.org). Yapılan bir çalışmada code.org’un ders planlarıyla, içeriğiyle, etkinlikleriyle öğretmenlere rehberlik yapabileceği ifade edilmiştir (Yıldız, 2018). İlgili ders planında, karmaşık bir problemle karşılaşıldığında, bu tür problemi dört adımla çözmenin mümkün olabileceği ifade edilmektedir. Bu adımlar; parçalarına ayırma, örüntü, soyutlama ve algoritma olarak verilmiştir. 5. Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünmenin Boyutları Nelerdir? Alanyazın incelemeleri sonucunda en sık karşılaşılan bilgi işlemsel düşünme boyutlarının; parçalara ayırma, örüntü bulma/tanımlama, soyutlama, algoritma ve test etme/hata ayıklama olduğu görülmektedir (Şekil 5). Problemi anlama ise bazı kaynaklarda ayrı basamak olarak yer alırken, bazı kaynaklarda ise satır aralarında öneminin vurgulandığı görülmektedir. Bunun yanında, problem çözme yönteminde ilk adımının problemi anlama olması, bilimsel süreç ile de paralellik göstermektedir. Bu nedenlerden dolayı, en sık rastlanan basamaklara problemi anlama basamağı da eklenmiştir. Bu boyutların en basit örnekleriyle açıklamaları, aşağıda verilmiştir: Parçalara Ayırma (Decomposition): Adından da anlaşılacağı gibi, karmaşık ya da çoklu yapıdan oluşan bir bileşeni parçalarına ayırma olarak da tanımlamak mümkündür. Bilgi işlemsel düşünme ile ilgili çalışmaların çoğunda bu boyuta rastlamak mümkündür. Çözülemeyen karmaşık problemlerde yaşanan başarısızlığın nedeninin, problemin parçalarına iyice ayrılmaması olduğu düşünülebilir. Örneğin güvenlik görevlileri, işlenen karmaşık bir suçu çözerken mümkün olduğunca her detayı araştırırlar. Her bir detay, ipucu olduğundan sonuca ulaşma bir o kadar kolaylaşacaktır (www.bbc.com).

Bay Uluslararası Türk Kültür Coğrafyasında Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi (TURKSOSBİLDER) Cilt 03, Sayı 02, 2018, Sayfa 1-16 Sayfa 10 Şekil 5. Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin boyutları Örüntü Tanımlama/Model Çıkarma (Pattern): Tekrar eden işlemler dizisi, bir başka deyişle model çıkarma olarak açıklamak mümkündür. Bir başka örüntü tanımında; verilerdeki desenleri, örüntüleri ve tekrar eden düzenleri gözlemleme olarak yer almaktadır (computationalthinkingcourse.withgoogle.com). Örneğin, kedi modeli/örüntüsü çıkarılırken tüm kedilerde ortak olan özelliklere göre formüle edilir (Şekil 6). Yani her kedinin dört bacağı, bir kuyruğu, bir başı, bir de gövdesi vardır. Soyutlama (Abstraction): Aranan özellikleri bulmak için gerekli olan özelliklere odaklanıp, diğer durumları göz ardı etmek olarak tanımlanmaktadır (CSTA,2016). Wing’e (2008) göre, bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin özü soyutlamadır. Soyutlama olarak tanımlanması, aranan özelliğin dışındaki tüm durumlardan soyutlanmasından kaynaklanmaktadır. Bir başka çalışmada “belirli örneklerden genelleme süreci” olarak tanımlanırken, problem çözmenin temel şartı olarak verilmektedir (Togyer, 2017; Lee et al., 2011). Problemler arasındaki bağlantıların bulunup, çözümlerin yeniden gözden geçirilmesine imkân sunan soyutlama boyutunun, bilgi işlemsel düşünme boyutlarından en zoru olabileceği ifade edilmiştir (Booth, 2013). Bir önceki örnekteki kedi modeli çıkarma işleminde aslında önceki adım olarak soyutlama yapılmıştır. Yani kedilerin ortak özelliklerini bulurken tüylerinin farklı uzunlukta ve renkte olması, göz renklerinin farklı olması, kuyruk uzunlukları gibi özelliklerden soyutlanarak ortak özelliklere odaklanılmıştır (Şekil 7). Renkten soyutlama yapıldığında; rengi ne olursa olsun her kedinin kuyruğunun olması bilgisi örüntü bulurken işe yarayacaktır (www.bbc.com ). Algoritma: Kodlamanın özünü oluşturan algoritmalar, çözülecek bir problemde ya da uygulanacak bir planda işlemlerin adım adım gösterilerek çözüme nasıl ulaşacağının belirlenmesi olarak bilinmektedir. Sadece bilgisayar biliminde değil diğer disiplinlerde de bir görevi adım adım yerine getirmek olarak tanımlanması, algoritmik düşünme kavramı olarak da çokça kullanılmasının göstergesi olarak kabul edilmektedir (Selby & Woollard, 2013). Algoritmik düşünme, programlamadan bağımsız geliştirilecek bir özellik olarak tanımlanması, bilgi işlemsel Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünmenin Boyutları Problemi Anlama Parçalara Ayırma Soyutlama Örüntü Algoritma Değerlendirme/Hata Ayıklama 1 Baş 1 Gövde 1 Kuyruk 4 Bacak Kedi Tüy rengi Tüy uzunluğu Göz rengi Gövde büyüklüğü Kuyruk uzunluğu Şekil 6.

Bay Uluslararası Türk Kültür Coğrafyasında Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi (TURKSOSBİLDER) Cilt 03, Sayı 02, 2018, Sayfa 1-16 Sayfa 11 düşünmenin doğrudan bilgisayarla ilgili beceri olmadığının da göstergesidir (Otaran, 2017). Bilgisayar programlamanın bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin bir parçası olarak görülmesi, algoritmaların da bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin vazgeçilmez bir boyutu olduğunu göstermektedir(Israel, Pearson, Tapia, Wherfel & Reese, 2015). Değerlendirme ve Hata Ayıklama: Algoritmalar düzenlenirken ya da bir bilgisayar programı hazırlanırken en fazla uygulanan işlemlerden biri test etme, yani hazırlanan programın ya da algoritmanın denenip değerlendirilmesi işlemidir. İyi bir problem çözümü için, çözümlerin değerlendirilmesi önem taşımaktadır (Liu, Zhi, Hicks & Barnes, 2017). Scratch’ın geliştiricileri bu boyutu “yalnızca programlamada değil, diğer çeşitli tasarım etkinliklerinde de faydalıdır” şeklinde ifade etmektedirler (Brennan & Resnick, 2012, s.7). Bir başka çalışmada ise öğrencilerin programlama yaparken hata ayıklama yaptıklarında, algoritma tasarlama süreçlerinde problemleri daha kolay aştıkları görülmüştür (Ko, Myers & Aung, 2004). Buna rağmen çoğu programlama ortamı, hata ayıklamayı doğrudan öğretmek amacı ile hazırlanmamıştır. Programlamalarda önemli yeri olan hata ayıklama işlemi için, yeni kod yazmanın ötesinde bir anlayış gerektiği belirtilmiştir (Liu et al., 2017). 6. Türkiye’deki Öğretim Programlarında Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünmenin Yeri Nedir? 2018 yılında, Talim Terbiye Kurulu tarafından yayımlanan Bilişim Teknolojileri ve Yazılım Dersi öğretim programına bakıldığında, önceki öğretim programlarına göre köklü değişiklikler yapıldığını görmek mümkündür. Türkiye Yeterlilikler Çerçevesi’nde yer alan yetkinlikler esas alınarak hazırlanan bu programda, sekiz temel yetkinlik esas alınmıştır. Bu yetkinlikler; ana dilde iletişim, yabancı dilde iletişim, matematiksel yetkinlik-fen ve teknolojide temel yetkinlikler, dijital yetkinlik, öğrenmeyi öğrenme, sosyal ve vatandaşlık ile ilgili yetkinlik, insiyatif alma ve girişimcilik, kültürel farkındalık ve ifadedir. Öğretim programında bulunan on beş genel amacın altı tanesinde doğrudan programlama, bilgi işlemsel düşünme ve problem çözme amaçları yer almıştır. Diğer amaçlar ise bilgi iletişim teknolojileri, internet ve iletişim araçları, etik ve güvenlik, yaşam boyu öğrenme gibi başlıkları içermektedir.

Bir yıl boyunca işlenecek ünitelerin süre dağılımında Problem Çözme ve Programlama ünitesine ayrılan sürenin toplam sürenin %50’sini oluşturduğu görülmektedir (Tablo 2). Kazanımlara bakıldığında ise problem çözme, algoritma oluşturma, programlama bileşenleri, blok tabanlı programlar ve doğrusal mantık gibi konuları içerdiği görülmektedir. 2018 yılında güncellenen ilkokul ve orta okul fen bilgisi, matematik ve hayat bilgisi öğretim programları bilgi işlemsel düşünme becerisini içerme yönüyle incelenmiştir (Talim ve Terbiye Kurulu, 2018). Eğitimde Yeni 21. Yüzyıl Becerisi: Bilgi İşlemsel Düşünme Ö.Üzümcü, E. Bay Uluslararası Türk Kültür Coğrafyasında Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi (TURKSOSBİLDER) Cilt 03, Sayı 02, 2018, Sayfa 1-16 Sayfa 12 Fen bilimleri ve matematik öğretim programlarına (ilkokul-ortaokul düzeyi) bakıldığında problem çözme becerisiyle ilgili becerilerin programın amaçlarında yer aldığı görülmektedir. Buna karşın problem çözme becerilerinden olan bilgi işlemsel düşünmeye rastlanmamıştır. Yenilenen öğretmen yetiştirme öğretim programlarında bölümlere göre farklılaşan Bilişim dersleri, tüm öğretmenlik programlarında “Bilişim Teknolojileri” dersi olarak değiştirilip, içeriği de güncellenmiştir. Yapılan değişiklikle birlikte; bilgi işlemsel düşünme, problem çözme, algoritma ve ilgili kavramlar yeni öğretim programı içeriğinde yer almaktadır (YÖK, 2018). Tartışma, Sonuç ve Öneriler Bilgi işlemsel düşünme, temeli eskilere dayanmakla birlikte dünya genelinde yeni öğrenme becerileri arasında yer edinmeye başlayan yetkinlikler arasındadır. Yeni 21. yüzyıl becerisi olarak da tanımlanabilen bu yetkinlik, çeşitli uluslararası standartların yanı sıra öğretim programlarında, araştırmalarda ve projelerde yer almaktadır (Einhorn, 2012; Voogt, Fisser, Good, Mishra & Yadav, 2015). Temeli daha eskilere dayansa da son yıllarda bu alana olan ilgi oldukça artmıştır. Bu nedenle tanımından içeriğine, boyutlarından önemine kadar bir çok yönüyle merak uyandırmıştır. Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin tanımı ile ilgili farklı görüşler yer alırken Türkiye’deki son kurumsal alandaki kullanımlarında bilgi işlemsel düşünme çevirisinin olduğu görülmektedir. Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin boyutlarının neler olduğu konusunda da farklılıkların olduğu bulunmuştur. Bu çalışmada bilgi işlemsel düşünme boyutları; parçalara ayırma, soyutlama, örüntü/örüntü bulma, algoritma ve hata ayıklama-değerlendirme olarak değerlendirilmiştir. Algoritmalar, bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin çoğu kaynakta yer alan boyutlarından biridir. Bilgi işlemsel düşünme ve kodlama eğitiminin hemen hemen aynı zamanlarda yaygınlaşması, kodlamanın temelinin algoritmalar olmasıyla açıklanabilir. Bu nedenle bilgi işlemsel düşünme ve kodlama (programlama) ilişkisini açıklamaya yönelik çalışmalar görmek mümkündür. Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin programlama ile doğrudan ilişkisi olduğu görülse de, bir beceri olarak programlamadan fazlası olduğu ifade edilmiştir (Lu & Fletcher, 2009; Qualls & Sherrell, 2010). Bununla birlikte bazı ülkelerin bilgi işlemsel düşünmeyi programlamadan daha fazla önemsemeleri bu görüşü destekler niteliktedir (Şahin, 2018). Hangi konunun daha önemli olduğu tartışılsa da programlama öğretiminin öğrencilerin bilgi işlemsel düşünme becerilerine olumlu etkisi olduğu görülmüştür (Yolcu, 2018; Erdem, 2018). Bu nedenlerle kodlama ve bilgi işlemsel düşünme birbirininden ayrı düşünülemeyen, birbiri üerinde etkisi olan iki kavramdır. Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin öğretim programlarına entegresinin henüz yeterli olmadığı ifade edilmektedir (Wilson & Guzdial, 2010; Kong, 2016). Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin öğretim programlarıyla bütünleştirildiğinde öğrencilerin matematiksel düşünme becerilerinin gelişimine de katkı sağlayabileceği ortaya koyulmuştur (Oluk, 2017). Üst düzey düşünme becerisi olarak da kabul edilen bu becerinin üstün yetenekli öğrencilerin eğitiminde de farklılaştırılmış zenginleştirilmiş etkinlikler olarak katkıda bulunabileceği bulunmuştur (Taş, 2018). Bu becerinin kazandırılması için uzun soluklu çalışmalara ihtyiyaç duyulduğu bu nedenle öğretim programına dahil edilmesinin yerinde olacağı görülmektedir (Çakır, 2017). Türkiye’deki öğretim programlarına bakıldığında, bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin yeni yeni dahil edilmeye başlandığı, şimdilik bu sürece ilkokul, ortaokul, lise ve öğretmen yetiştirme programlarının bilişim teknolojileri derslerine dahil edildiği görülmüştür. Problem çözme becerisinin küçük yaşlardaki önemi göz önüne alındığında, ilkokul ve ortaokuldaki bilişim teknolojileri dersi dışındaki problem çözme becerilerini içeren fen bilimleri ve matematik dersi öğretim programları incelenmiştir. Buna göre problem çözme becerisinin genel olarak amaçlandığı ancak bilgi işlemsel düşünme, algoritmik düşünme gibi güncel problem çözme becerilerini içermediği görülmüştür. Bilgi işlemsel düşünmenin bir çeşit problem çözme becerisi olarak diğer disiplinlerce de kabul görmesi gerekmektedir. Sonuç olarak öğretim programlarında; başta problem çözmeyi amaçlayan sayısal dersler olmak üzere tüm derslerin bilgi işlemsel düşünme becerisini kazandırma amacı ve ilgili içerikler yer almalıdır. Bilgi işlemsel düşünmeyi daha iyi anlayabilmek, faydaını görebilmek için bu alandaki çalışmaların sayısının artması gerektiği ifade edilmiştir (Şahiner, 2017; Patan, 2016). Öğrenciler üzerinde pozitif yönde somut etkiler görmek için öğretim programlarının uygulanmasına yönelik uygulamalı hizmetiçi eğitimler, projeler gerçekleştirilmesi faydalı olacaktır. Bununla birlikte ilgili çalışmaların sadece bilişim alanında değil diğer branş derslerinde disiplinlerarası yapılması bilgi işlemsel düşünme becerisi kazandırmada önemli etki oluşturacaktır.

This is crucial to getting into and staying in ketosis. 3. **Limit Your Carb Intake**: Carefully monitor and limit your daily carb intake to stay within the 20-50 grams range, or whatever specific target you've set based on your dietary goals. 4. **Stay Hydrated**: Increasing water intake is important on a ketogenic diet, as it can help mitigate flu-like symptoms associated with the initial transition into ketosis, known as the \\"keto flu.\\" 5. **Keep an Eye on Electrolytes**: As your body adjusts, you may need additional electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and magnesium) to help manage symptoms like headaches, muscle cramps, and fatigue. 6. **Prioritize Quality Sleep**: Good sleep patterns support the hormonal balance that is vital for weight loss and overall health on the ketogenic diet. 7. **Exercise Regularly**: While dietary adjustments are key, combining the diet with regular exercise can boost ketone levels and help your body enter ketosis more quickly. 8. **Experiment with Intermittent Fasting**: Many find that intermittent fasting pairs well with the ketogenic diet for accelerating fat loss and ketone production. 9. **Be Mindful of Hidden Carbs**: Read labels carefully, as carbs can hide in sauces, dressings, and packaged foods. 10. **Listen to Your Body**: Everyone's body responds differently to dietary changes. Pay attention to how your body responds and adjust your ***Ketogenic Diet*** plan accordingly. 11. **Stay Consistent**: Consistency is key in seeing the benefits of the ketogenic lifestyle. It can take a few days to a few weeks to enter full ketosis, so patience and persistence are essential.

Here's an overview of how to structure a **Ketogenic Diet Food Plans** without compromising the integrity of the dietary approach. Starting the day, breakfast options can include eggs prepared in various ways such as scrambled with cheese and avocado, or an omelet incorporating spinach and mushrooms cooked in butter or coconut oil. Including a source of healthy fats like avocado ensures you're getting the necessary macronutrients to start your day right. For lunch, **Ketogenic Diet Food Plans** often recommend salads with a base of leafy greens such as kale or spinach, topped with high-fat ingredients like cheese and nuts, and a protein source such as grilled chicken or salmon. Using olive oil as a salad dressing further enhances the meal's fat content, aligning with ketogenic principles. Dinner within **Ketogenic Diet Food Plans** can range from fatty cuts of meat like steak or pork belly, served alongside low-carb vegetables like asparagus or broccoli sautéed in butter or olive oil. Another option is fish, such as salmon or sardines, known for their healthy fat content, alongside a side of cauliflower rice or mashed cauliflower to keep the meal low in carbs. Snacks are an essential aspect to consider and might include a handful of nuts, cheese slices, or even a small portion of berries with full-fat cream. These snacks help maintain energy levels and provide a convenient way to ensure adequate fat intake throughout the day. It's also crucial to stay hydrated and manage electrolyte balance by consuming plenty of water and, if necessary, supplementing with electrolytes. This can help avoid the symptoms often associated with the transition to a ketogenic diet, such as the keto flu. Finally, while **Ketogenic Diet Food Plans** emphasize fat intake, it's vital to choose high-quality food sources, incorporating plenty of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids from natural sources like fish and to limit processed foods and unhealthy fats. By focusing on whole, nutrient-dense foods, **Ketogenic Diet Food Plans** not only facilitate the maintenance of ketosis but also support overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"Ketogenic Diet Drinks","completion":"When following a ketogenic diet, it's not just the food that matters—what you drink is also crucial to maintaining ketosis. Here is an overview of suitable drinks for a ketogenic diet: 1. **Water**: The most important beverage to consume on any diet, especially on a ketogenic diet, to stay hydrated. You can add a slice of lemon or lime to enhance the flavor without adding a significant number of carbs. 2. **Sparkling Water**: A good alternative to still water, offering variety without adding carbs. Ensure it's unsweetened and free from artificial sweeteners that could impact blood sugar levels. 3. **Coffee**: Black coffee is virtually carb-free and can be consumed on a ketogenic diet. However, adding sugar or high-carb creamers will break the carb limit. Instead, use heavy cream, almond milk, or coconut milk, and consider sweeteners like stevia or erythritol if you prefer it sweet. 4. **Tea**: Green, black, and herbal teas are excellent choices for the ketogenic diet. They are carb-free if consumed plain, and they offer additional health benefits such as antioxidants. Like with coffee, avoid adding sugar. 5. **Bone Broth**: A nutritious option that can help replenish electrolytes lost through the diuretic effect of the ketogenic diet. Choose bone broth low in carbs and without added sugars. 6. **Almond Milk and Coconut Milk**: Unsweetened almond and coconut milk are keto-friendly and can be used in various drinks as a substitute for regular milk, which is higher in carbs. 7. **Keto Smoothies**: Made with low-carb vegetables like spinach, kale, and avocados, combined with high-fat ingredients such as coconut milk or almond milk. Sweeten with a keto-friendly sweetener if needed. 8. **Vegetable Juice**: If making your own, focus on low-carb vegetables like cucumbers and celery. Commercial vegetable juices are often high in sugar and carbs, so they should be consumed sparingly or avoided. 9. **Diet Soda**: While technically keto-friendly due to the lack of carbs, diet sodas are controversial due to their artificial sweeteners and other additives. Some people choose to include them in moderation, but they are not generally recommended for a healthy ketogenic diet. 10. **Alcohol**: Certain alcoholic drinks can be consumed in moderation on a ketogenic diet, such as spirits (vodka, rum, gin, tequila) mixed with zero-carb mixers. However, alcohol can slow down fat burning and contribute to dehydration. It's important to read labels and be aware of the carb content of beverages, especially when purchasing pre-made or packaged drinks. Keeping the focus on hydration and minimizing carb intake will support your efforts on a ketogenic diet."},{"prompt":"Ketogenic Diet Cakes","completion":"Creating cakes that fit into a ketogenic diet requires some creativity and adjustments to traditional recipes, primarily due to the need to minimize carbohydrates, particularly sugars and flours that are staples in standard cake recipes. However, with the right ingredients, it's entirely possible to enjoy delicious and satisfying cakes that comply with ketogenic dietary restrictions. Here are some key considerations and ingredients for making **ketogenic diet cakes**: # Flour Substitutes - **Almond Flour**: A popular choice for keto baking, almond flour has a fine texture and rich flavor. It's high in fats and low in carbs, making it ideal for keto cakes. - **Coconut Flour**: Another excellent low-carb alternative, coconut flour is highly absorbent, so you'll use less of it than you would other flours. It can add a slight coconut flavor to your cakes. - **Ground Flaxseed or Flax Meal**: Provides a nutty taste and is beneficial for adding fiber. It's used in combination with other flours to improve texture. # Sweeteners - **Erythritol**: A sugar alcohol that has almost no effect on blood sugar levels, making it a favorite among keto dieters for baking. - **Stevia**: A natural sweetener derived from the leaves of the stevia plant. It's much sweeter than sugar, so it's used sparingly. - **Monk Fruit Sweetener**: Another natural option that doesn't raise blood sugar levels, monk fruit sweetener is gaining popularity in keto recipes. # Fats - **Butter**: Unsalted butter is a staple in keto cakes, providing moisture, richness, and flavor. - **Coconut Oil**: A versatile oil that's solid at room temperature, it can be used to replace butter in dairy-free recipes. - **Heavy Cream or Almond Milk**: Used to add moisture to the batter. Heavy cream is great for adding richness, while unsweetened almond milk offers a lighter option. # Leavening Agents - **Baking Powder or Baking Soda**: Essential for helping keto cakes rise. Check that they're fresh to ensure proper leavening. # Flavorings and Add-ins - **Cocoa Powder**: For chocolate cakes, use unsweetened cocoa powder to add rich flavor without added sugars. - **Vanilla Extract**: A dash of vanilla can enhance the flavor complexity of cakes. - **Nuts and Seeds**: Adding chopped nuts (walnuts, pecans) or seeds can provide texture and nutritional value. # Example Recipe Idea **Basic Keto Chocolate Cake**: 1. Whisk together 1 cup almond flour, 1/3 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup erythritol, and 1 tsp baking powder. 2. Mix in 3 eggs, 1/2 cup melted butter, and 1 tsp vanilla extract. 3. Pour batter into a greased cake pan and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. 4. Let cool before serving. Optionally, you can frost with a keto-friendly frosting made from cream cheese, butter, erythritol, and vanilla extract. When making **ketogenic diet cakes**, the key is experimentation and finding the right balance of wet to dry ingredients since low-carb flours absorb moisture differently than traditional wheat flour. With practice, you can enjoy a variety of delicious, keto-compliant cakes that satisfy your sweet tooth without compromising your dietary goals."},{"prompt":"Ketogenic Diet Desserts","completion":"Ketogenic diet desserts allow individuals following a keto lifestyle to enjoy sweet treats without deviating from their nutritional goals. These desserts are crafted to be low in carbohydrates, using keto-friendly ingredients that won't spike blood sugar or disrupt ketosis. Here's a breakdown of common ingredients used in ketogenic diet desserts and a few popular dessert ideas: # Key Ingredients for Keto Desserts: - **Sweeteners:** Natural low-carb sweeteners such as erythritol, stevia, monk fruit sweetener, and allulose are popular choices. They provide sweetness without the carbs found in sugar. - **Flours:** Almond flour and coconut flour replace traditional wheat flour to reduce carb content. They provide structure and texture to baked goods. - **Fats:** High-fat ingredients like butter, coconut oil, and heavy cream add richness and help create a satisfying dessert. - **Eggs:** Essential for adding structure and helping ingredients bind together in the absence of gluten. - **Cocoa Powder:** Unsweetened cocoa powder or dark chocolate (with a high cacao content and low sugar) are used for chocolate desserts. - **Vanilla Extract:** Adds flavor depth to a variety of desserts. - **Cream Cheese:** Used in many keto dessert recipes for its texture and fat content, making dishes creamy and delicious. # Popular Ketogenic Diet Dessert Ideas: 1. **Keto Cheesecake:** A classic cheesecake made with cream cheese, eggs, a low-carb sweetener, and almond flour for the crust. It captures the creamy texture and tangy flavor of traditional cheesecake without the carbs. 2. **Keto Chocolate Mousse:** A simple blend of heavy cream, unsweetened cocoa powder, and a keto-friendly sweetener, whipped together to create a light and fluffy mousse. 3. **Keto Brownies:** Made with almond or coconut flour, butter, unsweetened chocolate or cocoa powder, eggs, and a low-carb sweetener. These can be dense and fudgy or light and cakey, depending on the recipe. 4. **Keto Ice Cream:** Homemade keto ice cream often uses a combination of heavy cream, a keto-friendly sweetener, and vanilla extract, churned in an ice cream maker or mixed and frozen. Variations include adding cocoa powder, nuts, or low-carb fruit for different flavors. 5. **Keto Lemon Bars:** A tangy dessert featuring an almond flour crust and a lemony filling made with eggs, lemon juice, and a low-carb sweetener. The result is a refreshing and slightly tart treat. 6. **Fat Bombs:** Not a traditional dessert, but fat bombs are popular in the keto community for a sweet treat that's high in fat and low in carbs. Ingredients often include coconut oil, cocoa butter, nuts, seeds, and a sweetener, formed into small balls or bars. By using keto-friendly ingredients, it's possible to recreate many traditional desserts in a form that aligns with ketogenic dietary guidelines. Whether you prefer baked goods, creamy desserts, or frozen treats, there's likely a keto version that satisfies your cravings while keeping carbs in check."},{"prompt":"Ketogenic Diet","completion":"The ketogenic diet, commonly referred to as \\"keto,\\" is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat dietary regimen that has gained popularity for its potential health benefits and effectiveness in weight loss. The fundamental principle behind the ketogenic diet is to induce a metabolic state known as ketosis, where the body shifts its energy source from glucose, derived from carbohydrates, to ketones, which are produced from stored fat. This metabolic adaptation occurs when carbohydrate intake is drastically reduced and fat intake is significantly increased, prompting the body to efficiently burn fats for energy. # Key Components of the Ketogenic Diet: 1. **Low Carbohydrate Intake:** Carbohydrates are typically limited to about 20 to 50 grams per day. This restriction helps lower blood sugar and insulin levels, leading the body to access stored fat for energy. 2. **High Fat Intake:** The diet emphasizes consuming fats from both animal and plant sources, including meat, fish, dairy, eggs, nuts, and oils. Fats provide the majority of daily calories, usually around 70% to 80% of total intake. 3. **Moderate Protein Intake:** Protein is consumed in moderation, typically around 20% of daily calories. Excessive protein can be converted to glucose, which might hinder the ketosis process. # Potential Health Benefits: The ketogenic diet has been explored for various health applications beyond weight loss. Some of the potential benefits include: - **Enhanced Weight Loss:** By shifting the body's metabolism to burn fat for fuel, the ketogenic diet can lead to significant weight loss. The high fat and protein content also helps to reduce hunger and increase satiety. - **Blood Sugar and Insulin Management:** The diet's low-carbohydrate nature helps to stabilize blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity, which can be beneficial for managing and preventing type 2 diabetes. - **Improved Heart Health:** Although high in fats, if healthy fats are chosen, the ketogenic diet can improve markers such as HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and triglycerides, contributing to a lower risk of heart disease. - **Neuroprotective Effects:** There is evidence suggesting the ketogenic diet may have neuroprotective benefits and could support the management of neurological disorders like epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. # Considerations and Drawbacks: While the ketogenic diet offers potential health benefits, there are considerations and drawbacks to be mindful of: - **Adaptation Period:** The initial phase of the ketogenic diet often comes with side effects, sometimes referred to as the \\"keto flu,\\" which can include headache, fatigue, dizziness, and irritability. - **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Restricting carbohydrates means limiting the intake of certain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which could lead to deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals. - **Long-Term Sustainability:** For some, the dietary restrictions of the ketogenic diet may be difficult to maintain over the long term, which can lead to yo-yo dieting and fluctuations in weight. - **Potential Health Risks:** As with any high-fat diet, there is ongoing debate and investigation into the potential long-term health risks or negative side effects associated with the ketogenic diet. Ultimately, while the ketogenic diet can offer numerous benefits and may be suitable for many individuals, it's important for anyone considering this dietary approach to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to ensure it's appropriate for their health status and lifestyle."},{"prompt":"ketogenic diet plan","completion":"A well-structured ketogenic diet plan focuses on high-fat, adequate-protein, and low-carbohydrate foods.

The factory was a magical place, filled with colorful paints, shiny plastic molds, and a team of dedicated toymakers. One toymaker in particular, named Geppetto, had a special talent for bringing toys to life. He worked tirelessly in his workshop, carefully carving each wooden figure and painting them with bright, cheerful colors. Geppetto poured his heart and soul into every toy he created, infusing them with a bit of his own magic. One day, as Geppetto was putting the finishing touches on a new toy, a mischievous fairy named Tinkerbell fluttered into his workshop. Intrigued by Geppetto's skill and dedication, Tinkerbell decided to sprinkle some of her own magic dust on his latest creation. To Geppetto's amazement, the toy sprang to life before his eyes, blinking and smiling up at him. Overjoyed, Geppetto named the toy Woody, after his favorite cowboy character from a storybook. Woody quickly became Geppetto's favorite creation, with his adventurous spirit and kind heart. But little did Geppetto know that Tinkerbell's magic had unintended consequences. The other toys in the factory soon began to come to life as well, causing chaos and excitement throughout the workshop. From a sassy cowgirl doll named Jessie to a space ranger action figure named Buzz, the toys brought joy and laughter to Geppetto's life. As the toys bonded and formed a special friendship with each other, Geppetto realized that these creations were more than just playthings - they were his family. And so, in the days before Toy Story began, the toys of Geppetto's workshop lived happily together, dreaming of the adventures that awaited them in the outside world."},{"prompt":"Consider the following 1. 10 letter words which are composed of only the letters A and B are mutated by removing a single letter from a fixed position. 2.

It asks the user to input three pairs of original and mutated words, entering them one pair at a time, separated by a space. 2.

It checks character by character until it finds the first instance where the characters do not match, which indicates the position of the removed letter. If there is no discrepancy until the last character, it's assumed that the removal happened at the end. Now, even if the actual removed letter's position might vary, the script checks each pair individually and expects them to be consistently at the same location across all inputs to confirm the operation was identical for all cases, as per your initial requirement."},{"prompt":"what is similar android app like ios, things 3?","completion":"As of my last update in 2023, \\"Things 3\\" is a popular task management app available exclusively on iOS and macOS platforms, developed by Cultured Code.

Если вы хотите сделать срез по значениям элементов от 600 до 1200, то необходимо вначале найти индексы этих элементов, а уже затем выполнить срез. Прямого способа сделать срез по *значениям* элементов Python не предлагает. Ниже представлено решение задачи, при условии что ваш список отсортирован: \`\`\`python lst = sorted([i for i in range(0, 2000, 100)]) # Пример списка, который отсортирован и содержит элементы от 0 до 1900 с шагом 100 # lst будет выглядеть как [0, 100, 200 ..., 1900] # Нахождение индекса для начала среза (для 600) start_index = lst.index(600) if 600 in lst else None # Нахождение индекса для конца среза (для 1200) end_index = lst.index(1200) if 1200 in lst else None # Если оба индекса найдены, делаем срез списка if start_index is not None and end_index is not None: sliced_list = lst[start_index:end_index+1] # +1 чтобы включить сам элемент с 1200 print(sliced_list) \`\`\` Однако, если список не отсортирован или если вы ищете не точные значения, а диапазон значений (то есть, получить срез от первого элемента, значение которого больше или равно 600, до последнего элемента, значение которого меньше или равно 1200), вам нужно использовать другой подход: \`\`\`python lst = [i for i in range(0, 2000, 100)] # Пример списка # Создание среза с помощью генератора списка sliced_list = [x for x in lst if 600 <= x <= 1200] print(sliced_list) \`\`\` В этом случае вы работаете непосредственно с значениями, и выражение в квадратных скобках \`600 <= x <= 1200\` фильтрует элементы списка на основе их значений, а не индексов."},{"prompt":"600 и 1200 индексы","completion":"Если 600 и 1200 это индексы, и вам нужно извлечь срез элементов между этими индексами включительно, то делается это довольно просто. В Python список можно срезать, указав начальный и конечный индексы в квадратных скобках. Важно помнить, что в Python первый элемент имеет индекс 0, и что конечный индекс в срезе не включается в результат. Поэтому, если вам нужно включить элемент с индексом 1200 в срез, нужно указать конечный индекс как 1201. Синтаксис для среза будет выглядеть так: \`\`\`python # Предположим, что у вас есть список my_list my_list = [...] # Чтобы получить срез между элементами с индексами 600 и 1200 включительно sliced_list = my_list[600:1201] print(sliced_list) \`\`\` Этот код создаст срез списка \`my_list\`, начиная с элемента с индексом 600 и заканчивая элементом с индексом 1200, включая оба этих элемента. Обратите внимание, что если в вашем списке меньше 1201 элемента, попытка доступа к элементу с индексом 1200 приведёт к ошибке \`IndexError: list index out of range\`. Чтобы избежать такой ситуации, можно добавить проверку на длину списка: \`\`\`python if len(my_list) > 1200: sliced_list = my_list[600:1201] print(sliced_list) else: print(\\"Список слишком короткий для такого среза.\\") \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"Как написать гпт, чтобы он возвращал ответ в json формате","completion":"Для формирования ответа от GPT (или любого другого ИИ или программы) в формате JSON, вы можете использовать стандартный модуль Python \`json\`.

Xét hai số nguyên dương x và y bất kì. Ta kí hiệu 𝑙𝑐𝑚(𝑥, 𝑦) là bội chung nhỏ nhất của x và y. Cho dãy số nguyên dương A gồm n phần tử 𝑎1 , 𝑎2 , … , 𝑎𝑛. Hãy đếm số cặp chỉ số (𝑖,𝑗) thoả mãn: 𝑎𝑖 + 𝑎𝑗 = 2 × 𝑙𝑐𝑚(𝑎𝑖 , 𝑎𝑗 ) 𝑣ớ𝑖 1 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛 Dữ liệu: Vào từ tệp LCMPAIR.INP:  Dòng đầu tiên chứa số nguyên 𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 105 ) là số phần tử của dãy A.  Dòng thứ hai gồm 𝑛 số nguyên dương 𝑎1 , 𝑎2 , … , 𝑎𝑛 (1 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 109 ). Kết quả: Ghi ra tệp LCMPAIR.OUT một số nguyên là kết quả cần tìm. làm bài này bằng c++","completion":"Giải bài toán này bằng C++ đòi hỏi phải nghĩ về cách tối ưu để tìm số cặp chỉ số (𝑖, 𝑗) thỏa mãn điều kiện đã cho. Cần chú ý rằng kiểm tra từng cặp (𝑖, 𝑗) có thể dẫn đến độ phức tạp là O(n^2) và có thể không khả thi với n lớn (với 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). Dưới đây là một cách tiếp cận hiệu quả hơn. Nhận xét quan trọng: Nếu (a_i + a_j = 2 times lcm(a_i, a_j)), điều này có nghĩa là (lcm(a_i, a_j) = a_i = a_j). Điều này bởi vì LCM (Least Common Multiple - Bội chung nhỏ nhất) của hai số bằng nhau chính là chính chúng, và tổng của chúng sẽ gấp đôi LCM. Do đó, bài toán trở thành việc đếm số cặp (i, j) sao cho (a_i = a_j). Ta có thể giải quyết vấn đề này bởi việc sử dụng một hash map (hoặc dictionary trong một số ngôn ngữ khác) để đếm số lượng xuất hiện của mỗi số trong dãy. Sau đó, với mỗi số duy nhất, ta sẽ tính số cặp (i, j) có thể có từ số lượng đó. \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <vector> #include <unordered_map> using namespace std; long long countPairs(const vector<int>& arr) { unordered_map<int, long long> count_map; // Đếm số lượng xuất hiện của mỗi số for (int num : arr) { ++count_map[num]; } long long result = 0; // Tính số cặp có thể có từ mỗi số for (auto& entry : count_map) { long long count = entry.second; // Số cặp có thể tạo từ count phần tử là count*(count-1)/2 result += count * (count - 1) / 2; } return result; } int main() { int n; cin >> n; vector<int> arr(n); for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { cin >> arr[i]; } cout << countPairs(arr) << endl; return 0; } \`\`\` Trong đoạn code này, ta tiến hành: 1. Đọc dữ liệu đầu vào. 2. Sử dụng hash map \`count_map\` để đếm số lần xuất hiện của mỗi số trong \`arr\`. 3. Với mỗi số duy nhất trong \`count_map\`, tính số lượng cặp có thể có được và cộng dồn vào \`result\`. 4. In kết quả \`result\`, là tổng số cặp thỏa mãn yêu cầu."},{"prompt":"ستترجم لي الكود الذي سأرسله لك للانجليزية","completion":"بالطبع، يمكنك إرسال الكود وسأقوم بترجمته لك إلى الإنجليزية."},{"prompt":"<div dir=\\"rtl\\" style=\\"text-align: right;\\" trbidi=\\"on\\"><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\">مرحبا بكم في&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://thesportyrealm.blogspot.com/?m=1\\" target=\\"_blank\\">thesportyrealm</a>،&nbsp;باستعمالك لهذا الموقع، فإنك توافق على أن تتقيد وتلتزم بالشروط والأحكام التالية لذا، يرجى منك الاطلاع على هذه الأحكام بدقة. أن كنت لا توافق على هذه الأحكام، فعليك ألا تتطلع على المعلومات المتوفرة في المدونه.</div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"> جميع قوالب بلوجر الموجودة في&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://thesportyrealm.blogspot.com/?m=1\\" target=\\"_blank\\">thesportyrealm</a>&nbsp;معروضه \\"كما هي\\" بدون أى ضمانات واستخدامك للموقع على مسؤوليتك الشخصيه فقط كما لا يلتزم&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://thesportyrealm.blogspot.com/?m=1\\" target=\\"_blank\\">thesportyrealm</a>&nbsp;أو ادارته بأي مسؤوليه أو تعويض عن أيه أخطاء ناتجه من استخدامك للموقع، أو احدى خدماته أو محتوياته ويخلي مسؤوليته من أي عقود أو اتفاقات جرت بشكل مستقل بين مستخدميه أو أي جهة أخرى.</div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: right;\\"><ul style=\\"text-align: right;\\"><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">توفر المدونة إمكانية التعليق على المحتوى المنشور فيها.</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">يحق لك كما لكل المستخدمين المشاركة في التعليق، على ألا تقوم بنشر أي محتوى يمكن أن يكون ضارًا، غير مشروع، تشهيري، مخالف، مسيء، محرض، قذر، مضايق أو ما شابه ذلك. أنت وحدك المسؤول عن التعليقات التي تشارك بها.&nbsp;</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">حقوق الملكية الفكرية للتعليقات تبقى مسجلة لك. لكن يحق لصاحب المدونة إعادة استخدام التعليقات في أي نشاط متعلق بالمدونة دون الحاجة إلى طلب إذن مسبق من صاحب التعليق، بشرط أن يقوم بذكر إسم صاحب التعليق ولا يعدل على التعليق بشكل يؤدي إلى التحريف في معناه.&nbsp;</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">للتعليق في المدونة يفضل ذكر اسمك الشخصي. يمكنك استخدام اسم مستعار، لكن لا يسمح أبدًا بانتحال اسم أي شخص أو هيئة.&nbsp;</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">يفضل ذكر بريدك الإلكتروني الحقيقي عند التعليق. المدونة تلتزم بعدم استخدام هذا البريد في أي نشاط سوى المراسلات الشخصية. وتلتزم بألا تسلم بريدك إلى أي طرف ثالث دون إذن مسبق منك.&nbsp;</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">يجب عليك ألا تعدل أو تكيف المدونة ولا استخدامها بطرق غير مشروعة أو بأي طرق أخرى يمكن أن تضر أو تعطل المدونة.&nbsp;</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">تقوم المدونة بجمع بعض البيانات الخاصة بك، مثل نوع المتصفح، نظام التشغيل، رقم IP… إلخ. الهدف من جمع هذه البيانات هو تحسين مستوى الخدمة.&nbsp;</li><li style=\\"text-align: right;\\">يحق للمدونة مشاركة هذه البيانات مع طرف ثالث دون أن تقوم بالربط بين هذه البيانات وهويتك الشخصية.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\">قد تتغيّر هذه الاتفاقية من فترة لأخرى بما نراه مناسباً لهدف المدونة، لذا أرجو منك مراجعتها والتقيّد بما فيها. </div><div style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><br /></div><h3 style=\\"text-align: justify;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: normal;\\"><span style=\\"color: #406ff3;

Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info! Admin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days. Please feel free to open a new one if you have more news or want to continue the discussion about the upcoming Squish cartoon. Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September Thread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! ☀️📺 GreenJelly223: Summer’s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB’s lineup! We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing Thread Title: Revealed: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!✨🤖 CartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery’s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic!

Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment.

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! I thought I’d list properties exclusive to each block (24/7 channel in 4Kids TV’s case) effective April 13 4Kids TV Exclusive Shows: Glitter Force: A team of teenage girls become superheroes to save the world from a group of fairytale monsters who want to revive the evil Emperor Nogo, Four Eyes!: Emma is a 11 year old squid-like, four eyed pink alien girl from Albacore 7, who is sent from her planet to Payne Academy Boarding School on Earth to repeat 5th grade, Her only friends are 2 boys named Pete and Skyler, The worst part is that her human form is a stereotypical geek, complete with buckteeth and glasses, But with a bit of resourcefulness, life in boarding school will no longer have any suprises for her Tomodachi Life: Joseph is mayor of the madcap Greenock Island, He has to stop the island from falling into chaos every day, but with the help from his fellow Miis, life in a island is easy. One Piece: Monkey D. Luffy and his friends: The Straw Hat Pirates set out in search of the legendary One Piece, hidden by Gol. D Roger CW4Kids Exclusive Shows: The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: Gloopy, a teal gooey blob and his best friend Glitter, a sparkling fuschia (still gooey) blob, hail from the planet of Gloopiter, Laugh along as they travel through the galaxy Code Lyoko: A group of kids: Jeremy, Aelita, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi do battle against a evil computer program XANA in a virtural world known as Lyoko The Gees (shorts, so shown inbetween shows): Meet G-Girl, G-Boy and G-Cat, the world’s first alien visitors, Unlike B-movie horror villans, these are kind, but annoying aliens, They always try to get involved in human activity, of which they understand nothing, Even to the point where humans think horror movie monsters would be more desirable than these “peaceful” Gees. The Owl (also shorts): Life is hard for this pink owl, Despite wanting to relax on his bench, bad luck has other plans for him, No matter what, this poor owl has the worst luck possible, and always ends each episode blown to smithereens, Do us a favor and don’t laugh: it’s cruel Write a follow up where a user says Shaman King is also 4Kids TV exclusive, and on another note the company seems to have 4 normal toons under their wing now (GGR, FE, TAOG&G and Cl), The shorts don’t count Thread Title: CW4Kids & 4Kids TV’s Exclusive Toons & Updates 📺✨ RetroToonFan: Just wanted to point out that Shaman King is also a 4Kids TV exclusive! Pretty exciting to see them bringing back this epic adventure. On another note, it seems like 4Kids Entertainment now officially has four main cartoons under their wing for CW4Kids - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, Four Eyes!, Glitter Force, and Code Lyoko. ToonEnthusiast123: That’s right! Shaman King’s inclusion is a big win for 4Kids TV. It adds a good mix of action and mystical drama to their lineup. As for CW4Kids, seeing them maintain a unique blend with shows like Gloopy and Glitter is fascinating. I’m curious how this balance between nostalgia and newer properties will play out for them. PixelDoodler: Super pumped for Shaman King! It’s such an underrated gem. But let’s talk about CW4Kids - Gloopy and Glitter represent such a fresh take on adventurous toons, while Code Lyoko offers that sci-fi intrigue. With Four Eyes! and Glitter Force, it’s like 4Kids is exploring diverse genres to cater to everyone. AnimationAficionado: It’s interesting to analyze 4Kids Entertainment’s approach. They seem to be carefully selecting shows to cater to various interests, ensuring a diverse palette. However, I wonder if they’re considering expanding their repertoire further beyond these four main attractions and occasional shorts like The Gees and The Owl. DigitalBytes: Don’t forget those shorts! Even though they’re not considered part of the “main” lineup, they add a lot of character to the programming. The Gees and The Owl have their own unique charm that fills in the gaps quite nicely. But yes, the main toon lineup shows a strategic approach to appealing across the board. SketchyArtKid: Honestly, The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter have been such a breath of fresh air. It’s always great seeing how creative shows can get, and having Code Lyoko sticking around gives the lineup that solid anchor. I’m eagerly waiting to see if 4Kids plans to introduce more “normal toons” to CW4Kids or if they’ll continue to diversify with more shorts. ToonTalker91: With Shaman King on 4Kids TV and the mix of adventures and sci-fi on CW4Kids, it’s like they’re trying to secure every corner of the toon spectrum. The real question is, what’s next? Will they lean more into these established genres, or is there another surprise genre they’re aiming to introduce? Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with the discussions and speculations! Our goal is to offer a range of programming that appeals to various tastes while pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in the lineup. Your favorite might just be around the corner. Thanks for your continued support! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a convo in late April where TL is going away, G&G is coming to 4Kids TV to take its place, Also Kirby is leaving the CW in late May, our currently 24/7 channel exclusive alien is taking its place Thread Title: Late April Shakeup: Tomodachi Life Departing, G&G and Alien Surprise Incoming! 🌌📺 ToonMasterJay: Heads up, team! Just caught wind that Tomodachi Life’s journey on CW4Kids is wrapping up by end of April. Bittersweet, but hey, every season finale preludes a new beginning, right? And guess what’s making waves? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is migrating from CW to 4Kids TV! DigitalToonFan: Whoa, serious moves in the lineup! “Tomodachi Life” had a quirky charm, for sure. But “Gloopy and Glitter” hopping over to 4Kids TV? Interesting switch. They’ve got that intergalactic buddy vibe that could really shine there. And Kirby’s space? Filled by our beloved 24/7 channel exclusive alien, huh? Intriguing! AnimationAficionado: Honestly, “Gloopy and Glitter” has that universal appeal (pun intended), perfect for 4Kids TV. But I’m really curious about our exclusive alien friend taking up residence on CW in place of Kirby. Such a mystery! Any teasers on who this extraterrestrial might be? GoGoFan223: Sad to see Kirby float off into the sunset, but excited for the alien to land! “Gloopy and Glitter” always had that zany, out-of-this-world vibe that’ll probably resonate well on 4Kids TV. As for the alien, fingers crossed for something as charismatic and engaging! SonicXforever: “Tomodachi Life” leaving is like the end of an era, but change is the name of the game. “Gloopy and Glitter” will surely bring their sparkle to 4Kids TV. Now, about our alien – could this mean even more cosmic adventures? CW4Kids and 4Kids TV really know how to keep the universe expanding. PokeNostalgia101: A little heartbroken over Kirby’s departure – those adventures were a blast. But, if the CW4Kids tradition holds, our new alien amigo will fill those boots and then some. As for “Gloopy and Glitter”, those two are about to become interstellar icons over at 4Kids TV. LyokoLover: It’s always interesting to see how these shifts play out. “G&G” has been doing well, so 4Kids TV seems like a logical next chapter for them. Meanwhile, Kirby leaving a void? Let’s hope our new alien resident brings a blend of humor and adventure to fill that vacuum. ComicStripKid: So much happening! While I’ll miss the faces leaving, “Gloopy and Glitter’s” move and the mysterious alien arrival promise fresh storylines and laughs. The CW4Kids universe seems to be ever-evolving. Here’s hoping the alien is as entertaining as our departing friends! ToonTalker91: Changes abound! It’s the cosmic cycle of toon life - some shows set beyond the horizon while new stars rise. “Gloopy and Glitter” will definitely add their unique luster to 4Kids TV. Eagerly awaiting our alien’s unveiling. May it bring a galaxy of new stories to explore! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with your enthusiasm and speculations! Transitions, like the ones you’re seeing, are part of our commitment to keeping our lineup fresh and engaging. Rest assured, “Gloopy and Glitter” and our new extraterrestrial addition are just the beginning of more exciting things to come. Stay tuned and keep watching — adventure is always around the corner!

Seems like our screens will be hosting quite the interstellar party! ToonMasterJay: The addition of “Four Eyes!” really solidifies the extraterrestrial theme they’re going for. But here’s a thought – what if 4Kids is plotting an Alien Hour for the summer? Imagine back-to-back alien adventures, capped off with “The Gees” in between as a quirky interlude. That’d be something! DigitalToonFan: An Alien Hour would be epic! “Four Eyes!”, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”, plus “The Gees” shorts? Sounds like a perfect blend of cosmic chaos and laughter. It’s like they’re curating a dedicated space block for all of us sci-fi toon heads. GoGoFan223: Loving the sound of that! An Alien Hour could really showcase the diversity in their extraterrestrial storytelling. Plus, “The Gees” slots in so naturally – they bring a unique charm that could glue the whole hour together. SonicXforever: The potential for an Alien Hour got me thinking – 4Kids has always been about pushing creative boundaries. This could be their way of testing the waters for more themed hours. And honestly, who doesn’t love a good alien tale? PokeNostalgia101: If anyone can make an Alien Hour work, it’s 4Kids. They’ve got a knack for mixing up genres and themes in the coolest ways. And with “The Gees” as comedic relief? Count me in! Just hoping the variety stays fresh and keeps us on our toes. LyokoLover: The more I think about it, the more I get on board with the Alien Hour idea. These characters and stories offer so much in terms of creativity and fun. It’s a brilliant way to keep viewers engaged, especially over the summer when everyone’s looking for an escape. ComicStripKid: An Alien Hour seems like a great strategy to pull viewers into a universe 4Kids is crafting. I mean, alien adventures are timeless, and integrating “The Gees” means there’s never a dull moment. Here’s hoping they take the leap and make it happen! ToonTalker91: It’s all about creating an experience, and an Alien Hour could really set a unique tone for the summer. Plus, it’d give “Four Eyes!” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a fantastic platform to shine even brighter. Fingers crossed 4Kids goes for it!

From sequels and reboots to fresh dubs of hit anime, it looks like CW4Kids is aiming to cater to a wide audience this fall. Also, can’t help but wonder how “Code Lyoko” will interact with these new additions. ComicStripKid: “Redakai” and “Pokémon Horizons” will be great for keeping that action-adventure vibe going strong, while “My Dad the Spy” could add a wholesome yet thrilling family dynamic. Plus, those shorts like “The Owl” are perfect palate cleansers between heavier shows. ToonTalker91: “Vampire Hunters” could be the wildcard of the bunch, considering its origin.

ToonArchivist42: Yeah, I noticed the webpage swap too! It was pretty low-key, but definitely hinted at something big. “World of Quest” has that unique blend of humor and adventure that’s been missing. Glad CW4Kids is bringing back some fan favorites.

The show always had potential; it just needed the right moment to shine again. Looks like that time is now.

Well played, CW4Kids, well played. Excited to see where they take the storyline this season! AdventureAwait: This is the best news! “World of Quest” has that rare mix of epic quests and laugh-out-loud moments. It’s the comeback I didn’t know I was waiting for. Really curious to see if they’ll introduce new characters or stick with the classic crew. PixelPundit: Super psyched for the return, but also intrigued by how it’ll fit with the rest of the CW4Kids lineup. It’s quite diverse this year. “World of Quest” brings a specific flavor that complements the existing shows. Kudos to whoever’s curating the fall schedule!

That show was a gem that deserved more spotlight. And “Four Eyes!” has that fresh, quirky vibe that could really resonate with the audience. CW4Kids is on a roll here. ToonTalker91: The block extension to 12:30pm is curious. It’s like they’re pacing themselves for a larger strategy, possibly eyeing to dominate the Saturday morning cartoon space even more. More shows mean more diversity in content, and I’m all for that. PixelPundit: As much as I love this news, I wonder how they’ll pace the introduction of “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” within the current lineup.

Both aired on the 4Kids block back in 2024, but my searches are turning up nothing solid. Here's what I remember: 1. The first show was about these liquid-like creatures. The lead characters were these blobby, gooey entities. The male character was this teal color, and the female character was very sparkly, almost glittery. They had these intergalactic adventures, I think? It was a whimsical and fun show from what I can recall. 2. The second show was this short cartoon with an incredibly unlucky creature. It was some sort of animal that just had the worst luck imaginable. Every episode, it would find itself in some new unfortunate situation. It usually sat on a tree or something similar in its episodes before things went hilariously south. The level of misfortune it faced was almost like it was being tortured, but it was all in a slapstick, cartoonish manner. Does anyone have any ideas what these shows were called?"},{"prompt":"Write a users reply","completion":"User: ClassicToonFan Reply: Hey there! Sounds like you're looking for a couple of gems from the 2024 4Kids lineup. 1. The first show you're describing is definitely \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.\\" It's all about these two liquid-like creatures, Gloopy and Glitter, who go on various adventures across the galaxy. Gloopy is indeed teal, and Glitter is exactly as her name suggests - very sparkly and glittery. It was quite a hit for its unique characters and creative storytelling. 2. The second show is \\"The Owl.\\" It's a series of shorts about, well, an owl with notoriously bad luck. Every episode, it ends up in disastrous situations despite its best efforts to just chill out on its tree. Its unluckiness reaches almost epic proportions, making for some pretty funny slapstick humor. Hope that helps solve the mystery for you!"},{"prompt":"Write the OP's reply, thanking him","completion":"User: ToonSeeker21 Reply: @ClassicToonFan, you're a lifesaver! That's exactly what I was trying to remember - \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" and \\"The Owl.\\" Just hearing the names brings back so many memories of watching them. I couldn't for the life of me recall their titles, and it was driving me up the wall. Thank you so much for clearing that up for me. Time to go on a nostalgia trip and rewatch them if I can find them anywhere. Thanks again!"},{"prompt":"Write the OP saying 3 shows from the same block, but he never forgot their names","completion":"User: ToonSeeker21 Reply: While I was wracking my brain over \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" and \\"The Owl,\\" there were three shows from the same 4Kids block in 2024 that I never forgot the names of: 1. **\\"Code Lyoko\\"** – That show was unforgettable with its blend of 2D and 3D animation. The adventures of Jeremy, Aelita, Ulrich, Odd, and Yumi fighting against XANA had me hooked every Saturday morning. 2. **\\"Pokémon Horizons: The Series\\"** – As a huge Pokémon fan, this addition to the Pokémon universe stayed with me. The new adventures and Pokémon they introduced were exciting, and I loved the fresh take on the series. 3. **\\"World of Quest\\"** – This show’s humor and unique animation style made it stand out. Quest, Prince Nestor, and their band of unlikely heroes on their quest to save the Kingdom of Odyssia was always entertaining. These shows were staples of my childhood viewing, and I've rewatched them more times than I can count.

Each of those shows holds a special place in my heart for different reasons, but if I had to pick a favorite, I’d say \\"Code Lyoko.\\" There was something about the blend of real-world and virtual world adventures that really captured my imagination. The idea of dual lives, fighting to save the world in secret, and the friendships between the characters really resonated with me. Plus, the unique art style and the transition between animation styles were so cool. It's a show that sparked a lot of creativity in me as a kid, and I still find it incredibly compelling to this day. How about you?

This is kind of embarrassing, but it completely slipped my mind until now. There was this show where all the characters were designed like balls – quite a unique art style that set it apart. I distinctly remember a blue rabbit character and another magenta character with spiky hair and round glasses. Their spherical designs made the show's animation and character movements really interesting and fun to watch. Does this ring a bell for anyone? I can't believe I forgot to mention this one earlier! --- User: ClassicToonFan Reply: @ToonSeeker21, the show you're remembering sounds like \\"GoGoRiki\\" (also known as \\"Gogoriki\\" or \\"Smeshariki\\" in other regions). The characters are indeed designed like balls, which made for some really creative and amusing animation. The blue rabbit you mentioned is most likely Pogoriki, and the magenta character with spiky hair and round glasses has got to be Chikoriki. \\"GoGoRiki\\" was great for its humor and the way it approached moral and educational themes in such a lighthearted manner.

Hoping someone here can help jog my memory: 1. The first one was centered around this gooey, orange creature. The main plot involved it constantly trying to evade some scientists who were always on its tail, trying to capture it for study, I assume. The creature had a really expressive face and could change shapes, which made for some hilarious escapes. 2. The second series of shorts were these random animated sketches. They were quite diverse in their storytelling, but I distinctly recall one episode that featured horses and another with a dinosaur. The animation style was pretty unique, making these shorts stand out. Do these ring a bell for anyone? They were such a fun part of the Kids WB lineup right before it ended. --- User: ClassicToonArchivist Reply: @AnimationNostalgia, you've got some deep cuts there, but I think I know exactly what you're talking about! 1. The orange creature short sounds like \\"Lamput.\\" Lamput is indeed a gooey, shape-shifting entity always trying to dodge the scientists determined to catch it. Its ability to morph into almost anything led to some really entertaining and clever scenarios. 2. For the random animated sketches, you're describing \\"Planet Sketch.\\" This series featured a variety of short skits with different characters and settings, including the horse and dinosaur segments you mentioned. The diverse animation styles and humor were definitely memorable aspects of this show. Both were part of Kids WB's final forays into animated shorts, marking a creative period just before the transition to CW4Kids.

It was such a unique and fun show that aired during the golden era of CW4Kids. The characters were so endearing and creative, set against the backdrop of endless cosmic adventures. I still have vivid images in my mind of Gloopy, the male protagonist, who was this charming, teal, gooey blob. He had this perpetually optimistic outlook that made even the direst situations seem manageable. And then there was Glitter, his sparkly pink counterpart. Her whole body shimmered, and she had this beautiful, glowing aura that practically lit up the screen. She wore round glasses that added to her intelligent yet adventurous persona. They made such a great duo, navigating through the galaxy with a mix of humor and heart. Their design was so simple yet so memorable. It’s shows like these that truly showcased the creativity of animators and storytellers of that time. Really wish there was a way to bring them, or at least a show like it, back into the limelight. Does anyone else share this nostalgia for Gloopy and Glitter? --- User: CosmicCartoonLover Reply: Absolutely, @StellarToonFan! Gloopy and Glitter hold a special place in my heart. I loved how Gloopy's simplicity was contrasted by Glitter's sparkle, making them visually captivating characters despite their minimalist design. It was their personalities and the dynamic between them that truly brought those characters to life. Watching them deal with galactic-scale issues using wit and a dash of whimsy was the highlight of my viewing experience back in the day. It's shows like \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" that remind me why I fell in love with cartoons in the first place. Their adventures were always so full of hope and the joy of discovery. I miss that kind of creativity and positivity in shows today. Thanks for bringing up such a gem, really takes me back! --- User: NostalgiaNerd Reply: @StellarToonFan, @CosmicCartoonLover, you've both captured exactly what made \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" so magical! Their complementing designs and personalities, the blend of humor with genuine moments of tenderness, it was all perfect. What I wouldn't give to watch a new episode or even reruns. Perhaps it's time for a campaign to bring our gooey and glittery friends back to the screen? In the age of reboots and revivals, Gloopy and Glitter definitely deserve their moment again. Who's with me? 🌌✨ --- Admin: ToonRevive Reply: Hey there, nostalgic toon fans! It's truly heartwarming to see the love for \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" still going strong.

User: ToonTimeTraveler Post: Hey fellow toon enthusiasts, I’ve been hit with a wave of nostalgia lately and found myself yearning for \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.\\" I remember it used to air on CW4Kids, but I also recall that its original home was on S4C. Does anyone know if it’s still being rerun on S4C? I’d love to catch those episodes again, especially to relive the vibrant and quirky adventures of Gloopy and Glitter. Their unique dynamic and the imaginative universe they explored were truly something special. Any info would be greatly appreciated! --- User: CymruCartoonFan Reply: Hey @ToonTimeTraveler, great to see another fan of Gloopy and Glitter! I’ve been keeping an eye on S4C's schedule because it's a treasure trove for nostalgic shows like this. As of my last check, \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" hasn't been on the regular schedule, but S4C does occasionally bring back classic series for special rerun blocks or themed weekends. Your best bet would be to monitor their schedule around holiday periods or to reach out directly via their audience contact or social media channels. Sometimes broadcasters respond well to direct interest in shows for potential reruns! --- User: GalacticNostalgia Reply: @ToonTimeTraveler, @CymruCartoonFan has the right idea. Recently, S4C did a nostalgia run that included some older animated series, but I must’ve missed \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.\\" It’s such a shame because it feels like there’s a growing appreciation for these classics. Maybe if enough of us show interest, they might consider a rerun. It might also be worth checking streaming platforms or official digital channels, as some networks have taken to sharing older content online for streaming or download. Let’s keep our fingers crossed and our voices loud! --- User: ToonTimeTraveler Reply: Thanks, @CymruCartoonFan and @GalacticNostalgia, for the insights and suggestions! It’s comforting to know there are others who share the nostalgia and appreciation for \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.\\" I’ll definitely take your advice and keep an eye on S4C’s schedule and reach out to them about potential reruns. It’d be fantastic to have those characters back on the screen, bringing joy to both new audiences and us nostalgia-driven fans. Cheers for the help, and let’s hope for a positive outcome!

Now wife is getting impatient and want to call her pastor to mediate but she is scared the husband will get angry as he believes they should resolve their issues without third party intervention","completion":"Addressing this situation as a Christian pastor, it's crucial to approach it with grace, understanding, and guided by Christian principles of love, respect, and patience. However, it's clear that the situation has caused significant strain on the marriage, and it requires careful attention to ensure the health and sanctity of the marital relationship, as well as the well-being of all involved. # Steps to Consider: 1. Open and Honest Communication: Encourage another round of open and honest communication between the husband and wife. It's essential they both express their feelings, fears, and desires without judgment. The wife can express her feelings of neglect and unhappiness, while the husband can share his concerns and desires to care for his mother. This conversation should be grounded in love and the commitment they made to each other. 2. Seeking Wisdom in Scripture: As Christians, the couple can turn to Scripture for guidance and support. Verses about the sanctity of marriage, the importance of leaving parents and cleaving to one’s spouse (Genesis 2:24), and instructions to love and respect each other (Ephesians 5:22-33) can be particularly relevant. Yet, they are also called to honor their parents (Exodus 20:12). Balancing these scriptural admonitions requires wisdom and heart-led interpretation specific to their situation. 3. Mediation: While the husband is hesitant to involve a third party, it's essential to recognize that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. As a pastor, you can offer to mediate or recommend a Christian counselor who can help navigate these complex family dynamics. This shouldn't be seen as airing dirty laundry but rather as seeking guidance to uphold the love and respect foundational to their marriage. 4. Patience and Empathy: It's understandable that the wife is feeling impatient. Yet, patience and empathy are crucial, especially towards the husband's concerns for his mother. However, patience does not mean enduring an unhealthy situation indefinitely. Setting boundaries and creating a timeline might help manage expectations on all sides. 5. Setting Boundaries and Finding Solutions: Together, they might explore alternative solutions such as hiring a caregiver, finding a senior community for the mother-in-law, or speeding up the government housing application process. Setting boundaries about personal space and time as a couple is also critical. 6. Praying Together: Encourage the couple to pray together for wisdom, patience, and a loving resolution. Prayer can be a powerful way to invite God's guidance and peace into the situation. # Conclusion: The issue at hand is not just about choosing between the wife and the mother-in-law; it's about honoring one's spouse, caring for aging parents, and maintaining a healthy marriage. As Christians, the couple is called to navigate these challenges with love, wisdom, and respect for all parties involved. A mediator, especially one grounded in Christian principles, can help the couple find a balanced, compassionate way forward."},{"prompt":"I am the wife","completion":"As the wife in this challenging situation, you are navigating a delicate balance between showing respect and care for your mother-in-law while also advocating for the well-being of your marriage. It is vital to approach this predicament with compassion, wisdom, and a heart for reconciliation. Here are steps you can consider: # Prioritize Communication with Your Husband Create a serene, undistracted environment to express your feelings and concerns to your husband again. Highlight that you understand his perspective and the importance of caring for his mother, but also gently remind him of the needs and sanctity of your marriage. It's not about making him choose between you and his mother but finding a solution that respects all parties involved. # Suggest Joint Prayer Invite your husband to join you in prayer over the situation. This can be a powerful way to bring both of your hearts in alignment with each other and with God's will. Praying together can create a shared sense of purpose and can open both of your hearts to divine guidance. # Explore Solutions Together Encourage a conversation about potential solutions, emphasizing teamwork and mutual respect. Ideas might include hiring part-time care for his mother, exploring other living arrangements, or setting more definite boundaries within your home that prioritize your marriage. Propose setting a timeline for reevaluation, which can help make the situation feel more temporary and manageable. # Consider Counseling While your husband is reluctant to involve a third party, you might gently suggest the benefits of seeking wisdom from someone who can provide neutral, biblically grounded advice. This could be framed not as involving an outsider in your personal issues, but as seeking guidance together to strengthen your marriage. A compromise might be starting with a trusted pastor or a Christian marriage counselor who can provide a safe space for both of you. # Practice Patience and Love In these moments, lean into the fruits of the Spirit, especially patience, kindness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23). These virtues can guide your responses and interactions, helping to ease tensions and foster a more loving environment, even amid challenges. # Personal Care and Prayer Lastly, it's crucial to care for your spiritual and emotional health during this time. Ensure you have personal quiet times, prayer, and if possible, the supportive ear of a trusted friend or church member. Placing your anxieties and concerns before God and seeking His peace can provide comfort and guidance. Ultimately, this situation requires navigating a complex web of familial, marital, and individual needs. Approach each step prayerfully, with an open heart, seeking not only an amicable resolution but also the growth and strengthening of your marriage. Remember, it is okay to seek change and to assert your needs within your marriage respectfully and lovingly."},{"prompt":"I feel huge resentment towards the mom now as she constantly gives me passive aggressive","completion":"Feeling resentment in your situation is understandable given the circumstances. Dealing with passive-aggressive behavior, especially from a family member living in such close quarters, can be incredibly stressful and emotionally draining. Your feelings are valid, and it's essential to address them for the sake of your own well-being and the health of your marriage. Here are some steps you can consider taking to manage and work through this resentment: # Acknowledge Your Feelings First, it's important to acknowledge and accept your feelings of resentment without judgment. Suppressing or ignoring these feelings can lead to more significant issues down the line. Recognizing your emotions is the first step toward addressing them constructively. # Seek Personal Support Find a trusted friend, counselor, or pastor with whom you can discuss your feelings openly and safely. Sometimes, just having a listening ear can provide immense relief. A professional counselor or pastor can also offer insights and coping strategies grounded in Christian faith and principles. # Practice Forgiveness Forgiveness is a powerful Christian principle, but it's important to remember that forgiving someone does not mean condoning their behavior. Forgiveness is more about freeing your heart from the burden of resentment. Pray for the strength to forgive your mother-in-law for the peace it will bring to your heart. Remember, forgiveness is a process, and it's okay if it takes time. # Communicate Boundaries Consider having a calm and honest conversation with your mother-in-law about how certain behaviors make you feel. It's possible she may not be fully aware of the impact of her actions. Set clear and reasonable boundaries respectfully. If direct communication is challenging, you might seek your husband's support in facilitating this conversation, highlighting the importance of your well-being in the household. # Engage in Self-Care Make time for activities that replenish your spirit and bring you joy. Whether it's spending time in prayer, engaging in a hobby you love, or simply taking time for yourself, self-care can significantly impact your emotional health and resilience. # Pray for Healing Pray not only for your own heart but also for your mother-in-law. Ask God to work within this situation, healing wounds, and softening hearts. Prayer can be incredibly transformative, both for you and for those with whom you're struggling. # Seek Mediation if Needed If the situation does not improve, or if communicating your feelings and setting boundaries does not lead to a change in behavior, seeking mediation with a pastor or Christian counselor may become necessary. Approach your husband again with your concerns, emphasizing the impact on your emotional and spiritual well-being and the potential benefits of seeking guidance together. It's crucial to address resentment before it festers and causes more profound issues in your marriage and family life. By taking steps to manage your emotions constructively and seeking resolution through communication and forgiveness, you can work toward a healthier, more peaceful living situation for all involved."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This limit is typically established by the creators or developers of the token to control the supply and prevent inflation. Exceeding the token limit may devalue the token and compromise the stability of the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"explain token limit to a middle schooler","completion":"Sure! Imagine tokens as special coins that are used in a game or on a playground. The token limit is like a rule that says there can only be a certain number of these special coins in circulation. This limit helps to make sure that everyone has a fair chance to play and trade with the tokens, and it also prevents the value of the tokens from getting too low. Just like how you can't have an unlimited number of game pieces in a board game, there is a set amount of tokens that can exist to keep things balanced and fun for everyone."},{"prompt":"what happens if you run out of tokens?","completion":"If you run out of tokens, it means that there are no more left to use or trade in the ecosystem. This could potentially disrupt the functioning of the ecosystem or platform where the tokens are used. For example, if a game runs out of tokens, players may not be able to continue playing or participating in activities that require the tokens. In some cases, the creators or developers may need to issue more tokens or adjust the token limit to ensure that the ecosystem remains operational and balanced."},{"prompt":"how to get more tokens","completion":"The process of obtaining more tokens can vary depending on the ecosystem or platform in which the tokens are used. Here are some common ways to get more tokens: 1. Purchase: In many cases, tokens can be purchased from exchanges or directly from the creators of the token. This involves using real money to buy tokens at the current market price. 2. Earn: Some ecosystems or platforms offer ways to earn tokens through activities such as mining, staking, participating in token rewards programs, or completing specific tasks. 3. Airdrops: Airdrops are when tokens are distributed for free to users who meet certain criteria, such as holding a specific amount of another cryptocurrency or being a member of a particular community. 4. Token sales: Tokens may be offered through initial coin offerings (ICOs) or token sales, where the creators sell tokens to raise funds for a project or platform. 5. Rewards: Some platforms reward users with tokens for contributing to the ecosystem, such as creating content, referring others, or providing liquidity to a decentralized finance (DeFi) project. It's essential to research and understand the specific rules and processes for obtaining more tokens within a particular ecosystem to ensure compliance and security."},{"prompt":"how many tokens have I used","completion":"I do not have the capability to track or determine how many tokens you have used as I do not have access to personal information or transaction data. If you have used tokens in a specific platform or ecosystem, you may be able to check your transaction history or account details to see how many tokens you have used or have remaining. If you have concerns about your token usage or activity, you may want to reach out to the platform's support team or check the platform's documentation for more information on tracking token usage."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Its operation typically depends on the firmware loaded onto it or the commands sent from a connected microcontroller, such as an Arduino. Here are a few general approaches to manage or potentially disable audio notifications, depending on your specific application and setup: 1. **Modifying Firmware (if applicable):** If your XY-BT-Mini runs firmware that allows customization and you have the skills to modify it, you could alter how it handles audio signals or notifications. 2. **Microcontroller Programming:** Since the XY-BT-Mini is often controlled by an external microcontroller, you can write or modify the code running on that controller to prevent it from sending commands to the XY-BT-Mini that would trigger audio notifications. For instance, if using it in an Arduino project, control the logic in your sketches to avoid triggering unwanted sounds. 3. **Hardware Solutions:** In some cases, if the audio notifications are hardcoded and cannot be disabled via software or firmware, a hardware solution might be necessary. This could be as drastic as physically disconnecting the speaker or buzzer component responsible for the sound, assuming it won't affect the rest of your project's functionality. 4. **Consult Documentation or Community Resources:** Sometimes, the answer lies in the community or the documentation. Manuals, forums, or user groups related to the XY-BT-Mini or similar projects might have tackled this issue before. 5. **Contacting Support:** If the above solutions are not viable and the audio notifications are a significant issue for your project, consider reaching out directly to the support team or the community surrounding the product for more tailored advice. Remember, any modifications you make, especially hardware alterations, could affect the functionality of the device or void any warranty it might have. Always ensure you have a backup plan or the ability to revert changes if something doesn't work as expected."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I can provide information, answer questions, and create content based on a vast amount of training data. If you need assistance with something specific, feel free to ask!"},{"prompt":"i forgot? how do you add a photo?","completion":"To add a photo to an HTML page, you use the \`<img>\` tag, specifying the source of the image with the \`src\` attribute. Additionally, it's good practice to include an \`alt\` attribute, which provides alternate information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (due to slow connection, an error in the \`src\` attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader). Here's a basic example: \`\`\`html <img src=\\"url_to_your_photo.jpg\\" alt=\\"A brief description of the image\\"> \`\`\` Replace \`url_to_your_photo.jpg\` with the actual URL of your image. If the image is hosted on the web, the URL might look something like \`https://example.com/photo.jpg\`. If the image is stored locally in the same directory as your HTML file, you can simply use the file name (e.g., \`photo.jpg\`) or a relative path from your HTML file to the image file. Here’s a practical example using placeholder values: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Adding an Image</title> </head> <body> <img src=\\"https://example.com/your-image.jpg\\" alt=\\"Description of the image\\" style=\\"width:100%; max-width:400px; height:auto;\\"> </body> </html> \`\`\` In this example: - \`src\` is the URL where your image is located. - \`alt\` is the alternative text for the image. - \`style\` with \`width:100%; max-width:400px; height:auto;\` is an inline CSS style that ensures your image is responsive. It will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size (400px in this example). The height automatically adjusts to maintain the aspect ratio. It's important to ensure that you have permission to use and display any photo or image you choose to add to your website."},{"prompt":"This is still a show I've made (I'll make it real when I'm older) The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: Gloopy, a teal gooey blob and his best friend Glitter, a sparkling fuschia (still gooey) blob, hail from the planet of Gloopiter, Laugh along as they travel through the galaxy., Welsh title: (Anturiaethau llysnafeddog a phefriog).

Here's a vivid description of both Gloopy and Glitter based on the fascinating concept you've created for \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.\\" **Gloopy**: Gloopy is a charming and cheerful blob of a teal color, which is both eye-catching and soothing to look at. His body is a delightful mixture of gooey and elastic consistency, allowing him to stretch, bounce, and reshape with ease, making him quite the character in every adventure. His eyes are large and round, shimmering with a deep azure hue that radiates kindness and curiosity. Gloopy's mouth stretches widely across his amorphous face, ready to break into a wide grin or an expression of awe at a moment's notice. Despite lacking traditional limbs, Gloopy has the incredible ability to form pseudo-arms and -legs to interact with his environment or give his best friend, Glitter, a comforting squeeze. **Glitter**: Glitter stands out with her sparkling fuchsia appearance, emitting a gentle glow that makes her presence known and adored. Her texture is intriguingly gooey, akin to Gloopy, yet she is speckled with countless tiny sparkles that catch the light with every movement, leaving a trail of shimmering particles in her wake. This sparkling aspect adds an element of magic and wonder to her character, fascinating everyone around her. Glitter's eyes are almond-shaped, glinting with a pinkish hue that exudes warmth and empathy. Her smile is gentle, yet mischievous, hinting at the playful adventures she embarks on with Gloopy. Like Gloopy, she can morph her shape to form appendages that help her navigate their exciting galactic adventures. Together, Gloopy and Glitter make an unforgettable duo. Their contrasting colors and similar gooey textures complement each other perfectly, symbolizing their unbreakable bond and the harmonious blend of their personalities. Their adventures across the galaxy are not just a showcase of their exploratory spirit but also a beautiful display of their shared joy and the radiant friendship between them. Watching them interact and overcome challenges together, all while marveling at the wonders of the universe, is a visual treat that underscores the essence of their incredible journey."},{"prompt":"Write a S4C ratings review in May 2024 (in this timeline), Highest rated for normal S4C programming was Rownd A Rownd, Pobol y Cym and Newdyddion, and say what was the most popular Swtnsh show (S4C's kids block)","completion":"**S4C Ratings Review - May 2024** As we look back at the programming landscape of S4C in May 2024, it's been a particularly vibrant period for the Welsh broadcaster.

It's gooey, sparkly fun for the little ones, but the space adventures and humor seem to catch the older kids' attention too. **User3:** Absolutely, and it's not just about the adventures. The themes of friendship and understanding differences play well across ages. It's clever storytelling.

This dual approach not only maximizes viewership but also introduces younger audiences to content that they can grow into. **User8:** And if you check out the S4C website, \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" is often promoted with both Cyw and Swtnsh logos side by side. It's a clear indication that the show serves as a bridge between the two programming blocks, intentionally designed to appeal across different age groups. **User9:** It's a clever move.

By fostering a connection with characters like Gloopy and Glitter from an early age, S4C is banking on the idea that emotional bonds will encourage viewership loyalty as children age. **User1:** Absolutely, and it's a testament to the versatility and depth of \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.\\" Crafting a show that can simultaneously entertain, educate, and emotionally engage diverse age groups is no small feat.

Welsh network: S4C, English network: Pop (UK), Kids’ WB (USA), Premiere: 21 February 2022 (Welsh) , 17 September 2022 (English, USA), 22 May 2023 (English, UK), Origin country: United Kingdom.

A teal gooey blob and a sparkling fuchsia blob exploring the galaxy offers a vivid setup ripe with potential for whimsical stories, unique characters, and learning opportunities wrapped in humor and friendship. The concept of two best friends from the fantastical planet of Gloopiter could captivate children’s imagination, encouraging them to think about friendship, diversity, and the wonders of the universe in an entertaining way. Choosing to air the show on channels such as S4C, Pop (UK), and Kids’ WB (USA) suggests an intent to reach a broad audience, which is great for such an inclusive and fun program. Also, having episodes available in Welsh adds a valuable cultural and educational layer, potentially introducing children to a new language in an engaging context.

Keep nurturing your creativity, and best of luck with your journey to becoming a cartoonist! Write descriptions of their appearances Certainly! Here’s a vivid description of both Gloopy and Glitter based on the fascinating concept you’ve created for “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” Gloopy: Gloopy is a charming and cheerful blob of a teal color, which is both eye-catching and soothing to look at. His body is a delightful mixture of gooey and elastic consistency, allowing him to stretch, bounce, and reshape with ease, making him quite the character in every adventure. His eyes are large and round, shimmering with a deep azure hue that radiates kindness and curiosity. Gloopy’s mouth stretches widely across his amorphous face, ready to break into a wide grin or an expression of awe at a moment’s notice. Despite lacking traditional limbs, Gloopy has the incredible ability to form pseudo-arms and -legs to interact with his environment or give his best friend, Glitter, a comforting squeeze. Glitter: Glitter stands out with her sparkling fuchsia appearance, emitting a gentle glow that makes her presence known and adored. Her texture is intriguingly gooey, akin to Gloopy, yet she is speckled with countless tiny sparkles that catch the light with every movement, leaving a trail of shimmering particles in her wake. This sparkling aspect adds an element of magic and wonder to her character, fascinating everyone around her. Glitter’s eyes are almond-shaped, glinting with a pinkish hue that exudes warmth and empathy. Her smile is gentle, yet mischievous, hinting at the playful adventures she embarks on with Gloopy. Like Gloopy, she can morph her shape to form appendages that help her navigate their exciting galactic adventures. Together, Gloopy and Glitter make an unforgettable duo. Their contrasting colors and similar gooey textures complement each other perfectly, symbolizing their unbreakable bond and the harmonious blend of their personalities. Their adventures across the galaxy are not just a showcase of their exploratory spirit but also a beautiful display of their shared joy and the radiant friendship between them. Watching them interact and overcome challenges together, all while marveling at the wonders of the universe, is a visual treat that underscores the essence of their incredible journey. Write a S4C ratings review in May 2024 (in this timeline), Highest rated for normal S4C programming was Rownd A Rownd, Pobol y Cym and Newdyddion, and say what was the most popular Swtnsh show (S4C’s kids block) S4C Ratings Review - May 2024 As we look back at the programming landscape of S4C in May 2024, it’s been a particularly vibrant period for the Welsh broadcaster. Traditional stalwarts like “Rownd A Rownd,” the ever-compelling soap that revolves around the lives of those in a fictional North Wales community, “Pobol y Cwm,” which offers an intimate look into the lives of the residents of the Cwmderi village, and “Newyddion,” the channel’s trusted news program, have once again topped the charts, drawing in viewers with their compelling narratives and insightful reporting. However, it’s within the realm of children’s programming, specifically the Cyw block, where we’ve seen an unexpected title surge in popularity. The standout star of S4C’s Cyw lineup has undeniably been “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” This animated series, which made its Welsh debut in February 2022 before enjoying its English-language premiere across several networks, has become something of a phenomenon among the younger demographic. The tales of Gloopy and Glitter, who hail from the gooey planet of Gloopiter, have not only captured the imaginations of children but have also garnered a sizeable adult following. The series, which combines whimsical adventures with lessons on friendship, diversity, and environmental awareness, has struck a chord with audiences looking for both entertainment and educational value in children’s programming. The show’s unique blend of humor, heart, and the universal language of kindness has transcended cultural barriers, making it the most popular show within the Cyw block in May 2024. Critics and viewers alike have praised the series for its creative storytelling and its vibrant, engaging animation style. The central characters, Gloopy, a teal gooey blob, and Glitter, his sparkling fuchsia companion, have become iconic figures in Welsh children’s television, often being cited as positive role models for young viewers. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has outpaced previously popular shows within the Cyw lineup, showcasing the power of innovative and inclusive content. Its success has not only elevated S4C’s profile as a champion of quality children’s entertainment but has also underscored the channel’s commitment to nurturing Welsh language and culture through its programming. As S4C looks to the future, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of well-crafted children’s storytelling. It raises the bar for what viewers can expect from the channel’s offerings, promising a bright future for Welsh programming that educates, entertains, and inspires. Write the current Swntsh lineup in this timeline (which also includes The Amazing Adrenalini brothers, Horrid Henry, Spongebob, Alvinnnn, and Pokemon) In this imaginative timeline for May 2024, S4C’s Cyw (for younger viewers) and the broader Swtnsh (for a slightly older demographic) blocks showcase a dynamic and engaging array of programming that captivates Welsh children and families. Here’s how the current Swtnsh lineup could look, featuring a blend of homegrown hits like “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and international favorites: # Swtnsh Lineup - May 2024 Morning Block: - 7:00 AM: “Cyw Classics” - A nostalgic start to the morning featuring beloved Cyw characters in short stories and songs. - 7:30 AM: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” - The Welsh hit that follows the galactic travels of two gooey friends, teaching lessons on friendship and diversity. - 8:00 AM: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” - High-flying adventures with three daredevil brothers from Rendoosia, always in pursuit of the “¡Yahzaa!” thrill, with each episode promising laughs and heart-pounding action. After School Block: - 3:30 PM: “SpongeBob SquarePants” - The underwater escapades of SpongeBob and his eclectic group of Bikini Bottom friends, dubbed in Welsh, continuing to enchant a new generation. - 4:00 PM: “Horrid Henry” - The misadventures of Henry, the self-styled ‘Lord High Excellent Majesty of Misrule’, offering relatable family dynamics and clever solutions to kid-sized problems. - 4:30 PM: “ALVINNN!!! and The Chipmunks” - Music, mischief, and mayhem with Alvin, Simon, Theodore, and the Chipettes, blending humor, heart, and catchy tunes. Evening Block: - 5:00 PM: “Pokémon” - The latest series installment from the ever-expanding Pokémon universe, following new trainers and their Pokémon companions on a journey of discovery, battles, and friendships. - 5:30 PM: “Swtnsh Original: Teen Heroes” - A new animated series focusing on a group of Welsh teenagers who discover ancient powers, blending Welsh mythology with modern-day adolescence. - 6:00 PM: “Swtnsh Newsround” - A youth-focused news program covering current events, science, culture, and sports, making the news accessible and engaging for a younger audience. Weekend Specials: - Saturday Mornings: “Swtnsh Sports Club” - A weekend special featuring highlights from youth sports, interviews with young athletes, and tips on getting involved in sports. - Sunday Evenings: “Swtnsh Cinema” - A family movie night featuring Welsh-language films, international animated hits, and classic family favorites dubbed in Welsh. This lineup represents a mix of educational content, entertainment, and cultural programming designed to engage children and pre-teens while supporting Welsh language and values. It keeps the essence of S4C’s mission alive by catering to a diverse audience with a wide range of interests, from animated adventures and real-world issues to sports and science. Write a convo noting only 1 show airs on both Swntsh and Cyw User1: Noticed something interesting in the S4C lineup for Cyw and Swtnsh. Looks like “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is the only show that airs on both blocks. That’s quite a crossover appeal! User2: Yeah, it’s pretty rare for a show to resonate with both preschoolers on Cyw and the older kids watching Swtnsh. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” must have some magic formula. It’s gooey, sparkly fun for the little ones, but the space adventures and humor seem to catch the older kids’ attention too. User3: Absolutely, and it’s not just about the adventures. The themes of friendship and understanding differences play well across ages. It’s clever storytelling. Plus, the Welsh language aspect makes it a goldmine for educational content. User4: I’ve seen this with my own kids. My youngest loves the colors and shapes of Gloopy and Glitter, while my eldest is all about the galaxy exploration and the quirky characters they meet. It’s become a bonding thing for them, and they’re learning some Welsh along the way. User5: Do you think it sets a precedent for S4C programming? Creating shows that have cross-generational appeal but also serve educational purposes? Seems like a smart move in a media landscape that’s incredibly fragmented. User2: It’s definitely a smart strategy. Plus, airing a show on both Cyw and Swtnsh maximizes the viewership across different age groups. It also gently transitions the younger viewers to the Swtnsh block, keeping them within the S4C family as they grow. User1: True, it’s a seamless way to introduce kids to more mature content while retaining educational and entertainment value. It’s interesting to see S4C innovating in this space. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” seems to be leading the charge. Write that it’s likely a “bridge” strategy, new eps usually premiere on Swntsh, and rerun on Cyw the next day, its usually promoted on the website with both logos for this reason User6: I’ve been following the conversation about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” and the unique position it holds on S4C, airing on both Cyw and Swtnsh. It seems like a deliberate “bridge” strategy by S4C to cater to a wide audience range. User7: Exactly, I noticed that new episodes usually premiere on the Swtnsh block, which targets older kids, and then they rerun on Cyw the next day, for the younger audience. This dual approach not only maximizes viewership but also introduces younger audiences to content that they can grow into. User8: And if you check out the S4C website, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is often promoted with both Cyw and Swtnsh logos side by side. It’s a clear indication that the show serves as a bridge between the two programming blocks, intentionally designed to appeal across different age groups. User9: It’s a clever move. In a way, it keeps the content within the family for a longer time. As kids grow, their interest in Cyw might wane, but if they’ve already been introduced to Swtnsh through a familiar show like “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” they’re more likely to stick around. User10: The bridging strategy goes beyond just scheduling and promotion; it’s about content continuity and emotional investment. By fostering a connection with characters like Gloopy and Glitter from an early age, S4C is banking on the idea that emotional bonds will encourage viewership loyalty as children age. User1: Absolutely, and it’s a testament to the versatility and depth of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” Crafting a show that can simultaneously entertain, educate, and emotionally engage diverse age groups is no small feat. S4C’s strategy here could very well set a new standard for kids’ programming.

Busca-se determinar a veracidade dos fatos apresentados, considerando a inexistência de testemunhas oculares e a divergência entre as declarações do jovem detido e dos oficiais envolvidos. 2. **Diligências** Foram realizadas as seguintes diligências para a apuração dos fatos: a. Análise dos relatórios de ocorrência registrados pela guarnição envolvida e pela delegacia civil. b. Realização de dois laudos médicos para verificar a existência de lesões no jovem detido - o primeiro imediatamente após a ocorrência e o segundo laudo cinco horas após o término do procedimento na delegacia civil, sem a presença da guarnição. c. Coleta de declarações formais do jovem envolvido e dos oficiais da guarnição. 3. **Defesa** A guarnição envolvida apresentou uma defesa unificada, alegando que o uso da força foi estritamente necessário e proporcional ao comportamento agressivo e à resistência à prisão demonstrados pelo jovem. Ressalta-se que a defesa baseou-se principalmente na alegação de que a segurança do público estava em risco devido à conduta perigosa do detido. 4. **Mérito** Ao examinar o mérito da questão, considerou-se: - A ausência de testemunhas oculares dificulta a avaliação completa dos eventos. - Os laudos médicos não confirmaram lesões corporais no primeiro exame, mas o segundo laudo, realizado sem a presença da guarnição e horas depois, levanta questões sobre a possibilidade de lesões tardias ou não aparentes inicialmente. 5. **Fundamentação** A avaliação se fundamentou na análise comparativa das declarações do jovem e dos policiais, das evidências documentais disponíveis, e dos procedimentos legais e operacionais padrão para o uso da força por parte da polícia. Considerou-se igualmente a legalidade, a necessidade, a proporcionalidade e a moderação no contexto da abordagem sob suspeita de direção perigosa. 6. **Conclusão** Diante dos elementos analisados, não se pode afirmar categoricamente que houve uso excessivo de força devido à falta de testemunhas oculares e à inconclusividade dos laudos médicos. No entanto, destaca-se a necessidade de revisão dos procedimentos de uso da força pela guarnição envolvida, visando garantir a integridade física dos cidadãos e a transparência nas ações policiais. Recomenda-se: a. A realização de treinamentos adicionais para a guarnição sobre técnicas de contenção e abordagem. b. Implementação de câmeras corporais nos uniformes para registro das abordagens. c. Continuidade da monitorização do caso, considerando a possibilidade de surgimento de novas evidências. Este relatório é concluído com a recomendação de que as providências sugeridas sejam implementadas para prevenir a ocorrência de incidentes semelhantes no futuro e fortalecer a confiança da população na instituição policial.

Objetivo** Averiguar as circunstâncias envolvendo a atuação de uma guarnição da Polícia Militar durante a detenção de um jovem acusado de direção perigosa em uma motocicleta, especificamente no que tange à alegação de uso de violência. O objetivo é estabelecer se houve conformidade com as normas legais e regulamentares aplicáveis. **2. Diligências** - Exame dos relatórios de ocorrência elaborados pela guarnição envolvida e pela delegacia. - Análise de dois laudos médicos produzidos para verificar a existência de lesão corporal no detido: o primeiro imediatamente após a detenção e o segundo cinco horas após, sem a presença dos policiais. - Coleta de depoimentos do jovem detido e dos policiais envolvidos. **3.

Deve-se analisar se as ações dos policiais estiveram em consonância com os princípios da legalidade, necessidade, proporcionalidade e moderação, conforme determinado pela Lei nº 13.869, de 5 de setembro de 2019 (Lei de Abuso de Autoridade). **5. Fundamentação** A análise se baseia em: - **Lei de Abuso de Autoridade (Lei nº 13.869/2019):** Art. 9º e Art. 22, pontuando a proibição do uso excessivo de força que possa exceder o estritamente necessário para atendimento da ocorrência. - **Código Penal Brasileiro:** Art. 129, no tocante à lesão corporal, comparando as disposições do código com os fatos apurados. - **Jurisprudência relevante:** STJ HC 598.886/MS, que reafirma a necessidade de se aferir a proporcionalidade e a razoabilidade do uso da força por agentes do Estado, usando-a somente quando estritamente necessário para a manutenção da ordem pública e segurança das pessoas. **6. Conclusão** Considerando os elementos coletados, os testemunhos e os laudos médicos apresentados, não foram encontradas provas conclusivas que atestem o uso excessivo de violência por parte da guarnição. Porém, a ausência de testemunhas oculares e a diferença temporal entre os exames médicos introduzem uma margem de incerteza que não permite uma declaração definitiva de absolvição ou condenação das ações dos policiais sob a ótica legal vigente. Portanto, recomenda-se: - Reforço na formação dos policiais quanto às práticas de detenção e uso da força, alinhadas às normativas legais. - Incentivar o uso de equipamentos que possam registrar audiovisualmente as ações policiais para futura análise. - Monitoramento contínuo das práticas de abordagem policial, garantindo a conformidade com os princípios legais e éticos. Dada a natureza ambígua dos fatos e a complexidade inerente às avaliações de conduta policial em situações de alto risco, salienta-se a importância de uma investigação contínua e aprofundada.

Objetivo** Analisar as circunstâncias que levaram à avaria no para-brisa da viatura, enquanto o 3º sargento PM Silva dirigia o veículo para abastecimento, decorrente do arremesso de detritos por um caminhão, e determinar a responsabilidade sob a ótica legal. **2. Diligências** - Coleta de depoimento do 3º sargento PM Silva. - Solicitação de imagens de possíveis câmeras de segurança no trajeto. - Busca de testemunhas do incidente. - Avaliação técnica da viatura para verificar as circunstâncias da avaria. **3.

Mérito** A sindicância se concentra em verificar a existência de culpa por parte do 3º sargento PM Silva, no contexto da avaria ocorrida no veículo sob sua responsabilidade. **5. Fundamentação** - **Constituição Federal**, artigo 37, § 6º, que dispõe sobre a responsabilidade objetiva do Estado por danos causados a terceiros, no exercício de suas funções, excluindo a responsabilidade pessoal do agente, exceto em casos de dolo ou culpa. - **Código Civil**, artigos 186 e 927, que tratam da obrigação de reparar o dano causado por ação ou omissão voluntária, negligência ou imprudência. - **Código Penal Militar**, artigo 251, que qualifica como transgressão a negligência na conservação ou uso dos veículos pertencentes à administração militar. - **Jurisprudência** relacionada a casos semelhantes, onde o Superior Tribunal de Justiça tem se posicionado pela exclusão da responsabilidade do agente público em casos fortuitos ou força maior. **6.

This can occur in several ways: 1. **Featured in Movies, TV Shows, or Advertisements**: When a song is used as part of a movie soundtrack, in an episode of a television show, or in a commercial, it's said to be featured on that media. This often brings the music to a broader audience and can revitalize interest in older tracks or boost the popularity of new ones. 2. **Collaborations and Guest Appearances**: In the music industry, when an artist is invited to contribute vocals, instrumentals, or production to another artist's song, the guest artist is often credited as \\"featured.\\" This is common in genres like hip-hop, pop, and electronic music. For example, a track might be listed as \\"Artist A feat. Artist B,\\" indicating that Artist B has a significant, albeit secondary, contribution to the song. 3. **Compilations and Playlists**: Songs can also be featured on various artists' compilation albums or public playlists. For example, a song might be included in a \\"Best of the Year\\" compilation or a curated playlist on a music streaming service. Being featured in this context can introduce music to new listeners who are exploring a specific genre, mood, or theme. 4. **Video Games and Apps**: Featuring music in video games or mobile apps is another way songs reach new audiences. A track might be part of a game's score, featured in a rhythm-based game, or used for background music in an app, providing exposure and often attracting fans from among the game or app's user base. Being featured can be a significant aspect of a song's success and longevity, often providing new revenue streams, expanding an artist's fan base, and helping the track find its way into the cultural zeitgeist."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It implies that a significant portion of the songs associated with this artist includes those where he isn't the main artist but is featured on them. In the context of music, a \\"featured\\" artist is one who contributes to a song but isn't the primary artist or owner of the song. This can involve singing a verse, contributing to the music, or adding a rap segment, among other contributions. The inquiry, \\"are we gonna penalize those artists?\\" suggests a discussion or debate about how to evaluate or recognize the achievements of the primary artists of those songs. Essentially, it questions whether it's fair to discount or lesser value the contributions of the primary artists just because a well-known artist is featured on their track. The presence of a notable featured artist can significantly boost a song's popularity, but this statement cautions against diminishing the primary artist's efforts and talent merely because of the association with a famous contributor. The overall context could be a debate about award nominations, chart placements, or considerations of artistic merit, where there is a discussion on how to fairly recognize and credit both the main and featured artists for their work."},{"prompt":"escriba un poema extenso para mí novia, donde se indique la distancia que circunstancialmente nos separa, y el deseo de acompañarla en su cama, como cercanía , compañía y contención, y para abrigarla en esta noche tan fría","completion":"En la brecha de la distancia que circunstancialmente nos separa se esconde mi anhelo constante de estar junto a ti en esta hora amarga.

We start with the foundation: a cracked, dry wood background that immediately evokes a sense of decay and fragility. This not only serves as a metaphor for the imperfections and challenges in life but also adds a tactile, raw depth to the piece, enriching the overall texture and adding to its dreamlike quality. At the center of this evocative backdrop is the focal point of our artwork: an emotional girl adorned in an elegant dress. Her dress, although exquisitely detailed and flowing with fabric that seems to defy gravity, carries muted colors that blend seamlessly with the abstract, dreamlike setting. The use of muted colors serves to emphasize the emotion and mood over the specific details of the dress, allowing the viewer to sense its elegance without overwhelming the senses. The girl's expression and posture are key in conveying the depth of emotion without relying on vivid color, aligning with the principles of surrealist expressionism. Her face, portrayed with abstract and distorted forms, captures a moment of introspection or sorrow, resonating with the viewer on an almost subconscious level. The surreal approach allows for the expression of complex emotions that might not be easily conveyed through a more realistic depiction. Incorporating skin lesions as a storytelling element introduces a narrative of struggle and resilience. These markings are not just physical but symbolize the challenges and scars (both visible and invisible) that everyone carries with them. Placed thoughtfully, they do not overshadow the beauty or elegance of the girl; instead, they add layers of meaning, suggesting a story of overcoming adversity or bearing the marks of personal battles. The overall dreamlike atmosphere is accentuated by the surreal, abstract forms that surround the girl and are embedded throughout the composition. Elements that defy logical placement or proportion contribute to a feeling of being in a space where the normal rules do not apply, inviting viewers to interpret the artwork through their personal lens of imagination and emotion. Finally, the use of mixed media techniques amplifies the depth and complexity of the artwork. Incorporating various textures, from the roughness of the wood to the smoothness of what might simulate the girl's skin or the fabric of her dress, engages the senses in a way that a single medium could not. The interplay of materials mirrors the complexity of human emotions and experiences, making the artwork a multidimensional exploration of vulnerability, elegance, and the surreal landscapes of the mind. This artwork, with its blend of elegance and raw emotional power set against a surreal, dreamlike backdrop, invites viewers to navigate the layers of meaning and explore their own reactions and interpretations.
