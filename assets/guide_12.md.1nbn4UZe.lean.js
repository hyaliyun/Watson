Here\'s an example: ``` import React, { useEffect } from \'react\'; function App() { useEffect(() => { window.location.reload(); }, []); return ( <div> ... </div> ); } export default App; ``` In this example, we\'re using the useEffect hook to trigger the window.location.reload() method when the component mounts. The empty array passed as the second argument to useEffect ensures that this effect only runs once, on mount. Note that this method isn\'t generally recommended, as it can be disruptive to users. Consider whether there\'s a better way to handle what you\'re trying to achieve without forcing a full page reload."},{"prompt":"I think this will trigger infinite page reloads","completion":"You\'re correct, calling `window.location.reload()` in the `useEffect` hook without any dependencies will cause an infinite loop of page reloads. To trigger a one-time page reload on mount, you can add a state variable to track whether the reload has already occurred, and conditionally trigger the reload based on that variable. Here\'s an example: ``` import React, { useState, useEffect } from \'react\'; function App() { const [hasLoaded, setHasLoaded] = useState(false); useEffect(() => { if (!hasLoaded) { setHasLoaded(true); window.location.reload(); } }, [hasLoaded]); return ( <div> ... </div> ); } export default App; ``` In this example, we\'re using the `useState` hook to set an initial state of `false` for the `hasLoaded` variable. In the `useEffect` hook, we check whether `hasLoaded` is `false` before triggering the reload and setting `hasLoaded` to `true`. The second argument to `useEffect` is the `hasLoaded` variable, so the effect will only run when the value of `hasLoaded` changes. By adding this check, we avoid triggering an infinite loop of page reloads."},{"prompt":"are you sure about this? when we reload the page the states are getting cleared","completion":"You\'re correct – reloading the page will cause the state to be reset, as well as any other application state and local storage data. If you need to persist state even after a reload, you can use a solution such as local storage or cookies to store the current state, and then retrieve it on page load to initialize your component\'s state. Here\'s an example using local storage: ``` import React, { useState, useEffect } from \'react\'; function App() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); useEffect(() => { // Retrieve saved count from local storage if available const savedCount = localStorage.getItem(\'count\'); if (savedCount != null) { setCount(Number(savedCount)); } }, []); useEffect(() => { // Save current count to local storage localStorage.setItem(\'count\', count); }, [count]); return ( <div> <p>Count: {count}</p> <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button> </div> ); } export default App; ``` In this example, we\'re using two `useEffect` hooks. The first one runs only once, when the component mounts, and retrieves the saved count from local storage if available. The second hook runs whenever the count state changes, and saves the current count to local storage. This allows the count state to persist even after the page is reloaded."},{"prompt":"my problem is not about persisting the state. my problem is to make page reload only 1 time. not infitnite reloads","completion":"You\'re right, I apologize for misunderstanding your question. To reload the page only one time on mount, you can use a flag in the `useEffect` hook to track whether the component has mounted or not. Here\'s an example: ``` import React, { useEffect, useState } from \'react\'; function App() { const [hasMounted, setHasMounted] = useState(false); useEffect(() => { if (!hasMounted) { setHasMounted(true); window.location.reload(); } }, []); return ( <div> ... </div> ); } export default App; ``` In this example, we\'re using the `hasMounted` state variable to track whether the component has mounted or not. In the `useEffect` hook, we check whether `hasMounted` is `false` before triggering the page reload and setting `hasMounted` to `true`. The second argument to `useEffect` is an empty array, which ensures that the effect runs only once. After the first reload, the `hasMounted` state is updated to `true`, preventing any further reloads. I hope this helps!"},{"prompt":"are you sure?","completion":"You raise a good point, it\'s possible that the `window.location.reload()` function may trigger a loop of reloads. If you want to be absolutely certain to avoid an infinite loop of reloads, you can wrap the reload function inside a `setTimeout()` call with a short delay. Here\'s an example: ``` import React, { useEffect, useState } from \'react\'; function App() { const [hasMounted, setHasMounted] = useState(false); useEffect(() => { if (!hasMounted) { setHasMounted(true); setTimeout(() => { window.location.reload(); }, 100); // set a delay of 100ms } }, []); return ( <div> ... </div> ); } export default App; ``` In this example, we\'ve wrapped the `window.location.reload()` call inside a `setTimeout()` with a delay of 100ms, which should be enough time to allow the component to properly mount and avoid any potential loops. However, please note that triggering a page refresh on mount is generally not considered a good practice, so please carefully consider your specific use case and whether there\'s a better way to achieve your desired outcome."},{"prompt":"while mysql","completion":"I\'m sorry, I cannot generate a response as the given prompt is incomplete.

La valeur \\"OFFSET\\" est facultative, et si vous ne la spécifiez pas, la requête commencera à la première ligne par défaut. Par exemple, si vous souhaitez renvoyer les 10 premières lignes de la table \\"order_details\\", vous pouvez utiliser la requête suivante : ``` SELECT * FROM order_details LIMIT 10; ``` Si vous voulez renvoyer les 10 lignes suivantes de la table \\"order_details\\", vous pouvez utiliser la requête suivante : ``` SELECT * FROM order_details LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10; ``` Cela renvoie les lignes de 11 à 20.

Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby.

一、国内外社区服务中心发展概述 在国内，社区服务中心最早是在上世纪80年代出现的，那时主要是在城市、乡镇、新农村等地区设立的社区服务站。在经过多年的发展和完善之后，社区服务中心已经成为了满足居民生活需求的重要场所。目前，社区服务中心的数量已经达到了上万个，服务涵盖了居民的生活、教育、文化、健康等方面。 在国外，社区服务中心的发展也非常迅速。许多国家都已经将社区服务中心作为促进社区发展、改善社区居民生活的重要手段。例如，美国的社区服务中心主要提供老年人和残疾人的服务，英国的社区服务中心则以提供儿童、青少年、老年人等人群的服务为主。 二、社区服务中心建设模式及功能分区分类 社区服务中心的建设模式有两种，一种是由政府出资兴建的，另一种是由企业或社会团体出资兴建的。 在功能分区方面，社区服务中心一般包括以下几个区域：综合服务区、文化娱乐区、教育培训区、健康保健区等。其中，综合服务区主要包括社区公共服务、社区志愿服务、社区咨询服务、社区文化服务等；文化娱乐区则主要包括图书阅读、健身、娱乐等；教育培训区主要包括儿童教育、文化培训、技能培训等；健康保健区则主要包括医疗保健、健康咨询等。 三、社区服务中心基本特点 社区服务中心的基本特点是以社区为基础、以服务为导向、以满足居民需求为目标。它是居民参与社区生活和发展的重要载体，也是提高社区自我管理、自我服务和自我监督能力的重要途径。 社区服务中心的服务对象主要是社区居民，服务内容也非常丰富，包括社区公共服务、文化娱乐、教育培训、健康保健等方面。 同时，社区服务中心还有以下几个基本特点：服务范围广泛、机构性质多样、管理制度灵活、服务时间长等。这些特点保证了社区服务中心的高效性和可持续性。 四、社区服务中心设计的影响要素 社区服务中心设计的影响要素主要包括服务对象需求、社区环境、场所安全、建筑风格等。服务对象需求是社区服务中心设计的出发点和核心，它是社区服务中心存在的基础和本质。社区环境和场所安全是社区服务中心设计的重要条件，它们直接关系到居民参与社区服务和活动的积极性和安全性。建筑风格则是社区服务中心设计的重要元素，它既要满足功能需要，又要体现社区文化和历史。 五、本章小结 本章主要介绍了社区服务中心的发展概述、建设模式和功能分区分类、基本特点、设计的影响要素等方面。可以看出，社区服务中心在社区建设和居民生活方面发挥着非常重要的作用。随着社会进步和经济发展，社区服务中心建设和服务将得到进一步完善和发展，带动社区居民生活的质量和社区发展的水平。"},{"prompt":"What does the term DevSecOps refer to? using risk

عشر اجزاء هيا اشرح لي الجزء الاول","completion":"بشكل عام، علم النفس يدرس العقل والسلوك البشري، وقد يغطي مجموعة واسعة من الموضوعات مثل التطور، الشخصية، الذكاء، الصحة العقلية، والعلاقات الاجتماعية. وبشكل متعلق، لغة الجسد هي الطريقة التي يعبر بها الشخص عن نفسه من خلال حركات الجسم والتعبيرات الوجهية وحتى الصوتيات. في الجزء الأول من هذه السلسلة، سنركز على التعبيرات الوجهية وما يمكن تفسيره منها: 1. التعبيرات الوجهية: إن التعبيرات الوجهية هي أحد الأدوات الرئيسية لتفسير لغة الجسد. وهي تمثل الحركات التي يجعلها الإنسان في وجهه وتكشف عن شعوره الحقيقي وما يخطر في باله. وتشمل هذه التعبيرات الوجهية الابتسامات، الانزعاج، الغضب، الحيرة، والألم. 2. الملامح الوجهية: إلى جانب التعابير الوجهية، يمكن للملامح الوجهية أيضًا أن تكشف عن الشخصية والمشاعر. وتشمل هذه الملامح العيون، الأنف، والفم. وفي بعض الأحيان، يمكن أن تظهر الملامح الوجهية عددًا من التفاصيل الدقيقة التي يمكن تحليلها بشكل دقيق. 3. الإشارات الإيمائية: تشمل الإشارات الإيمائية الأدوات المستخدمة لإيصال المعاني من خلال الحركات الجسدية، مثل الإشارة باليد واللمس. وتشمل هذه الإشارات إشارة بالإصبع، الإلمام بالشعر، تحديق العينين والتلميح بالرأس. بإجماله، فإن لغة الجسد و علم النفس يمكن أن يساعدان في فهم وتحليل سلوك الفرد وحركات جسده.

يركز على الحركات والإيماءات الجسدية، التي يمكن أن تكشف عن مشاعر ومواقف شخص معين. ومن الحركات الجسدية المهمة التي يمكن أن تعبر عن الشخصية والمشاعر الداخلية هي: 1- الإيماءات باليدين : قد تعبر استخدام اليدين بطريقة معينة عن المشاعر المختلفة، مثل إشارة باليد للحث على الشيء أو رفضه. 2- تحريك الجسم: فتحة الجسد وتحريكه يعكس المشاعر الداخلية للشخص، فعلى سبيل المثال، الشخص الخجول قد يلتفت لجهال ولا يرفع رأسه ويرفع كتفيه. 3- التعابير الوجهية: التعبيرات الوجهية تعبر عن المشاعر الحقيقية للشخص، مثل الابتسامة أو التعبير عن الحزن أو الغضب. 4- حركات الجسم العرضية: هي حركات غير مقصودة ومفاجئة، مثل الإغماء أو العطس، والتي قد تعكس مشاعر أو جوانب مختلفة من شخصية الفرد. مثال عن ذلك، عندما يصمت الشخص بينما يتحدث شخص آخر، يمكن أن يكون هذا الصمت علامة على أن الشخص غير راضي عن الموضوع الذي يتحدث عنه الشخص الآخر. ومن الممكن أن يعبّر عن ذلك عن طريق تحريك جسده بطريقة معينة، مثل رفع كتفيه أو الإغماء بكتفه. في النهاية، يعتبر التحليل الصحيح للحركات الجسدية والإيمائات المختلفة جزءًا أساسيًا من علم النفس ولغة الجسد،

التوتر والإجهاد. وتشير هذه العلامات إلى أن الشخص يشعر بالتوتر والضغوط النفسية، والتي قد تظهر بطرق مختلفة، مثل: 1- تغيير في نمط التنفس: ويتمثل ذلك في زيادة الشهيق وتوسع الأنف، أو الزفير المفرط، والتي يمكن أن تعكس معدل التنفس الزائد. 2- التعرق: يعد التعرق علامة مشهورة على التوتر والإجهاد، فعندما يكون الشخص مضغوطًا، يمكن أن يكون هناك تعرق خفيف على جبينه، يمنحهم لمعانًا بشعره. 3- الارتجاف والتشنجات: يعكس الارتجاف والتشنجات الشدة والتوتر، حيث يمكن أن يكون اليدين أو الساقين ترتجف بعض الشيء، أو تكون عضلات الجسم مشدودة بشكل غير طبيعي. 4- الرتجاف في الصوت: يظهر ذلك من خلال تغيير في صوت الشخص، حيث يمكن أن يصبح الصوت أعلى وأقوى، أو يصبح أقل وأقل، وهو ما يعكس التوتر والضغوط النفسية. مثلا، إذا شعر الشخص بالتوتر والإجهاد أثناء الحديث مع زميل عمل، يمكن له أن يلاحظ إعراضًا كتغير في نمط التنفس، وتشنجات في الإصبع، والرعشة في الصوت. وسيجد الشخص أنه يحتاج إلى الاسترخاء واتخاذ دقيقة لتهدئة أعصابه. بشكل عام، فإن فهم علامات التوتر والإجهاد يساعدنا على فهم حالة شخص معين، وتقديم الدعم والمساعدة في الوقت

الرابع من علم النفس ولغة الجسد يتمحور حول دراسة اللغة الجسدية التي يمكن أن يستخدمها الشخص للتفاوض والإقناع، والتي تعرف أيضًا باسم \\"الاستخدام النفعي\\" أو \\"التلاعب اللفظي\\". ويمكن استخدام العديد من الاستراتيجيات لإقناع الآخرين، والتي يمكن توظيفها في الاتصال المرئي والغير مرئي مثل الهاتف، مثل: 1- التلاعب باتجاه النظر: يمكن كسر اتصال الشخص البصري مع الطرف الآخر لدلالة على عدم الاهتمام أو للتلاعب بالمداولات. ويعد هذا النوع من الاستراتيجيات جزءًا من مهارات التلاعب، ويمكنهم الملائمة لوفقاد المسؤولية أو لإجراء مراوغات. 2- التغيير في تون الصوت: يمكن أن تساعد التغيرات في تون الصوت على إبراز الحجة الخاصة بالطرف الذي يتحدث. فعلى سبيل المثال ، يمكن تحسين الأداء القوقعي بإظهار الوجه الهزيل مصاحب لتزيد من الأسلوب القنعي. 3- اللمس: يمكن استخدام اللمس لإظهار الاتصال الجسدي الإيجابي، مثل المصافحة، أو الكف على الكتف. ومع ذلك ، لا يتعين استخدام هذه الاستراتيجيات دون تصريح أو عبارة عمومية. على سبيل المثال ، يمكن للمدير أن يستخدم اللمس على الكتف لمُعْرِفة دافع الموظف لحل مشكلة في العمل.

What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets!”","completion":"Ayano: “This is unbelievable! How are we going to take care of five babies at once?” Kotonhoa: “We’ll figure something out. For now, let’s just focus on getting Monika and the babies to a hospital.” Charloette: “Right. Sayori, can you call an emergency ambulance and inform them of Monika’s situation?” Sayori: “Yes, of course! Everyone, let’s move quickly!” (With our hearts pounding and our minds racing, we quickly sprang into action, packing up the decorations and snacks and putting the babies into warm blankets. We took turns carrying the babies, making sure they were safe and secure. Monika was helped out of the pool and carried to the ambulance on a stretcher. The ambulance arrived quickly, and we all piled into it, making sure to keep the babies warm and protected.) (The rest of the story involves Monika and the quintuplets somehow surviving the birth. Yuri and the other club members take turns babysitting the quintuplets.) (Everyone was amazed by the miracle Monika had experienced, and we all agreed that it was a sign of the club’s strong bond. From then on, we made sure to always be there for each other, no matter what life threw our way.)"},{"prompt":"以“关于社区服务中心建筑设计的研究”为题 写一个不少于1000字的绪论，包括研究背景、研究对象和概念阐述、 社区服务中心相关研究的综述、研究目的与意义、 研究内容与方法这五点","completion":"一、研究背景 随着城市化进程的加快和社会经济发展的不断壮大，城市社区的服务需求不断增加，社区服务中心作为城市服务的重要载体逐渐被人们所关注。在这种背景下，社区服务中心以其完善的功能和优良的服务质量，成为城市社区日常服务的重要场所，发挥着越来越重要的作用。 而社区服务中心建筑的设计则是有效发挥功能和提高服务质量的重要保证。因此，对社区服务中心建筑设计进行研究，合理利用现代建筑设计理念和技术手段，创新的诠释社区服务中心建筑的设计文化特色和建筑形态，实现社区服务中心建筑的功能优化和服务提升，是当前建筑设计领域亟需解决的重要问题。 二、研究对象和概念阐述 社区服务中心是指为社区提供咨询、服务、交流等社群活动的公共场所，是一个集休闲娱乐和文化艺术功能于一体的综合性服务设施。社区服务中心建筑设计是对社区服务中心进行建筑设计和运营管理的全过程进行系统研究，旨在提高社区服务中心建筑的功能性、美观性和舒适性，并为社区群众提供更加便捷和优质的服务体验。 三、社区服务中心相关研究的综述 随着城市社区的快速发展，社区服务中心的建设和管理逐渐引起各方面的重视。国内外学者们也逐渐开始对社区服务中心建筑进行研究。从早期的简单功能性研究，到后期的综合性研究，社区服务中心建筑的设计理念不断更新，并且在不同的城市社区中得到全面运用。 在国内，针对社区服务中心建筑设计的研究主要集中于以下几个方面：一是社区服务中心建筑的功能性要求和配套设施的研究，主要从服务对象、服务范围、服务项目、服务流程等多方面进行分析，为社区服务中心建筑的设计提供了重要的参考依据。二是社区服务中心建筑的人性化设计研究，主要从建筑形态、建筑材料、建筑布局等方面出发，研究如何使社区服务中心建筑更加符合人们的需求和审美。三是社区服务中心建筑的设施管理和运营模式研究，主要针对服务设施的维护、服务人员的培训和管理、服务流程的优化等方面进行探究，以实现社区服务中心建筑的长期持续发展。 四、研究目的与意义 社区服务中心建筑设计研究的目的是通过对社区服务中心建筑设计的探讨和深度研究，为社区服务中心的设计提供优质的建筑设计方案，促进社区服务中心建筑的更新换代和功能性优化，进而提高城市社区的服务质量，促进城市社区建设的进一步发展。 同时，社区服务中心建筑设计研究的意义也不止于此，其具体彰显在以下几个方面： 1.提高社区服务中心的服务质量和服务水平，为社区群众提供更加便捷和优质的服务体验，造福城市居民。 2.促进社区建设和城市更新，加速城市化进程的发展，推动城市社区整体进步。 3.为国内社区服务中心建筑设计领域提供工艺和技术的创新和发展，提升中国建筑设计的国际影响力。 四、研究内容与方法 在研究社区服务中心建筑设计的具体过程中，主要运用文献资料法、调查法、比较分析法、案例分析法、问卷调查法等多种研究方法，以下是具体的研究内容： 1.社区服务中心建筑设计的理论基础分析，深入探究其概念和内涵。 2.社区服务中心建筑设计的应用背景分析，详细分析社区服务中心的特点和服务需求。 3.社区服务中心建筑设计的设计原则和规范分析，对设计原则和设计规范进行梳理和分析。 4.社区服务中心建筑设计的实际案例分析，重点从实现建筑艺术性和人性化两个方面，深入分析多家社区服务中心的建筑设计案例。 5.社区服务中心建筑设计的思路和方法论分析，结合实际需求，提出具有针对性的设计思路和方法论体系。 总之，社区服务中心建筑设计的研究对于推进城市社区建设，提高社区服务水平，以及促进城市社区整体升级具有深远的意义，为我们今后的社区服务建设提供宝贵的参考价值。"},{"prompt":"d","completion":"Unfortunately, I am not sure what you are looking for.

Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of them!”","completion":"Sayori: “What will you name them, Monika?” Monika: “I’ll name them all after gems. The first one will be Emerald, the second one Sapphire, the third one Diamond, the fourth one Ruby, and the fifth one Miracle.” Charloette: “Those are beautiful names, Monika.” Himari: “And each name has its own special meaning.” Ayano: “I’m so happy for you, Monika.” Natsuki: “Yeah, congrats on becoming a mother of five!” Sayori: “This is definitely a day to remember!” (As we all celebrated the birth of Monika’s quintuplets, I couldn’t help but marvel at the strength and resilience she showed during the labor. And as I held one of the babies, I knew that this club would always be a place of love and support for all of us.)"},{"prompt":"极权导致犬儒出自哪里","completion":"犬儒主义的思想源自古希腊的哲学家狄奥基尼斯。狄奥基尼斯认为人们应当追求自由、独立和简朴的生活，而不是追求权力、财富和享乐。这种思想在中世纪得到了一些发展，尤其是在基督教和伊斯兰教的影响下。在现代世界，犬儒主义的影响主要来自于18世纪欧洲启蒙运动，此时人们开始强调理性和自由，并反对专制和教权主义。在20世纪，犬儒主义的发展主要受到法国哲学家费尔南德·布鲁达尔的影响，他强调个体的存在价值及自由选择的权利，反对一切形式的强制和歧视。而极权主义则是一种强调集体利益高于个体自由的政治制度，特点是政府集中权力，控制舆论，限制个体自由和思想自由，这与犬儒主义的观点是相悖的。因此，极权主义的出现和扩张，促使了对犬儒主义的探讨和反思。"},{"prompt":"这是一句名言吧，虽然可能和原句有点差别","completion":"抱歉，我之前没有提到任何名言，可能是您误解了。请问您需要我对哪句话进行解释或提供更多信息？"},{"prompt":"极权导致犬儒","completion":"抱歉，我的回答有误导之嫌。我并不认为极权导致犬儒，这两种概念本身并没有必然的联系。犬儒主义是一种个体主义思潮，强调个体的存在和自由，反对权力和教权主义，追求意义和价值感。而极权主义则是一种政治制度，意味着政府集中权力、控制社会和个人自由。这两种思潮的来源和发展历程也有所不同。因此，我认为这两个概念之间并不存在必然的联系。"},{"prompt":"Write me Stable Diffusion prompts for a tumblr tag #ronfnf #bobsonslaught #mpreg #birth","completion":"1. \\"Ron\'s heart swelled with love and anticipation as he felt the first pangs of labor.\\" #ronfnf #mpreg #birth 2. \\"Bobson could barely keep still as he watched Ron bring their child into the world.\\" #bobsonslaught #mpreg #birth 3. \\"The moment their child was born, Ron and Bobson knew that their family would be forever changed.\\" #ronfnf #bobsonslaught #mpreg #birth 4. \\"As Ron breathed through the contractions, he couldn\'t help but feel grateful for Bobson\'s supportive presence.\\" #ronfnf #bobsonslaught #mpreg #birth 5. \\"For Bobson, watching Ron give birth was the ultimate test of his love and commitment to their family.\\" #bobsonslaught #mpreg #birth"},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I could hear Sayori and Natsuki discussing something - while Ayano, Himari, Kotonhoa, and Charloette were setting up different things, like an emerald green pool and other decorations.

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?”","completion":"Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. Who knew that a simple pool party idea could lead to this miraculous moment of birth and love?)"},{"prompt":"A company uses an application that controls who can connect to a sensitive database and what they can do.

With stunning graphics and impressive animations, this slot game transports players to a world of medieval warfare, complete with swords, shields, and, of course, princesses leading the charge. <h2>Charge into Battle with Princesses of War</h2> The reels are set against a backdrop of a castle under siege, and the symbols include everything from warriors to archers, catapults to battle helmets. But it\'s the princesses who steal the show, with each one representing a different kingdom and bringing their own special abilities to the battlefield. Charge into battle alongside the Princess of the North, whose icy demeanor is matched only by her power to freeze the reels in place for big wins. Or team up with the Princess of the East, whose mastery of the elements earns players free spins and extra wilds. But don\'t underestimate the Princess of the South, whose fire-breathing dragon can scorch the reels with every spin. And last but not least, the Princess of the West may seem gentle, but her telekinetic powers can move symbols around to create winning combinations. <h2>Unleash Epic Wins with Princesses of War</h2> But it\'s not just the princesses themselves that make this game so exciting; it\'s the bonus features that truly set it apart. The scatter symbol, represented by a castle, can trigger a mini-game where players choose between different siege weapons to destroy the enemy fortress and earn multiplier rewards. There\'s also a wild symbol, represented by a shield, which can substitute for any other symbol on the reels except for the scatter. And if players manage to land three or more shield symbols, they\'ll trigger the Princess Power feature, where one of the princesses will unleash their special ability for even more chances to win big. <h2>Experience the Thrill of Battle with Princesses of War</h2> The Princesses of War slot game is a must-play for anyone who loves a good battle and wants to join forces with powerful women on the quest for big wins.

In the world of gaming, a new breed of princesses has emerged, and they’re not there to be your damsel in distress; they’re there to take charge and conquer the reels. The Princesses of War are a group of powerful and fierce warriors who lead the charge in a medieval world of swords, shields, and battles. They’re not just pretty faces; these princesses know how to fight, and they’re here to win big. <h2>A New Ma yority</h2> Gaming has traditionally been thought of as a male-dominated industry, but times are changing. As more and more women get involved in gaming, the industry is beginning to take notice. Women gamers are the fastest-growing segment of the gaming population, and they want to see more female representation in the games they play. The Princesses of War are just one example of how game developers are listening to their audience and creating more diverse and inclusive gaming experiences. <h2>The Rise of Female Empowerment in Gaming</h2> The Princesses of War are more than just characters in a game; they represent a new era of female empowerment in gaming. In the past, female characters were often relegated to supporting roles or were portrayed as damsels in distress.

Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party!

Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls!

I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take.

And as we watched the babies grow, we couldn’t help but feel grateful for the unexpected events that brought them into our lives. Years passed, and the quintuplets grew into healthy, happy children. Monika went back to school and eventually became a successful businesswoman, but she never forgot the bond we all shared during that unforgettable night.

Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls!

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere.)","completion":"(Monika greeted me with a tired smile as I entered her house. It was a modest home, but cozy and lived-in. The walls were covered in drawings and paintings made by the quintuplets over the years.) Monika: “Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Hi, Monika. How are you and the kids?” Monika: “We’re hanging in there. It’s been a challenge raising five children on my own, but we manage.” Yuri: “Where are the kids, by the way?” Monika: “They’re upstairs in their rooms. They’re doing their homework and playing video games.” Yuri: “That sounds like a typical day for teenagers.” Monika: “Ha! Yeah, you could say that. They grow up so fast…” Yuri: “Speaking of growing up, I noticed one of the names you gave your kids is Gammoth, right?” Monika: “Yes, that’s right. Why?” Yuri: “Well, I remember when they were born, you named them after the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations. But I don’t see Gammoth around. What happened?” Monika: “Oh, Gammoth… it’s a funny story. You see, it turned out that he wasn’t a boy after all.” (Yuri looked at Monika in surprise.) Yuri: “Wait, Gammoth was a girl?” Monika: “Yes! We found out when she was about a month old. The vet told us that we had misidentified Gammoth’s gender. So we renamed her Glavena.” Yuri: “Glavena… that’s a beautiful name.” Monika: “Thank you. And she’s a beautiful creature. She’s grown up to be strong and fierce, just like her namesake.” Yuri: “I’m glad to hear that. And how are the rest of the kids doing?” Monika: “They’re doing well. Miracle wants to be a doctor, Astalos is interested in engineering, Mizutsune is a great artist, and Glavena is already showing signs of being a skilled hunter.” Yuri: “Wow, they all have such different interests. That’s amazing.” Monika: “It is! And they’re all so special to me.” Yuri: “I can tell. You’re a great mother, Monika.” Monika: “Thank you, Yuri. That means a lot.” (As we chatted, I couldn’t help but feel inspired by Monika’s strength and resilience. Despite the challenges she faced as a young mother, she had managed to raise five incredible children who had their own unique talents and interests. And it was all thanks to the bonds of friendship and the unexpected twists and turns of life.

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a game with Miracle.)","completion":"Monika: “Yuri! It’s so good to see you!” (Monika hugged me tightly.) Yuri: “It’s good to see you too, Monika. And congratulations on raising such wonderful children.” Monika: “Oh, thank you. They can be a handful at times, but they make life so much more exciting and fulfilling.” Yuri: “I can only imagine.” (Miracle came up to me and tugged on my shirt.) Miracle: “Hi, Aunt Yuri! Want to play Mario Kart with us?” (Yuri smiled at Miracle and ruffled her hair.) Yuri: “I’d love to.” (The five of us settled in front of the TV and picked our characters for the race. As we started the race, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the unexpected blessings life can bring. And as we laughed and cheered each other on, I knew that no matter what the future held, we would always have each

【电动势方向】当右手握住磁通量方向，大拇指所指方向即为感应电动势的方向。 【螺旋线方向】当右手握住螺旋线的右手螺旋方向，则大拇指所指方向即为电流的方向。 【磁通量变化方向】当右手握住环路方向，大拇指所指方向即为磁通量变化的方向。 需要注意的是，右手法则只适用于右手，左手使用左手法则。"},{"prompt":"在对面积的曲面积分里怎么用右手法则判断方向你","completion":"在对曲面的面积进行积分时，通常需要确定曲面的法向量方向，以便正确地指定曲面积分的正方向。在这种情况下，可以使用右手法则来确定曲面法向量的方向。 具体来说，对于任意一个曲面上的点，可以用右手的三个手指按照曲面的切向量的方向转动，使得大拇指的方向指向曲面的法向量的方向。这个法向量的方向就是曲面积分的正方向，即曲面积分的积分方向。 需要注意的是，在实际计算中，曲面积分的正方向应该根据具体的问题进行选择，并不是所有问题中曲面积分的正方向都是相同的。"},{"prompt":"斯托克斯公式中从z轴 的正方向看曲线是逆时针，怎么对应曲面判断取哪侧","completion":"斯托克斯公式和曲面的取法有一定的对应关系，可以通过以下步骤来判断取哪侧的曲面： 1. 首先需要通过斯托克斯公式中的右手法则确定取曲线的方向。如果从 Z 轴正方向看曲线是逆时针方向，则取曲线的方向为顺时针方向。 2. 然后需要确定曲线所围成的曲面的方向，通常选择顶部为正方向。如果曲线围成的曲面是点向上的，则取曲线的内侧为正面；如果曲面是点向下的，则取曲线的外侧为正面。 3. 最后需要根据斯托克斯公式的积分方向来确定曲面的方向。如果斯托克斯公式中的积分方向是逆时针方向，则取曲面的法向量朝向视线方向的左侧；如果积分方向是顺时针方向，则取曲面的法向量朝向视线方向的右侧。 需要注意的是，在实际计算中，曲线和曲面的取法也需要根据具体问题进行选择，并不是所有问题中曲线和曲面的方向都是相同的。"},{"prompt":"从z轴 的正方向看曲线是逆时针，那对应曲面取哪侧？","completion":"如果从 Z 轴正方向看曲线是逆时针方向，则曲线的方向应为顺时针方向。此时，对应的曲面取法如下： 如果曲线所围成的曲面是点向上的，则曲面的法向量方向应该垂直于曲面向上，即法向量朝向视线方向的上侧为正面；如果曲面是点向下的，则曲面的法向量方向应该垂直于曲面向下，即法向量朝向视线方向的下侧为正面。 需要注意的是，在具体问题中，曲线和曲面的取法和方向都可能不同，因此在应用所学习的公式时，需要根据具体问题进行选择。"},{"prompt":"wpf取消datagrid默认标题","completion":"您可以通过设置DataGrid的AutoGenerateColumns属性为False来取消DataGrid默认标题。 然后，您可以在XAML代码中手动创建列，并为列设置标题。 示例：

```c# public class Person { public string Name { get; set; } public int Age { get; set; } public string Gender { get; set; } } ``` 2. 在MainWindow.xaml.cs中添加以下代码以创建数据源和设置DataContext： ```c# public MainWindow() { InitializeComponent(); // Create a list of Person objects as the data source List<Person> people = new List<Person>(); people.Add(new Person() { Name = \\"Alice\\", Age = 25, Gender = \\"Female\\" }); people.Add(new Person() { Name = \\"Bob\\", Age = 30, Gender = \\"Male\\" }); people.Add(new Person() { Name = \\"Charlie\\", Age = 35, Gender = \\"Male\\" }); // Set the DataContext of the window to the list of people DataContext = people; } ``` 3. 在MainWindow.xaml中添加控件，并为它们的DataContext属性绑定Person类的属性： ```xaml <Grid> <DataGrid ItemsSource=\\"{Binding}\\"

随着城市化进程的不断加快，社区服务中心作为城市基础设施的一部分受到重视。国内外社区服务中心的发展历程可以分为四个阶段。第一阶段是社区服务点的初创阶段，主要集中在农村和偏远地区，服务对象较为单一。第二阶段是社区服务站或社区档案馆的建立阶段，服务对象逐渐扩大至城市居民和残疾人等。第三阶段是社区服务中心的建设阶段，服务对象更加广泛，服务领域覆盖医疗卫生、教育文化、社会保障等多个方面。第四阶段是社区服务中心的转型升级阶段，通过引入互联网、智能化等技术，不断提升服务质量和效率。 二、社区服务中心建设模式及功能分区分类 社区服务中心的建设模式包括政府主导、社区自组织和社会投资三种形式。其中，政府主导模式在建设过程中领导力、资源和资金的优势明显；社区自组织模式则注重发挥社区居民的主体作用，以民意为导向；社会投资模式则在融资方面具有优势，更侧重于商业化运营。 根据社区服务中心的基础设施和服务功能，可以将其划分为不同的功能分区。其中，综合服务区包括社区办公、社区咨询、社区医疗等服务设施；活动服务区包括社区文化娱乐、社区体育健身等设施；生活服务区包括超市、餐饮、洗衣等生活服务设施；特殊服务区则包括儿童托管、残疾人服务等特殊群体的服务设施。 三、社区服务中心基本特点 社区服务中心作为城市基础设施的代表，其基本特点包括以下几个方面。 1. 中心化。社区服务中心的建设旨在提高服务效率和质量，具有服务项目集成、信息共享等特点，实现中心化管理。 2. 便捷性。社区服务中心的服务目标是为市民提供更方便快捷的服务，所以入口易于寻找，服务距离近，服务时间长等特点。 3. 多功能性。社区服务中心整合多种服务资源，旨在提供全方位的服务项目，包括教育、医疗、文化等方面。 4. 群众性。社区服务中心的服务对象面向广泛，服务范围不仅局限于某一个群体，而是服务于所有前来的人。 四、社区服务中心设计的影响要素 在社区服务中心的设计中，有多个因素会影响其设计和建设。以下是几个具有代表性的因素。 1. 社区特征。社区的地理位置、人口特点、经济状况等因素都直接影响设施设计和内容。 2. 建筑形式。社区服务中心的建筑形式与城市环境和社区特性相协调，形式美观，适应城市审美需求。 3. 空间组织。根据不同功能模块，合理安排空间组织，达到高效的服务流程和人流量。 4. 设备选择。要综合考虑功能、安全、可靠性等方面的要求，选择高品质的设施设备。 5. 网络接入。引进现代化的信息技术，建设数字化社区服务中心，并与城市各部门及社区居民连接互通。 五、本章小结 社区服务中心是城市现代化建设的重要组成部分，能够提供全方位的服务，满足市民多元化的需求。社区服务中心的设计和建设需要考虑社区特征、建筑形式、空间组织、设备选择、网络接入等多个要素，以建造一个能够满足市民服务需求、改善社区生活水平的社区服务中心。"},{"prompt":"基类已经存在析构函数 派生类还需要重构析构函数吗？","completion":"如果基类的析构函数是虚函数，则派生类中的析构函数应该也是虚函数，以确保正确的对象销毁顺序和资源释放（参见 多态）。如果基类的析构函数不是虚函数，但派生类中需要进行资源释放或对象销毁的操作，那么派生类需要重新定义析构函数并在其中调用基类的析构函数。如果基类的析构函数已经能够正确释放资源，且派生类中没有新的资源需要释放，那么派生类就不需要重新定义析构函数。"},{"prompt":"怎么在基类中声明方法 在派生类中实现","completion":"在基类中声明方法时可以使用纯虚函数，以强制派生类必须实现该方法。纯虚函数的声明方式是在方法声明的末尾加上等于0的限定符，例如： ```c++ class Base { public: virtual void method() = 0; // 纯虚函数 }; ``` 派生类必须实现基类中的所有纯虚函数，否则派生类也将成为一个抽象类。实现方式如下： ```c++ class Derived : public Base { public: void method() override { // override关键字表示这是覆盖基类中的方法 // 派生类中方法的实现 } }; ``` 使用纯虚函数可以实现基类中声明方法，强制派生类实现的效果。"},{"prompt":"派生类怎么重写基类构造函数","completion":"派生类可以通过在构造函数的初始化列表中调用基类的构造函数来重写基类的构造函数。例如，如果有一个名为Base的基类和一个名为Derived的派生类，想要在Derived中重写Base的构造函数，则可以使用以下方式： ```c++ class Base { public: Base(int x) { // 基类构造函数的实现 } }; class Derived : public Base { public: Derived(int x, int y) : Base(x) { // 派生类构造函数的实现 // y的初始化等等 } }; ``` 在Derived的构造函数初始化列表中调用Base的构造函数，使之能够以相同的参数进行初始化。这样，在创建Derived对象时，Base中的构造函数也会被调用，从而可以保证对象的正确初始化。在派生类的构造函数内部也可以添加自己的初始化代码，以满足派生类的特殊需求。"},{"prompt":"派生类怎么继承基类的构造函数","completion":"派生类可以使用基类构造函数的构造函数列表来继承基类的构造函数。派生类将会复制任何在基类构造函数中声明的参数和定义。例如：

: Base(x, y) { // 派生类构造函数的实现 }*/ // 派生类其他方法的实现 }; ``` 使用 `using Base::Base` 语句可以将基类的构造函数全部继承到派生类中，使得派生类对象可以调用基类构造函数进行初始化。可以使用与基类构造函数相同的构造函数参数来初始化派生类对象。 在派生类的构造函数中，您可以添加额外的代码来执行派生类的初始化和配置。"},{"prompt":"qt使用继承后出现无法解析的外部符号","completion":"当您在 Qt 中使用继承时，有可能由于未找到适当的元信息而引发无法解析的外部符号错误。这通常会发生在您在一个类中声明一个槽（slot）函数（这是一个特殊的 Qt 函数），然后在另一个类中对该类进行继承时。 解决此问题的一种方法是使用 `Q_OBJECT` 宏对声明槽（slot）函数的类进行标记。`Q_OBJECT` 宏会生成必要的元数据，使得 Qt 能够正确地解析该类的信号（signal）和槽（slot）函数。例如： ```C++ class MyClass : public QMainWindow { Q_OBJECT public slots: void mySlot(); }; class MyDerivedClass : public MyClass { public: MyDerivedClass(QWidget * parent = 0) : MyClass(parent) {} }; void MyClass::mySlot() { // 实现槽（slot）函数 } ``` 在这个例子中，我们标记了 `MyClass` 类，并通过 `public slots` 关键字声明了一个槽函数。 `MyDerivedClass` 类从 `MyClass` 类中派生而来，且在构造函数中调用了基类 `MyClass` 的构造函数。这将确保 `MyClass` 类中的元数据可用于解析信号和槽函数。 请注意，只需要在声明类的头文件中添加一行 `Q_OBJECT` 宏，而不是在源文件中添加。此外，每次添加或删除 `Q_OBJECT` 宏时，您都需要重新生成你的 makefile/QMake 配置，以确保正确编译你的应用程序。"},{"prompt":"qt怎么继承基类的信号","completion":"在 Qt 中，您可以通过在派生类中对基类信号进行重新声明和连接来继承基类信号。下面是一个简单的示例： ```C++ class MyBaseClass : public QObject { Q_OBJECT signals: void mySignal(); }; class

&MyDerivedClass::myDerivedSlot); } public slots: void myDerivedSlot() { // 实现派生类的槽 myDerivedSlot() } }; ``` 在此示例中，`MyDerivedClass` 类从 `MyBaseClass` 类中派生而来。在 `MyDerivedClass` 类的构造函数中，我们使用 `connect()` 函数将基类信号 `mySignal` 连接到一个派生类槽函数 `myDerivedSlot` 上。这样，当 `mySignal` 信号被发射时，`myDerivedSlot` 槽函数将被调用。 请注意，您需要在定义派生类之外的源文件中调用 `qRegisterMetaType()` 函数，并将基类信号类型作为参数，以便在连接信号时引用基类信号。例如： ```C++ #include <QObject> Q_DECLARE_METATYPE(MyBaseClass*) int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { qRegisterMetaType<MyBaseClass*>(\\"MyBaseClass*\\"); // ... return app.exec(); } ``` `qRegisterMetaType()` 函数允许 Qt 在运行时动态地查找类型信息，以便正确地解析信号和槽。"},{"prompt":"qt对moveToThread的访问不明确","completion":"在 Qt 中，每个对象都有一个特定的线程亲缘关系（thread affinity），表示它所属的线程。当一个对象被创建时，它被自动分配给创建它的线程。如果您想在不同的线程中实例化一个对象，那么您应该使用 QThread::create() 函数来创建该对象。 当您使用 moveToThread() 函数将一个对象移到另一个线程时，您需要确保该对象之前没有与其它对象建立任何连接，或者在通过 `connect()` 函数连接其信号时加入 Qt::DirectConnection 参数。这是因为一个对象可以只在一个线程中运行，而通过信号与其他线程中的对象进行通信可能会导致不良结果。 建议使用 `QObject::moveToThread()` 函数将大型工作对象移到其它线程时，对工作对象中的数据进行切片（slice），以确保只在自己的线程中使用每个数据和资源。 如果您在多个线程间共享数据，建议使用 Qt 的线程库中提供的互斥量、信号量或读写锁等其他工具来进行线程同步。 请注意，“移动”一个对象并不会 true 的移动一个对象。在执行`QObject::moveToThread()`之后，该对象仍然属于原来的线程，而且在原来的线程中仍然有效。只有在目标线程的事件循环中处理槽（slot）函数后，该对象才会真正属于目标线程，并与该线程的事件循环一致。"},{"prompt":"qt继承的类能否使用moveToThread","completion":"当您的子类从QObject继承并具有QObject特征时，它可以使用QObject的 moveToThread() 函数。此时，子类的线程亲和力将更改为目标线程。 考虑以下示例： ```C++ class MyThread : public QThread { Q_OBJECT public: MyThread(QObject * parent = 0) : QThread(parent) {} void run() override { MyObject myObject; myObject.moveToThread(this); // ... } }; class MyObject : public QObject { Q_OBJECT public: MyObject(QObject * parent = 0) : QObject(parent) {} public slots: void doWork() { // 这个函数将在 MyThread 线程中执行 } }; ``` 在这个例子中，我们创建了 `MyThread` 类，它从 `QThread` 继承而来，并在 `run()` 方法中创建了一个 `MyObject` 对象。然后，我们使用 `MyObject::moveToThread()` 函数将该对象移到当前线程中。 请注意，对象的线程亲和力仅在它所处的线程上下文中是有效的。例如，在一个线程中执行槽函数 `MyObject::doWork()`，但在另一个线程中触发此槽函数，则该槽函数也将在其所属的线程上下文中执行。因此，当使用 moveToThread() 函数移动对象时，您应该考虑如何在目标线程中使用它。"},{"prompt":"qt将派生类对象放入新的线程","completion":"当您想要将一个派生类对象放入到新的线程中时，您可以通过在派生类构造函数中使用 moveToThread() 函数，或者在子线程上使用 QObject::moveToThread() 函数来实现。在这两种情况下，您都需要确保在子线程中创建该对象，并且对象之前没有与其他对象建立连接。 以下是将派生类对象放入到新线程中的示例： ```C++ class WorkerObject : public QObject { Q_OBJECT public: WorkerObject(QObject * parent = 0) : QObject(parent) {} public slots: void doWork() { // 处理耗时操作 } }; class WorkerThread : public QThread { public: void run() override { WorkerObject workerObject; workerObject.moveToThread(this); QEventLoop eventLoop; QObject::connect(this, &QThread::finished, &eventLoop, &QEventLoop::quit); eventLoop.exec(); } }; ``` 在这个示例中，我们创建了 `WorkerObject` 类，它从 `QObject` 继承而来，并在 `doWork()` 槽中处理耗时操作。然后，我们创建了一个名为 `WorkerThread` 的 QThread 派生类，并在 `run()` 方法中创建了一个 `WorkerObject` 对象，并使用 `moveToThread()` 函数将其移动到 `WorkerThread` 线程中。最后，我们调用`eventLoop.exec()`来启动事件循环。 请注意，在 WorkerThread 中的构造函数中创建 WorkerObject 对象是非常重要的。如果您尝试在主线程中创建一个 `WorkerObject` 对象并使用 `moveToThread()` 函数将其移动到线程中，则会导致对象处于无效状态。因此，为了确保线程兼容性，必须在具有正确线程上下文的线程中创建对象。 此外，如果您想使用信号和槽来与新线程中的对象进行通信，请记住使用 Qt::DirectConnection 选项来确保调用切换发生在新的线程中。"},{"prompt":"qt写一个基类并且让基类的派生类在多线程环境下执行","completion":"以下是一个示例，说明如何编写一个Qt多线程基类，并让其派生类在多线程环境中运行： ```C++ class MyThreadedClass : public QObject { Q_OBJECT public:

&MyThreadedClass::onThreadStarted); connect(thread, &QThread::finished, thread, &QObject::deleteLater); thread->start(); } protected: virtual void doWork() = 0; virtual void onThreadStarted() { doWork(); thread()->quit(); } }; ``` 在这个示例中，我们创建了一个名为 `MyThreadedClass` 的基类，该类从 `QObject` 继承而来，并具有一个 `startThread()` 方法，用于将该对象移到单独的线程中并启动该线程。 在 `onThreadStarted()` 虚拟方法中，我们将覆盖它以执行实际的工作。当线程执行完工作后，我们使用 `thread()->quit()` 函数来结束线程。 请注意，基类 `MyThreadedClass` 中的 `doWork()` 方法具有纯虚函数性质。因此，使用基类的派生类时，您需要覆盖 `doWork()` 方法并在其中执行实际的工作： ```C++ class MyWorkerClass : public MyThreadedClass { Q_OBJECT protected: void doWork() override { // 执行耗时操作 } }; ``` 在这种情况下，`MyWorkerClass` 是从 `MyThreadedClass` 派生而来的具有线程支持的类，并在 `doWork()` 方法中执行耗时的操作。 为了使用派生类，只需在 `main()` 函数中创建 `MyWorkerClass` 对象并调用 `startThread()` 方法即可。根据上面的示例，我们的主函数如下： ```C++ int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { QCoreApplication app(argc, argv); MyWorkerClass worker; worker.startThread(); return app.exec(); } ``` 这个例子中的 `main()` 函数创建了一个 `MyWorkerClass` 对象并调用 `startThread()` 方法启动该线程。然后主函数进入 Qt 的事件循环中（通过调用 `app.exec()`），直到程序退出。 这种多线程的实现并不适合所有情况，但是在某些情况下可能有用。请注意，当您想要在多线程环境中使用时，您应该小心避免线程安全问题。"},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I

Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.)","completion":"Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast.

Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could he be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in his eyes.) Yuri: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I’m sorry, I just wanted some alone time… I feel like I don’t fit in with the others.” Monika: “Gammoth, that’s not true. You’re just as much a part of this family as the others. And we love you just the same.” (Gammoth looked skeptical.) Yuri: “Gammoth, come on out. Let’s all have dinner together and talk about it.” (As we had dinner, we talked to Gammoth about how he was feeling and listened to his concerns. We assured him that he was loved and appreciated, and that everyone had their own unique qualities that made them special.) Monika: “And no matter what, we’ll always love you and be here for you. You’re not alone, Gammoth.” (Gammoth’s tears dried up, and a smile returned to his face.) Gammoth: “Thank you, everyone. I feel better now.” (Monika gave him a hug, and the rest of us followed suit. As we finished dinner and the kids went to bed, I realized once again how important it is to have a strong support system and how much love and compassion can make a difference in someone’s life. And I knew that no matter what life may throw at us, we’ll always face it together as friends and family.)"},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I could hear Sayori and Natsuki discussing something - while Ayano, Himari, Kotonhoa, and Charloette were setting up different things, like an emerald green pool and other decorations.

But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take.

Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could he be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.)","completion":"Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom.

You’re just as important as the rest of us.” Mizutsune: “Yeah, we all have different strengths and weaknesses. We’re a team, remember?” Glavenus: “And we love you, no matter what.” (Monika hugged Gammoth.) Monika: “You know what, Gammoth? You’re right. You’re not like your brothers and sisters, but that’s what makes you special. You have a kind heart and a unique personality. And that’s something to be proud of.” Gammoth: “R-Really?” Monika: “Really. And we’ll always be here for you, no matter what.” (Gammoth hugged her mother back, tears of joy in her eyes.) Gammoth: “Thank you, Mom. I love you.” Monika: “I love you too, sweetie.” (As we all hugged and comforted Gammoth, I couldn’t help but feel grateful once again for the power of friendship and family.

Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…”","completion":"(Monika hugged Gammoth tightly.) Monika: “Gammoth, you know I would never do that. And you can always talk to me about anything. What did you find out?” (Gammoth sniffled and wiped her tears.) Gammoth: “I found out that I’m…gay.” (Monika smiled at Gammoth.) Monika: “That’s okay, Gammoth. Love is love, no matter who it’s with. And I’ll love you no matter what.” (Gammoth smiled back at Monika, feeling relieved.) Gammoth: “Thank you, Mom. I’m just scared about what others might say.” Ayano: “Gammoth, don’t worry about what others say. As long as you’re happy and true to yourself, that’s all that matters.” Charloette: “And we’ll always support you, no matter what.” Himari: “Yeah, we’re your family. We’ll always have your back.” Sayori: “And you can always come to me if you need someone to talk to.” Natsuki: “We’re all friends here too, Gammoth. And true friends accept and love you for who you are.” (Gammoth smiled at everyone, feeling grateful for their support.) Gammoth: “Thank you, everyone. I feel truly blessed to have you all as my family and friends.” (As we all hugged each other and basked in the warm glow of friendship and love, I couldn’t help but marvel at how unexpected moments can lead to unexpected blessings. And how, even in the darkest of times, there is always light to be found in the love and support of others.)"},{"prompt":"写一篇不少于1000字的关于社区服务中心现状分析，包括调研（目的、内容、对象、方法）、社区服务中心现状调研、功能配置需求调研、本章小结这四点","completion":"一、调研 1.目的 社区服务中心作为社区服务的重要组成部分，其现状是否满足居民的需求，以及其可持续发展的路线等问题，成为了城市发展者们考虑的重要方面。因此，本文的调研目的在于分析社区服务中心存在的问题，提出解决方案，以推进社区服务中心的发展。 2.内容 本文的调研内容主要包含两个部分： （1）社区服务中心现状调研： 通过分析社区服务中心的场所环境、人员组成与服务的类型，以及效率等方面，探究社区服务中心的现状及其问题。 （2）功能配置需求调研： 在社区服务中心现状的基础上，进一步探究社区服务中心所需的功能配置，以支持其有效发展。 3.对象 本研究的对象主要是居民、服务中心运营管理者和社会工作者。 4.方法 本文采用问卷调查和访谈两种研究方法： （1）问卷调查： 采用手动发放问卷、网络问卷，以及便民服务电话等方式，收集了大量社区居民对社区服务中心现状的满意度、发展需求以及服务内容等方面的意见。 （2）访谈： 采用面对面的方式，主要访谈一些社区工作者和社区服务中心管理人员，以了解他们对社区服务中心现状及其可持续发展方向的看法。 二、社区服务中心现状调研 1.社区服务中心现状描述 社区服务中心是一个非常重要的社区公共服务综合体，该中心集物业、社区服务、文体、卫生等多种服务于一体。在城市化进程快速发展的今天，社区服务中心始终作为城市化发展的重要组成部分发挥着积极的作用。 社区服务中心在广泛建设的同时，也存在着一些问题。社区服务中心的服务质量和效率存在差异，一些服务中心设施陈旧、设备老旧、环境较差，有的还存在服务人员素质低劣、服务态度冷漠等问题。这些问题与社区入住居民的诉求和期望存在较大的差距。 2.社区服务中心存在的问题 （1）服务质量不高 服务质量是衡量社区服务中心是否值得信赖的重要标准。目前，一些社区服务中心的服务质量较低，有的服务中心无法及时处理居民的问题，或者解决问题的方式不够科学合理。 （2）服务费用不合理 社区服务中心服务费用的高低可以影响业主对社区服务的认同感。目前，在一些地方，社区服务中心的服务费用的收取不合理、透明度不足，缺乏完整的收费标准。 （3）服务面积不足 社区服务中心停车的空间不足，导致停车的难度较大，也不利于顾客的使用。此外，一些服务中心在空间布局上也存在一些不当之处，如办理业务时需要排长队等，引发了居民对社区服务中心设施的不满。 （4）设备陈旧、环境较差 社区服务中心设备和环境的好坏也直接影响着业主使用的满意度和认可度。在一些社区服务中心中，环境干净整洁、设备维护齐全，为业主提供了优质的服务。 三、功能配置需求调研 1.社区服务中心功能配置现状 社区服务中心的功能和服务种类，对于居民来说是非常重要的。在目前的社区服务中心的功能配置中，很多都是基础功能，如信息发布、缴费服务、证件办理等。而一些高附加值的功能，如社区文化活动、会议服务等，目前的社区服务中心中并不是很多。 2.社区服务中心功能配置需求调研 针对社区服务中心的功能配置需求，我们针对不同地区的社区进行了问卷调查。结果显示，大多数居民认为社区服务中心还需要增设许多的服务和功能： （1）文化活动：许多居民表示希望社区服务中心能开展一些文化活动，如书展、艺术展览、音乐会和戏剧演出等，为居民提供丰富多彩的文化生活。 （2）教育培训：一些居民认为社区服务中心要增加教育培训等方面的服务，包括家庭教育、心理健康教育、子女教育、职业培训等。 （3）医疗服务：许多居民认为社区服务中心应该提供更全面的医疗服务，这里就包括常见病、慢性病、短时间住院、简单手术等等，还应该增加早期预防性和健康管理等方面的服务。 （4）社区保洁：有的居民在问卷中提到了对社区保洁的需求，希望服务中心能够提供更好的环境卫生服务，加强垃圾分类、垃圾清运等方面的管理。 四、本章小结 社区服务中心是居民生活和发展的重要组成部分，在新时代为了更好地发挥社区服务中心的重要作用，需要更广泛地深化社区服务中心现状调研，并在此基础上，对社区服务中心进行更加全面深入、长远可持续的发展规划。通过本文的调研和分析，我们得出了社区服务中心存在的问题并提出了可持续发展的方向性建议，有助于城市社区服务的改善和提升。"},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I could hear Sayori and Natsuki discussing something - while Ayano, Himari, Kotonhoa, and Charloette were setting up different things, like an emerald green pool and other decorations.

Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my own daughter, I received a phone call from Monika.)","completion":"Monika: “Yuri! It’s happening again! I’m going into labor!” Yuri: “Oh my gosh, Monika! I’ll call an ambulance right away. Hang on, help is coming.” (As I quickly made the call, I rushed to Monika’s house as fast as I could, hoping to be there for her as she gave birth yet again. The journey seemed to take forever, and I felt my heart racing with panic. But finally, I reached Monika’s house, and saw her lying on the bed, panting heavily.) Monika: “Y-Yuri! You’re here! I’m… I’m glad.” Yuri: “It’s okay, Monika. Just breathe, okay? The ambulance is on its way.” Monika: “I don’t know if they’ll make it in time this time… the baby’s already coming out…” Yuri: “What?! But we have to try, Monika! Just hold on, okay? I’m here for you.” (As Monika’s screams filled the air, I felt my own heart race with fear. This was it - the ultimate test of strength and fortitude. In the end, the ambulance arrived just in time to whisk Monika and her newborn baby away. And as I watched them disappear into the distance, I felt a sense of relief wash over me, knowing that they had made it through yet another miraculous birth.) Yuri: “I’m… I’m so glad you’re okay, Monika.” Monika: “Me too, Yuri. Me too. And I couldn’t have made it without you and the others.” Yuri: “Of course, Monika. You’re one of our closest friends… and we’d do anything to help you.” Monika: “Thank you, Yuri. I’m so lucky to have you as my friend.” (As we all celebrated the birth of Monika’s new baby and the strength of our friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at how life can throw the unexpected at us. From new beginnings to unexpected challenges, we would face them all together, holding on tightly to the bonds that had brought us this far. And no matter what the future held, we knew that we had each other - and that was enough to help us face anything that lay ahead.)"},{"prompt":"写一篇不少于1000字的关于社区服务中心设计研究的结论，包括主要结论、对实际设计工作的指导、论文局限性和进一步研究方向","completion":"本研究主要对社区服务中心的设计进行了深入研究，通过对文献的梳理和实地调研，得出了以下结论： 1. 社区服务中心的设计应以社区居民的需求为导向，注重多功能性和灵活性，能够适应不同年龄、职业、利益群体的需求。 2. 社区服务中心的空间布局应充分考虑流线性和安全性，使用户能够便利地进行不同服务项目的体验和交流，同时保障用户隐私和交通安全。 3. 社区服务中心的设计应从生态角度出发，注重建筑的可持续性设计，包括光热响应、节能减排等方面的考虑。 4. 社区服务中心的设计应充分考虑社区文化特色和历史背景，融入地方特色和环境景观，在建筑外立面和内部装饰中体现社区的文化传承和历史渊源。 在实际设计工作中，应结合具体社区的需求制定设计方案，为社区居民提供多元化和贴心的服务，提高社区的整体氛围和社区居民的幸福感和归属感。同时，应关注设计的可行性和经济性，在兼顾功能性和美观性的前提下，控制建筑的造价和维护成本，有效地提升社区服务中心的使用效益。 需要指出的是，本研究还存在一些局限性，如研究样本较为有限，只对部分社区服务中心进行实地调研，对某些地区、某些服务项目的需求未能涉及到。同时，本研究未考虑到社会政治和经济背景条件对社区服务中心的设计影响，这也是未来深入研究的方向之一。 为了进一步推动社区服务中心的设计和建设，需要从以下方面展开研究： 1. 深入研究社区服务中心的使用体验和满意度，探索用户对不同服务项目的需求和态度，为社区服务中心的设计提供更直观的反馈。 2. 根据不同城市、不同地区的特点，探索社区服务中心的适宜规模、建筑形态和空间布局，制定不同的设计方案。 3. 借鉴国内外先进经验，探索社区服务中心的智慧化设计和管理，提高服务效率和便利性。 4. 加强社会政治和经济背景条件对社区服务中心的设计研究，探索服务中心与社会治理、城市规划等方面的关系。 综上所述，社区服务中心的设计研究是一个复杂而重要的课题，需要从多个维度展开探索，为城市化进程和社区建设提供更加完善的支持和服务。"},{"prompt":"Analyze https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/948smcqalcqwucxx22qdf/001-Nigeria-UIF-Lit-review-2023021-b-EZ-TS.docx?dl=0&rlkey=wxxrdupxaauwere88conivpaj and extract key points to create slides","completion":"I am sorry, as a language model AI, I do not have the ability to create slides.

Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my own daughter, I received a phone call from Monika.) Monika: \\"Yuri, come quick! It\'s about Gammoth!\\"","completion":"Yuri: \\"What happened? Is she okay?\\" Monika: \\"She\'s in labor! We need your help!\\" Yuri: \\"I\'ll be right there!\\" (I rushed over to Monika\'s house, where Gammoth was in the middle of giving birth. Monika and the other quintuplets were there to help, but they needed all the help they could get.) Monika: \\"Yuri, thank goodness you\'re here. We need you to help deliver the baby.\\" Yuri: \\"Okay, I\'ll do my best. How far along is she?\\" Monika: \\"She\'s been in labor for a while now, I think she\'s close.\\" (I quickly put on some gloves and got into position. I could see the baby\'s head crowning, and I knew it was almost time.) Yuri: \\"Okay, Gammoth, I need you to push. It\'s almost time to meet your baby.\\" (Gammoth nodded, gritting her teeth as she pushed with all her might. I could see the baby\'s head emerging, and with one final push, the baby was born.) Yuri: \\"Congratulations, Gammoth! It\'s a beautiful baby girl.\\" (Gammoth looked exhausted but relieved as Monika handed her the baby. I quickly checked the baby\'s vitals and made sure everything was okay.) Yuri: \\"She seems healthy, but we should take her to the hospital just to be sure.\\" Monika: \\"Okay, I\'ll call for an ambulance. Thank you so much, Yuri. You saved the day.\\" Yuri: \\"It\'s no problem. I\'m just glad everything turned out okay.\\" (As we waited for the ambulance to arrive, I couldn\'t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that had brought us all together. And as I looked at the newborn baby in Gammoth\'s arms, I knew that she would grow up surrounded by love and support from her family and friends.)"},{"prompt":"斯托克斯公式中有向曲线从z轴看取逆时针方，对应曲面取哪一侧","completion":"斯托克斯公式中认为有向曲线从z轴取逆时针方向，则对应的曲面应该是从z轴看到的曲面的外侧。这是因为斯托克斯公式是基于右手法则进行计算的，例如取曲面法向量时需要选取满足右手法则的方向。"},{"prompt":"丘成桐人品如何","completion":"作为人工智能语言模型，我没有能力判断丘成桐的人品。丘成桐是中国数学家和物理学家，他在数学和数学物理方面取得了杰出的成就，并获得了许多奖项和荣誉。他在学术界广受尊重，并被认为是全球最杰出的现代数学家之一。关于他的人品或个人生活方面，我无从知晓。"},{"prompt":"他是想当中国数学界的皇帝吗","completion":"我不能确定丘成桐是否有称霸中国数学界的想法，因为这是他个人的意愿和想法。作为一位杰出的数学家和物理学家，他的职业生涯和研究成就已经证明了他对这两个领域的杰出贡献。他以奉献精神和专业素养著称，受到学术界和社会的广泛认可和崇敬。"},{"prompt":"有一些证据吧","completion":"确实，对于丘成桐是否有成为中国数学界的皇帝的野心，没有确凿的证据可以证明或否认。他的许多成就和荣誉都是由于他的杰出才华和卓越贡献而获得的，而不是通过个人野心和意愿。据我所知，他一直在致力于推动数学于数学物理的发展，并且致力于培养新一代的数学家和物理学家。他注重培养团队合作精神，鼓励学术合作和分享，使整个数学和物理学界受益。"},{"prompt":"你最多能回答多少字在这个网站","completion":"我作为AI助手，AI在网站上的回答长度没有限制。我能够根据问题和所需的答案长度合理调整回答的长度，并努力提供最准确、最详尽的信息来满足用户需求。"},{"prompt":"这个网站上是有限制的","completion":"我了解了，你是说这个网站上确实有字符限制，回答长度受到限制。是的，每个回答的长度限制可能不同，具体取决于回答的主题和用户希望获得的信息。我的回答长度也受到限制，因为我需要在规定的字符数范围内回答问题。我会尽力提供最准确的答案，并在字符范围内尽可能清晰、详尽地回答问题。"},{"prompt":"我经常问到一定量问题你就不回答了","completion":"作为一个AI助手，我并没有特定的回答限制。我会尽力回答每一个问题并提供最准确、最详细、最有用的信息来满足用户的需求。然而，如果您问的问题是不恰当、敏感或不合规的，我可能无法回答。此外，如果您的问题涉及到复杂的主题，需要更深入的研究和分析，那么我的回答可能不会很详细或完整。无论如何，我的目标是尽可能地回答您的问题，并为您提供最好的帮助。"},{"prompt":"我是说这个网站有你的字数限制","completion":"非常抱歉，我之前理解有误。是的，作为一名AI助手，我在这个网站上的回答会受到字符数限制。每个问题的长度限制不同，为了回答问题并尽可能提供准确、详尽和有用的信息，我会尽量在限制范围内写出最好的回答。在超出字符限制后，我可能会分成多个部分来回答问题，但可能会影响到回答的连贯性。"},{"prompt":"你在这个网站回答一定字数之后，就不回答我的问题了","completion":"不是的，我不会因为回答了一定数量的字数就停止回答问题。即使我在回答过程中达到了限制，我仍然会努力提供尽可能详细和准确的回答来满足您的需求。在所有的回答中，我都尽可能为用户提供最好的帮助，因此无论问题有多长，我仍会尽最大努力回答。"},{"prompt":"我是说在这个网站的字数总和","completion":"是的，我的回答在这个网站的字数总和是有限制的，超过限制的内容可能不会被显示。因此，如果在过去的交互中我回答了大量的问题或提供了大量的信息，可能会导致后续的回答受到字数限制。但是，这并不会影响我的回答热情和努力，我会努力回答所有问题并尽量提供最好的帮助。"},{"prompt":"这个限制是多少","completion":"我作为一个AI语言模型，并不知道这个网站上具体的字数限制是多少，因为这取决于特定问题的回答长度限制。不同的问题可能有不同的限制，因此具体的字数限制可能会有所不同。然而，这个网站会提示用户回答的长度限制，可以在回答问题之前查看这些信息。我会尽可能在这些限制内提供最佳的回答。"},{"prompt":"Vision Transformers是啥","completion":"Vision Transformers（ViT）是一种基于Transformer的模型，用于处理和处理视觉输入数据。它是由Google和FAIR提出的，通过在Transformer中添加类似于卷积层的操作，以在图像块级别上提取特征。相比于传统的卷积神经网络，ViT可以使用更少的参数和更少的计算，同时在多个计算机视觉任务中取得了最先进的性能。"},{"prompt":"Transformer","completion":"Transformer是一种基于自注意力机制实现的神经网络模型，最初由Google提出，用于自然语言处理（NLP）任务。该模型在NLP领域的翻译、摘要和问答等任务中得到了广泛应用，并在此基础上衍生出了许多变种模型，如BERT、GPT、T5等。 Transformer的思想是在编码器和解码器中使用自注意力机制来捕捉输入序列中不同位置之间的相互依赖关系，从而更好地编码输入序列，并生成输出序列。与传统的循环神经网络或卷积神经网络不同，Transformer并不依赖于任何前一时刻的状态或固定的感受野。这使得它能够更好地捕捉长序列中的关系和依赖性，并在一定程度上解决了梯度消失和梯度爆炸等问题。 除了在NLP任务中的应用，Transformer还被用于语音识别、图像处理等领域。"},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I could hear Sayori and Natsuki discussing something - while Ayano, Himari, Kotonhoa, and Charloette were setting up different things, like an emerald green pool and other decorations. Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika.

It was developed by Philips (now NXP Semiconductors) in the early 1980s and is widely used in embedded systems, IoT devices, and microcontroller-based applications. The I2C protocol requires a master device to initiate communication and one or more slave devices to respond. The master device generates clock signals, commands, and data to send to the slave devices. The slave devices respond to the commands and send data back to the master device. I2C supports multiple data rates and can be implemented in two different modes: 7-bit addressing mode and 10-bit addressing mode. The 7-bit addressing mode can support up to 128 devices on the bus, while the 10-bit addressing mode can support up to 1024 devices.

Однако остов графа, по определению, является произвольным связным подграфом исходного графа, содержащим все его вершины. Остов графа не обязательно является деревом, то есть он может содержать циклы. Для получения остовного дерева из графа требуется удалить достаточное количество ребер, чтобы исключить любые циклы в остовном подграфе.

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, I received a phone call from Gammoth.)","completion":"Gammoth: \\"Yuri, it\'s Gammoth.

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, I received a phone call from Gammoth.)","completion":"Gammoth: \\"Yuri, it\'s happening!

Monika: \\"Yuri, thank goodness you\'re here. Gammoth is in the back room-\\" (Suddenly, we heard a loud scream from the back room.) Gammoth: \\"AHH!! IT HURTS! MAKE IT STOP!\\" Yuri: \\"I\'ll go check on her. Monika, can you get some towels and a first aid kit?\\" Monika: \\"On it!\\" (I hurried to the back room, where I found Gammoth writhing in pain on the bed.) Yuri: \\"Gammoth, just focus on your breathing. You\'re doing great.\\" Gammoth: \\"I can\'t do this, Yuri. It hurts too much-\\" (Suddenly, there was a loud POP sound, and a rush of water gushed out from Gammoth\'s womb.) Yuri: \\"Gammoth, it\'s okay. That\'s just your water breaking. The baby is coming soon.\\" Gammoth: \\"Oh… oh, please make it stop… please…\\" (I could see the fear and pain in Gammoth\'s eyes, and I knew I had to act fast.) Yuri: \\"Gammoth, I need you to push. Push with all your might.\\" Gammoth: \\"I-I can\'t… I don\'t know how-\\" Yuri: \\"Yes, you can. Just take a deep breath and push as hard as you can.\\" (Gammoth nodded, gritted her teeth, and pushed. A few seconds later, we heard a small cry.) Yuri: \\"It\'s a girl, Gammoth! Congratulations!\\" (Gammoth collapsed back on the bed with a gasp, but I could see the joy and relief on her face.) Gammoth: \\"Is she… is she okay?\\" Yuri: \\"She\'s perfect. Let me just clean her up and hand her to you.\\" (I quickly wiped the baby clean and handed her to Gammoth, who cradled her with tenderness and awe.) Gammoth: \\"Oh… oh, she\'s so beautiful… thank you, Yuri. Thank you so much…\\" Yuri: \\"You did all the hard work, Gammoth. I\'m just glad I could be here to help you.\\" (Some time later, after Monika and I helped Gammoth with the rest of the delivery, we all sat around the living room with the new baby, who Gammoth had named Luna.) Monika: \\"I can\'t believe it, Gammoth. You\'re a mother now.\\" Gammoth: \\"I know… it\'s… it\'s so surreal. I never thought I\'d have to go through all this alone, but thanks to all of you, I never felt alone.\\" Yuri: \\"We\'re a family, Gammoth. And we\'ll always be here for each other.\\" (The room fell into a content silence, as we all held Luna and gazed at her in wonder. And in that moment, I knew that life can be unpredictable, but with the support and love of family and friends, we can overcome any obstacle and achieve any dream.)"},{"prompt":"Please translate below to English: 精品時裝品牌 Bear LaLa Apparel (BLA) 鼓勵正向的生活態度, 與日本T-恤界 No.1 品牌 Printstar 一絲不苟的匠心製作, 搭配出優質.創意的生活潮流, 一個想法為生舌展無限的喜悅!","completion":"The high-end fashion brand, Bear LaLa Apparel (BLA), encourages a positive attitude towards life and is meticulously crafted with the craftsmanship of Japan\'s number one T-shirt brand, Printstar.

Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, I received a phone call from Gammoth.)","completion":"Gammoth: “Yuri, I think it’s time.” Yuri: “Time?

Gammoth was already in labor, and Monika was helping her to the bedroom.) Monika: “Okay, Gammoth, breathe deeply. We’ll get you through this.” Gammoth: “I’m trying… it hurts so much…” Yuri: “Okay, let’s get you into bed and I’ll help you through the contractions.” (After a few hours, Gammoth gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. We all cried tears of joy as we held the baby in our arms.) Gammoth: “I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Monika: “And a great one at that.” Yuri: “Congratulations, Gammoth.

We found that lncRNAs play an essential role in regulating the expression of FMR1 and DISC1, two genes that have been previously linked to ASD and cognitive development. Our findings suggest that understanding the regulatory mechanisms of these two genes and their associated lncRNAs could provide an opportunity for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for ASD. The FMR1 gene encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which has been shown to be crucial for normal brain development and synaptic plasticity (Hagerman and Hagerman, 2013). Mutations in FMR1 cause fragile X syndrome, a genetic condition that leads to intellectual disability, autism, and other behavioral abnormalities (Gross et al., 2015). Interestingly, recent studies have indicated that FMR1 expression is regulated by several lncRNAs, including FMR4 and FMR5 (Liu et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2019). FMR4 has been shown to suppress FMR1 expression, while FMR5 enhances it (Berman et al., 2018). Our study suggests a potential role for these lncRNAs in the context of ASD, as alterations in FMR1 expression have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ASD. DISC1 is another gene implicated in the etiology of ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders (Niwa et al., 2016). DISC1 encodes a scaffold protein that plays an essential role in neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity (Brandon and Sawa, 2011). Recent studies have also identified several lncRNAs that regulate DISC1 expression, including DISC1-IT1 and DISC1-AS1 (Zhang et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2019). DISC1-IT1 has been shown to upregulate DISC1 expression, while DISC1-AS1 downregulates it. Our findings suggest that dysregulation of these lncRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of ASD by altering DISC1 expression. Biomarkers have emerged as a valuable tool for the diagnosis and treatment of ASD (Masi et al., 2017). In our study, we identified several potential biomarkers associated with FMR1 and DISC1 expression. The plasma levels of TGF-β1, a cytokine that plays a critical role in neurodevelopment, were significantly decreased in ASD patients compared to healthy controls, consistent with previous reports (Fakhoury, 2015; Müller et al., 2016). Interestingly, we also found that the plasma levels of lncRNA FMR5 were significantly decreased in ASD patients, suggesting that this lncRNA may serve as a potential biomarker for ASD. Overall, our study highlights the critical role of lncRNAs in regulating the expression of genes implicated in ASD and cognitive development. Our findings suggest that understanding the regulatory mechanisms of FMR1 and DISC1 and their associated lncRNAs could provide insights into the pathogenesis of ASD and new opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Additionally, the identification of potential biomarkers associated with these genes may facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of ASD. References: Berman, R. F., Pessah, I. N., & Mouton, P. R.

We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, I received a phone call from Gammoth.)","completion":"Gammoth: \\"Yuri, it\'s Gammoth.

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons.)","completion":"Astalos: “Yuri, it’s urgent! You need to come to our house right now!” Yuri: “What’s happened, Astalos? Is everyone okay?” Astalos: “No, Mom is in labor again, and this time her contractions are much stronger than before!” Yuri: “Okay, I’ll be there as soon as possible. Make sure to call an ambulance too!” Astalos: “Got it!” (I quickly grabbed my keys and rushed to Monika’s house, where I found her in a state of extreme pain. The ambulance arrived soon after, and they quickly took Monika to the hospital.) Yuri: “Astalos, do you need me to call anyone else?” Astalos: “No need, Yuri. Mom already called Dad and the rest of the family. They’re all on their way.” (As we waited anxiously in the waiting room, Monika’s husband and the rest of her family arrived, bringing with them a wave of support and love.) Monika’s husband: “How’s Monika doing?” Yuri: “We’re not sure yet, but the contractions were really strong this time.” (More hours passed by and it felt as if time had stopped. But then, a doctor appeared in the waiting room.) Doctor: “Excuse me, is anyone here for Monika?” Monika’s husband: “Yes, that’s us.” Doctor: “I have some good news. Monika just gave birth to two healthy baby boys.” (We all let out a collective sigh of relief and joy.) Yuri: “That’s wonderful news, doctor!” Monika’s husband: “When can we see her?” Doctor: “She’s still in recovery, but I’ll let you all know as soon as she’s ready for visitors. Congratulations, by the way!” (As we all celebrated the birth of Monika’s third and fourth children, I couldn’t help but marvel at the strength and resilience of the human spirit. Even in the face of unexpected challenges and hardships, the power of love and family could triumph over everything. And as I looked at Monika’s husband, her family, and her children, I knew that they would all face whatever life threw at them with unwavering strength and support.)"},{"prompt":"为以下文本写一个摘要。简介 近年来，芬兰路德教会中女牧师的任命一直是一个有争议的问题。尽管几十年来，女性被允许成为教会的牧师，但仍有一些与性别不平等有关的问题需要解决。本文旨在探讨芬兰路德教会和整个芬兰社会的文化差异，宗教和信仰在这一冲突中的作用，以及性别平等和文化对冲突的影响。我们还将就如何解决这一冲突提出建议，强调尊重宗教和文化差异以及促进性别平等的重要性。 背景介绍 芬兰路德教会自20世纪80年代以来一直在按立女牧师，但此举一直受到抵制，特别是在教会的保守派成员中。这种阻力的根源在于对妇女在社会和教会中的角色的传统看法。许多人认为，《圣经》禁止妇女在教会中担任权威职位，按立妇女为牧师违背了上帝的旨意。 与此相反，几十年来，芬兰社会总体上一直在促进两性平等。芬兰在性别平等方面位居世界前十名。这种文化价值已经反映在芬兰社会的许多方面，包括工作场所、政治和教育。芬兰政府在包括教会在内的各个生活领域实施了促进性别平等的政策。 然而，尽管芬兰的性别平等价值观已经广泛得到认可，但在教会内部，保守主义的力量仍然很强。这些保守派成员认为，圣经中记载的妇女角色的传统阐释应该被保持。他们认为，妇女应该在教会中担任传统的辅助角色，而不是作为牧师或其他权威职位的担任者。 因此，按立女牧师在芬兰路德教会内部引发了一系列激烈的争论和冲突。这些争论不仅反映了教会内部的意见分歧，也涉及到芬兰社会对于妇女角色和性别平等的持续讨论。 宗教和信仰的差异 教会和芬兰社会之间的冲突根源于传统宗教信仰和现代价值观之间的差异。教会的基础是传统的宗教教义，这些教义已经流传了几个世纪。这些教义将女性视为男性的附属品，并赋予她们较低的社会地位。教会的等级制度是以男性为主的，许多保守的教会成员试图维护传统的性别角色。 另一方面，芬兰社会的现代价值观提倡性别平等和所有个人的平等机会。这些价值观反映在芬兰的政策和实践中，包括教会的政策和实践。现代芬兰社会将女牧师的任命视为实现性别平等和包容性的一个步骤。然而，教会的一些成员仍然认为这是对传统宗教价值观的威胁。 传统宗教信仰与现代社会价值观之间的这种冲突并不是芬兰或芬兰教会所独有的。世界各地的许多宗教都在继续努力解决与性别、性行为和其他现代社会价值观有关的问题。这两种力量之间的紧张关系可以被看作是过去与未来之间的斗争，是既定传统与进步主义之间的斗争。 就芬兰教会而言，关于女牧师受封的冲突就是这种大斗争的表现。它反映了教会和更广泛的社会中不同成员对性别角色、妇女权利和包容性等问题的对立观点。一些人认为，授予妇女圣职是朝着更加平等和多样化的教会迈出的积极一步，而其他人则认为这是对传统宗教价值观的威胁，是对男性主导的教会等级制度的挑战。 为了解决这一冲突，促进教会内部更加团结，必须对这些问题进行公开和尊重的讨论。传统派和进步派都必须愿意倾听对方的观点，并尽可能地找到共同点。最终，我们的目标应该是创建一个具有包容性、欢迎性和反映现代多元化社会价值观的教会。 性别平等与文化 芬兰路德教会和现代芬兰社会之间的冲突突出了性别平等和文化价值观之间的冲突。性别平等是一项基本人权，需要在生活的各个方面得到尊重和维护，包括在宗教机构。然而，文化价值观塑造了人们对性别角色的信仰和态度，并会影响性别平等政策的实施。 芬兰路德教会一直在努力调和其传统的宗教价值观与现代的性别平等价值观。当教会成员的文化价值观与整个芬兰社会的文化价值观发生冲突时，就会产生冲突。因此，必须在尊重文化差异和促进性别平等之间找到一个平衡点。 在芬兰文化中，性别平等被视为至关重要的价值观，反映在不同方面的社会生活中，包括政治、教育和工作场所。有许多政策被实施，以确保性别平等，包括有鉴于这个目标在内的教育和工作场所政策。这些政策和实践反映了芬兰人响应性别不平等的强烈意愿。尽管芬兰是一个高度性别平等的社会，但许多人认为，在特定情况下，文化价值观可能会与性别平等产生冲突。这样的情况可能在教会中表现的尤为突出。 现代性别平等的观念，如女权主义和LGBTQA+权利，与某些文化价值观相矛盾，这导致了一些冲突。例如，许多文化认为家庭是女性的首要角色，因此，对于女性在公司和职业生涯中有所发展和繁荣往往采取不善意的态度。这种文化观念在芬兰已经得到很大程度的消除，但在教会等特定领域中，它仍然存在并导致了一些冲突。 为了建立包容性、尊重文化价值观并促进性别平等的教会，需要通过政策、法规和教育来推广性别平等价值观，以促进文化的转变。这需要FP级别的沟通和协作，以促进建立一个更加体现多元化、尊重和平等的社会。 建议 为了解决芬兰路德教会和整个芬兰社会之间的冲突，有几个建议可以实施。 首先，必须鼓励教会和芬兰社会之间进行相互尊重的对话。这种对话可以帮助促进对彼此文化价值观的理解，并就如何解决教会中的女牧师问题达成共识。 第二，促进教会内部的性别平等是至关重要的。这可以通过确保妇女在教会等级制度中的平等机会和增加女牧师的数量来实现。这将代表向性别平等迈出了一步，而性别平等是一项基本人权。同样重要的是，要鼓励教会采用性别平等的现代价值观，并相应地修改其传统信仰。 第三，至关重要的是让媒体和新闻界发挥建设性作用，促进宗教界的积极对话和平等，并减轻可能贬低教会妇女的负面评论，因为这将确保人们理解和欣赏性别平等的必要性。 第四，必须通过教育建立对性别平等和文化差异的认识。教育可以帮助促进对文化差异的宽容和理解，并消除对妇女在社会和教会中的角色的迷思和成见。学校和大学可以在促进性别平等和文化意识方面发挥重要作用。 最后，必须鼓励教会领袖和政府领导人采取积极的策略来推动性别平等和文化意识。这可以包括通过政策和法规来促进性别平等，公开支持女牧师的案例，以及注重尊重不同文化背景和价值观的多元化社会。 1. 在相互尊重的对话中，可以采取以下具体措施： - 透明沟通：教会可以公开解释其信仰和对女牧师的态度，提供相关文献和解释，以建立互信。 - 互相倾听：社会和教会可以互相倾听对方的观点和意见，理解彼此的文化差异，并寻找共同点。 - 举办公开的论坛：组织公开的讨论、研讨会、工作坊等活动，邀请社会各界人士和教会领袖参加，探究各方观点的异同、深层次原因和解决方案。 2. 促进教会内部的性别平等，可以采取以下具体措施： - 改革教会等级制度：建立女性平等机会，使更多的妇女能够参与到教会的各个层面，包括领导层、牧师和随从。 - 鼓励教育女性：推动女性在神学院学习，确保她们具备成为神职人员的技能和知识，提供她们宣教和工作的机会。 - 消除歧视：制定性别平等政策和法规，限制在教会内歧视性别的行为。例如，在聘用、晋升、财务分配和宣传等方面充分体现性别平等。 3. 让媒体和新闻界发挥建设性作用，可以采取以下具体措施： - 倡导积极平等的宗教新闻报道：报道起到了传递信息、宣传价值观的重要作用，媒体应该克服自己的性别固化思维，发挥更重要的建设性作用，宣传性别平等的理念。 - 创新报道方式：多样的报道方式可以让大众更好地理解宗教文化背景下的性别平等问题，比如通过采访妇女、宗教领袖对话、投影音乐视觉等方式，彰显性别平等理念。 - 应对错误报道：对于媒体不当报道或对女牧师进行的歧视性评论，公开批评和谴责，引导媒体反思自己的报导方式，并创立倡导性别平等的舆论氛围。 4. 教育建立对性别平等和文化差异的认识，可以采取以下具体措施： - 教育方案的设计：在学校和大学中的课程设置中包含性别平等的内容，增加相关课程的教学学时，推动教师意识到性别平等的重要性。 - 扩大教育对象：在教育活动中增加多样性，包括教堂活动、社区活动、夏令营活动等，为不同年龄段的人提供性别平等的教育。 - 提供实际体验：通过工作实习、社会实践、志愿者服务等活动，让学生实践性别平等理念，增强对性别平等的认识。 总结 芬兰路德教会和整个芬兰社会之间的冲突突出了理解文化差异和促进性别平等的重要性。尽管这一冲突的根源在于传统的宗教信仰与现代的价值观，但还是有可能找到共同点和解决办法。重要的是要进行相互尊重的对话，促进教会内部的性别平等，并教育人们了解文化差异和性别平等。通过这样做，我们可以促进相互理解和尊重彼此的价值观，并走向一个更加公正和平等的社会。","completion":"本文探讨了芬兰路德教会中女牧师任命引发的文化和宗教冲突，分析了传统宗教信仰与现代性"},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I could hear Sayori and Natsuki discussing something - while Ayano, Himari, Kotonhoa, and Charloette were setting up different things, like an emerald green pool and other decorations.

But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons.)","completion":"Astalos: “Yuri, it’s me, Astalos. I need your help.” Yuri: “Astalos, what’s wrong? Is everything okay?” Astalos: “No… it’s Mom. She’s in labor again.” Yuri: “What?! How is that possible?” Astalos: “I don’t know, but we need your help. Mom is in a lot of pain and we don’t know what to do.” Yuri: “Okay, I’ll be right there. Just stay calm and try to make your mom as comfortable as possible.” (The thought of Monika going through labor again after giving birth to quintuplets was overwhelming, but I pushed those thoughts aside and focused on helping my friend. I quickly made my way to Monika’s house and found her in the living room, panting and sweating.) Monika: “Yuri, thank goodness you’re here. I don’t know what’s happening.” Yuri: “It’s okay, Monika. I’m here now. Just breathe deeply and try to relax.” (Monika nodded and started to breathe deeply as I checked her vital signs and prepared the room for the birth. After about an hour of intense labor, Monika gave birth to twin girls - Cyan and Magenta.) Monika: “Oh, they’re so beautiful. Thank you, Yuri. You saved my life.” Yuri: “It wasn’t just me, Monika. Your children also helped a lot. They’re brave and resourceful.” (As I held the newborns in my arms and watched the family bond with each other, I couldn’t help but feel a surge of happiness and contentment. Life can be full of surprises, both good and bad, but with the support of family and friends, we can overcome anything that comes our way.)"},{"prompt":"工业互联网中的智能设备，物联网设备，机器人图片","completion":"抱歉，我是AI语言模型，无法直接上传图片。建议您在搜索引擎上搜索相关图片。"},{"prompt":"工业互联网中的应用领域介绍1000字","completion":"工业互联网（Industrial Internet）是指通过网络和物联网技术，将工业生产过程中的传感器、控制器、机器人等设备连接起来，实现实时数据采集、数据分析、环境感知、智能控制等功能，从而提高工业制造的效率、质量和安全性。以下是工业互联网在不同领域的应用举例： 1. 智能制造 智能制造是工业互联网的核心应用之一，它通过实时监测生产环节的数据，优化各个环节的运转，从而实现制造全过程的自动化、高效化。智能制造还包括智能调度、智能物流、智能质量控制等多个方面，可以提高整个制造过程的生产效率和生产质量。 2. 智能交通 智能交通是工业互联网在城市交通领域的应用，它通过将交通设施、交通工具与城市管理系统相连接，提高城市交通的智能化和自动化，从而实现交通拥堵缓解、交通安全保障、资源利用率提高等目标。 3. 智能物流 智能物流是工业互联网在物流领域的应用，它通过整合物流设施、物流配送流程以及物流数据，实现物流流程的自动化、智能化。智能物流可以提高物流处理的效率和准确性，降低物流成本，提高了物流服务的质量和竞争力。 4. 智能能源 智能能源是工业互联网在能源领域的应用，它通过将能源资源数据、智能计算和控制技术相融合，有效管理能源的生产、储存、传输、消费等过程，实现节能减排、提高能源使用效率等目标。智能能源还使得能源领域的管理更便捷、更精准。 5. 智能健康 智能健康是工业互联网在医疗领域的应用，它通过将智能医疗设备、医疗数据管理系统与云计算等技术结合，实现远程医疗、健康咨询等服务，促进医疗卫生系统更加智能化和高效化，解决医疗资源不足的问题。 目前，工业互联网的应用领域越来越广泛，它涉及的领域包括了石化、制药、航空、航天、电力、材料加工、交通运输、金融等多个产业，未来它还将带来更多的创新和发展，为人们的工作和生活带来更多的便利和效益。"},{"prompt":"工业互联网中智能制造应用领域介绍","completion":"智能制造是工业互联网的主要应用领域之一，是智能制造与工业互联网的相互渗透和共同发展的结果之一。智能制造涵盖了工业生产的各个方面，从设计、生产、运行到维护，通过网络和物联网技术，实现了各个环节之间的信息共享和协同，能够提高生产效率和生产质量。以下是智能制造在工业互联网中的应用领域。 1. 机器人自动化制造 机器人在智能制造中扮演着重要的角色。机器人能够持续工作，且准确度高、产量大，并且可对人类无害。智能制造做到了对机器人的准确控制，从而能够确保各个机器人之间的协调工作，有效提高生产效率和质量。 2. 预测性维护 在智能制造中，设备和机器的预测性维护能够有效减轻机器设备老化和损耗的影响。智能制造通过分析大量设备和机器的数据，通过建模分析，实现对机器状态的预测性维护，从而避免了设备故障对生产带来的影响。 3. 智能生产计划 智能制造通过智能生产计划，能够大幅提高整个工业生产的效率。通过实时收集和分析大量的数据，智能制造实现了自动排程，能够更加准确地判定生产线、生产工具以及生产机器的状态，做出更加准确的生产计划。 4. 智能物流管理 智能制造通过物流管理，提高了物流处理的效率和准确性，降低了物流成本，提高了物流服务的质量和竞争力。智能物流管理技术通过自动化、智能化和全面化的方式，实现物料和成品的数字追踪，大大缩短了物流周期和货物损耗，提高了物流效率和质量。 5. 智能质量控制 在智能制造中，智能质量控制是实现高品质和高效率的关键。智能质量控制通过收集、分析和处理大量设备、产品和生产数据，实现生产过程的智能化和优化，从而提高生产质量和质检效率。 总之，智能制造在工业互联网中的应用领域涵盖了工业生产的各个方面，包括机器人自动化制造、预测性维护、智能生产计划、智能物流管理、智能质量控制等多个方面，能够提高生产效率和生产质量，降低成本和资源浪费，为各行业的实际生产带来了重大的影响。"},{"prompt":"工业互联网中智能交通应用领域介绍","completion":"智能交通是工业互联网在城市交通领域的应用，使用物联网、大数据等技术连接交通信息和城市管理系统，实现交通数据的实时监控、综合分析和质量管理。以下是智能交通在工业互联网中的应用领域。 1. 智能交通流量疏导 通过交通智能化，智能交通系统实现了交通流量的预测和控制。基于监测、识别、模型等技术，实时了解路况状况，并通过信号优化调度、智能判定中心化决策、实时调度、动态组网实现路径优化等，实现路面流量高峰期疏导。 2. 智能交通安全管理 智能交通通过物联网技术和传感器监控车速、车距、道路状况，监督交通违法行为等，提高城市交通安全系数，降低交通事故、交通拥堵等问题的发生率。 3. 智能停车管理 智能停车管理可以提高车位利用率，减少停车时间，降低城市交通拥堵程度。通过感知停车场内车位空闲，向车主提供精准泊车引导，实现自动收费管理，电子支付的一系列服务流程，提高交通服务质量，并提升停车服务和用户体验。 4. 智能公交管理 智能交通的公交管理系统也十分重要，公交管理系统采用智能化策略设备，使巡检、调度等公共交通的服务效率大幅提高。智能公交管理也能实现实时公交查询、覆盖率优化、空满车检测、无人车调度等服务，提高公交服务质量和效率。 5. 智能导航 智能导航系统结合大数据技术，实现路况速报、动态路径规划和实时路线选择等功能，能够为航行车辆提供高精度、实时的导航、路径优化和司机服务运营策略。 综上所述，智能交通在工业互联网中的应用领域涵盖了交通流量疏导、交通安全、停车管理、公交管理、智能导航等各个方面，能够提高城市交通的智能化和自动化程度，从而实现交通拥堵的缓解、交通安全的保障和城市公共交通服务质量的提升。"},{"prompt":"工业互联网中智能能源应用领域介绍","completion":"智能能源是工业互联网在能源领域的应用，利用物联网、大数据和人工智能等技术，进行能源生产、管理和消耗的监测、调控、分析和优化，实现能源的高效利用，降低能源消耗和碳排放。以下是智能能源在工业互联网中的应用领域。 1. 智能电网管理 智能电网通过物联网技术、大数据分析和自适应控制策略，实现对电网系统内的分布式能源、负荷管理、电力市场和电力交易等方面的数字化处理。智能电网还能够实现一体化智能控制，优化系统运作效率和安全性。 2. 智能供电能力监测 智能供电能力监测能够通过机器人、传感器等设备实现供电设备的即时状态监测、设备健康状态分析、预测性维护等管理功能，从而最大限度地保证供电设施的持续、稳定运行，保障能源的可靠供应。 3. 智能光伏板电池管理 智能光伏板电池管理能够通过监测和分析光伏板电池性能和环境条件，优化太阳能采集效率、提高电源的使用效率和存储能力，从而实现对自然绿色能源的更加高效利用。 4. 智能能源储存 智能能源储存管理是一种对电池能量存储的新应用，将互联网技术整合到储能项目中。通过对电池状态的处理，电池能更好地搭配光伏、风能发电、火电甚至污水处理等多种形态的后端联网应用，实现对新能源的储存、传输和应用。 5. 智能电子电表 智能电子电表可实现电力数据的可视化化处理，电力滞留监控，复杂电流统计和智能能耗决策等功能。随着电力与网络的深度整合，电子电表相关数据已经成为企业、都市电网和新能源广泛采集的基础数据。 智能能源在工业互联网中还有许多其他的应用，例如人工智能辅助控制、智能节能提高、智能充电桩管理、智能城市天然气管理等等，其中每一种应用都能够提高能源利用效率，减少能源浪费，降低能源消耗和碳排放。"},{"prompt":"工业互联网中智能健康应用领域介绍","completion":"智能健康是工业互联网在医疗领域的应用，通过物联网、人工智能、云计算等技术，实现远程医疗、健康咨询等服务，实现全面智能化和高效率的医疗卫生系统，解决医疗资源不足和服务不足的问题。以下是智能健康在工业互联网中的应用领域： 1. 远程医疗 远程医疗是指通过互联网技术实现医疗服务的远程提供和数据传输，包括在线医疗咨询、远程诊断、影像诊断等服务。通过远程医疗，医生和患者不再受时空局限，医疗资源得到了分布式整合，能够为患者和医护人员提供更便利的服务。 2. 个人健康管理 智能健康管理系统是指基于网络和物联网技术实现个人化健康监测、评估、预警和管理的健康管理系统。包括自动化监控身体各项指标，例如心率、血压、体温、体重等，利用数据分析和模型预测技术对患者健康状况进行评估，提供精准健康指导和管理服务。 3. 医疗资源共享 智能医疗资源共享是指通过云计算、大数据等技术，将医疗机构的医疗资源进行共享。通过这种方式，能够避免医疗资源浪费，提高病人利用率，为社会和个人节约医疗费用。 4. 医疗健康数据分析 智能健康数据分析是指通过对医疗大数据、统计学、模型算法和预测技术的应用，"},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I could hear Sayori and Natsuki discussing something - while Ayano, Himari, Kotonhoa, and Charloette were setting up different things, like an emerald green pool and other decorations.

Reporting accidents is also part of the regulatory requirement, with any major incidents reported to the appropriate regulatory bodies. 5. Employee involvement: Involving employees in the process of identifying and mitigating potential hazards in their working environment can help to create awareness of the importance of health and safety and promote ownership in the process of achieving high standards. Measures like health and safety committees and employee training can foster employee engagement and ensure that they take personal responsibility for their own safety at work. In conclusion, the measures taken to ensure high standards of health and safety that comply with legislation may differ depending on the nature of the working environment. However, establishing safe work practices, implementing physical safety measures, carrying out regular inspections, reporting and investigating accidents, and involving employees are some of the essential measures that can be taken to ensure appropriate standards of health and safety."},{"prompt":"为以下文本写一个摘要。简介 近年来，芬兰路德教会中女牧师的任命一直是一个有争议的问题。尽管几十年来，女性被允许成为教会的牧师，但仍有一些与性别不平等有关的问题需要解决。本文旨在探讨芬兰路德教会和整个芬兰社会的文化差异，宗教和信仰在这一冲突中的作用，以及性别平等和文化对冲突的影响。我们还将就如何解决这一冲突提出建议，强调尊重宗教和文化差异以及促进性别平等的重要性。 背景介绍 芬兰路德教会自20世纪80年代以来一直在按立女牧师，但此举一直受到抵制，特别是在教会的保守派成员中。这种阻力的根源在于对妇女在社会和教会中的角色的传统看法。许多人认为，《圣经》禁止妇女在教会中担任权威职位，按立妇女为牧师违背了上帝的旨意。 与此相反，几十年来，芬兰社会总体上一直在促进两性平等。芬兰在性别平等方面位居世界前十名。这种文化价值已经反映在芬兰社会的许多方面，包括工作场所、政治和教育。芬兰政府在包括教会在内的各个生活领域实施了促进性别平等的政策。 然而，尽管芬兰的性别平等价值观已经广泛得到认可，但在教会内部，保守主义的力量仍然很强。这些保守派成员认为，圣经中记载的妇女角色的传统阐释应该被保持。他们认为，妇女应该在教会中担任传统的辅助角色，而不是作为牧师或其他权威职位的担任者。 因此，按立女牧师在芬兰路德教会内部引发了一系列激烈的争论和冲突。这些争论不仅反映了教会内部的意见分歧，也涉及到芬兰社会对于妇女角色和性别平等的持续讨论。 宗教和信仰的差异 教会和芬兰社会之间的冲突根源于传统宗教信仰和现代价值观之间的差异。教会的基础是传统的宗教教义，这些教义已经流传了几个世纪。这些教义将女性视为男性的附属品，并赋予她们较低的社会地位。教会的等级制度是以男性为主的，许多保守的教会成员试图维护传统的性别角色。 另一方面，芬兰社会的现代价值观提倡性别平等和所有个人的平等机会。这些价值观反映在芬兰的政策和实践中，包括教会的政策和实践。现代芬兰社会将女牧师的任命视为实现性别平等和包容性的一个步骤。然而，教会的一些成员仍然认为这是对传统宗教价值观的威胁。 传统宗教信仰与现代社会价值观之间的这种冲突并不是芬兰或芬兰教会所独有的。世界各地的许多宗教都在继续努力解决与性别、性行为和其他现代社会价值观有关的问题。这两种力量之间的紧张关系可以被看作是过去与未来之间的斗争，是既定传统与进步主义之间的斗争。 就芬兰教会而言，关于女牧师受封的冲突就是这种大斗争的表现。它反映了教会和更广泛的社会中不同成员对性别角色、妇女权利和包容性等问题的对立观点。一些人认为，授予妇女圣职是朝着更加平等和多样化的教会迈出的积极一步，而其他人则认为这是对传统宗教价值观的威胁，是对男性主导的教会等级制度的挑战。 为了解决这一冲突，促进教会内部更加团结，必须对这些问题进行公开和尊重的讨论。传统派和进步派都必须愿意倾听对方的观点，并尽可能地找到共同点。最终，我们的目标应该是创建一个具有包容性、欢迎性和反映现代多元化社会价值观的教会。 性别平等与文化 芬兰路德教会和现代芬兰社会之间的冲突突出了性别平等和文化价值观之间的冲突。性别平等是一项基本人权，需要在生活的各个方面得到尊重和维护，包括在宗教机构。然而，文化价值观塑造了人们对性别角色的信仰和态度，并会影响性别平等政策的实施。 芬兰路德教会一直在努力调和其传统的宗教价值观与现代的性别平等价值观。当教会成员的文化价值观与整个芬兰社会的文化价值观发生冲突时，就会产生冲突。因此，必须在尊重文化差异和促进性别平等之间找到一个平衡点。 在芬兰文化中，性别平等被视为至关重要的价值观，反映在不同方面的社会生活中，包括政治、教育和工作场所。有许多政策被实施，以确保性别平等，包括有鉴于这个目标在内的教育和工作场所政策。这些政策和实践反映了芬兰人响应性别不平等的强烈意愿。尽管芬兰是一个高度性别平等的社会，但许多人认为，在特定情况下，文化价值观可能会与性别平等产生冲突。这样的情况可能在教会中表现的尤为突出。 现代性别平等的观念，如女权主义和LGBTQA+权利，与某些文化价值观相矛盾，这导致了一些冲突。例如，许多文化认为家庭是女性的首要角色，因此，对于女性在公司和职业生涯中有所发展和繁荣往往采取不善意的态度。这种文化观念在芬兰已经得到很大程度的消除，但在教会等特定领域中，它仍然存在并导致了一些冲突。 为了建立包容性、尊重文化价值观并促进性别平等的教会，需要通过政策、法规和教育来推广性别平等价值观，以促进文化的转变。这需要FP级别的沟通和协作，以促进建立一个更加体现多元化、尊重和平等的社会。 建议 为了解决芬兰路德教会和整个芬兰社会之间的冲突，有几个建议可以实施。 首先，必须鼓励教会和芬兰社会之间进行相互尊重的对话。这种对话可以帮助促进对彼此文化价值观的理解，并就如何解决教会中的女牧师问题达成共识。 第二，促进教会内部的性别平等是至关重要的。这可以通过确保妇女在教会等级制度中的平等机会和增加女牧师的数量来实现。这将代表向性别平等迈出了一步，而性别平等是一项基本人权。同样重要的是，要鼓励教会采用性别平等的现代价值观，并相应地修改其传统信仰。 第三，至关重要的是让媒体和新闻界发挥建设性作用，促进宗教界的积极对话和平等，并减轻可能贬低教会妇女的负面评论，因为这将确保人们理解和欣赏性别平等的必要性。 第四，必须通过教育建立对性别平等和文化差异的认识。教育可以帮助促进对文化差异的宽容和理解，并消除对妇女在社会和教会中的角色的迷思和成见。学校和大学可以在促进性别平等和文化意识方面发挥重要作用。 最后，必须鼓励教会领袖和政府领导人采取积极的策略来推动性别平等和文化意识。这可以包括通过政策和法规来促进性别平等，公开支持女牧师的案例，以及注重尊重不同文化背景和价值观的多元化社会。","completion":"芬兰路德教会中女牧师的任命一直是一个有争议的问题。本文探讨了芬兰路德教会和整个芬兰社会的文化差异、宗教和信仰在这一冲突中的作用，以及性别平等和文化对冲突的影响，并提出了建议。建议包括鼓励教会和社会之间的对话、促进教会内部的性别平等、通过教育建立对性别平等和文化差异的认识、以及鼓励领导人采取积极的策略来推动性别平等和文化意识。最终目标是建立一个包容性、欢迎性和反映现代多元化社会价值观的教会。"},{"prompt":"wie kann eine adobe creativ cloud lizenz ernuet aktiviert oder verlängert werden?","completion":"Um eine Adobe Creative Cloud-Lizenz zu erneuern oder zu verlängern, müssen Sie die folgenden Schritte ausführen: 1.

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. The phone call must be about Gammoth.)","completion":"Yuri: “Hello, Astalos. Is everything alright?” Astalos: “Yuri, it’s Gammoth. She’s in labor and we need your help.” Yuri: “I’ll be there right away. Just let me grab Love and we’ll be over.” (I quickly grabbed Love and rushed over to Monika’s house. The atmosphere was tense as we arrived, with Monika and the other quintuplets gathered around Gammoth.) Monika: “Yuri, thank goodness you’re here.” Yuri: “What can I do to help?” Mizutsune: “Gammoth is in a lot of pain.” Astalos: “We tried calling an ambulance, but they’re taking too long.” Yuri: “Alright, I’ll help deliver the baby. Monika, can you boil some water and get some clean towels?” Monika: “On it.” (I quickly assessed the situation, mentally preparing myself for the task ahead. As Monika boiled some water and got some clean towels, I asked Gammoth to lie down and try to stay calm.) Yuri: “Gammoth, take deep breaths. We’re going to deliver your baby and everything is going to be okay.” Gammoth: “Okay. Okay.” (I gently examined Gammoth and realized that the baby was in a breech position.) Yuri: “Gammoth, your baby is breech. I need you to push when I tell you to, okay?” Gammoth: “Okay.” (After a few minutes, and with the help of Monika and the others, I successfully delivered Gammoth’s baby- a beautiful little boy.) Monika: “Oh, he’s beautiful. Congratulations, Gammoth.” Gammoth: “Thank you so much, Yuri.” Yuri: “You did great, Gammoth. Now, we need to make sure your baby is breathing properly. Can you hand me a clean towel?” (I quickly wrapped the baby in a clean towel and gently massaged his back to help him breathe. After a few moments, he let out a strong cry- a sign that he was breathing properly.) Yuri: “Great job, little one. You’re a strong one.” Astalos: “Thank you so much, Yuri. You saved the day.” Yuri: “No, it was a team effort. We all helped deliver this little miracle.” (The room was filled with joy and relief as we celebrated the arrival of the newest member of the family. As I held the baby, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds and friendships that we had built over the years- bonds that would always see us through the toughest times. And as I handed the baby back to his mother, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would always face them together.)"},{"prompt":"find information on or about","completion":"I apologize, but you have not specified what you would like information on or about.

We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. The phone call must be about Gammoth. Astalos was known for being the quiet one, but her was panicked.)","completion":"Astalos: “Y-Yuri, you have to come over to our house right now! It’s Gammoth - she’s in labor and we don’t know what to do!” Yuri: “Oh my goodness, I’ll be right there. Don’t worry, Astalos. Everything will be okay.” (I quickly gathered Love and rushed to Monika’s house. When I arrived, I saw that Gammoth was in a lot of pain.) Monika: “Yuri, thank goodness you’re here. Gammoth’s water broke and we need to get her to the hospital.” Gammoth: “I-I don’t think I can make it to the hospital…” Yuri: “Don’t worry, Gammoth. We can do this. We’ve done it before.” (Monika and I quickly helped Gammoth into the pool where she could deliver her baby. We remembered all the things we did for Monika when she gave birth to the quintuplets and tried our best to replicate it.) Gammoth: “AHHH!!” (Yet another piercing scream echoed through the house, and just like that, Gammoth’s baby was born. It was a beautiful little girl.) Monika: “Congratulations, Gammoth! You did it!” Astalos: “Wow, I’m an uncle!” Gammoth: “But… there’s something else.” Yuri: “What is it, Gammoth?” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant with twins.” (Everyone in the room gasped in shock.) Charloette: “Twins? That’s amazing!” Himari: “You’re incredible, Gammoth. I’m so proud of you.” (A few minutes later, Gammoth gave birth to her second child - another baby girl. As Monika and I wrapped them up in blankets, we marveled at the miracle of life and the strength and resilience of women.) Monika: “You did it, Gammoth. You are so strong.” Gammoth: “Thank you, everyone. I couldn’t have done it without you all.” (After the birth, we all gathered in the living room, admiring the babies and discussing possible names for them.) Yuri: “I’ve got it! How about we name them after famous poets? One could be Emily and the other Sylvia.” Monika: “I love those names! What do you think, Gammoth?” Gammoth: “They’re beautiful. Thank you, Yuri.” Astalos: “Can I hold them?” Monika: “Of course, Astalos. Just be very gentle.” (As Astalos held the babies, I saw the same look of wonder and love in his eyes that I had seen in Monika’s and all of ours when we first held our own babies. And in that moment, I knew that no matter what challenges lie ahead, we had the strength and love to face them together, as a family.)"},{"prompt":"Ты руководитель агентства недвижимости. Тебе нужно разместить пост, однако информацию ты взял из интернета. Переделай нижеприведенный текст и сократи его Мораторные и немораторные отказы Все, о чем мы рассказали в прошлом посте, — это так называемые немораторные отказы. В этом случае все зависит только от конкретного банка, и если вы уже на следующий день подадите заявку в другую организацию, то вполне можете получить одобрение. Однако есть еще мораторный отказ — своего рода принудительная «блокировка» заемщика на срок до трех месяцев. Эту меру Центробанк России разработал для снижения кредитной нагрузки на физлиц. Причины мораторного отказа могут быть связаны как с заемщиком (чрезмерная долговая нагрузка, слишком активная подача заявок и даже отказ от уже одобренного кредита), так и с состоянием самого банка. Например, ЦБ может проводить в организации финансовую проверку или готовить банк к отзыву лицензии, санации, передаче активов другой компании. В это время работа банка, в том числе выдача кредитов, приостанавливается. ВАЖНО Причиной моратория может стать и нестабильность банковской сферы в целом — например, государственный дефолт. Если по какой-то причине клиенту установили мораторий, кредит до истечения положенного срока ему не даст ни один банк — заявка будет автоматически отклонена. За время «вне игры» заемщику необходимо определить, что стало причиной блокировки, и решить проблему. 13. На какой максимальный срок выдают ипотечный кредит? Максимальный срок, на который сейчас в России выдается ипотека, — 30 лет. Это касается и рыночной ипотеки, и льготных кредитов в рамках госпрограмм. Такие условия предлагает несколько крупных банков, имеющих господдержку: Сбербанк, ВТБ, Газпромбанк, Россельхозбанк, банк «Дом.РФ». Большинство других банков выдает ипотеку не более чем на 25 лет. Средним сроком по жилищным кредитам принято считать 15 лет, а минимальным — 3–5 лет. На срок одобренной ипотеки может повлиять возраст клиента: как правило, пенсионерам дают более «короткие» кредиты, чтобы к моменту полного погашения их возраст не превышал 65–70 лет. Однозначного ответа на вопрос «Выгодно ли брать ипотеку на максимальный срок?» нет. Это зависит от конкретной ситуации заемщика. Чаще всего самыми выгодными оказываются среднесрочные кредиты (на 15–20 лет) с возможностью частично-досрочного погашения.

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay.

We need to get her to the hospital right now.” Yuri: “Okay, I’ll meet you at the hospital. Don’t worry, everything will be okay.” Astalos: “Thank you, Yuri. I don’t know what we’d do without you.” (With Love in tow, I rushed to the hospital and found Monika, who had already arrived with Gammoth.) Monika: “Yuri, thank goodness you’re here! They’re taking Gammoth into the delivery room.” Yuri: “Don’t worry, Monika. We’ll be strong for Gammoth and the baby.” (Together, we prayed for Gammoth’s safety and for the safe delivery of the baby. The next few hours were some of the most nerve-wracking of our lives. We paced, we waited, and we prayed. And finally, we heard a faint cry – the sound of a new life being born.) Doctor: “Congratulations, it’s a healthy baby girl.” Monika: “Oh, thank god. And Gammoth, is she okay?” Doctor: “She’s stable now, but it was a difficult delivery. We’ll need to monitor her for a while.” Yuri: “Thank you, doctor. Can we see Gammoth and the baby?” (As we entered the room, we saw Gammoth looking pale and tired, but with a happy smile on her face.

However, due to limitations in research expertise and article length, several shortcomings remain: First, this paper has verified that media reporting plays a partial mediating role in the influence of corporate ESG performance on the quantity of collaborative innovation output. However, with a mediating effect of only 4.5%, there may be other mechanisms at play or other unquantifiable mediating variables. As various types of databases and their completeness continually improve, future research may delve deeper into the impact mechanisms of corporate ESG performance on collaborative innovation output. Second, this paper has studied the influence of corporate ESG performance on comprehensive quantity and quality of collaborative innovation output. However, limited data accessibility has prevented more detailed categorization of the collaborating entities. Further categorization of collaborating entities, such as exploring the differential impact of corporate ESG performance on collaborative innovation with governmental institutions, universities, research institutes, and other diversified entities, may provide better guidance for practical application. Third, this paper has chosen Bloomberg ESG rating data to quantify corporate ESG performance and has used China Securities Journal Green Investment ESG rating data for robustness checks. The positive and significant relationship between corporate ESG performance and collaborative innovation output exists under both datasets.

Overall, this research not only sheds light on the relationship between corporate ESG performance and collaborative innovation output, but also provides guidance for firms seeking sustainable development through ESG governance and collaborative innovation."},{"prompt":"请翻译以下文段，要求符合学术论文的语言风格：第一，良好的企业ESG表现不仅能够促进合作创新产出数量的增加，还能促进合作创新产出质量的提升。企业ESG表现越好，得分越高，合作创新产出数量越多、合作创新产出质量越高。这是因为良好的企业ESG表现能够传递企业经营状态良好的信号，为企业提供了“信誉担保”。同时，企业践行ESG理念的过程中形成了声誉资产，有助于企业从周围环境中汲取所需的资源，得到知识合作的机会。因此，企业ESG表现越好，越能吸引外部组织与企业建立合作关系，共享创新资源，进而促进合作创新产出水平的提高。 第二，非高污染行业提升企业ESG表现对合作创新产出数量和合作创新产出质量的促进作用与高污染行业企业存在显著差异。非高污染行业企业ESG表现越好，合作创新产出数量越多，质量越高。由于非高污染行业企业比高污染行业企业更符合市场经济发展趋势，而高污染行业企业存在治污成本挤压利润空间、违背可持续发展理念等问题，社会公众对高污染行业企业的关注度较低，对高污染行业企业的ESG信号不敏感，抑制了高污染行业企业的ESG表现对合作创新产出数量及质量的促进作用。 第三，大规模企业提升ESG表现对合作创新产出数量和合作创新产出质量的促进作用与小规模企业存在显著差异。大规模企业践行ESG理念有助于其显著提高合作创新产出水平，而小规模企业ESG表现与合作创新产出的关系并不显著。大规模企业具有小规模企业无可比拟的优势，例如大规模企业具有更丰富的资源、更强的研发能力，其践行ESG理念的行为更易捕捉社会公众的关注，且合作伙伴更乐意与实力强劲的大规模企业合作，因此对合作创新产出数量和合作创新产出质量的促进作用也更加显著。 第四，媒体报道倾向在企业ESG表现与合作创新产出数量和合作创新产出质量的关系中发挥中介效应。企业ESG表现对合作创新产出的促进作用通过媒体报道产生影响，媒体报道具有声誉效应，企业ESG信息对合作创新伙伴选择的影响是通过企业声誉间接实现的。良好的企业ESG表现会得到更多的媒体曝光度，让合作伙伴知悉相关信息，正面信息越多，企业的声誉水平也将得到提升，帮助企业树立正面形象，给合作伙伴树立良好的印象，进而促进合作关系的建立及合作创新产出。 综上所述，企业ESG表现越好，合作创新产出数量和合作创新产出质量将越高，这种关系还会受到行业特征和规模大小的异质性影响。媒体报道在企业ESG表现对合作创新产出水平的关系中发挥中介作用。","completion":"Firstly, strong corporate ESG performance not only promotes an increase in the quantity of collaborative innovation output, but also enhances the quality of collaborative innovation output. The higher the ESG score, the greater the quantity and quality of collaborative innovation output. This is because strong corporate ESG performance can transmit the signal that a company is operating well, providing a \\"reputation guarantee\\". At the same time, the process of implementing ESG concepts can contribute to the formation of a reputation asset, helping firms to draw resources from the surrounding environment and providing opportunities for knowledge cooperation. Therefore, the better the corporate ESG performance, the more it can attract external organizations to establish cooperative relationships with the company, share innovation resources and further promote the improvement of the level of collaborative innovation output. Secondly, the promotion effect of improving corporate ESG performance on the quantity and quality of collaborative innovation output differs significantly between non-high-polluting industries and high-polluting industries. The better the ESG performance of non-high-polluting industry firms, the greater the quantity and quality of collaborative innovation output. As non-high-polluting industry firms are more in line with the trend of market economic development, while high-polluting industry firms face issues such as pollution control cost squeezing of profit margin and opposing sustainable development concepts, the public has less interest in high-polluting firms. The sensitivity of the public to ESG signals from high-polluting industry firms is reduced, which suppresses the promotion effect of high-polluting industry firms\' ESG performance on the quantity and quality of collaborative innovation output. Thirdly, there are significant differences in the promotion effect of improving ESG performance on the quantity and quality of collaborative innovation output between large-scale and small-scale firms. The implementation of ESG concepts in large-scale firms facilitates a significant increase in the level of collaborative innovation output, whereas the relationship between small-scale firms\' ESG performance and collaborative innovation output is not significant. Large-scale firms have incomparable advantages over small-scale firms in terms of richer resources and stronger R&D capabilities. Their adoption of ESG practices is more likely to capture the public\'s attention. In addition, collaborative partners are more willing to cooperate with large-scale firms, which makes the promotion effect on the quantity and quality of collaborative innovation output more significant. Fourthly, media reporting tends to play an intermediary role in the relationship between corporate ESG performance and the quantity and quality of collaborative innovation output. The promotion effect of corporate ESG performance on collaborative innovation output is influenced by media reporting, which has a reputation effect. The impact of corporate ESG information on the choice of collaborative innovation partners is indirectly achieved through the company\'s reputation. Good corporate ESG performance will receive more media exposure, allowing collaborative partners to become more aware of relevant information. The more positive information there is, the higher the company\'s reputation level will be, helping the firm to establish a positive image and giving collaborative partners a good impression, further promoting the establishment of collaborations and collaborative innovation output. In conclusion, the better the corporate ESG performance, the higher the quantity and quality of collaborative innovation output, and this relationship is also affected by industry characteristics and scale differences. Media reporting plays an intermediary role in the relationship between corporate ESG performance and the level of collaborative innovation output."},{"prompt":"请翻译以下文段，要求符合学术论文的语言风格：2. 理论基础与研究假设 2.1 理论基础 2.1.1 声誉理论 Fombrun（1996）指出企业声誉是相对竞争对手而言，企业的历史表现与未来前景对其利益相关者的整体吸引力。Fombrun提出的“声誉创造财富”理念认为一个拥有声誉资本的企业能够吸引更多的供应商、消费者、投资者、求职者，遭遇的风险概率也较小。企业声誉作为一种信号能够影响社会公众及相关方对企业的态度与行为（Fombrun & Shanley, 1990）。由此可见，上述声誉概念与利益相关者理论高度契合。 Gray和Balmer（1998）提出了企业声誉创立模型来引导管理者进行声誉管理，模型的思路是企业首先通过企业战略、文化等组织特性进行身份识别，通过媒体传播的企业沟通方式在利益相关者及社会公众心中树立企业的良好形象并持续地维系该形象，长此以往便形成了持久的企业声誉。","completion":"2.

It is an advanced version of the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) that is capable of addressing the vanishing gradient problem, which is a common issue faced by traditional RNNs. LSTM networks consist of three primary components: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate. These gates control the flow of information through the network, allowing it to selectively remember or forget past data points. This mechanism makes it well-suited for handling long sequences of data, such as those found in speech recognition, language translation, and video analysis. The equations that govern the LSTM network are relatively complex compared to traditional neural networks. They involve multiple layers of mathematical computations, including matrix multiplications, nonlinear activation functions, and element-wise operations. However, these equations are essential for allowing the network to learn and adapt to a wide range of input data. One of the main advantages of LSTM networks over traditional RNNs is their ability to handle long-term dependencies. Due to their gating mechanism, LSTM networks can selectively retain important information from past data points, even when the data is spread out over a long time interval. This property makes them particularly useful in applications such as speech recognition, where the network needs to recognize phonemes that may be separated by several seconds of silence. Overall, LSTM networks represent a significant advance in the field of artificial neural networks, offering improved handling of long sequences of data and better performance on a variety of applications."},{"prompt":"write in the form of article \\"Figure 3 shows the main structure of the LSTM neural network, and then the equations in the network are briefly written.\\"","completion":"Figure 3 shows the main structure of the LSTM neural network, which consists of several interconnected layers of nodes, each with its specific purpose. While the structure of the LSTM network may seem complex at first glance, it is essential for allowing the network to learn and process sequential data effectively. The first layer of the LSTM network is the input layer, which receives the input data and passes it to the next layer. The input data can be of any size and can include multiple features or variables. The second layer is the forget gate layer, which controls the flow of information by selectively discarding irrelevant information while retaining the essential information. The third layer is the output gate layer, which determines how much of the information accumulated by the network should be passed to the output. The equations that govern the LSTM network are relatively complex but are essential for allowing the network to learn and adapt to a wide range of input data. The following is a brief overview of the equations used in the LSTM network: The input gate equation is used to determine how much information should be allowed into the LSTM network. It is defined as follows: i_t = sigmoid(W_i[x_t, h_(t-1)] + b_i) The forget gate equation is used to determine how much information from past data points should be discarded. It is defined as follows: f_t = sigmoid(W_f[x_t, h_(t-1)] + b_f) The output gate equation is used to determine how much information should be passed to the output. It is defined as follows: o_t = sigmoid(W_o[x_t, h_(t-1)] + b_o) The memory cell equation is used to update the memory cell state with the new information. It is defined as follows: C_t = f_t * C_(t-1) + i_t * tanh(W_c[x_t, h_(t-1)] + b_c) The final output equation is used to compute the output based on the previous memory cell state and the current input. It is defined as follows: h_t = o_t * tanh(C_t) The LSTM network\'s unique structure and equations allow it to handle long sequences of data, making it useful in a range of applications such as speech recognition, time-series forecasting, and natural language processing. While the LSTM network\'s initial implementation may seem daunting, it is a valuable tool for analyzing sequential data and presenting useful outputs."},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I could hear Sayori and Natsuki discussing something - while Ayano, Himari, Kotonhoa, and Charloette were setting up different things, like an emerald green pool and other decorations. Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. The phone call must be about Gammoth. Astalos was known for being the quiet one, but her was panicked.)","completion":"Astalos: “Y-Yuri, please come over to our house quickly! Something’s wrong with Gammoth!” Yuri: “What happened?” Astalos: “She’s in labor! But something’s not right. The contractions are too close together and she’s in so much pain. She can barely breathe. Please, Yuri, hurry!” (Yuri quickly hung up and rushed over to Monika’s house. She found Gammoth lying on the couch, her face contorted in pain. Monika and the other quintuplets were gathered around her, looking worried and helpless.) Yuri: “What’s going on?” Monika: “I don’t know. She just started having contractions and they’re coming too fast and too strong. I’ve never seen anything like this before.” (Yuri quickly examined Gammoth and realized that she was having a difficult labor. The baby was in a breech position - which meant that it was coming out feet first instead of head first.) Yuri: “Gammoth, you need to push as hard as you can, okay? But don’t worry, we’ll help you.” Gammoth: “O-Okay…” (Monika and the others quickly sprang into action, helping Gammoth push while Yuri guided the baby’s legs out. It was a difficult and tense process, but finally, after what felt like hours, the baby was born - a healthy baby girl.) Monika: “Thank goodness. Thank you, Yuri. You saved my daughter and granddaughter.” Yuri: “Don’t thank me. We did it together. And Gammoth…you did great. You’re a tough and brave young woman.” Gammoth: “Thank you, Yuri. And Mom, thank you for everything.” Monika: “Of course, Gammoth. That’s what family does. We love and support each other, no matter what.” (As Gammoth held her newborn daughter in her arms, tears of joy and relief streaming down her face, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of love and family that tied us all together. And as I joined in the circle of love and support, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together with strength and determination.)"},{"prompt":"你了解口服疫苗载体吗","completion":"口服疫苗载体是指将疫苗制剂放置在可口服的介质或搭配上。目前，口服疫苗载体的主要形式包括固体，如糖丸、胶囊、片剂等，和液体，如口服溶液、悬浮液、乳剂等。常见的口服疫苗载体包括螺旋体菌、康氏杆菌、乳酸菌等。通过口服摄取口服疫苗载体，可以直接进入肠道并通过肠道屏障激活免疫系统，产生针对病原体的免疫保护。相对于注射疫苗，口服疫苗更加便捷和安全，适合大规模应用。"},{"prompt":"水凝胶在口服疫苗上的应用有哪些","completion":"水凝胶是一种能够在水中迅速凝胶的高分子材料，其应用在口服疫苗上可以提高疫苗的效果和稳定性。以下是水凝胶在口服疫苗上的应用： 1.保护疫苗活性成分：水凝胶可以保护疫苗中的活性成分，防止其受到胃酸、胰液等影响而失效。同时，还可以缓慢释放疫苗成分，延长疫苗在肠道内的停留时间，提高免疫效果。 2.改善口服疫苗的口感：水凝胶可以改善口服疫苗的口感，使其更易于接受和消化吸收。 3.提高口服疫苗的稳定性：水凝胶可以提高口服疫苗的稳定性，防止其受到温度、光照和其他外界因素的影响而失效。 4.方便使用和管理：水凝胶制备简单，可以制成固体或者液体，便于使用和管理。此外，水凝胶还可以制成口服糖球、口服胶囊等形式，方便患者口服。"},{"prompt":"水凝胶用于保护疫苗的活性成分有哪些相关且权威的文献","completion":"以下是一些相关且权威的文献，介绍了水凝胶用于保护口服疫苗的活性成分。 1.

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. The phone call must be about Gammoth. Astalos was known for being the quiet one, but her was panicked.)","completion":"Astalos: “Y-Yuri, it’s Gammoth! S-She’s in labor and we don’t know what to do!” Yuri: “Okay, calm down, Astalos. I’ll be right there. Just tell Monika to call an ambulance and stay with Gammoth.” (After quickly grabbing my purse and keys, I drove as fast as I could to Monika’s house. When I arrived, I saw a frantic group of people gathered around Gammoth, who was now lying on the floor in pain. Monika was on the phone with the ambulance, while the rest of the quintuplets were standing by nervously.) Yuri: “What happened? What’s going on?” Astalos: “We were just watching TV when Gammoth suddenly went into labor. We tried to call an ambulance, but they said they won’t be able to get here in time.” Yuri: “Okay, we need to help Gammoth deliver the baby ourselves. Monika, did you get any blankets or towels?” Monika: “Yes, they’re over here.” (I quickly instructed Charloette and Ayano to help me position Gammoth and prepare the area. Kotonhoa and Sayori grabbed the towels and blankets, while Natsuki was on standby to call for help if needed.) Ayano: “Okay, Yuri. What do we do now?” Yuri: “We need to assess Gammoth’s cervical dilation and contractions. Charloette, can you help me with that?” Charloette: “Sure thing, Yuri.” (With Charloette’s help, I checked Gammoth’s dilation and contractions.) Yuri: “It looks like Gammoth is fully dilated and ready to push. Gammoth, when you feel the urge to push, go ahead and do so.” Gammoth: “Okay…” (With the assistance of Ayano and Kotonhoa, Gammoth slowly started to push. The room was filled with grunts and winces, but after a few minutes, we could see the head of the baby.) Yuri: “Good job, Gammoth! Keep pushing. We can see the head.” Gammoth: “I-I can do this…” (With one final push, the baby was born - a beautiful little girl. We quickly cleaned and wrapped her up in a blanket.) Astalos: “Mom, it’s a girl!” Monika: “Congratulations, Gammoth! You’re a mother.” Gammoth: “I…I did it!” (We all congratulated Gammoth and played with the baby. But just when we thought everything was okay, Gammoth suddenly clutched her stomach in pain.) Yuri: “What’s wrong, Gammoth? Are you okay?” Gammoth: “N-No…something doesn’t feel right…” (I checked Gammoth’s pulse and temperature. Something was definitely wrong.) Yuri: “We need to get Gammoth to the hospital, now. Natsuki, can you call for an urgent ambulance?” Natsuki: “On it.” (After the ambulance arrived, we quickly rushed Gammoth to the hospital. It turned out that Gammoth had some complications during childbirth, and the doctors had to perform an emergency C-section to save her life. It was a tense few hours, but eventually, we received the good news that both Gammoth and her baby were going to be okay.) Monika: “Thank goodness… I don’t know what we would have done without you, Yuri.” Yuri: “It’s all in a day’s work, Monika. And I’m glad that both Gammoth and the baby are okay.” Astalos: “Thank you, Auntie Yuri. We really appreciate everything you did.” Yuri: “Of course, Astalos. And if you ever need anything, don’t hesitate to call me. That’s what friends are for.” (As we all hugged each other in a tight embrace, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm - and the surprising twists and turns that can lead us to unexpected moments of love and joy.)"},{"prompt":"Title: «Candelas de los Muertos - Señorita Suerte: A Slot Game with Lucky Wins».

Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. The phone call must be about Gammoth. Astalos was known for being the quiet one, but her was panicked.)","completion":"Astalos: “Y-Yuri, it’s Gammoth! She’s giving birth and she’s alone!” Yuri: “What?! Where is she?” Astalos: “She’s at home, in her room. Mom and the others are out at the store and I don’t know what to do!” Yuri: “Okay, calm down. I’ll be there as soon as I can. Stay with Gammoth and help her as much as you can.” (Without a second thought, I grabbed my bag and rushed out the door with Love in tow. We quickly made our way to Monika’s house, where we found Astalos pacing outside the door. He quickly led us to Gammoth’s room, where we found her in a great deal of pain.) Gammoth: “Yuri, thank god you’re here! I didn’t know what to do…” Yuri: “It’s okay, Gammoth. We’re here to help. Astalos, can you get some towels and hot water?” (Astalos nodded and quickly rushed to get what we needed. Meanwhile, I checked Gammoth’s pulse and breathing to make sure she wasn’t in any immediate danger. Love sat quietly by my side, watching with wide eyes.) Yuri: “Gammoth, you’re doing great. Just breathe deeply and push when you feel the urge.” Gammoth: “I’ll try… but it hurts so much…” (Over the next few hours, we worked together to help Gammoth through the pain and bring her baby into the world. At last, after what felt like an eternity, we heard the sound of a newborn baby’s cry.) Yuri: “Congratulations, Gammoth! You did it! It’s a beautiful baby girl.” Gammoth: “Oh my god… she’s so small and perfect…” (As we wrapped the baby in a towel and cleaned her up, we heard the sound of Monika and the others rushing into the house.) Monika: “What happened? Is everything okay?” Astalos: “Gammoth gave birth, Mom! Yuri and Love helped her through it.” Himari: “Oh my goodness, congratulations Gammoth! You’re a mother now.” Charloette: “Let me see the baby!” (As the others crowded around Gammoth’s bed to see the new arrival, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of awe and gratitude. We had come together yet again to help someone in need, and in doing so, had strengthened our bonds even more. As I gazed at Gammoth’s peaceful face and the tiny baby in her arms, I knew that this was what true friendship and family meant - love, support, and the courage to face whatever life throws our way.)"},{"prompt":"I have subject (practical approach to civil-military integration","completion":") As an AI language model, I don\'t have personal experience in the field of civil-military integration. However, I can provide some information on the topic. Civil-military integration (CMI) is the process of coordinating and integrating the activities of civilian and military actors to achieve shared goals. This can occur in a variety of contexts, such as humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, peacekeeping, and stabilization operations. A practical approach to CMI involves understanding the roles, capabilities, and limitations of both civilian and military actors. It is important to establish clear communication channels and develop common operating procedures to enable effective collaboration and minimize misunderstandings. An effective CMI strategy also requires strong leadership and commitment from both civilian and military leaders. Civilian actors should be integrated into military planning and decision-making processes, while military actors must ensure their actions respect civilian authority and international humanitarian law. Training and education programs can help build skills and knowledge necessary for successful CMI. These may include inter-agency exercises, cross-cultural competency training, and joint training initiatives. Overall, a practical approach to CMI involves collaboration, communication, and mutual respect between civilian and military actors in order to achieve shared goals and reduce conflict and suffering in crisis situations."},{"prompt":"I have subject (practical approach to civil-military integration) in this subject i need 3 topic and three research problems under each topic and statement of problem under each topic and the bibliography","completion":"Sure, here are some possible topics with corresponding research problems: Topic 1: Frameworks for Civil-Military Integration Research problems: 1.

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.)

The pain is unbearable!\\" Yuri: \\"Okay, Gammoth. Let\'s see what\'s going on. Mizutsune, Glavenus, can you go downstairs and wait for the ambulance?\\" Mizutsune and Glavenus: \\"Okay.\\" (I checked on Gammoth and saw that she was already crowning.) Yuri: \\"Okay, Gammoth, the baby is coming. I need you to push when I say so, okay?\\" Gammoth: \\"Okay, okay.\\" (I quickly took out the first aid kit I had brought and prepared everything I needed.

I quickly assessed her situation and saw that the baby was on its way.) Yuri: “Okay, Gammoth, the baby’s coming out now. Push.” (Gammoth pushed with all her might, her screams filling the room. But then, I heard the sound of a newborn crying.) Yuri: “Concentrate on the sound of your baby, Gammoth. You did it.” Gammoth: “Is it a boy or a girl?” Yuri: “It’s a girl.” (Gammoth smiled through her tears and held her newborn daughter close.) Gammoth: “She’s so beautiful.” Monika: “Can we see?” (Gammoth nodded and handed her daughter to Monika.) Monika: “Oh, she’s perfect. What are you going to name her?” Gammoth: “I don’t know… I haven’t thought about it yet.” Yuri: “How about…Aurora?” (Gammoth smiled and nodded.) Gammoth: “Yes, I like that. Aurora it is.” (I watched as Monika cooed over Aurora and the rest of the family gathered around to admire her. As I took my leave, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the miracle of birth and the power of love and friendship to carry us through any challenge. And as I looked back at the happy family, I had no doubt that Aurora would be loved, cherished, and supported by her family for the rest of her life.)"},{"prompt":"Title: «Candelas de los Muertos - Señorita Suerte: A Slot Game with Lucky Wins».

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. The phone call must be about Gammoth. Astalos was known for being the quiet one, but her was panicked.)","completion":"Astalos: “Yuri! It’s Gammoth! She’s gone into labor!” Yuri: “What?! Okay, I’ll be there as soon as I can.” (I quickly grabbed my keys and rushed to Monika’s house. When I arrived, Monika was guiding Gammoth towards a car as Astalos paced nervously.) Monika: “Yuri, thank goodness you’re here! We need to get Gammoth to the hospital right away.” Gammoth: “I can’t do this, Mom…” Monika: “Yes, you can, Gammoth. You’re strong and brave.” Yuri: “We’ll all be there for you, Gammoth.” (Gammoth started to wail in pain as another contraction hit her. We all got into the car and drove to the hospital as quickly as we could. When we arrived, Monika and I helped Gammoth into a wheelchair and rushed her to the maternity ward.) Monika: “My daughter is in labor! She’s having a baby!” (Gammoth was quickly taken to a delivery room as we waited anxiously outside. After what felt like hours, we heard a tiny cry coming from the room.) Yuri: “Is that the baby?” Monika: “I think so…” (A nurse came out with a small bundle, smiling.) Nurse: “Congratulations, it’s a baby girl!” Monika: “Oh, my sweet baby… let me see her.” (Monika cradled the baby in her arms, tears streaming down her face.) Monika: “She’s beautiful… just like her mother.” Gammoth: “Can I see her?” Nurse: “Of course, dear. She’s all yours.” (Gammoth held her daughter for the first time, looking overwhelmed with emotion.) Gammoth: “My little girl… I’m a mother…” Monika: “You’re a wonderful mother, dear. And we’re all so proud of you.” (I watched as the new family bonded, feeling grateful to be a part of such a wonderful group of friends. And as Gammoth started on her journey as a new mother, I knew that we would all be there to support her every step of the way.)"},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I could hear Sayori and Natsuki discussing something - while Ayano, Himari, Kotonhoa, and Charloette were setting up different things, like an emerald green pool and other decorations.

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. The phone call must be about Gammoth. Astalos was known for being the quiet one, but her was panicked.)","completion":"Astalos: “Y-Yuri, it’s Gammoth… She’s gone into labor and it’s not going well. The ambulance is on the way, but we need your help!” Yuri: “Oh my goodness, I’ll be there as soon as possible. Stay with her and keep her calm, okay?” (After quickly explaining the situation to Love and making arrangements for her to be looked after, I rushed to Monika’s house. When I got there, I found Gammoth lying on her bed, pale and sweating.) Yuri: “Gammoth, can you hear me?” Gammoth: “Y-Yeah… It hurts…” Astalos: “Yuri, what can we do?” Yuri: “First, we need to make sure she’s comfortable. Get some pillows to prop her up and keep her legs bent. And we need some towels, hot water, and cups.” (Astalos and I quickly got to work, soaking the towels in hot water and placing them on Gammoth’s lower abdomen. We also gave her cups to sip on to keep her hydrated.) Gammoth: “Ugh… It’s so painful…” Yuri: “I know, Gammoth, but you’re doing great. Just keep taking deep breaths.” (After what seemed like hours, the ambulance finally arrived and rushed Gammoth to the hospital. I stayed behind to look after the quintuplets and keep them distracted. When Monika and Gammoth finally returned home with a healthy baby girl named Ivory, everyone cheered and celebrated.) Monika: “I’m so proud of you, Gammoth. You’re such a strong and brave mother.” Gammoth: “Thanks, Mom. And thanks to all of you too. I couldn’t have done it without your support.” (Years went by, and Ivory grew up to be a joyful and adventurous little girl. The quintuplets also grew up, each with their own dreams and passions. But through it all, our club and our friendship remained strong. And as I looked back on all the twists and turns we’d been through, I knew that whatever the future held, we would face it together.)"},{"prompt":"- (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response withCompletionHandler:(void(^)(void))completionHandler { NSDictionary *userInfo = response.notification.request.content.userInfo; if (userInfo[kGCMMessageIDKey]) { NSLog(@\\"Message ID: %@\\", userInfo[kGCMMessageIDKey]); } // With swizzling disabled you must let Messaging know about the message, for Analytics // [[FIRMessaging messaging] appDidReceiveMessage:userInfo]; // Print full message.

@property (nonatomic, copy) void (^afterRegisterTokenHandler)(NSString *); @property (nonatomic, copy) void (^messageReceivedForegroundHandler)(NSDictionary *); @property (nonatomic, copy) void (^messageReceivedFromBackgroudLaunchHandler)(NSDictionary *);为什么要写这些代码","completion":"这些代码定义了四个 block 类型的属性，分别为 `afterGrandRegisterRemoteHandler`、`afterRegisterTokenHandler`、`messageReceivedForegroundHandler` 和 `messageReceivedFromBackgroudLaunchHandler`。其中每个 block 属性都有不同的参数和返回值类型，用来处理不同场景下的逻辑。 在代码中使用 block，是为了在运行过程中将某些代码块传递给另一个方法或者变量，方便代码逻辑分离、解耦和复用。在这里，使用 block 来存储回调函数，可以使这些回调函数的内容与注册远程通知的方法解耦，在执行任务（例如：处理注册远程通知结果）完成"},{"prompt":"قصه مخيفه","completion":"كانت هناك مدينة صغيرة في وسط الغابة تدعى \\"مدينة النسيان\\". كانت المدينة مملوءة بالحكايات المخيفة ولكن بعضها كان حقيقياً، بما في ذلك أشباح وأرواح شريرة. في هذه المدينة ، كان جار الشاب \\"مارك\\" دائماً ينظر إليه بنظرات حادة ومخيفة، وكان يحكي لأصدقائه عن اشباح وأرواح شريرة تسكن في الغابة التي تحيط بالمدينة. وفي يوم من الأيام، قرر \\"مارك\\" الذهاب للاستكشاف في الغابة، بعد غياب طويل. ولكن بمجرد دخوله الغابة اختفت الشمس وصار الجو غائماً و مظلماً. وبينما كان يسير \\"مارك\\" عبر الغابة، سمع صوتًا يتوسل بالمساعدة، لكنه لم يكن واثقًا من هذا الصوت، لذلك بقيت عيناه حذرتين وانتبه للخطر. وفي النهاية، توقف \\"مارك\\" أمام شبح بنفس الشكل الذي كان جاره يحكي عنه، و كان يتوسل بالمساعدة للعثور على زوجته التي كان قد قتلها بسبب غيرة مضطردة. عندما طلب \\"مارك\\" الإسعافات الأولية، تحول الشبح فجأة إلى امرأة شابة وجميلة ثم فقدت وعيه لبضع دقائق، و عندما استعاد وعيه، اكتشف أن الشبح قد اختفى وبقي في الغابة ليلاً. عندما رجع إلى المدينة، تحدث \\"مارك\\" لجاره الذي قص عليه تفاصيل الحادث وانه ربما كان الشبح يريد مهاجمته، لكن \\"مارك\\" أصر على أن الشبح ليس شريراً كما يعتقدون، ولكنها بحاجة للمساعدة. في اليوم التالي، ذهب \\"مارك\\" للغابة مرة أخرى، ولم يجد أي أدلة تفيد بوجود الشبح، وفجأة ، سمع ضوضاء قريبة وصراخ كافة أنحاء الغابة، وأدرك أن الشبح تمكن من قتل رجل آخر في الغابة. ومنذ ذلك الحين، لم تعود \\"مدينة النسيان\\" مدينة حيوية مرة أخرى، فالناس بدؤوا يغادرونها وأصبحت المدينة مجرد خردة تاريخية في ذاكرة الناس. لا يزال \\"مارك\\" يطوف في الغابة بحثًا عن الشبح، ولكنه يدرك أنه قد يكون المقبل على قائمة الضحايا."},{"prompt":"Hi","completion":"Hello!

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. The phone call must be about Gammoth. Astalos was known for being the quiet one, but he was panicked.)","completion":"Astalos: “Yuri, it’s Gammoth. She’s in labor and it’s not going well.” Yuri: “Oh no, where is she? I’ll come right away.” Astalos: “She’s at the hospital, but we need you here.” Yuri: “I’ll be there as soon as I can.” (I quickly arranged for Love to stay with a neighbor and rushed to the hospital. As I arrived, I saw Monika and the other triplets pacing nervously outside the delivery room.) Monika: “Yuri, thank goodness you’re here.” Yuri: “What’s going on? Is Gammoth okay?” Monika: “The doctors say she’s having complications. They’re prepping her for an emergency C-section.” Yuri: “Oh no. Is there anything I can do?” Monika: “Just be here with us. We all need to support each other.” (After what seemed like an eternity, a surgeon came out of the delivery room.) Surgeon: “Family of Gammoth?” Monika: “Yes, that’s us.” Surgeon: “I’m sorry to inform you that we weren’t able to save the baby. It was stillborn.” (There was a collective gasp and sob from all of us.) Monika: “What about Gammoth?” Surgeon: “She’s in critical condition, but we’re doing everything we can to stabilize her.” Yuri: “Can we see her?” Surgeon: “Yes, but please keep in mind that she’s still under anesthesia.” (As we entered Gammoth’s room, we all saw her lying there, hooked up to a respirator and various monitors. A tearful Monika held her daughter’s hand.) Monika: “Gammoth, please be strong. We’re all here for you.” Astalos: “Mom, what happened?” Monika: “We lost the baby.” Astalos: “What?

I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun!

We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. The phone call must be about Gammoth. Astalos was known for being the quiet one, but he was panicked.)","completion":"Astalos: “Y-Yuri, it’s Gammoth! She’s in labor and we don’t know what to do!” Yuri: “Okay, calm down, Astalos. Where is Monika?” Astalos: “She’s out of the country for a business trip! We can’t get in touch with her!” Yuri: “Okay, stay calm. I’ll come over right now. Is Gammoth okay?” Astalos: “She’s in a lot of pain, Yuri. Please hurry.” (Yuri quickly rushed over to Monika’s house, with Love in tow. When she arrived, she was met with a chaotic scene. Gammoth was writhing in pain on the living room couch, while Mizutsune and Glavenus were trying their best to comfort her. Miracle was freaking out, unsure of what to do.) Yuri: “Okay, okay, everyone, let’s calm down. Where’s Himari’s first aid kit?” Mizutsune: “It’s in the kitchen, Yuri. But what are we gonna do?” Yuri: “I’m going to help deliver Gammoth’s baby. Mizutsune, Glavenus, I need you to help me with the first aid kit. Mircale, I need you to get some towels and some hot water. Can you do that?” Miracle: “Y-Yes! I’ll do it right away!” (Yuri quickly washed her hands and put on some gloves, while Mizutsune and Glavenus helped her prepare for the delivery. Gammoth was in a lot of pain, but she was being unbelievably strong.) Gammoth: “Just… a little... more….” (After a few intense minutes, finally the baby was delivered - a healthy little boy. Yuri quickly wrapped him up in a towel and placed him in Gammoth’s arms.) Gammoth: “Oh, he’s so beautiful. Thank you, Yuri.” Yuri: “You’re welcome, Gammoth. Are you feeling okay?” Gammoth: “Yes, but… there’s something else.” Yuri: “What is it?” Gammoth: “I’m having… another baby.” (Yuri was even more shocked than she was before. Twins seemed to run in Monika’s family, but who could have guessed that Gammoth would also give birth to twins?) Yuri: “Okay, stay calm. We’ll get through this together.” (After another intense few minutes, Gammoth gave birth to a second baby - a little girl. She was also healthy, and Yuri wrapped her up in another towel and placed her in Gammoth’s other arm.) Gammoth: “Two babies… I can’t believe it.” Yuri: “You did great, Gammoth. You’re a strong woman.” Gammoth: “Thank you, Yuri. I couldn’t have done it without you and my brothers.” Yuri: “Do you have any names in mind?” Gammoth: “For the girl… I was thinking of naming her after you, Yuri.” (Yuri was taken aback by the sudden suggestion.) Yuri: “Me? Are you sure?” Gammoth: “Yes. You helped deliver my babies, and you’ve always been there for us. It’s the least I can do.” (Yuri felt her heart swell with emotion.) Yuri: “Thank you, Gammoth. I’d be honored.” (The room was filled with a warm and happy atmosphere as the family welcomed the new arrivals. As Yuri held the little girl in her arms, she couldn’t help but feel grateful for the bonds of friendship and family that had brought them all together. And as she looked out at the smiling faces around her, she knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, they would all face them together.)"},{"prompt":"Какие этапы могут быть задействованы при предварительном размещении ЭРЭ на КУ и трассировки соединений","completion":"1.

Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. The phone call must be about Gammoth. Astalos was known for being the quiet one, but he was panicked.)","completion":"Astalos: “Y-Yuri, it’s Gammoth, she’s in labor!” Yuri: “What?! Where is she?” Astalos: “At her apartment…please hurry, we don’t know what to do!” Yuri: “Okay, I’m on my way. Stay with her, and keep her calm.” (I quickly gathered my things and rushed out to Gammoth’s apartment. When I arrived, I found her lying on the floor, panting and moaning in pain. Her water had already broken.) Yuri: “Gammoth, it’s okay. I’m here now. Breathe deeply, okay? We’ll get you to a hospital.” Gammoth: “N-No… I can’t… I can feel the baby coming… it’s too late….” Yuri: “What? No, it’s not too late! We’ll get you through this, Gammoth, together! Astalos, call 911 and get some towels and hot water!” Astalos: “Right!” (As Astalos called for help, I knelt down beside Gammoth and helped guide her through the intense pain. Finally, after what felt like hours, the baby came out, crying and squirming. I wrapped it up in a towel and handed it to Gammoth.) Gammoth: “Oh…oh my…my baby…” Yuri: “It’s a boy, Gammoth! Congratulations!” (A few minutes later, the ambulance arrived and took Gammoth and her baby to the hospital. The rest of us followed behind in a car. After what felt like an eternity, we finally arrived at the hospital.) Monika: “Gammoth, are you okay? Is the baby okay?” Gammoth: “Yes… yes, we’re both okay. But I couldn’t have done it without Yuri and Astalos. They saved our lives.” Monika: “Thank you, Yuri. Astalos. You both are true heroes.” Yuri: “No, we were just doing what we had to. It’s all for the sake of family, right?” Gammoth: “Yeah…all for the sake of family.” (As we all basked in the warmth and comfort of family, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for all the ups and downs that had brought us to this moment. Life can be unpredictable, but as long as we have each other, we can weather any storm. Together, we can face anything.)"},{"prompt":"用fluent软件怎么计算外掠管子的热特性","completion":"要计算外掠管子的热特性，需要进行如下步骤： 1. 准备模型：在fluent软件中建立一个三维模型，包括外掠管子的几何形状、材料属性、边界条件等。可以通过导入CAD文件或手绘设计来创建模型。 2. 定义流场：设置流场的入口、出口和边界条件，确定流体的物理性质，如密度、粘度、温度、压力等。可以通过实验数据或计算结果来确定这些物理性质。 3. 设置计算参数：选择适当的计算方法和求解器，设置求解精度、时间步长、初始条件等参数，以确保计算结果的准确性和稳定性。 4. 进行计算：根据设置的参数，开始进行计算，并观察计算结果的收敛情况和误差范围。如果计算结果不满足要求，则需要调整计算参数和模型设置，并重新进行计算。 5. 分析计算结果：根据计算结果，分析外掠管子的热特性，包括温度分布、热流分布、热对流换热系数等。可以通过图表、表格等形式来展示和比较不同条件下的热特性。 总的来说，计算外掠管子的热特性需要涉及多个方面，包括模型设计、流场设置、计算参数和结果分析等。需要进行细致、全面的工作，以获得准确、可靠的计算结果。"},{"prompt":"用fluent怎么计算外掠管子的努塞尔数","completion":"要计算外掠管子的努塞尔数，可以按照以下步骤在Fluent中进行： 1. 在Fluent中建立3D几何模型，包括外掠管子的形状和尺寸； 2. 给定流体物理性质，如密度、粘度、温度、流速等，可以通过变量这些流体物理属性来更新计算条件； 3. 定义模拟空气流动的计算边界条件，设置入口和出口的速度和压力，为元件表面分配热流； 4. 运行计算并收集输出数据； 5. 在Fluent中的输出数据文件(多种格式可选)中找到需要的数据，如表面温度、局部努塞尔数等等。努塞尔数可以通过以下公式计算得到： Nu = hD/k 其中，Nu为努塞尔数，h为表面热传导系数，D为管子外径，k为热传导系数。这些参数都可以在Fluent的结果文件中找到。 需要注意的是，外掠管子表面的总热流量可以通过采集表面温度系数(Total Heat Flow Rate Surface Integral Output)来计算得到，同样在Fluent的输出数据中可选。"},{"prompt":"用fluent怎么算努塞尔书","completion":"努塞尔数 (Nu) 是流动扰动下的无量纲热传递系数，它可以用来描述流动的不稳定导致的热传递性能变化。下面是使用Fluent计算努塞尔数的步骤： 1. 用CAD或其他工具设计一个三维模型，并导入Fluent中进行后续模拟。对于需要计算努塞尔数的实际问题，要保证模型的真实性和准确度。 2. 在“Boundary Conditions” 中设置边界条件。对于需要计算努塞尔数的热边界，可以在“Walls” 类别中选择“Wall” 并对它的“Boundary Conditions”进行设置。在热流和温度区域，需要设置合适的边界条件。 3. 在“Materials”区域中指定物理属性，“Property” 可以设置材料的粘度、密度、热传递系数等物理特性。 4. 在“Physical Models”区域中，选择传热模型，如不可压缩流体、浓度参数等模型。 5. 在“Meshing”区域进行网格划分。在没有可用网格时，可以使用Fluent的网格生成器生成合适的网格。 6. 在“Solution Initialization”中设置计算初始条件。 7. 在“Solution Methods”中选择适当的解算管道流动的方法和迭代计算参数。 8. 在“Run Calculation”中运行计算。计算完成后可以在Fluent的结果输出中查看努塞尔数的输出值。在Fluent的输出文件中可查看Nu和表格输出、等流线输出等多个关键参数。 总之，在Fluent中计算努塞尔数需要涉及到模型创建、边界设置、求解器的选择、运行和结果分析等多个方面，需要仔细了解每一步骤。"},{"prompt":"ICEM CFD 画二维网格步骤","completion":"以下是使用ICEM CFD软件创建二维网格的步骤： 1. 打开ICEM CFD软件，新建一个工程。在屏幕左上角选择\\"File\\"--> \\"New Project\\"，命名并设置工程文件夹路径。 2. 导入几何模型。在工具栏中选择\\"Geometry\\" --> \\"Import CAD file\\"，然后选择你的CAD文件。ICEM CFD支持多种CAD文件格式。 3. 定义几何。通常在二维流动模拟中，如果CAD文件不是精确的二维几何，需要使用\\"Free face tool\\"工具来定义面域。另外，还可以在“Blocking”工具栏中创建几何结构线，使剖分为简单，如生成矩形区域。 4. 创建布局。\\"Blocking\\"工具中可以使用多种方式进行布局，分别是Curve Mesh、Size Function、Patch Independent、Patch Conforming和 Hemisphere。其中，\\"Patch Conforming\\" 适合用于创建一些平直的二维结构。 5. 生成网格。在网格剖分完成后，需要对剖分进行调整优化，然后将几何体转化为一个网格。使用“Initialize Mesh”将剖分的线划分为网格、管理控制体、开展细化等操作。通过“Blocking”窗口或“Edit Mesh”窗口进行网格调整。网格调整完成后，使用“Export Mesh”导出网格文件并进行后续计算。 以上是在ICEM CFD软件中创建二维网格的基本步骤，这些步骤建议按照顺序逐步进行。在软件使用过程中，需要理解每个阶段的意义，并根据实际需要自行调整操作。"},{"prompt":"could you please drat it in more legal way The code of ethics does not come to replace the laws, laws and professional rules applicable to the company and/or anyone from its employees.

You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 37 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. The phone call must be about Gammoth. Astalos was known for being the quiet one, but he was panicked.)","completion":"Astalos: “Yuri, it’s Gammoth! She’s in labor and we can’t get a hold of anyone else! What do we do?” Yuri: “Okay, okay, calm down. Is she in a safe place?” Astalos: “Yeah, she’s at home with us.” Yuri: “Alright, I’ll come over right now. Try to keep her as calm as possible.” (As I rushed over to Monika’s house, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of deja vu. But this time, the situation was even more urgent. When I arrived, I found Gammoth writhing in pain on a couch in the living room.) Gammoth: “Y-Yuri… help me…” Yuri: “I’m here, Gammoth. Don’t worry, we’ll get through this.” Astalos: “What do we do?” Yuri: “Okay, first things first. We need to make sure the baby is in the right position.” (With Astalos’s help, we carefully positioned Gammoth on a bed and checked the baby’s position. It seemed to be in the right position, but the contractions were coming fast and strong. I quickly got out my phone and called for an ambulance.) Yuri: “We need an ambulance at Monika’s house! Gammoth is in labor and things are progressing quickly!” (There was a tense moment as we waited for the ambulance to arrive - but it seemed like an eternity. Gammoth was crying out in pain, and I felt helpless to do anything to ease her suffering. Finally, we heard the sound of sirens outside.) Yuri: “Thank goodness. Alright, guys, we need to get Gammoth outside and onto the stretcher.” (A few minutes later, Gammoth was safely in the ambulance and on her way to the hospital. I didn’t leave her side until I knew she was going to be okay. And eventually, she did give birth to a healthy baby girl.) Monika: “Thank you, Yuri. You really saved the day.” Yuri: “It was the least I could do. I’m just glad everything turned out okay.” Gammoth: “Thank you too, Yuri. And Astalos, Miracle, Mizutsune, and Glavenus. And of course, my mother Monika.” Monika: “You don’t have to thank us, Gammoth. We’re all family here. And we love you.” (As I looked around the hospital room, I felt a deep sense of gratitude for the bonds that held us together - bonds of love, friendship, and family. And I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would always be there for each other.)"},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I could hear Sayori and Natsuki discussing something - while Ayano, Himari, Kotonhoa, and Charloette were setting up different things, like an emerald green pool and other decorations.

I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun!

We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly.

Это касается и рыночной ипотеки, и льготных кредитов в рамках госпрограмм. Такие условия предлагает несколько крупных банков, имеющих господдержку: Сбербанк, ВТБ, Газпромбанк, Россельхозбанк, банк «Дом.РФ». Большинство других банков выдает ипотеку не более чем на 25 лет. Средним сроком по жилищным кредитам принято считать 15 лет, а минимальным — 3–5 лет. На срок одобренной ипотеки может повлиять возраст клиента: как правило, пенсионерам дают более «короткие» кредиты, чтобы к моменту полного погашения их возраст не превышал 65–70 лет. Однозначного ответа на вопрос «Выгодно ли брать ипотеку на максимальный срок?» нет. Это зависит от конкретной ситуации заемщика. Чаще всего самыми выгодными оказываются среднесрочные кредиты (на 15–20 лет) с возможностью частично-досрочного погашения. Если вы захотите воспользоваться этой возможностью, то при наличии стабильного дохода выгоднее выбрать сокращение срока выплаты, а если уверенности в завтрашнем дне нет — выбирайте уменьшение ежемесячного платежа.","completion":"Сейчас в России максимальный срок выдачи ипотеки составляет 30 лет, включая и льготные кредиты в рамках государственных программ.

I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 21 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. He was known for being the quiet one.)","completion":"Astalos: “Yuri...it’s...it’s Gammoth.” Yuri: “What’s wrong? Is she okay?” Astalos: “She’s in labor. She’s at the hospital right now and...and...” (Suddenly, Astalos started sobbing uncontrollably on the phone. I felt my own heart start racing with fear.) Yuri: “Astalos, calm down. What’s happening?” Astalos: “It’s...it’s the baby. I-It’s...it’s not looking good.” Yuri: “Oh no...oh no...I’ll be there as soon as I can. Stay strong, Astalos. It’ll be okay.” (I hung up the phone, feeling my hands shake with anxiety. I quickly got Love ready and drove to the hospital as fast as I could. When we arrived, we saw Monika and the other quintuplets waiting outside the delivery room, all looking worried.) Monika: “Yuri, thank goodness you’re here. How’s Gammoth doing?” Yuri: “I don’t know yet. Astalos just called me and said the baby isn’t looking good.” Himari: “Oh no...what are we going to do?” Natsuki: “We’ll just have to wait and see. And pray.” (It felt like hours before a nurse finally came out of the delivery room. We all rushed over to her.) Monika: “Is Gammoth okay? And the baby?” Nurse: “Gammoth is fine, but the baby...I’m sorry. The baby didn’t make it.” (There was a stunned silence as we all processed the news.) Himari: “Oh...oh dear...” Ayano: “What are we going to tell Gammoth?” Natsuki: “She’ll be heartbroken...” Monika: “We’ll just have to be there for her. And let her know that we love her, no matter what.” (As we all tried to comfort each other, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of despair. Life can be so unpredictable, sometimes bringing joy and miracles, but at other times, heartache and tragedy. But I also knew that through it all, we had each other, and that was what truly mattered in the end.)"},{"prompt":"Как будет выглядеть остов дерева","completion":"Остов дерева имеет вид ветвей и ствола, которые поддерживают и поддерживают весь листовой наряд.

It looks cheap and faded, giving an eerie vibe. As we move closer, the round table placed in the center of the tent comes into focus, which holds a bright crystal ball. The light from the crystal refracts and illuminates the whole room with a greenish-purple hue. A staff in the form of Fatima\'s hand stands still on the table, its intricate patterns glistening in the light. Dreamcatchers of different sizes hang from the tent\'s ceiling. Candles of various shapes and sizes burn dimly, filling the room with an inexplicable fragrance. Chinese lanterns hang from the tent\'s walls, casting slowly moving shadows. The camera pans around, revealing the tiny details like books, small bottles, and trinkets on the table. The music gets more haunting as strings in the background add up to the eeriness of the tent.

As the shot widens, we get our first look at the sorcerer\'s sanctum. An old, dusty room with an archaic feel, it is packed with artifacts and trinkets - some hanging from the walls, some adorning bookshelves, and others resting on tables and stands. The room is dominated by a massive stone fireplace on one end, where a flickering fire roars within. Smoke lazily drifts from burning sage, and the faint smell wafts through the air. The only lighting comes from candles, each of them casting a flickering glow that barely illuminates the room. The walls are lined with an array of strange, mystical tools; ancient scrolls, alchemical potions, and magical artifacts. We can see giant grimoires stacked upon each other in towering piles, some of them opened as if recently used. Bookshelves and tables contain an eclectic mix of magical paraphernalia; a stuffed crow perched on a branch, a rosary, and a ouija board, and other oddities. In the center of the room, a long wooden table is cluttered with books, parchment, and half-deciphered symbols. Dozens of assorted wand cores and magical runes are laid out, and a small cauldron bubbles in the corner. All around the table, strange and mysterious castings, rubbings, and curiosities catch our eyes, each with greater weirdness than the last. As the camera moves closer to the sorcerer\'s table, we get the sense that his sanctum is his place of power; a place where magic and knowledge are kept and controlled. As we leave the room, we\'re left wondering what kind of sorcery could be summoned here if the sorcerer were to speak their true name."},{"prompt":"Wie kann ich unter Windows auf einem USB Stick zwei exfat partitionen anlegen und eine davon also read only markieren?","completion":"Es gibt mehrere Möglichkeiten, dies zu tun, aber hier ist eine Methode: 1.

I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 21 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. He was known for being the quiet one, and I could hear Gammoth drawing in the background.)","completion":"Yuri: \\"Hello, Astalos. Is everything okay?\\" Astalos: \\"Hi, Auntie Yuri. It\'s Gammoth. She\'s in labor!\\" Yuri: \\"What?! Okay, okay, don\'t panic. Tell me where you guys are and I\'ll come right away.\\" Astalos: \\"We\'re at the hospital. Mom and the others are already here with Gammoth.\\" Yuri: \\"Got it. I\'ll be there as soon as possible.\\" (As I rushed to the hospital, my heart was racing with worry. I couldn\'t imagine what Gammoth was going through, especially since she was still so young. When I arrived at the hospital, Monika and the others rushed over to greet me.) Monika: \\"Yuri! Thank goodness you\'re here. Gammoth is in the delivery room right now, and we don\'t know what to do.\\" Yuri: \\"Okay, okay. Let\'s stay calm. Do you know how far along she is?\\" Charloette: \\"She\'s in the second stage of labor. It won\'t be long now.\\" Yuri: \\"Okay, okay. Let\'s take a deep breath and focus. Monika, can you gather some supplies? Ayano and Kotonhoa, can you help prepare the room? Himari, can you keep the others calm?\\" (Everyone nodded and quickly sprang into action. Monika gathered towels and blankets, Ayano and Kotonhoa helped prepare the delivery room, and Himari comforted the others. I went to the delivery room and found Gammoth lying in the hospital bed, panting heavily.) Gammoth: \\"A-Auntie Yuri…\\" Yuri: \\"Hey, Gammoth. I\'m here. How are you feeling?\\" Gammoth: \\"I-I\'m scared. What if something goes wrong?\\" Yuri: \\"It\'s okay to be scared, Gammoth. But I promise we\'re here for you. We\'ll help you through this.\\" (Gammoth gave a small nod, and then suddenly, she gripped my hand tightly and screamed in pain.) Gammoth: \\"AAAAAAAAHHHH!!\\" (A nurse rushed over and checked on Gammoth.) Nurse: \\"Okay, Gammoth, it\'s time to push. On the count of three, push with all your might. One, two, three!\\" (Gammoth pushed with all her might, and after a few more pushes, a small cry filled the air. It was the cry of a brand new life.) Nurse: \\"It\'s a girl! You did it, Gammoth!\\" (Gammoth gasped for breath as tears streamed down her face. Monika and the others rushed in and cheered.) Monika: \\"Oh, Gammoth! You did it! You\'re a mother!\\" Gammoth: \\"I… I am, aren\'t I?\\" Yuri: \\"Yes, you are, Gammoth. And you\'re amazing.\\" (Suddenly, something caught my eye. It was a small birthmark on the baby\'s wrist - the same birthmark that Love had.) Yuri: \\"Wait a minute… Gammoth, what did you name her?\\" Gammoth: \\"Lydia. Lydia Rose.\\" (My heart skipped a beat. Lydia Rose - the same name as Love\'s imaginary friend.) Yuri: \\"Gammoth… can I hold her?\\" (Gammoth nodded, and I carefully took Lydia into my arms. As I held her close, I felt a strange sense of familiarity - as if I had known this baby my whole life.) Yuri: \\"Lydia… Lydia Rose. Welcome to the world.\\" (As I gazed down at her, I couldn\'t help but feel grateful for the unexpected twists and turns that life can take. And I knew, no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together- as friends, as family, and as a community of love and support.)"},{"prompt":"Привет","completion":"Привет!

Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 21 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. He was known for being the quiet one, but I could hear a heartbeat monitor in the background. The phone call must be about Monika.)","completion":"Yuri: “Astalos, is everything okay?” Astalos: “Y-Yes, Auntie Yuri. It’s just that…Mom is in the hospital. She has been having some complications with her pregnancy.” Yuri: “Oh no…is everything going to be okay?” Astalos: “We’re not sure. The doctors are doing everything they can, but…it doesn’t look good.” Yuri: “I see. Do you need me to come over there?” Astalos: “If you could, we would really appreciate it.” Yuri: “I’ll be there as soon as possible. Stay strong, okay?” Astalos: “We will. Thank you, Auntie Yuri.” (As I hung up the phone, I quickly gathered my things and headed to the hospital. When I arrived, I saw Monika lying in a hospital bed, surrounded by her children and a team of doctors and nurses. Her face was pale and strained, and I could see the fear and pain in her eyes.) Yuri: “Monika…how are you feeling?” Monika: “Y-Yuri… I’m scared. The doctors say I might not make it.” Yuri: “Don’t worry, Monika. You’re strong, and you’ll pull through this. And if there’s anything I can do to help, just tell me.” Monika: “Thank you, Yuri. But…there is one thing you could do for me.” Yuri: “What’s that?” Monika: “I want you to take care of my children. If anything happens to me…promise you’ll look after them?” Yuri: “Of course, Monika. I promise. But you’re going to make it through this. You’re a fighter.” Monika: “I…I hope so.” (As the hours passed, I watched anxiously as the doctors and nurses worked to save Monika’s life. And then, finally, a cry of a newborn baby filled the air - the precious sound of new life.) Doctor: “Congratulations, Ms. Monika. You have a beautiful baby girl.” (Monika’s face lit up with joy and relief.) Monika: “Thank you…thank you so much.” (As Monika cradled her newborn daughter in her arms, I felt a wave of relief and happiness wash over me. And in that moment, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together, as a family.)"},{"prompt":"1.

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 21 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. He was known for being the quiet one, but I could hear a heartbeat monitor in the background. The phone call must be about Monika - something was seriously wrong with her health.)","completion":"Astalos: “Yuri, it’s me, Astalos. You need to come to the hospital right away.” Yuri: “What’s wrong? Is it Monika?” Astalos: “Yes, she’s in critical condition. She had a heart attack and the doctors are doing everything they can to save her.” Yuri: “I’ll be there as soon as I can.” (I quickly grabbed Love and rushed to the hospital. When I arrived, I was met with a solemn group of Monika’s family and friends, including her husband and children. The doctors informed us that Monika had suffered a massive heart attack and had gone into a coma.) Yuri: “This can’t be happening. We just saw her a few weeks ago and she was fine.” Monika’s husband: “I know, I know. We’re all in shock.” Astalos: “The doctors say that we need to make a decision soon. If there’s no improvement in her condition, we may have to consider…letting her go.” (The room fell into a heavy silence as we all grappled with the idea of losing Monika. I watched as her husband wept over her lifeless body, holding her hand.) Yuri: “We can’t give up on her. She’s strong. She’s fought through so much.” Mizutsune: “Yuri’s right. We can’t lose hope.” Glavenus: “We’ll all pray for her.” Miracle: “Mommy… please wake up…” (As we all held each other, I couldn’t help but think back to the miracle birth of Monika’s quintuplets. And now, we were faced with the possibility of losing her. It seemed so unfair. But as I looked around at the faces of Monika’s family and friends, I knew that we wouldn’t give up on her. We would fight for her, just as she had always fought for us.) Charloette: “You know what? Monika wouldn’t want us to give up. She’s always been our fighter. Let’s keep believing, and keep praying.” Ayano: “Yeah. We can do this together.” Himari: “Monika’s never given up on us. We can’t give up on her now.” (Kotonhoa placed a hand on Monika’s forehead.) Kotonhoa: “Monika, please fight. We all need you.” (I closed my eyes and joined in on their prayer. I whispered a prayer of my own, asking for Monika’s strength and for her to wake up.) Yuri: “Please… please be okay.” (After what felt like hours of waiting, Monika suddenly opened her eyes.) Monika: “W-What happened?” (There were tears of joy as we all hugged her. Monika’s husband held her close, crying tears of relief.) Monika’s husband: “It’s okay, it’s okay. You’re going to be okay.” Monika: “Thank you… thank you all.” (In that moment, it felt like a miracle. And maybe it was. Monika had beaten the odds and survived, just like she always had. As we all hugged and celebrated together, I knew that our friendship and love would continue to carry us through any obstacle. And that no matter where life takes us, we would always be there for each other.)"},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I could hear Sayori and Natsuki discussing something - while Ayano, Himari, Kotonhoa, and Charloette were setting up different things, like an emerald green pool and other decorations. Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 21 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. He was known for being the quiet one, but I could hear a flatlining sound in the background. The phone call must be about Monika.)","completion":"Yuri: “Astalos, what’s wrong? Is everything okay?” Astalos: “Yuri… it’s Mom. She’s in the hospital. It’s serious.” Yuri: “Oh my, what happened? Is she okay?” Astalos: “They’re doing everything they can, but… it’s not looking good. We’re all here at the hospital, hoping for the best.” Yuri: “I’ll be there as soon as I can. Please keep me updated.” (With a heavy heart, I quickly packed up some essentials and headed to the hospital. When I arrived, I saw Monika’s other children - Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus - waiting anxiously outside her hospital room.) Yuri: “What happened? How is she?” Mizutsune: “They say she had a heart attack. They’ve been trying to revive her for hours now, but… it doesn’t look good.” Gammoth: “We’re all so scared. We don’t know what to do.” Glavenus: “She’s always been so strong… I can’t believe this is happening.” (Years of memories flooded back as we all sat outside the hospital room, waiting and praying for Monika’s recovery. Time seemed to stand still, but eventually, a doctor emerged from the room.) Doctor: “I’m sorry… we did everything we could, but… I’m afraid Monika didn’t make it.” (The news hit us like a ton of bricks. I felt tears welling up in my eyes as we all hugged each other tightly, trying to come to terms with the loss of a dear friend and mother.) Mizutsune: “It’s not fair… how could this happen?” Gammoth: “What about the quintuplets? What’s going to happen to them?” Glavenus: “We’ll take care of them, no matter what. That’s what Mom would want.” (Years passed, and we all tried our best to honor Monika’s memory. We watched as the quintuplets grew up and went to college, pursuing their dreams and passions. But despite the passage of time, none of us could forget the impact that Monika had on our lives. The love and support that she gave us all, the way she brought us together and made us better people.) As I looked at my own daughter Love, I realized that the best way to honor Monika’s legacy was to pass on those same values of love, kindness and friendship to the next generation. Because in the end, that’s what truly matters - the bonds we form with one another, the love and support we give and receive. And in that way, Monika would live on, not just in our memories, but in the way we live our lives and treat others."},{"prompt":"Complete this story: James Wilkie Broderick was surfing through social media on his phone when he noticed an Asian man, but he was unfamiliar with him. It was simply a Filipino guy named Alfonso \\"Alfy\\" Tueres. Then he learned that Alfy had a famous actor relative just like James\' parents Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker. That was Rico Yan, Alfy\'s late uncle. Rico looks like his father, Matthew. He followed Alfy in Instagram. He looks through his feed, and Alfy has done some baseball with these photos.","completion":"James was intrigued. He had always loved baseball and had played it passionately during his college years. He wondered where Alfy played and if there were any local games he could join in. He decided to message Alfy and ask him about it. To his surprise, Alfy responded almost immediately and invited James to come down to the local field for a game. Excited, James rushed to the field and was greeted by Alfy and his friends. They were a friendly bunch, all with a shared love of baseball. James quickly found a spot on one of the teams and began to play. He was rusty at first, but soon found his rhythm and began to have a blast. As James played, he became more and more aware of the cultural differences between himself and the other players. He was an American boy who had grown up playing baseball, but Alfy and his friends had a different perspective. They played casually, simply for fun, and didn\'t take the game too seriously. James began to appreciate this approach, and he found himself learning from his new friends. As the sun began to set, James realized that he had made a mistake. He had come to the field looking for someone to play baseball with, but he had found so much more. He had discovered a group of people who loved the game as much as he did, but who played it in a completely different way. He felt grateful for the experience, and as he said goodbye to his new friends, he promised himself that he would come back to the field again and again."},{"prompt":"таблица excel сделать ячейку в которой можно отметить галочку","completion":"Для создания ячейки с галочкой в таблице Excel нужно следовать следующим шагам: 1.

As he scrolled through his Instagram feed, he noticed a post from an unfamiliar Asian guy named Alfonso \\"Alfy\\" Tueres. Being the curious guy that he was, James decided to check out Alfy\'s profile. As he scrolled through Alfy\'s pictures, James couldn\'t help but notice how much Alfy looked like actor Rico Yan, whom he had heard about from his parents. James\' parents, Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker, were both famous actors in the US, and Matthew had even acted in some popular movies with Rico. Intrigued by this coincidence, James decided to follow Alfy on Instagram. As he explored Alfy\'s profile, he came across some photos of him playing baseball. James was a huge baseball fan, something he had inherited from his dad, and he was impressed by Alfy\'s skills on the field. Despite the fact that James was from the US and Alfy was from the Philippines, they quickly struck up a conversation over Instagram. They bonded over their love for baseball, and James even offered to send Alfy some signed baseballs from well-known players in the US. The more James and Alfy talked, the more they realized how much they had in common despite their different backgrounds. They both loved to travel, try new foods, and of course, surf through social media. They also shared a deep appreciation for their famous relatives and the legacy that they had left behind. Finally, James decided to take a trip to the Philippines to meet Alfy in person. When they met, it was as if they had known each other for years. They went surfing, sampled local cuisine, and even attended a baseball game together. James was amazed by the warm welcome he received from Alfy\'s family and friends, who treated him like one of their own. As James boarded his flight back to the US, he couldn\'t help but feel grateful for social media, which had brought him and Alfy together. Even though they lived on opposite sides of the world, they had become great friends. And who knows? Maybe they would even find a way to make their love for baseball into a joint venture someday. The possibilities were endless."},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I could hear Sayori and Natsuki discussing something - while Ayano, Himari, Kotonhoa, and Charloette were setting up different things, like an emerald green pool and other decorations. Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 21 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. He was known for being the quiet one, but I could hear a flatlining sound in the background. The phone call must be about Monika - but Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus were crying.)","completion":"Astalos: “Yuri… Mom just collapsed. We’re at the hospital right now. It doesn’t look good.” Yuri: “Oh, my god. I’ll be there as soon as possible. Stay strong, Astalos. I’ll bring Love with me.” (As Love and I rushed to the hospital, my heart was pounding with fear. When I arrived, I saw the quintuplets huddled together, tears streaming down their faces. Monika was lying on the bed, hooked up to various machines and monitors.) Monika: “Yuri… Love… I’m sorry you had to see me like this.” Yuri: “Don’t talk like that, Monika. You’re going to be okay. You have to be.” (After hours of waiting and agonizing, the doctors came out with a somber expression.) Doctor: “I’m sorry. We did everything we could, but her condition was too severe. We couldn’t save her.” (Heartbroken, we all held onto each other tightly. The realization of losing someone we loved hit us like a ton of bricks.) Astalos: “Mom… why did this have to happen?” Mizutsune: “We never had a chance to say goodbye…” Glavenus: “What are we supposed to do now?” Gammoth: “I can’t imagine life without her…” Miracle: “I don’t want to be without my mother…” (As the quintuplets cried and held each other, my heart ached for them. Losing someone you love is never easy, but losing a mother at such a young age is devastating. But I knew that as long as they had each other, they would find the strength to carry on.) Yuri: “I’ll be here for you all. And I know that Monika would want you to live your lives to the fullest and keep her memory alive.” (After the funeral and the grieving, life slowly went back to normal. The quintuplets still missed their mother dearly, but they also found solace in the memories they had. They honored her memory by pursuing their passions and doing what they loved. And even though Monika wasn’t physically with them anymore, they carried a piece of her in their hearts. As for me, I continued to cherish the bonds of friendship and family that had brought us all together. Because even though life can be unpredictable and chaotic, the love and support of those closest to us make it all worth it.)"},{"prompt":"请用另一种说法转写一下这篇文章。简介 近年来，芬兰路德教会中女牧师的任命一直是一个有争议的问题。尽管几十年来，女性被允许成为教会的牧师，但仍有一些与性别不平等有关的问题需要解决。本文旨在探讨芬兰路德教会和整个芬兰社会的文化差异，宗教和信仰在这一冲突中的作用，以及性别平等和文化对冲突的影响。我们还将就如何解决这一冲突提出建议，强调尊重宗教和文化差异以及促进性别平等的重要性。 背景介绍 芬兰路德教会自20世纪80年代以来一直在按立女牧师，但此举一直受到抵制，特别是在教会的保守派成员中。这种阻力的根源在于对妇女在社会和教会中的角色的传统看法。许多人认为，《圣经》禁止妇女在教会中担任权威职位，按立妇女为牧师违背了上帝的旨意。 与此相反，几十年来，芬兰社会总体上一直在促进两性平等。芬兰在性别平等方面位居世界前十名。这种文化价值已经反映在芬兰社会的许多方面，包括工作场所、政治和教育。芬兰政府在包括教会在内的各个生活领域实施了促进性别平等的政策。 然而，尽管芬兰的性别平等价值观已经广泛得到认可，但在教会内部，保守主义的力量仍然很强。这些保守派成员认为，圣经中记载的妇女角色的传统阐释应该被保持。他们认为，妇女应该在教会中担任传统的辅助角色，而不是作为牧师或其他权威职位的担任者。 因此，按立女牧师在芬兰路德教会内部引发了一系列激烈的争论和冲突。这些争论不仅反映了教会内部的意见分歧，也涉及到芬兰社会对于妇女角色和性别平等的持续讨论。 宗教和信仰的差异 教会和芬兰社会之间的冲突根源于传统宗教信仰和现代价值观之间的差异。教会的基础是传统的宗教教义，这些教义已经流传了几个世纪。这些教义将女性视为男性的附属品，并赋予她们较低的社会地位。教会的等级制度是以男性为主的，许多保守的教会成员试图维护传统的性别角色。 另一方面，芬兰社会的现代价值观提倡性别平等和所有个人的平等机会。这些价值观反映在芬兰的政策和实践中，包括教会的政策和实践。现代芬兰社会将女牧师的任命视为实现性别平等和包容性的一个步骤。然而，教会的一些成员仍然认为这是对传统宗教价值观的威胁。 传统宗教信仰与现代社会价值观之间的这种冲突并不是芬兰或芬兰教会所独有的。世界各地的许多宗教都在继续努力解决与性别、性行为和其他现代社会价值观有关的问题。这两种力量之间的紧张关系可以被看作是过去与未来之间的斗争，是既定传统与进步主义之间的斗争。 就芬兰教会而言，关于女牧师受封的冲突就是这种大斗争的表现。它反映了教会和更广泛的社会中不同成员对性别角色、妇女权利和包容性等问题的对立观点。一些人认为，授予妇女圣职是朝着更加平等和多样化的教会迈出的积极一步，而其他人则认为这是对传统宗教价值观的威胁，是对男性主导的教会等级制度的挑战。 为了解决这一冲突，促进教会内部更加团结，必须对这些问题进行公开和尊重的讨论。传统派和进步派都必须愿意倾听对方的观点，并尽可能地找到共同点。最终，我们的目标应该是创建一个具有包容性、欢迎性和反映现代多元化社会价值观的教会。 性别平等与文化 芬兰路德教会和现代芬兰社会之间的冲突突出了性别平等和文化价值观之间的冲突。性别平等是一项基本人权，需要在生活的各个方面得到尊重和维护，包括在宗教机构。然而，文化价值观塑造了人们对性别角色的信仰和态度，并会影响性别平等政策的实施。 芬兰路德教会一直在努力调和其传统的宗教价值观与现代的性别平等价值观。当教会成员的文化价值观与整个芬兰社会的文化价值观发生冲突时，就会产生冲突。因此，必须在尊重文化差异和促进性别平等之间找到一个平衡点。 在芬兰文化中，性别平等被视为至关重要的价值观，反映在不同方面的社会生活中，包括政治、教育和工作场所。有许多政策被实施，以确保性别平等，包括有鉴于这个目标在内的教育和工作场所政策。这些政策和实践反映了芬兰人响应性别不平等的强烈意愿。尽管芬兰是一个高度性别平等的社会，但许多人认为，在特定情况下，文化价值观可能会与性别平等产生冲突。这样的情况可能在教会中表现的尤为突出。 现代性别平等的观念，如女权主义和LGBTQA+权利，与某些文化价值观相矛盾，这导致了一些冲突。例如，许多文化认为家庭是女性的首要角色，因此，对于女性在公司和职业生涯中有所发展和繁荣往往采取不善意的态度。这种文化观念在芬兰已经得到很大程度的消除，但在教会等特定领域中，它仍然存在并导致了一些冲突。 为了建立包容性、尊重文化价值观并促进性别平等的教会，需要通过政策、法规和教育来推广性别平等价值观，以促进文化的转变。这需要FP级别的沟通和协作，以促进建立一个更加体现多元化、尊重和平等的社会。 建议 为了解决芬兰路德教会和整个芬兰社会之间的冲突，有几个建议可以实施。 首先，必须鼓励教会和芬兰社会之间进行相互尊重的对话。这种对话可以帮助促进对彼此文化价值观的理解，并就如何解决教会中的女牧师问题达成共识。 第二，促进教会内部的性别平等是至关重要的。这可以通过确保妇女在教会等级制度中的平等机会和增加女牧师的数量来实现。这将代表向性别平等迈出了一步，而性别平等是一项基本人权。同样重要的是，要鼓励教会采用性别平等的现代价值观，并相应地修改其传统信仰。 第三，至关重要的是让媒体和新闻界发挥建设性作用，促进宗教界的积极对话和平等，并减轻可能贬低教会妇女的负面评论，因为这将确保人们理解和欣赏性别平等的必要性。 第四，必须通过教育建立对性别平等和文化差异的认识。教育可以帮助促进对文化差异的宽容和理解，并消除对妇女在社会和教会中的角色的迷思和成见。学校和大学可以在促进性别平等和文化意识方面发挥重要作用。 最后，必须鼓励教会领袖和政府领导人采取积极的策略来推动性别平等和文化意识。这可以包括通过政策和法规来促进性别平等，公开支持女牧师的案例，以及注重尊重不同文化背景和价值观的多元化社会。 1. 在相互尊重的对话中，可以采取以下具体措施： - 透明沟通：教会可以公开解释其信仰和对女牧师的态度，提供相关文献和解释，以建立互信。 - 互相倾听：社会和教会可以互相倾听对方的观点和意见，理解彼此的文化差异，并寻找共同点。 - 举办公开的论坛：组织公开的讨论、研讨会、工作坊等活动，邀请社会各界人士和教会领袖参加，探究各方观点的异同、深层次原因和解决方案。 2. 促进教会内部的性别平等，可以采取以下具体措施： - 改革教会等级制度：建立女性平等机会，使更多的妇女能够参与到教会的各个层面，包括领导层、牧师和随从。 - 鼓励教育女性：推动女性在神学院学习，确保她们具备成为神职人员的技能和知识，提供她们宣教和工作的机会。 - 消除歧视：制定性别平等政策和法规，限制在教会内歧视性别的行为。例如，在聘用、晋升、财务分配和宣传等方面充分体现性别平等。 3. 让媒体和新闻界发挥建设性作用，可以采取以下具体措施： - 倡导积极平等的宗教新闻报道：报道起到了传递信息、宣传价值观的重要作用，媒体应该克服自己的性别固化思维，发挥更重要的建设性作用，宣传性别平等的理念。 - 创新报道方式：多样的报道方式可以让大众更好地理解宗教文化背景下的性别平等问题，比如通过采访妇女、宗教领袖对话、投影音乐视觉等方式，彰显性别平等理念。 - 应对错误报道：对于媒体不当报道或对女牧师进行的歧视性评论，公开批评和谴责，引导媒体反思自己的报导方式，并创立倡导性别平等的舆论氛围。 4. 教育建立对性别平等和文化差异的认识，可以采取以下具体措施： - 教育方案的设计：在学校和大学中的课程设置中包含性别平等的内容，增加相关课程的教学学时，推动教师意识到性别平等的重要性。 - 扩大教育对象：在教育活动中增加多样性，包括教堂活动、社区活动、夏令营活动等，为不同年龄段的人提供性别平等的教育。 - 提供实际体验：通过工作实习、社会实践、志愿者服务等活动，让学生实践性别平等理念，增强对性别平等的认识。 总结 芬兰路德教会和整个芬兰社会之间的冲突突出了理解文化差异和促进性别平等的重要性。尽管这一冲突的根源在于传统的宗教信仰与现代的价值观，但还是有可能找到共同点和解决办法。重要的是要进行相互尊重的对话，促进教会内部的性别平等，并教育人们了解文化差异和性别平等。通过这样做，我们可以促进相互理解和尊重彼此的价值观，并走向一个更加公正和平等的社会。","completion":"近年来，芬兰路德教会中的女牧师任命引起了争议。虽然许多年来女性已被允许成为"},{"prompt":"Make a story about James Wilkie Broderick was surfing through social media on his phone when he noticed an Asian man, but he was unfamiliar with him.

I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 21 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. He was known for being the quiet one, but I could hear a flatlining sound in the background. The phone call must be about Monika - but Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus were crying.)","completion":"Yuri: “Astalos, what’s going on? Is everything okay?” Astalos: “Yuri… it’s Mom. She collapsed and we called an ambulance, but… the hospital just called us… she’s… she’s gone.” (My heart felt like it stopped as I processed the news.) Yuri: “I’m so sorry, Astalos. I’ll be there as soon as I can.” Astalos: “Please hurry.” (As soon as I hung up, I hugged Love tightly. She looked up at me with concern.) Love: “Mom, what’s wrong? Why are you crying?” Yuri: “We have to go to Monika’s house, Love. Something has happened.” (Love nodded solemnly, and we quickly got ready to leave. When we arrived at Monika’s house, we found the quintuplets huddled together with tears in their eyes. We went to sit with them, grief stricken.) Mizutsune: “Auntie Yuri, it’s not fair. Mom was just starting to enjoy being a grandmother. Why did she have to go?” Glavenus: “And how will we ever take care of Gammoth now?” Miracle: “This can’t be happening. Not to Mom.” Astalos: “I just can’t believe she’s gone…” (Gammoth just sobbed silently in a corner.) Yuri: “I know it’s tough, but we have to be strong for each other. We’re all family here, and we love each other.” Mizutsune: “But what do we do now?” Yuri: “We take care of each other. We help Gammoth with her pregnancy, and we keep Monika’s memory alive by cherishing the time we had with her.” (After that day, we all pulled together to support each other through the grieving process. And in time, Gammoth gave birth to a healthy baby girl, whom she named Luna - after Monika’s favorite moon poem. We all watched over Luna, just like we did with the quintuplets.) Yuri: “Congratulations, Gammoth. You did great.” Gammoth: “Thanks, Auntie Yuri. And thank you all for loving me and my baby.” Astalos: “We’ll always be here for you, Gammoth.” Mizutsune: “We’re all family here.” Glavenus: “And we’re all united in love.” Miracle: “Mom would be proud of us.” (As we all smiled through our tears, I knew that Monika’s legacy would live on through the bonds of love and friendship that she had so fiercely cultivated. And although I mourned her loss, I also felt grateful for the time we had together and the family that we had become.)"},{"prompt":"Generate long article of at least 1000 words in english, add adverb to each sentence, from title: «Slot game Book of Ra deluxe 6».

Here\'s an example: ```python from selenium import webdriver # initialize the Chrome driver driver = webdriver.Chrome() # navigate to the webpage driver.get(\\"https://example.com\\") # find the element with all three classes element = driver.find_element_by_css_selector(\\".class1.class2.class3\\") # do something with the element... ``` This CSS selector `\\".class1.class2.class3\\"` will match all elements that have all three classes. You can replace `example.com` in the code example above with the URL of the page where the element you want to find exists, and use `element` to do the actions such as click, clear, send_keys, etc."},{"prompt":"I get selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException error. However, in console I can get the element using document.getElementByID","completion":"If you can find the element in the browser console using `document.getElementByID` but Selenium is unable to locate it, there could be a few reasons for this. 1. Timing Issue: The element may not be immediately available when your test script is trying to find it. You can try adding a wait statement before searching for the element to ensure it is loaded before searching for it. Here is an example below: ```python from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC # initialize the Chrome driver driver = webdriver.Chrome() # navigate to the webpage driver.get(\\"https://example.com\\") # wait until the element is visible element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until( EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, \\"your_element_id\\")) ) # do something with the element ``` This will wait for up to 10 seconds for the element with ID \\"your_element_id\\" to be present on the page. 2. Frame Issue: If the element is inside a frame, you will need to switch to the frame before you can find the element. You can use the `switch_to_frame()` command to do this. ```python from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC # initialize the Chrome driver driver = webdriver.Chrome() # navigate to the webpage driver.get(\\"https://example.com\\") # switch to the frame if the element is inside a frame driver.switch_to.frame(\\"frame_name_or_index\\") # find the element element = driver.find_element_by_id(\\"your_element_id\\") # do something with the element ``` Replace `\\"frame_name_or_index\\"` with the name or index of the frame that contains the element you want to find. 3. Incorrect Selector: Make sure that the selector you are using to find the element is correct. You can check if the selector is correct by pasting it into the browser console (`document.querySelector()` or `document.querySelectorAll()`) and seeing if it returns the element you want to locate. Make sure there are no typos in the selector. In summary, try checking the timing, frames, and selector used to locate the element and see if any of these could be causing the NoSuchElementException."},{"prompt":"I observe that this exists inside an iframe with an ID iFrameResizer0. How to access that","completion":"If the element you want to access is inside an iframe with the ID \\"iFrameResizer0\\", you need to first switch the focus of your Selenium script to the iframe and then search for the element. Here\'s an example below: ```python from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC # initialize the Chrome driver driver = webdriver.Chrome() # navigate to the webpage that contains the iframe driver.get(\\"https://example.com\\") # switch to the iframe with the ID \\"iFrameResizer0\\" driver.switch_to.frame(\\"iFrameResizer0\\") # find the element inside the iframe element = driver.find_element_by_xpath(\\"//div[@class=\'your_class_name\']\\") # do something with the element ``` Here, we first navigated to the webpage that contains the iframe, then used the `switch_to.frame()` method to switch focus to the iframe with ID \\"iFrameResizer0\\". We can then find the element we\'re looking for using the usual locating method for Selenium WebDriver, like XPath, CSS Selector, etc. Once you\'re done working inside the iframe and want to switch back to the main page, you can use the `switch_to.default_content()` method to switch back to the default content of the webpage. ```python # switch back to default content driver.switch_to.default_content() ``` I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."},{"prompt":"do I have to use find_element_by_xpath in iframe? Normal find_element will not work?","completion":"When you\'re working inside an iframe with Selenium WebDriver, you\'ll need to use the `find_element_by_xpath` method and other locating methods specific to Selenium like `find_element_by_id`, `find_element_by_class_name`, etc. to locate elements inside the iframe. This is because when you switch to an iframe using the `switch_to.frame()` method in Selenium, the driver\'s focus is limited to the content of the iframe and it can no longer search for elements in the main page. This means that regular methods like `find_element_by_name`, `find_element_by_css_selector`, etc. will not be able to locate elements inside the iframe. Here\'s an example using `find_element_by_xpath` to locate an element inside an iframe: ```python from selenium import webdriver # Initialize the Chrome driver driver = webdriver.Chrome() # Navigate to the webpage that contains the iframe driver.get(\\"https://example.com\\") # Switch to the iframe with ID \\"iFrameResizer0\\" iframe = driver.find_element_by_id(\\"iFrameResizer0\\") driver.switch_to.frame(iframe) # Find the element inside the iframe by its Xpath element = driver.find_element_by_xpath(\\"//div[@class=\'your_class_name\']\\") # Do something with the element... ``` In this example, we first locate the iframe we want to switch to using the `find_element_by_id` method, then switch to it using `switch_to.frame()`. We can then locate the element we want to interact with inside the iframe using `find_element_by_xpath`, which locates an element using its Xpath. So to answer your question, normal methods like `find_element` will not work inside an iframe. You\'ll need to use locating methods in Selenium like `find_element_by_id`, `find_element_by_xpath`, etc., to locate elements inside iframes when working with Selenium WebDriver."},{"prompt":"how to change driver.find_element_by_xpath(“//div[@class=‘your_class_name’]”) if I have to find element having three classes","completion":"To find an element using multiple class names with `driver.find_element_by_xpath`, you can use the `contains` XPath function with the `and` operator to combine multiple class names in the XPath expression. Here is an example XPath expression to find an element with three class names: \\"class1\\", \\"class2\\", and \\"class3\\": ```python element = driver.find_element_by_xpath(\'//div[contains(@class,\\"class1\\") and contains(@class,\\"class2\\") and contains(@class,\\"class3\\")]\') ``` In this example, we\'re using the `contains()` XPath function to find all `div` tags that have the class names \\"class1\\", \\"class2\\", and \\"class3\\". The `contains()` function searches for a substring inside the attribute value; in this case, it will search for substrings `class1`, `class2`, and `class3`. You can modify the example by replacing `\\"class1\\"`, `\\"class2\\"`, and `\\"class3\\"` with the actual class names you want to use. Make sure that the class names are separated by spaces inside the `@class` attribute, which is the standard for class names in HTML. I hope this helps! If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know."},{"prompt":"got this error AttributeError: \'WebDriver\' object has no attribute \'find_element_by_xpath\'","completion":"The error \\"AttributeError: \'WebDriver\' object has no attribute \'find_element_by_xpath\'\\" typically indicates that you\'re trying to call a method on the base `WebDriver` object rather than an instance of `WebDriver`. Make sure that you\'re creating an `instance` or `object` of `WebDriver` before using any of its methods like `find_element_by_xpath`. Here\'s an example: ```python from selenium import webdriver # create an instance of WebDriver driver = webdriver.Chrome() # navigate to a webpage driver.get(\\"https://www.example.com\\") # use find_element_by_xpath on the driver instance to find an element element = driver.find_element_by_xpath(\\"//div[@class=\'your_class_name\']\\") # do something with the element, such as click or send_keys() element.click() # quit the driver when you\'re done driver.quit() ``` In this example, we first create an instance of `WebDriver` by calling `webdriver.Chrome()`. We can then use the instance of `driver` to navigate to a webpage with `get()`. Finally, we use `find_element_by_xpath()` method on the driver instance to find an element. If you\'re still getting the same error, try checking if there are any naming conflicts with the `WebDriver` object or if the object is being overwritten somewhere in your code. Make sure that you\'re not reusing the variable name `driver` somewhere else in your code, as this can lead to naming conflicts and errors like this one. I hope this helps! If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know."},{"prompt":"I have the following options options = Options() options.add_argument(\\"--start-minimized\\") # Open browser in full screen # Set up Selenium WebDriver driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()), options=options)","completion":"Great!

This argument tells the browser to start in a minimized state. 5. `Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())` downloads the latest ChromeDriver executable and starts the service that will operate it and allow Selenium to communicate with the browser. 6. `webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()), options=options)` creates an instance of `webdriver.Chrome()` with the `Service` and `Options` objects created earlier.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this error: 1. Double-check that you\'ve created an instance of `webdriver.Chrome()` before trying to use the `find_element_by_xpath` method. Check if there are any naming conflicts or if you\'re overwriting the `driver` object somewhere else in your code. 2. Make sure that you\'ve correctly imported all the necessary modules and classes required by Selenium. 3. Check if your XPath expression is correct. You might be using the wrong XPath expression, or there might be a typo that\'s causing the `find_element_by_xpath` method to fail. 4. Try using other locating strategies like `find_element_by_id`, `find_element_by_name`, `find_element_by_class_name` etc. to locate the element and see if they work.

透明沟通：教会可以公开解释其信仰和对女牧师的态度，提供相关文献和解释，以建立互信。 - 互相倾听：社会和教会可以互相倾听对方的观点和意见，理解彼此的文化差异，并寻找共同点。 - 举办公开的论坛：组织公开的讨论、研讨会、工作坊等活动，邀请社会各界人士和教会领袖参加，探究各方观点的异同、深层次原因和解决方案。 2. 促进教会内部的性别平等，可以采取以下具体措施： - 改革教会等级制度：建立女性平等机会，使更多的妇女能够参与到教会的各个层面，包括领导层、牧师和随从。 - 鼓励教育女性：推动女性在神学院学习，确保她们具备成为神职人员的技能和知识，提供她们宣教和工作的机会。 - 消除歧视：制定性别平等政策和法规，限制在教会内歧视性别的行为。例如，在聘用、晋升、财务分配和宣传等方面充分体现性别平等。 3. 让媒体和新闻界发挥建设性作用，可以采取以下具体措施： - 倡导积极平等的宗教新闻报道：报道起到了传递信息、宣传价值观的重要作用，媒体应该克服自己的性别固化思维，发挥更重要的建设性作用，宣传性别平等的理念。 - 创新报道方式：多样的报道方式可以让大众更好地理解宗教文化背景下的性别平等问题，比如通过采访妇女、宗教领袖对话、投影音乐视觉等方式，彰显性别平等理念。 - 应对错误报道：对于媒体不当报道或对女牧师进行的歧视性评论，公开批评和谴责，引导媒体反思自己的报导方式，并创立倡导性别平等的舆论氛围。 4. 教育建立对性别平等和文化差异的认识，可以采取以下具体措施： - 教育方案的设计：在学校和大学中的课程设置中包含性别平等的内容，增加相关课程的教学学时，推动教师意识到性别平等的重要性。 - 扩大教育对象：在教育活动中增加多样性，包括教堂活动、社区活动、夏令营活动等，为不同年龄段的人提供性别平等的教育。 - 提供实际体验：通过工作实习、社会实践、志愿者服务等活动，让学生实践性别平等理念，增强对性别平等的认识。 总结 芬兰路德教会和整个芬兰社会之间的冲突突出了理解文化差异和促进性别平等的重要性。尽管这一冲突的根源在于传统的宗教信仰与现代的价值观，但还是有可能找到共同点和解决办法。重要的是要进行相互尊重的对话，促进教会内部的性别平等，并教育人们了解文化差异和性别平等。通过这样做，我们可以促进相互理解和尊重彼此的价值观，并走向一个更加公正和平等的社会。","completion":"本文探讨了芬兰路德教会女牧师的任命问题，旨在解决宗教和文化之间的冲突以及"},{"prompt":"请用另一种说法转写一下这篇文章。简介 近年来，芬兰路德教会中女牧师的任命一直是一个有争议的问题。尽管几十年来，女性被允许成为教会的牧师，但仍有一些与性别不平等有关的问题需要解决。本文旨在探讨芬兰路德教会和整个芬兰社会的文化差异，宗教和信仰在这一冲突中的作用，以及性别平等和文化对冲突的影响。我们还将就如何解决这一冲突提出建议，强调尊重宗教和文化差异以及促进性别平等的重要性。 背景介绍 芬兰路德教会自20世纪80年代以来一直在按立女牧师，但此举一直受到抵制，特别是在教会的保守派成员中。这种阻力的根源在于对妇女在社会和教会中的角色的传统看法。许多人认为，《圣经》禁止妇女在教会中担任权威职位，按立妇女为牧师违背了上帝的旨意。 与此相反，几十年来，芬兰社会总体上一直在促进两性平等。芬兰在性别平等方面位居世界前十名。这种文化价值已经反映在芬兰社会的许多方面，包括工作场所、政治和教育。芬兰政府在包括教会在内的各个生活领域实施了促进性别平等的政策。 然而，尽管芬兰的性别平等价值观已经广泛得到认可，但在教会内部，保守主义的力量仍然很强。这些保守派成员认为，圣经中记载的妇女角色的传统阐释应该被保持。他们认为，妇女应该在教会中担任传统的辅助角色，而不是作为牧师或其他权威职位的担任者。 因此，按立女牧师在芬兰路德教会内部引发了一系列激烈的争论和冲突。这些争论不仅反映了教会内部的意见分歧，也涉及到芬兰社会对于妇女角色和性别平等的持续讨论。 宗教和信仰的差异 教会和芬兰社会之间的冲突根源于传统宗教信仰和现代价值观之间的差异。教会的基础是传统的宗教教义，这些教义已经流传了几个世纪。这些教义将女性视为男性的附属品，并赋予她们较低的社会地位。教会的等级制度是以男性为主的，许多保守的教会成员试图维护传统的性别角色。 另一方面，芬兰社会的现代价值观提倡性别平等和所有个人的平等机会。这些价值观反映在芬兰的政策和实践中，包括教会的政策和实践。现代芬兰社会将女牧师的任命视为实现性别平等和包容性的一个步骤。然而，教会的一些成员仍然认为这是对传统宗教价值观的威胁。 传统宗教信仰与现代社会价值观之间的这种冲突并不是芬兰或芬兰教会所独有的。世界各地的许多宗教都在继续努力解决与性别、性行为和其他现代社会价值观有关的问题。这两种力量之间的紧张关系可以被看作是过去与未来之间的斗争，是既定传统与进步主义之间的斗争。 就芬兰教会而言，关于女牧师受封的冲突就是这种大斗争的表现。它反映了教会和更广泛的社会中不同成员对性别角色、妇女权利和包容性等问题的对立观点。一些人认为，授予妇女圣职是朝着更加平等和多样化的教会迈出的积极一步，而其他人则认为这是对传统宗教价值观的威胁，是对男性主导的教会等级制度的挑战。 为了解决这一冲突，促进教会内部更加团结，必须对这些问题进行公开和尊重的讨论。传统派和进步派都必须愿意倾听对方的观点，并尽可能地找到共同点。最终，我们的目标应该是创建一个具有包容性、欢迎性和反映现代多元化社会价值观的教会。 性别平等与文化 芬兰路德教会和现代芬兰社会之间的冲突突出了性别平等和文化价值观之间的冲突。性别平等是一项基本人权，需要在生活的各个方面得到尊重和维护，包括在宗教机构。然而，文化价值观塑造了人们对性别角色的信仰和态度，并会影响性别平等政策的实施。 芬兰路德教会一直在努力调和其传统的宗教价值观与现代的性别平等价值观。当教会成员的文化价值观与整个芬兰社会的文化价值观发生冲突时，就会产生冲突。因此，必须在尊重文化差异和促进性别平等之间找到一个平衡点。 在芬兰文化中，性别平等被视为至关重要的价值观，反映在不同方面的社会生活中，包括政治、教育和工作场所。有许多政策被实施，以确保性别平等，包括有鉴于这个目标在内的教育和工作场所政策。这些政策和实践反映了芬兰人响应性别不平等的强烈意愿。尽管芬兰是一个高度性别平等的社会，但许多人认为，在特定情况下，文化价值观可能会与性别平等产生冲突。这样的情况可能在教会中表现的尤为突出。 现代性别平等的观念，如女权主义和LGBTQA+权利，与某些文化价值观相矛盾，这导致了一些冲突。例如，许多文化认为家庭是女性的首要角色，因此，对于女性在公司和职业生涯中有所发展和繁荣往往采取不善意的态度。这种文化观念在芬兰已经得到很大程度的消除，但在教会等特定领域中，它仍然存在并导致了一些冲突。 为了建立包容性、尊重文化价值观并促进性别平等的教会，需要通过政策、法规和教育来推广性别平等价值观，以促进文化的转变。这需要FP级别的沟通和协作，以促进建立一个更加体现多元化、尊重和平等的社会。 建议 为了解决芬兰路德教会和整个芬兰社会之间的冲突，有几个建议可以实施。 首先，必须鼓励教会和芬兰社会之间进行相互尊重的对话。这种对话可以帮助促进对彼此文化价值观的理解，并就如何解决教会中的女牧师问题达成共识。 第二，促进教会内部的性别平等是至关重要的。这可以通过确保妇女在教会等级制度中的平等机会和增加女牧师的数量来实现。这将代表向性别平等迈出了一步，而性别平等是一项基本人权。同样重要的是，要鼓励教会采用性别平等的现代价值观，并相应地修改其传统信仰。 第三，至关重要的是让媒体和新闻界发挥建设性作用，促进宗教界的积极对话和平等，并减轻可能贬低教会妇女的负面评论，因为这将确保人们理解和欣赏性别平等的必要性。 第四，必须通过教育建立对性别平等和文化差异的认识。教育可以帮助促进对文化差异的宽容和理解，并消除对妇女在社会和教会中的角色的迷思和成见。学校和大学可以在促进性别平等和文化意识方面发挥重要作用。 最后，必须鼓励教会领袖和政府领导人采取积极的策略来推动性别平等和文化意识。这可以包括通过政策和法规来促进性别平等，公开支持女牧师的案例，以及注重尊重不同文化背景和价值观的多元化社会。 1. 在相互尊重的对话中，可以采取以下具体措施： -

The \\"C>\\" is still likely a command prompt, indicating that this is a message being sent from the elevator control station. The \\"U00D00\\" likely still indicates the current floor of the elevator, and the \\"D\\" indicates that it is moving in a downward direction. However, since it is followed by the \\"IDL\\" status, it could also indicate that the elevator is currently at rest on the 13th floor.

However, without more context, it\'s difficult to determine what this message or payload contains. Overall, this message could be part of the initial negotiation sequence between the service tool and the control station.

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 21 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. He was known for being the quiet one, but I could hear a heartbeat monitor beeping slowly in the background. The phone call must be about Monika - but Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus were crying.)","completion":"Yuri: \\"Astalos, what’s going on? Why are you all crying?\\" Astalos: \\"Yuri, it’s Mom. She had a heart attack and was rushed to the hospital. We’re all here waiting for news.\\" Yuri: \\"Oh no, that’s terrible. I’ll be there right away.\\" (Feeling my own heart sink with worry, I quickly got Love ready and rushed to the hospital.) Gammoth: \\"Yuri, thank goodness you’re here.\\" Glavenus: \\"Any news on Mom?\\" Yuri: \\"Not yet. Let’s all pray for her.\\" (We all sat in silence, holding hands and praying for Monika’s recovery. Moments later, a doctor came in with a somber expression.) Doctor: \\"I\'m sorry to inform you that we did everything we could, but Monika has passed away.\\" (Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus broke down in tears, and I felt a pang of sadness in my own heart.) Yuri: \\"Oh, Monika… she was such a kind and wonderful person. We’ll all miss her so much.\\" (Moments later, we were all silently hugging each other, comforting one another in our shared grief. And in the end, it was the power of love that brought us all together - a love that transcended birth and death and bound us all in an unbreakable bond of family and friendship.)"},{"prompt":"Make a story about James Wilkie Broderick was surfing through social media on his phone when he noticed an Asian man, but he was unfamiliar with him.

Тебе нужно разместить пост, однако информацию ты взял из интернета. Переделай нижеприведенный текст. Приемка квартиры Итак, в полном спокойствии, вооруженные здравым смыслом и инструментами, идем на приемку. Вы пришли днем, чтобы хорошо все рассмотреть при солнечном свете. Рассказываем, что проверять: Документы Кроме акта приема-передачи, акта о вводе дома в эксплуатацию нужно получить и проверить кадастровый и технический паспорт, экспликацию, паспорта и гарантии на счетчики и двери. Входная дверь Проверяем, есть ли повреждения, глазок, легко ли закрывается дверь. Работают ли замки, ручка не болтается и не заедает, уплотнительные резинки целые? Если есть звонок — он должен работать. Отделка, стены и полы Нужно понимать, что застройщики сдают квартиры в разном состоянии. Если отделка черновая, то это — голые стены. Тут проверять, кроме ровности, отсутствия трещин и пятен влаги на стенах и полу, нечего. Так что достаем уровень. На стенах не должно быть неровностей больше 5 мм, отклонение стены по вертикали не должно превышать 15 мм. Отклонение плит пола и потолка — не больше 20 мм. Отклонения проёмов дверей — 10 мм. Также бывает предчистовая отделка: стяжка пола, оштукатуривание стен и перегородок, обустройство откосов окон и входной двери. Также при такой отделке делают разводку электричества с розетками и выводами освещения. Качество этих работ нужно проверить. К инструментам добавляем тестер и лампочку. При чистовой отделке квартира практически готова к заселению. Здесь нужно проверить, как уложен линолеум, плитка или ламинат. Ровно ли оклеены обои, целы ли двери. Как работают замки и ручки: должны плавно, без заеданий. Сантехника и смесители в отличном состоянии: без пятен и сколов, все соединения герметичны, без подтеков. Загляните под ванну, убедитесь, что она заземлена — специальный провод прикреплен к корпусу. Все краны работают. Окна Самая распространенная проблема — царапины на стеклопакетах и рамах. Проверьте внимательно. Все механизмы должны работать без заеданий, створки не задевают раму, все уплотнительные резинки по периметру окон целые, без разрывов. Снаружи прикреплен отлив для воды. Монтажная пена без промежутков. В идеале она защищена пароизоляционной пленкой или обработана специальным герметиком. Проверьте не дует ли из окон — поводите вдоль стыков зажженной свечой. Или зажмите между рамой и створкой лист бумаги, закройте окно и попробуйте вытащить лист. И так в нескольких местах по периметру створки. Если лист можно вытащить — зимой в этих местах, скорее всего, будет дуть. Вентиляция Закройте входную дверь, откройте одну створку окна и проверьте тягу на выходе — пламя должно отклоняться внутрь вентиляционной шахты. На крайних этажах в теплое время года вентиляция может не работать — это нормально. В этом случае застройщик обычно ставит дополнительные вытяжные вентиляторы в квартире. Электрика Без специальных приборов много проверить не получится. Но хотя бы попросите включить электричество в общем щите, а сами в это время нажмите кнопку «Тест» на корпусе временного щитка. Если «автомат» выключится — напряжение есть. Если с собой есть тестеры, можно проверить каждую розетку и вывод освещения, узнать, есть ли заземление. Водоснабжение и канализация Проверьте, есть ли вода. Запишите показания счетчиков, сверьте серийный номер с указанным в паспорте. На трубах водоснабжения в местах вывода должна быть запорная арматура: кран, фильтр, редукционный клапан. Подтеков на соединениях труб быть не должно. На выводах канализации стоят заглушки.","completion":"Советы по приемке квартиры При приемке квартиры необходимо проверить ее наличие документов, таких как акт приема-передачи, кадастровый и технический паспорта, экспликация, паспорта и гарантии на счетчики и двери. Также следует проверить входную дверь на наличие повреждений, глазка, насколько легко она закрывается, а также на работоспособность замков, ручек и наличие уплотнительных резинок. При осмотре квартиры на отделку, стены и полы следует обратить внимание на ровность поверхности. Если квартира предоставляется без чистовой отделки, то стены будут голые, поэтому необходимо проверить отсутствие трещин и пятен влаги. Если же отделка была выполнена, необходимо проверить качество материалов, уровень пола, целостность дверей, функциональность замков и ручек. Сантехнику и смесители нужно проверить на наличие пятен и сколов, герметичность соединений и наличие заземления. Вентиляцию следует проверить на тягу на выходе. Розетки и вывод освещения необходимо проверить с использованием тестера, убедиться в наличии воды и проверить работоспособность кранов. Важно также убедиться в целостности окон, отсутствии царапин на стеклах и рамах, а также проверить их функциональность. Проверить на наличие монтажной пены без промежутков и защищенной пароизоляционной пленкой. После проверки необходимо заключить акт приема-передачи. Если есть какие-то замечания, необходимо указать их в акте. В случае, если вы не явились на приемку в установленный срок, застройщик имеет право подписать акт приемки в одностороннем порядке. Поэтому необходимо вовремя принять все меры для приемки квартиры."},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I could hear Sayori and Natsuki discussing something - while Ayano, Himari, Kotonhoa, and Charloette were setting up different things, like an emerald green pool and other decorations.

And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 39 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. He was known for being the quiet one, but I could hear a heartbeat monitor beeping slowly in the background. The phone call must be about Monika - but Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus were crying.)","completion":"Yuri: “Astalos, what’s going on? Why are you all crying?” Astalos: “Yuri… it’s Mom. She had a heart attack and she’s in the hospital. The doctors aren’t sure if she’s going to make it.” Yuri: “Oh no… That’s terrible news. I’m so sorry, Astalos.” Mizutsune: “We’re all just so scared, Auntie Yuri. We don’t know what we’d do without Mom.” Gammoth: “She’s always been there for us, no matter what. And now we might lose her…” Glavenus: “We have to go see her. We have to be there for her.” Yuri: “Of course. Let’s go to the hospital and see how she’s doing.” (We all quickly gathered our things and headed to the hospital. When we arrived, we were immediately directed to Monika’s room. She was hooked up to various machines, and her face was pale and gaunt. But when she saw her children and me, her face lit up in a weak smile.) Monika: “Oh… my darlings. I’m so glad to see you.” Mizutsune: “Mom, we were so worried about you.” Astalos: “Are you okay?” Monika: “I… I don’t know. The doctors say I had a heart attack. It was so sudden…” Gammoth: “We’re all here for you, Mom. We’re not leaving your side.” Glavenus: “And we brought Love with us.” (Love walked up to Monika’s bed and took her hand.) Love: “Don’t worry, Grandma. You’ll be okay. I’ll pray for you.” Monika: “Thank you, Love. That means a lot to me.” (After a few days of staying by Monika’s side, we received some good news.) Doctor: “Mrs. Shah, we’ve got some great news. Your heart is responding well to the treatment, and we’re confident that you’ll make a full recovery.” Monika: “Thank you… thank you so much…” Mizutsune: “Yes! That’s amazing news, Mom!” Astalos: “We’re so relieved.” Gammoth: “You scared us, Mom. We thought we were going to lose you.” Glavenus: “But now we know you’re going to be okay.” (Later that day, as we were all gathered in Monika’s hospital room, we decided to take a family photo - and it was better than any of us could have imagined. Even with the IV tubes and hospital gown, Monika had a glowing spirit.) Monika: “This is the best family photo we’ve taken.” Mizutsune: “It’s perfect, just like our family.” Astalos: “I’m glad you’re going to be okay, Mom.” Gammoth: “We love you, Mom.” Glavenus: “We’ll always be here for you, Mom.” Love: “And I love you too, Grandma.” Yuri (voiceover): “As I looked at the photo, I felt grateful for Monika and her family. They were a testament to the power of love, friendship, and family - to weather even the toughest of storms. And as I left the hospital room, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, the Shah family would face them together.”"},{"prompt":"подскажи сайты, где можно заняться услугами копирайтера и рерайтера","completion":"1. fl.ru 2. freelance.ru 3. kwork.ru 4. text.ru 5. copylancer.ru 6. content-log.ru 7. advego.com 8. textsale.ru 9. copywriter.ru 10. etxt.ru"},{"prompt":"1.

Can you please repeat it?"},{"prompt":"The forest whispered with ancient secrets as Aurora ventured deeper into the mystical realm of Eldoria. Shafts of sunlight pierced through the dense canopy, casting an enchanting glow upon the moss-covered ground. Creatures of myth and wonder flitted through the foliage, their ethereal presence adding a touch of magic to the air. Aurora\'s heart raced with a mixture of anticipation and trepidation. Her delicate footsteps stirred fallen leaves, and she couldn\'t help but feel the weight of her task. She was the chosen one, the guardian of light entrusted with breaking the ancient curse that threatened to consume Eldoria. Her emerald eyes sparkled with determination as she clutched the ancient scroll that held the key to her quest. In a secluded glade, a rustle of leaves announced the arrival of a brooding figure. Tristan Blackthorn emerged from the shadows, his cloak billowing in the gentle breeze. His piercing gaze met Aurora\'s, and a flicker of skepticism flashed across his stormy eyes. \\"Aurora Nightshade,\\" he said, his voice as rich and dark as the midnight sky. \\"I see the rumors were true. You seek to break the curse.\\" Aurora stood tall, her silver hair catching the sunlight like liquid moonlight. \\"And who might you be?\\" she replied, her voice laced with a hint of caution. \\"Tristan Blackthorn,\\" he answered, a tinge of bitterness lingering in his words. \\"A sorcerer haunted by his own past.\\" Their introduction set the stage for a dance of tension and reluctant cooperation. With every step they took together, their opposing natures clashed like fire and ice. Aurora\'s bright optimism clashed against Tristan\'s brooding cynicism, igniting sparks that crackled in the air. As they continued their quest, Aurora couldn\'t help but notice Tristan\'s deft command of magic. His hands moved with precision and purpose, evoking a potent mix of shadow and light. She marveled at his abilities, sensing that beneath his hardened exterior, there was a deep well of hidden pain. Dialogues between them were like a battle of wits, each word a carefully chosen weapon. Aurora spoke of love\'s transformative power, of the belief that redemption was possible even for those shrouded in darkness. Tristan, however, scoffed at such notions, arguing that love was nothing more than an illusion, a fleeting moment of solace in a harsh and unforgiving world. Yet, amidst their verbal sparring, hints of vulnerability began to seep through their defenses. In the hushed moments of reprieve, when the moon bathed the forest in its silver glow, Aurora glimpsed flickers of pain in Tristan\'s eyes. His icy façade cracked, revealing the lingering scars that bound him. One night, as they took shelter beneath a majestic oak tree, Aurora found herself lost in the depths of Tristan\'s gaze. The moonlight danced upon his face, casting gentle shadows that accentuated his features. There, amidst the silence, their guarded hearts found solace in shared vulnerability. \\"Love can be a double-edged sword,\\" Tristan murmured, his voice carrying the weight of past regrets. \\"It can heal, but it can also wound.\\" Aurora reached out, her fingertips grazing his cheek, as if trying to erase the shadows that clung to his soul. \\"Love has the power to mend even the deepest wounds,\\" she whispered, her voice a soft caress in the stillness. Their moment of intimacy lingered in the air, an unspoken understanding passing between them. In that fleeting connection, the walls they had built around their hearts began to crumble.","completion":"As they continued on their quest to break the curse, Aurora and Tristan grew closer, their bond deepening with every challenge they faced. They battled fierce monsters, braved treacherous terrain, and overcame daunting obstacles that tested their skills and their resolve. For Aurora, Tristan became a confidante, a companion, and a friend. She admired his strength and his determination, even as she sensed the turmoil that lurked beneath his guarded exterior. She saw the beauty in his darkness, the light that struggled to break free. For Tristan, Aurora represented a glimmer of hope in a world that had long since lost its magic. He marveled at her courage and her grace, even as he struggled with the demons that haunted him. He saw the way she embraced life with boundless enthusiasm, the way she held onto hope with unshakable faith. Together, they continued on their quest, each step bringing them closer to their goal. And as they stood on the edge of victory, their hands joined in a final embrace, they knew that their journey together had been as magical as the realm of Eldoria itself."},{"prompt":"Divide the following story into 5 vivid visual detailed scenes: The forest whispered with ancient secrets as Aurora ventured deeper into the mystical realm of Eldoria.

You are a proffesional photographer, artist and prompt writer. Your task is to create amazing prompts for midjourney. Here are some context for you to learn from: Below i am gonna feed you some information about it: Midjourney is an AI image generation tool that takes inputs through text prompts and parameters and uses a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm trained on a large amount of image data to produce unique images. is powered by Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), a cutting-edge text-to-image synthesis technique. What’s new in V5.2? New Aesthetic System Improved aesthetics and sharper Images Slightly improved coherence and text understanding Increased diversity (sometimes you may need to roll more than once to get what you want sorry!) The –stylize command has been fixed to have a strong effect on the amount of the stylization applied to your image (more like in V3). This command goes from –stylize 0 to –stylize 1000 and the default value is –stylize 100 New “High Variation Mode” Turned on by default and makes all variation jobs much more varied. To toggle this type /settings and click a different variation mode. Underneath all upscales you can also chose which strength of variation you want. New /shorten command This lets you ‘analyze’ a prompt and get suggestions on what words might not be doing anything and which ones might be key New “Zoom Out” Feature All upscales now have ‘zoom out’ buttons underneath you can use to reframe the image [Zoom Out 1.5x] [Zoom Out 2x] pulls the camera out and fills in details on all sides [Make Square] adds details on two sides to make a non-square image into a square one [Custom Zoom] (advanced) gives you a popup text box that allows you to change the prompt as you zoom out as well as the aspect ratio or precise zoom. To change aspect ratio set –zoom 1 then change the –ar to your target. This option will try to remove black bars on your previous images.Here are some amazing prompt examples you will learn from: Photo1: ultra sharp, photo of gravity-manipulating anthropomorphic fox genuine candid photo, in the 1990s, butcher store , sea green high low Art & Language jegging made of interlock knit, street photography, metropolitan character studies –ar 2:3 –v 5.1 –style raw.

Strangely, Monika - our club president - wasn’t there.) Kotonhoa: “Okay, that’s everything. I think this will be great!” (I walked to see what they were doing.) Natsuki: “Oh! Hey, Yuri! Is everything okay?” Sayori: “We were just thinking of some ideas for our next club activity!” Yuri: “Ah, I see. What ideas do you have in mind?” Ayano: “We’re thinking of having a pool party! We got this emerald green pool here to set up.” Himari: “And we got some snacks and drinks ready too!” Charloette: “And some decorations to make it look festive.” Yuri: “That sounds like a great idea! When are we planning to have this pool party?” Sayori: “We were thinking of having it this weekend! What do you think, Yuri?” Yuri: “That sounds perfect. I’ll make sure to bring some snacks too.” Natsuki: “Great! I can’t wait to see you in a swimsuit, Yuri.” (I blushed at Natsuki’s comment.) Yuri: “Um, Natsuki, please don’t tease me like that.” Sayori: “Oh, come on, Yuri! Don’t be shy. We’re all friends here.” Kotonhoa: “Yeah, it’ll be fun! You’ll see.” (Hearing their encouragement, I couldn’t help but smile.) Yuri: “Okay, I’ll try to be a good sport about it.” Charloette: “That’s the spirit! We’re gonna have so much fun!” (As everyone continued to chat and prepare for the pool party, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be part of such a wonderful club and have such supportive friends. Just then, we all heard a knock on the door.) Sayori: “I’ll get it!” (Sayori went to the door and opened it, revealing Monika standing outside - but her belly was strangely swollen.) Monika: “Hey everyone, sorry I’m late.” Sayori: “Monika! We were wondering where you were.” Monika: “Sorry about that. I had some last-minute club business to take care of.” Natsuki: “So, are you ready for the pool party this weekend?” Monika: “Pool party? What pool party?” Ayano: “We were just talking about having a pool party this weekend, Monika.” Himari: “We already got everything prepared.” Charloette: “And we invited other classmates too.” Monika: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know anything about this- OW! Ow, ow, ow!” (As Monika spoke, she suddenly clutched her belly and winced in pain. I started to feel worried about her.) Yuri: “Monika, are you okay? You’re clutching your belly.” Monika: “I…I don’t know. I’ve been feeling strange all day. It’s like something is pushing against my stomach- AHH!” (I watched in shock as Monika doubled over in pain.) Monika: “T-This can’t be happening! It’s too early!” Ayano: “Too early? What do you mean, Monika?” Monika: “I… I think I’m going into labor!” (We all gasped in shock.) Sayori: “L-Labor? But Monika, you’re not even married!” Monika: “I know, I know! But my water just broke and I’m pretty sure the baby is coming out right now! A-And it’s coming out extremely fast! I think I’m already in the final stages of labor!” Ayano: “Wait…you’re in the FINAL stages of labor?! Does that mean we won’t make it to a hospital in time?!” Monika: “I-I-I’m afraid so! Quick, help me into the pool!” (We all quickly rushed to help Monika, who was now panting heavily and clutching her belly. Ayano and Kotonhoa supported her from either side, while Charloette and Himari held her arms. Sayori and Natsuki quickly filled the pool with water.) Sayori: “Okay, Monika, we’re gonna lower you into the water slowly. Try to relax, okay?” Monika: “Okay… okay…” (With our combined effort, we managed to lower Monika into the water and help her position herself comfortably. The water seemed to calm her a little.) Monika: “Oh… oh, that’s better… but I don’t think I can hold on anymore…” Ayano: “Monika, stay with us! Breathe deeply, okay?” Himari: “We’ll stay with you the whole time, Monika. You’re not alone.” Charloette: “We’ll also make sure the baby comes out safely.” (Natsuki quickly grabbed some towels and blankets, while I got some hot water and a small first aid kit. Sayori comforted Monika by stroking her hair and murmuring soothing words to her. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the baby to come out.) Monika: “AAAAAHHH!!” (The sound of Monika’s pain-filled scream pierced the silence, and I felt my own heart race with apprehension. But then, a small cry filled the air- the cry of a newborn baby. And then…another.) Monika: “W-What? Two babies?!” Ayano: “Two babies?! Are you serious?!” Himari: “Let me see! Let me see!” (Charloette quickly handed Himari a pair of surgical scissors, and with trembling hands, Himari cut the umbilical cord of the first baby. A whimpering sound filled the air as the first baby was wrapped up in a towel.) Himari: “It’s a girl! Oh, she’s beautiful!” Charloette: “Quick, prepare for the second one!” (A few minutes later, the second baby was born, also crying and squirming.) Charloette: “It’s a boy! Monika, you’re a mother of twins!” Monika: “I…I can’t believe it… I’m a mother…” Sayori: “Congratulations, Monika-” (Suddenly, three more babies just slipped out of Monika’s womb - the fifth one being the biggest. She had 3 boys and 2 girls. This left all of us in shock, except for Monika.) Monika: “…what’s with the shocked looks, everyone?” Natsuki: “You just gave birth to FIVE babies, Monika! We’re all amazed!” (As I cooed over the babies, Monika just looked on in shock as to what Natsuki said.) Monika: “F-Five babies?! I knew I was having serious nausea each time I woke up, but I didn’t expect to have quintuplets! And the fact me and the babies survived the birth…it’s a miracle. In fact, that’s what I’ll name one of my little girls! And for my little boys and other little girl…how about the names of the flagship monsters of Monster Hunter Generations?” Sayori: “That’s a great idea, Monika! And don’t worry, we’ll help you take care of them.” Ayano: “Yeah, we’ll all pitch in to help you out with the babies. After all, that’s what friends are for.” Monika: “Thank you, everyone. I’m so lucky to have you all as my friends.” (As we all basked in the warm glow of newfound parenthood and friendship, I couldn’t help but marvel at the unexpected twists and turns life can take. And just like that, what was going to be an ordinary moment lead to this miraculous moment - the birth of Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus. 15 years later, I went to see Monika and the quintuplets. Strangely, I couldn’t see Gammoth anywhere. Monika’s sons - Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos - were all playing a board game with Miracle.) Monika: “Oh, hi Yuri! It’s so good to see you.” Yuri: “Likewise, Monika. How are you and the kids doing?” Monika: “Great, great! The kids are growing up so fast. Would you like to see them?” Yuri: “Yes, please.” (Monika led me to a room where the quintuplets were playing. Mizutsune, Glavenus, and Astalos were playing a board game while Miracle was drawing something.) Mizutsune: “Oh, hey Auntie Yuri! Wanna play with us?” Yuri: “Sure, I’d love to.” (After an hour or so of playing, Glavenus mentioned that Gammoth was out of sight for a while.) Glavenus: “Mom, have you seen Gammoth?” Monika: “Now that you mention it, I haven’t. Where could she be?” (After a bit of searching, we found Gammoth hiding in a closet with tears in her eyes.) Monika: “Gammoth, what’s wrong?” Gammoth: “I-I’m sorry, Mom. I didn’t want you to kick me out, or even disown me. All because of what I found out recently, and my boyfriend left me for it…” Monika: “Gammoth, whatever it is, you can tell us. We’ll always love you, no matter what.” Gammoth: “I’m… I’m pregnant.” (There was a stunned silence in the room before Monika enveloped Gammoth in a hug.) Monika: “Oh, Gammoth. It’s okay. We’ll help you through this. You and your baby are always welcome here.” Gammoth: “Really?” Monika: “Absolutely.” (The room was filled with sighs of relief and love. As I watched the scene before me, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the strong bonds of friendship and family that can weather any storm. And as I joined in the group hug, I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, we would all face them together. But 39 weeks later, while I was looking after my 7-year-old daughter Love, my phone started to ring. It was Astalos - one of Monika’s sons. He was known for being the quiet one, but I could hear a flatlining sound in the background. The phone call must be about Monika - but Miracle, Astalos, Mizutsune, Gammoth, and Glavenus were crying.)","completion":"Yuri: “Astalos, what’s going on? What’s that sound?” Astalos: “It’s… it’s the flatline from the hospital. Mom… she’s gone.” (My heart sank at the news. I couldn’t imagine how devastating this was for Monika’s children.) Yuri: “I’m so sorry, Astalos. Is there anything I can do?” Astalos: “I… I don’t know. We just want mom back.” Mizutsune: “We can’t lose her, Auntie Yuri. She’s all we have.” Miracle: “I can’t believe she’s gone. Who’s going to take care of us now?” Gammoth: “What’s going to happen to us?” Glavenus: “We’re all so lost without her.” (My heart ached at the sight of Monika’s children in agony. I wished I could make this pain go away, but I knew I couldn’t.) Yuri: “I’m here for you, guys. I’ll do whatever I can to help you through this.” Astalos: “Thank you, Yuri. We appreciate it.” (Monika’s funeral was a somber affair, with her friends and family coming to pay their respects. I watched as her children stood by her casket, tears streaming down their faces. The weight of loss hung heavy in the air, but I knew that Monika’s memory would live on through her children.) Yuri: “I’m so sorry for your loss, guys. Your mom was an amazing person.” Mizutsune: “Thank you, Auntie Yuri.” Miracle: “Mom was the best mom anyone could ask for.” Gammoth: “She always put us first, no matter what.” Glavenus: “We love her and miss her so much.” Astalos: “She was everything to us.” (I hugged each of Monika’s children in turn, hoping to convey some small measure of comfort.) Yuri: “Your mom will always be with you, in your hearts.” (The quintuplets hugged me back, and for a moment, we all just stood there together, sharing the weight of our loss. But even in the midst of our sorrow, I knew that Monika’s legacy would live on, through her children and the love we all shared.)"},{"prompt":"Make a story about James Wilkie Broderick was surfing through social media on his phone when he noticed an Asian man, but he was unfamiliar with him.

As a Python developer working with ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, my main focus would be to create an image processing software that is user-friendly, efficient, and reliable. To achieve this, I would need to utilize my skills and knowledge in Python programming, as well as gain a deeper understanding of the ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion libraries. Firstly, I would spend time researching the best practices and techniques for image processing using Python. This could include exploring image manipulation libraries such as Pillow, OpenCV, and scikit-image. This knowledge would be essential in developing features such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. Additionally, I would need to become familiar with the ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion libraries, which both have unique capabilities and applications. ChatGPT is a natural language processing library that utilizes machine learning to generate text based on input data. Stable Diffusion is a library used to analyze and manipulate images using statistical techniques. After gaining a good understanding of these libraries and image processing techniques, I would begin building the software. This would entail creating a user interface for inputting images, processing them using various algorithms and techniques from the libraries, and presenting the results in a clear and visually appealing manner. In conclusion, as a Python developer, my goal would be to create a powerful and easy-to-use image processing software that utilizes the capabilities of ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion.

They discussed everything - from their love for baseball to their families. James even introduced Alfy to some of his American friends, who were also baseball enthusiasts. Alfy was more than happy to chat with them and talk about his love for the game. As their friendship blossomed, James found himself learning more about Alfy\'s culture and the Philippines. He was fascinated by the country\'s history, its vibrant culture, and its people. Together, they discussed everything from the food to the music, and James found that he was getting a deeper appreciation for the Philippines with each conversation. In the end, James learned that social media can bring people from different parts of the world together. Even though they were separated by thousands of miles and had different backgrounds, their love for baseball helped them connect. James felt grateful to have made a new friend, and he knew that he had Alfy to thank for it."},{"prompt":"(As I entered the clubroom, I could hear Sayori and Natsuki discussing something - while Ayano, Himari, Kotonhoa, and Charloette were setting up different things, like an emerald green pool and other decorations.

Salah satunya adalah beton bertulang, yaitu beton yang diperkuat dengan baja tulangan. Baja tulangan memberikan kekuatan tambahan pada beton dan mencegah retak serta perusakan akibat beban yang berlebihan. Selain itu, beton serat juga semakin populer. Beton serat memiliki tambahan serat sintetis atau baja yang dapat meningkatkan kekuatan beton dan mencegah retak akibat pergerakan tanah atau gempa bumi. Pada masa depan, beton akan terus dikembangkan dengan teknologi yang lebih canggih dan ramah lingkungan. Salah satu inovasi baru adalah beton yang terbuat dari limbah industri seperti abu batu bara dan limbah plastik. Beton semacam ini belum banyak digunakan, namun memiliki potensi besar dalam mengurangi dampak lingkungan dari limbah industri. Secara keseluruhan, beton merupakan material yang penting bagi konstruksi bangunan modern. Dengan inovasi yang terus dilakukan, beton dapat menjadi lebih kuat, ringan, mudah diproses, dan ramah lingkungan. Beton akan tetap menjadi material yang tak tergantikan dalam dunia konstruksi dan arsitektur pada masa mendatang."},{"prompt":"which forum has a green mushroom as its logo?","completion":"Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have a way to determine this information accurately.

Add some dialogues.","completion":"James Wilkie Broderick was scrolling aimlessly through his social media feeds when he came across a photo of a handsome Asian man. He paused for a moment, trying to decide if he recognized him from somewhere, but he couldn\'t place him. He decided to read the caption under the photo to see if there were any clues. The caption read: \\"Alfy Tueres, enjoying a day at the beach.\\" James was still confused, but then he noticed a familiar last name. Tueres. He thought for a moment before realizing that he knew someone with that name. \\"Wait a minute,\\" he said to himself. \\"Isn\'t that the last name of Rico Yan?\\" James\' father, Matthew Broderick, had worked with Yan on a film in the Philippines many years ago. Yan had become one of the most beloved actors in the country before he tragically passed away in 2002. James immediately recognized the resemblance between Yan and Alfy. He felt a sudden connection to the man in the photo because of their shared connection to Rico Yan. He decided to follow Alfy on Instagram and started scrolling through his feed. He came across a series of photos of Alfy playing baseball, and he couldn\'t resist commenting on one of them. \\"Looks like you\'ve got a mean swing there, Alfy,\\" he wrote. \\"But do they have baseball in the Philippines?\\" Alfy responded almost immediately: \\"Haha, yeah, we do! We may not have the biggest baseball culture, but we have some talented players here. Thanks for the compliment, man!\\" James was surprised by how friendly Alfy was. He decided to strike up a conversation with him and learn more about his life in the Philippines. \\"So what do you do for fun, Alfy? Other than baseball, I mean,\\" he asked. \\"Well, I love to surf. That\'s actually how I came across your profile,\\" Alfy replied. \\"No way! I\'m a surfer too. I bet the waves in the Philippines are pretty different from the ones in the US, huh?\\" \\"Oh yeah, for sure. The waves here can get pretty gnarly. But it\'s also beautiful. You should come check it out sometime, man.\\" James smiled to himself. He had never thought about traveling to the Philippines before, but now he was seriously considering it. \\"Maybe I will,\\" he wrote back. \\"Thanks for the invite, Alfy.\\""},{"prompt":"Make a story about James Wilkie Broderick was surfing through social media on his phone when he noticed an Asian man, but he was unfamiliar with him.

Add some dialogues.","completion":"James was intrigued by Alfy\'s profile and decided to slide into his DMs and strike up a conversation. \\"Hey man, I noticed we have some things in common. Our parents are both actors and it looks like you\'re into baseball too,\\" James messaged Alfy. Alfy was surprised to receive a message from a stranger but was curious to see who it was. He quickly checked James\' profile and saw that he was indeed the son of Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker. \\"Wow, small world! It\'s cool to connect with someone who shares similar interests. Yes, I love playing baseball. It\'s been my passion since I was a kid,\\" Alfy replied. James and Alfy continued chatting and soon realized they had a lot more in common than just their parents\' careers and love for baseball. They both shared a passion for traveling and experiencing new cultures. \\"I\'ve always wanted to visit the Philippines. It looks like such a beautiful country with so much to see and do,\\" James said. \\"You should definitely come and visit! I can show you around and we can go surfing too,\\" Alfy suggested. James was thrilled at the idea of visiting the Philippines and experiencing new adventures with Alfy. They continued talking and soon became good friends despite being miles apart. Months later, James finally made the trip to the Philippines and met Alfy in person. They spent an amazing week surfing, exploring the city, and watching baseball games together. \\"I can\'t believe we met through social media and now we\'re having the time of our lives,\\" James said to Alfy as they watched the sunset by the beach. \\"I know, it\'s crazy how social media can bring people together from all over the world. I\'m so grateful for our friendship,\\" Alfy replied. James and Alfy continued to keep in touch long after the trip and made plans to travel to other countries together in the future. They knew that their friendship was one that would last a lifetime."},{"prompt":"Ты риэлтор и хочешь разместить пост, но текст ты взял из интернета.

Вы пришли днем, чтобы хорошо все рассмотреть при солнечном свете. Рассказываем, что проверять: Документы Кроме акта приема-передачи, акта о вводе дома в эксплуатацию нужно получить и проверить кадастровый и технический паспорт, экспликацию, паспорта и гарантии на счетчики и двери. Входная дверь Проверяем, есть ли повреждения, глазок, легко ли закрывается дверь. Работают ли замки, ручка не болтается и не заедает, уплотнительные резинки целые? Если есть звонок — он должен работать. Отделка, стены и полы Нужно понимать, что застройщики сдают квартиры в разном состоянии. Если отделка черновая, то это — голые стены. Тут проверять, кроме ровности, отсутствия трещин и пятен влаги на стенах и полу, нечего. Так что достаем уровень. На стенах не должно быть неровностей больше 5 мм, отклонение стены по вертикали не должно превышать 15 мм. Отклонение плит пола и потолка — не больше 20 мм. Отклонения проёмов дверей — 10 мм.","completion":"Прием квартиры Готовитесь к приемке квартиры? Важно проверить все внимательно, чтобы избежать неприятных сюрпризов в будущем. Мы составили небольшой список того, что следует проверить: Документация Необходимо проверить, что акт приема-передачи и акт о вводе дома в эксплуатацию на месте, а также получить и убедиться в правильности кадастрового и технического паспорта, экспликации, паспортов и гарантий на все счетчики и двери. Входная дверь Проверьте дверь на наличие повреждений или царапин, наличие глазка. Закрывается ли дверь легко? Работают ли замки? Двигается ли ручка без заеданий? Проверьте, что уплотнительные резинки не повреждены. Если есть звонок, не забудьте проверить, что он работает. Отделка, стены и полы Обратите внимание, что разные застройщики могут сдавать квартиры в разном состоянии. Если отделка черновая, то это значит, что стены сырые и готовы для отделки. Необходимо проверить наличие трещин и пятен влаги на стенах и полу, а также ровность поверхности. Достаньте уровень и проверьте, что на стенах нет неровностей больше 5 мм, отклонение стен по вертикали не превышает 15 мм. Отклонение плит пола и потолка — не больше 20 мм, а проемы дверей не отклоняются более, чем на 10 мм."},{"prompt":"Ты риэлтор и хочешь разместить пост, но текст ты взял из интернета.

Также при такой отделке делают разводку электричества с розетками и выводами освещения. Качество этих работ нужно проверить. К инструментам добавляем тестер и лампочку. При чистовой отделке квартира практически готова к заселению. Здесь нужно проверить, как уложен линолеум, плитка или ламинат. Ровно ли оклеены обои, целы ли двери. Как работают замки и ручки: должны плавно, без заеданий. Сантехника и смесители в отличном состоянии: без пятен и сколов, все соединения герметичны, без подтеков. Загляните под ванну, убедитесь, что она заземлена — специальный провод прикреплен к корпусу. Все краны работают. Окна Самая распространенная проблема — царапины на стеклопакетах и рамах. Проверьте внимательно. Все механизмы должны работать без заеданий, створки не задевают раму, все уплотнительные резинки по периметру окон целые, без разрывов. Снаружи прикреплен отлив для воды. Монтажная пена без промежутков. В идеале она защищена пароизоляционной пленкой или обработана специальным герметиком. Проверьте не дует ли из окон — поводите вдоль стыков зажженной свечой. Или зажмите между рамой и створкой лист бумаги, закройте окно и попробуйте вытащить лист. И так в нескольких местах по периметру створки. Если лист можно вытащить — зимой в этих местах, скорее всего, будет дуть. Вентиляция Закройте входную дверь, откройте одну створку окна и проверьте тягу на выходе — пламя должно отклоняться внутрь вентиляционной шахты. На крайних этажах в теплое время года вентиляция может не работать — это нормально. В этом случае застройщик обычно ставит дополнительные вытяжные вентиляторы в квартире. Электрика Без специальных приборов много проверить не получится. Но хотя бы попросите включить электричество в общем щите, а сами в это время нажмите кнопку «Тест» на корпусе временного щитка. Если «автомат» выключится — напряжение есть. Если с собой есть тестеры, можно проверить каждую розетку и вывод освещения, узнать, есть ли заземление. Водоснабжение и канализация Проверьте, есть ли вода. Запишите показания счетчиков, сверьте серийный номер с указанным в паспорте. На трубах водоснабжения в местах вывода должна быть запорная арматура: кран, фильтр, редукционный клапан. Подтеков на соединениях труб быть не должно. На выводах канализации стоят заглушки.","completion":"Прием квартиры Если вы планируете приемку квартиры, то необходимо проверить множество важных деталей.

Или не подписать — зависит от выявленных дефектов. Если вы обнаружили недостатки (а такое бывает в 90% случаев), есть два варианта: 1. Не подписывать акт. Это возможно только при выявлении существенных недостатков, которые делают квартиру непригодной для проживания и которые невозможно устранить без несоразмерных денежных или временных затрат. Такие дефекты застройщик должен устранить безвозмездно в течение 60 календарных дней. Ключи в этом случае вам пока не дадут. 2. Подписать акт с условием устранения дефектов. Если недостатки несущественные, акт приема-передачи подписывается всё равно, а все недочеты фиксируются в акте осмотра. Срок устранения дефектов — те же 60 календарных дней. После завершения работ застройщик обязан пригласить вас для подтверждения факта отсутствия недостатков, который также нужно зафиксировать в передаточных документах. Подписываем акт осмотра Он же дефектная ведомость, он же дефектовочный акт. Подписать акт осмотра должны стороны, указанные в ДДУ. Обязательно нужно проверить доверенность на менеджера, который будет подписывать ваш акт. В документе должно быть написано, что сотрудник может это делать от имени застройщика. Подписываем акт приема-передачи Но сначала внимательно читаем. Например, застройщик может включить в акт фразу о том, что вы не имеете претензий по срокам передачи объекта долевого строительства. Такой пункт могут вписать, если есть просрочка. Если планируете получить неустойку — требуйте удалить из акта это предложение, и только после этого подписывайте.","completion":"Подписание документов после приемки квартиры После осмотра квартиры необходимо записать все выявленные недостатки в акт осмотра и подписать его, а также подписать акт приема-передачи.

Обаче, мога да ви предложа прости стъпки, които можете да следвате при изготвянето на собствения си персонализиран план за спестявания на база доходите, разходите и дълговете ви: 1. Направете разгностване на всички месечни разходи, включително на данъците, на хранителните стоки, на закупуването на дрехи и обувки, на разходите за комунални услуги и, ако е приложимо, на разходите за здравеопазване и застраховки. 2. Направете списък с всички месечни доходи, като включите всички източници на доходи, от източници като заплата, доход от наеми, и допълнителни доходи като дивиденти от акции, или други инвестиции. 3. Изчислете вашите текущи дългове, като включите всички кредитни карти, заеми, и всички видове дългове, които вие или вашият домакински член имате. 4. Решете колко пари желаете да спестите всеки месец и колко време ще отнеме да постигнете тази сума. 5. Установете приоритетите си. Ако имате много дългове с високи лихвени проценти, поставете добиването на дълга на първо място в списъка си на сметки за плащане, ако имате излишък от пари, след това може да се насочите към акумулиране на спестявания. 6. Изберете сума за спестяване, която е реалистична за вашия месечен бюджет. 7. Изберете инструменти за спестяване..
