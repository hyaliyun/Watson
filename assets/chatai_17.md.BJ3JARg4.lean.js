If within these two rows, there exist two columns where both cells are of the same color (either both are black or both are white), then the vertices of a rectangle formed by these two columns will fulfill the conditions of having cells of the same color at the vertices. The centers of these cells form the vertices of the desired 2 times 1 or 1 times 2 rectangle. 3. Suppose there are no such two columns within the first two rows where the cells are both black or both white. In this situation, at least five out of the seven columns must exhibit cells of different colors in the first two rows (one black and one white). 4. Now, within these five columns, at least three of these columns will have the same placement of black and white cells (if we assume \\"black on top\\" and \\"white on bottom\\"). This is derived using the pigeonhole principle, where we consider the arrangement of black and white cells in the top row to be either consistent or inconsistent across the columns. 5. Consider these three columns with the same arrangement of black and white cells. Then, in the third row, among these three columns, there must exist at least two cells of the same color (black or white). Let's subdivide the cases: - If these two matched cells are black, they align with the centers of the black cells in the first row of the same columns, forming a 1 times 2 rectangle. - If these two matched cells are white, they align with the centers of the white cells in the second row of the same columns, also forming a 1 times 2 rectangle. 6.

This is because for any i, a_i > b_i implies A beats B under rule R_i. - **Condition 3:** If A beats B and B beats C, then A also beats C. Suppose A beats B under rule R_i, so a_i > b_i. If B beats C under rule R_i, then b_i > c_i. Therefore, a_i > c_i, so A beats C under rule R_i. 3. **Prove that no other rules exist:** Assume there exists another rule R that is not one of the 100 rules R_i.

Consider the 100 weights, denoted as ( w_1, w_2, ldots, w_{100} ), such that the difference between the mass of any two weights is at most 20 grams.

We need to prove that we can distribute the weights into two groups of 50 weights each, such that the total weight difference of the two groups does not exceed 20 grams. 3. First, pair the weights arbitrarily into 50 pairs, each with two weights. Suppose the pairs are ((w_1, w_2), (w_3, w_4), ldots, (w_{99}, w_{100})). 4. Place the first pair ( (w_1, w_2) ) on different pans of the balance arbitrarily. Assume ( w_1 ) is placed on the left pan and ( w_2 ) on the right pan.

Repeat the above step for all pairs ((w_3, w_4), (w_5, w_6), ldots, (w_{99}, w_{100})). 7. As each step balances out the weights by placing a heavier weight on a lighter side, consider any configuration at a certain step where the weights on the left and right pans are ( A ) and ( B ) such that ( A leq B leq A + 20 ). 8. Now assume we place the pair ( (w_i, w_j) ) where ( w_i geq w_j ). The new weights on the pans will be: [ A' = A + w_i quad text{and} quad B' = B + w_j ] 9. Since ( A leq B ), we have: [ A' = A + w_i quad text{and} quad B' = B + w_j implies A + w_i leq B + w_j ] 10. The difference: [ |A' - B'| = |(A + w_i) - (B + w_j)| ] 11.

This ensures at every step the weight difference between the two sides is maintained within 20 grams. Since each pair adheres to this balancing strategy, the final difference after placing all weights will also be within 20 grams. # Conclusion: Thus, we can place the 100 weights on two pans of a balance, with 50 weights on each pan, such that the difference in total weight of the two pans does not exceed 20 grams.

For k neq 0, substituting the line into the hyperbola's equation, we get (1 - 2k^2)x^2 - 8k^2x - 8k^2 - 2 = 0. The discriminant Delta = 64k^4 + 4(1 - 2k^2)(8k^2 + 2) = 8 + 16k^2 is always positive. The sum of the roots is x_1 + x_2 = frac{8k^2}{1 - 2k^2}, so the midpoint M of AB is at coordinates left( frac{4k^2}{1 - 2k^2}, frac{2k}{1 - 2k^2} right). By condition, PM perp AB, so the slope of PM is k_{PM} = -frac{1}{k}. Substituting, we get frac{2k - 1 + 2k^2}{4k^2} = -frac{1}{k}, and upon solving, we arrive at k = frac{-3 pm sqrt{11}}{2}.

We use the Lifting The Exponent (LTE) lemma to analyze the (17)-adic valuation of both sides. According to the LTE lemma: [ nu_{17}(19^a - 2^a) = nu_{17}(19 - 2) + nu_{17}(a) = nu_{17}(17) + nu_{17}(a) = 1 + nu_{17}(a) ] Since (p) is a prime and (nu_{17}(p^b) geq 1), it follows that (p) must be (17). 4. Substitute (p = 17) into the original equation: [ 2^a + 17^b = 19^a ] 5. **Case 1: (17 nmid a)** - Since (17 nmid a), (nu_{17}(17^b) = 1), which implies (b = 1). - Substitute (b = 1) into the equation: [ 2^a + 17 = 19^a ] - We need to find (a) such that this equation holds. Testing small values of (a): - For (a = 1): [ 2^1 + 17 = 19^1 implies 2 + 17 = 19 implies 19 = 19 ] This is true, so (a = 1) works. - For (a > 1): [ 19^a - 2^a > 17 ] This inequality holds for all (a > 1), so no other values of (a) satisfy the equation. - Therefore, ((a, b, p) = (1, 1, 17)) is a solution. 6. **Case 2: (17 mid a)** - Let (a = 17k) for some positive integer (k). - Substitute (a = 17k) into the equation: [ 2^{17k} + 17^b = 19^{17k} ] - Consider the equation modulo 4: [ 2^{17k} + 17^b equiv 1 pmod{4} ] [ 19^{17k} equiv 3^{17k} equiv (-1)^{17k} equiv (-1)^k pmod{4} ] This forces (k) to be even, so let (k = 2n). - Substitute (k = 2n) into the equation: [ 2^{34n} + 17^b = 19^{34n} ] - Consider the equation modulo 6: [ 2^{34n} + 17^b equiv 2^{2n} + (-1)^b equiv 3 text{ or } 5 pmod{6} ] [ 19^{34n} equiv 1 pmod{6} ] This is a contradiction because (2^{2n} + (-1)^b) cannot be congruent to 1 modulo 6. - Therefore, there are no solutions when (17 mid a).

The leading coefficient of ( f_n(x) ) is 1. 2. All other coefficients of ( f_n(x) ) are integers. 3. The degree of ( f_n(x) ) is ( n ). **Base Case:** - For ( n = 1 ): [ f_1(x) = 2 T_1left(frac{x}{2}right) ] From the property of Chebyshev polynomials: [ T_1(x) = x ] Thus, [ f_1(x) = 2 left(frac{x}{2}right) = x ] The degree of ( f_1(x) ) is 1, the leading coefficient is 1, and there are no other coefficients. - For ( n = 2 ): [ f_2(x) = 2 T_2left(frac{x}{2}right) ] From the property of Chebyshev polynomials: [ T_2(x) = 2x^2 - 1 ] Thus, [ f_2(x) = 2 left(2left(frac{x}{2}right)^2 - 1right) = 2 left(2 frac{x^2}{4} - 1right) = 2 left(frac{x^2}{2} - 1right) = x^2 - 2 ] The degree of ( f_2(x) ) is 2, the leading coefficient is 1, and the other coefficient ((-2)) is an integer. **Induction Step:** Assume the statement is true for ( n ) and ( n-1 ): [ f_n(x) = 2 T_nleft(frac{x}{2}right) ] By the recurrence relation of Chebyshev polynomials: [ T_{n+1}(x) = 2x T_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x) ] Applying this to our function: [ f_{n+1}(x) = 2 T_{n+1}left(frac{x}{2}right) = 2 left(2 left(frac{x}{2}right) T_nleft(frac{x}{2}right) - T_{n-1}left(frac{x}{2}right)right) = 2 x left(frac{T_n(x)}{2}right) - 2 T_{n-1}left(frac{x}{2}right) ] Thus: [ f_{n+1}(x) = x f_n(x) - f_{n-1}(x) ] Now, checking the properties: 1. **Degree:** The degree of ( f_n(x) ) is ( n ) and the degree of ( f_{n-1}(x) ) is ( n-1 ). Thus, the degree of ( f_{n+1}(x) ) is ( n+1 ). 2. **Leading Coefficient:** The leading coefficient of ( f_n(x) ) is 1 and similarly for ( f_{n-1}(x) ). Therefore: [ f_{n+1}(x) = x f_n(x) - f_{n-1}(x) ] The leading term of ( x f_n(x) ) has the same leading coefficient as ( f_n(x) ). Thus, the leading coefficient of ( f_{n+1}(x) ) is also 1. 3. **Integer Coefficients:** ( f_n(x) ) and ( f_{n-1}(x) ) both have integer coefficients by the induction hypothesis. Subtracting polynomials with integer coefficients results in a polynomial with integer coefficients. Thus, ( f_{n+1}(x) ) has integer coefficients. Conclusion: By mathematical induction, ( f_n(x) = 2 T_nleft(frac{x}{2}right) ) has a leading coefficient of 1 and all coefficients are integers for all ( n ).

This ensures all lines parallel to the axes intersect with at least one cube: boxed{2} Step 2: Understanding the n = 3 case For an n = 3 cube, we need: 3 times 3 times 3 = 27 text{ unit cubes} Similarly, ensuring every line parallel to the axes intersects with at least one selected cube can be achieved by selecting 5 cubes: - Choose 3 unit cubes from 3 orthogonal planes. - Ensure mutual coverage. We find: 1 text{ central cube} + 4 text{ adjunct cubes} = 5 text{ cubes} boxed{5} Step 3: Understanding the n = 4 case For an n = 4 cube, we need: 4 times 4 times 4 = 64 text{ unit cubes} We can achieve the coverage by choosing 8 cubes to ensure each plane intersection is covered: 4 text{ central cubes on each plane} + 4 text{ outer adjacent cubes} = 8 text{ cubes} boxed{8} Step 4: Understanding the n = 10 case For an n = 10 cube, we need: 10 times 10 times 10 = 1000 text{ unit cubes} This translates to: - Select unit cubes in such a way that coverage includes each plane: frac{n^2}{2} = frac{10^2}{2} = 50 text{ cubes} boxed{50} Step 5: Generalizing the solution for any n Based on induction and patterns observed from the smaller cases: - When n is even, we need frac{n^2}{2} cubes. - When n is odd, we need frac{n^2 + 1}{2} cubes. Thus, the generalized formula for the minimum number of unit cubes required to cover every plane intersection is: A_n = begin{cases} frac{n^2}{2}, & text{if } n text{ is even} frac{n^2 + 1}{2}, & text{if } n text{ is odd} end{cases} With specific examples yielding: A_2 = 2, A_3 = 5, A_4 = 8, A_{10} = 50 In conclusion: - For any n geq 2, the minimum number of unit cubes to be selected such that every line parallel to the axes intersects at least one cube is given by A_n. boxed{A_n}"},{"prompt":"(left(left(frac{sqrt{a}1}{sqrt{a}+1}right)^{1} cdotleft(frac{sqrt{a}1}{sqrt{a}+1}right)^{1 / 2}sqrt{a1} cdot(sqrt{a}+1)^{1}right)^{2} cdot frac{1}{a^{2 / 3}+a^{1 / 3}+1}).","completion":"1. **Identify the domain of the expression, (mathcal{D})**: We need (a > 1) to ensure the expressions involved are valid (such as the presence of square roots).

This means that the graph is horizontally stretched, making it wider. This transformation changes the function to y=sin(x-frac{π}{3}) because stretching the x-coordinates by a factor of 2 is equivalent to dividing the coefficient of x by 2.

Set up the simplified equation representing the difference: [ f(x) - g(x) = (a + b - c) left( x^2 + x - 1 right). ] 4.

The arrangement must be such that: 1. Each red triangle must share an even number of sides with blue triangles. 2. Each blue triangle must share an odd number of sides with blue triangles. Show that such an arrangement is possible, and that the triangles placed at the vertices of the larger triangle are identical in color.","completion":"1. **Construction of the Triangle with Red Plates:** - According to the problem, we have to assemble a larger equilateral triangle using smaller equilateral triangles of unit side length, which are colored either red or blue. - We propose that one possible construction is by using only red plates. Let us denote red triangles by R and blue triangles by B. - In this construction: - No red triangle side will connect to a blue triangle side, as there are no blue triangles present. - Since all triangles are red, they naturally satisfy the condition that each red triangle has an even number of its sides (in this case, zero) connected to blue triangles, which is a pair number (zero is even). Thus, construction with only red plates satisfies the given conditions. 2. **Proving Symmetry and Same Color of Vertex Triangles:** - Next, we'll prove that in any valid assembly of the larger triangle, the plates at the vertices of the big triangle are of the same color. - We'll show that the pattern in the larger triangle is symmetric with respect to its altitudes. Firstly, we define the term \\"ensemble\\" to refer to a set consisting of a plate and all plates directly connected to it. These ensembles can have 2, 3, or 4 members, based on whether the central plate is located at the vertex, on the side, or inside the larger triangle, respectively. 3. **Analyzing the Symmetry Across Ensembles:** - For any ensemble, we determine that the color of any member plate dictates the color of the other member plates due to the problem conditions. - Specifically, any ensemble's set of blue plates will be even. This is because a red central plate must connect an even number of blue plates, and a blue central plate must connect an odd number of blue plates. 4. **Proving Symmetry by Rows:** - Consider the larger triangle subdivided into horizontal rows, as shown in the second diagram. - Rows are indexed such that the first row (topmost) has 1 triangle, the second has 3 triangles, and the k-th row has 2k-1 triangles. Each row contains (k-1) triangles pointing downward and k triangles pointing upward. - We use mathematical induction to prove symmetry: - Base case: The first two rows show symmetry about the central vertical line. - Inductive step: If symmetry holds for rows up to the k-th row, we show it also holds for the ((k+1))-th row. 5. **Ensuring Consistent Color Patterns:** - For the triangles pointing downwards in the ((k+1))-th row, these can be grouped into ensembles whose other members lie in the k-th row. By induction hypothesis, the ensemble members up to the k-th row are symmetrically colored, ensuring that same symmetry extends to the ((k+1))-th row. - For triangles pointing upwards in the ((k+1))-th row, consider the middle triangle upward and move outward symmetrically. By computing the parities of the blue adjacent triangles and leveraging the constraints given, we show symmetry persists. 6. **Conclusion Based on Symmetry:** - Given the horizontal and vertical symmetry explained, the three vertices of the larger (n) unit triangle must be the same color. Therefore, based on the given problem conditions and symmetry arguments, the properly assembled larger triangle with the constraints set forth will always have the same color plates at its vertices. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"worker ' s take home pay last year was the same each month , and she saved the same fraction of her take home pay each month . the total amount of money that she had saved at the end of the year was 2 times the amount of that portion of her monthly take home pay that she did not save . if all the money that she saved last year was from her take home pay , what fraction of her take home pay did she save each month ?","completion":"Let's denote the worker's monthly take-home pay as P and the fraction of the take-home pay that she saves each month as f.

This is because: - n equiv 0 pmod{3} implies n^2 equiv 0 pmod{3} - n equiv 1 pmod{3} implies n^2 equiv 1 pmod{3} - n equiv 2 pmod{3} implies n^2 equiv 1 pmod{3} (since 2^2 equiv 4 equiv 1 pmod{3}) 3. **Application to the Given Numbers:** Now, let’s determine the squares of numbers 1, 2, ldots, 1982 modulo 3. We notice: - Numbers 1, 2 modulo 3 are 1, 2 respectively. - This pattern repeats every 3 numbers since 1982 = 3 times 660 + 2. 4. **Counting Squares:** - Each set of 3 consecutive numbers has residues modulo 3 of 0, 1, 2, giving remainders 0, 1, 1 when squared. - Since 1982 = 660 times 3 + 2, there are 660 complete sets of 0, 1, 2 and a remainder sequence 1, 2. 5. **Summation of Squares Modulo 3:** - Each complete set of 3 numbers contributes 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 to the sum modulo 3. - Therefore: [ text{Sum of residues from } 1 text{ to } 1980 = 660 times 2 = 1320 ] - The residues of 1981^2 and 1982^2 can be calculated directly: [ 1981 equiv 1 pmod{3} implies 1981^2 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] [ 1982 equiv 2 pmod{3} implies 1982^2 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] - So, adding these: [ 1320 + 1 + 1 = 1322 equiv 2 pmod{3} ] 6. **Conclusion:** - The sum of all these squares modulo 3 is 2.

Therefore, x=3 satisfies the condition of being a tangent. If the tangent line has a slope, let's denote it as k. The equation of the line can then be written as y-1=k(x-3), or equivalently kx-y+1-3k=0.

This indicates that as x increases, hat{y} decreases, which is characteristic of a negative correlation between variables x and y. Therefore, statement A is indeed correct. **For statement B:** To verify the correctness of statement B, we first calculate the mean values of x and y from the given data: - Mean of x, denoted as overline{x}, is calculated as: [ overline{x} = frac{1}{4} times (6 + 8 + 10 + 12) = frac{36}{4} = 9 ] - Mean of y, denoted as overline{y}, is calculated as: [ overline{y} = frac{1}{4} times (6 + m + 3 + 2) = frac{11 + m}{4} ] Substituting overline{x} = 9 into the regression equation hat{y}=-0.4x+7.6, we get: [ frac{11 + m}{4} = -0.4 times 9 + 7.6 ] Solving for m, we find: [ frac{11 + m}{4} = -3.6 + 7.6 = 4 ] [ 11 + m = 16 ] [ m = 5 ] Hence, statement B is correct as it accurately states that the value of m is equal to 5. **For statement C:** The correlation coefficient, denoted as r, is not directly given by the slope of the regression line.

The correlation coefficient involves both the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, but its value is not solely determined by the regression coefficient.

Find the smallest possible value of k.","completion":"Let's analyze the problem step by step. 1. **Properties of the Number Set:** According to the problem, any five-digit number, where all digits are in non-decreasing order, should share at least one digit with one of the numbers ( N_1 ) or ( N_k ) in at least one position. 2. **Non-solution with One Number:** The set with the stated properties can't consist of a single number. To see why, consider any five-digit number ( N = overline{abcde} ) with digits in non-decreasing order. We can always construct another number ( G = overline{gg9gg} ) (where ( g ) is a digit different from ( 0 ) and different from each of ( a, b, c, d, e )) that differs from ( N ) in all positions. This means that a single number ( N_1 ) can always be avoided, so more numbers are required. 3. **Selection of Two Numbers:** We need to show that at least two numbers are required. Let's see if the numbers ( N_1 = 13579 ) and ( N_2 = 12468 ) satisfy the conditions. 4. **General Form of Numbers:** Let ( A = overline{a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5} ) be any five-digit number with non-decreasing digits, meaning ( 1 le a_1 le a_2 le a_3 le a_4 le a_5 ). 5. **Analyzing Non-overlapping with ( N_1 ) and ( N_2 ):** If ( A ) does not overlap with ( N_1 ) in any position, we must have ( a_5 le 7 ) (since the digit 9 appears in ( N_1 ) and would cover any value greater than 7). Hence, ( a_4 le 7 ). - If ( a_3 le a_4 le a_5 le 7 ) and there is no overlap with ( N_1 ) in the tens place, then ( a_4 le 5 ) (since tens digit in ( N_1 ) is 7 and in ( N_2 ) is 6). - Further, if ( a_2 le a_3 le a_4 le 5 ) and no overlap occurs in the hundreds place, then ( a_3 le 3 ). - Continuing, we note that ( a_2 le a_3 le 3 ). If there is no overlap in the hundreds place, ( a_2 ) must not be 2 or 3 (since those are covered by ( N_1 ) and ( N_2 ) respectively). 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, ( a_1 = 1 ) remains. This forces an overlap in the units place between ( A ) and ( N_1 ) or ( N_2 ). Hence demonstrating that every number ( A ) has at least one digit in common in one of the positions with either ( N_1 ) or ( N_2 ).

Using ( x = 105 ) to solve for ( y ) and ( z ): - From the first equation, ( frac{1}{105} + frac{1}{y} = frac{1}{70} ): [ frac{1}{y} = frac{1}{70} - frac{1}{105} = frac{3}{210} - frac{2}{210} = frac{1}{210} ] Thus: [ y = 210 text{ minutes} ] - From the second equation, ( frac{1}{105} + frac{1}{z} = frac{1}{84} ): [ frac{1}{z} = frac{1}{84} - frac{1}{105} = frac{5}{420} - frac{4}{420} = frac{1}{420} ] Thus: [ z = 420 text{ minutes} ] 6.

The solution can be broken down into these clear steps: 1. **Define Inversion Center**: Considering the problem, we perform an inversion with the center at one end of the segment, say ( A ). 2. **Analyze Inversion**: Under this inversion, the configuration shown (a segment ( AB ) with inscribed tangent circles) transforms as follows: - ( A ) remains fixed under inversion. - ( B ) maps to some point ( B^* ). 3. **Effect on Inscribed Circles**: The inscribed tangent circles originally within the segment ( AB ) now map to a set of tangent circles within an angle with vertex at ( B^* ). - The tangent points of these circles must lie on the angle bisector of the new angle at ( B^* ). 4. **Identify the Set of Points**: The set of tangency points of the transformed configuration is along the angle bisector of the angle at ( B^*). 5. **Map Back to Original Configuration**: The set of points on the angle bisector in the transformed space (after inversion centered at ( A )) maps back to a specific curve in the original space due to the properties of inversion. 6. **Resulting Set**: The desired set of tangency points in the original configuration corresponds to the arc of a circle. This arc has endpoints at ( A ) and ( B ). Furthermore, it bisects the angle between the arc forming the segment and the chord ( AB ). **Conclusion**: The set of tangency points of all possible pairs of tangent circles inscribed in the segment is an arc of a circle with endpoints at ( A ) and ( B ).

Since they run up and down the bleachers 60 times, and there are 45 stairs one way, the total number of stairs climbed for one round trip (up and down) is 45 stairs up + 45 stairs down = 90 stairs. Now, multiply the number of stairs per round trip by the number of times they run up and down: 90 stairs/round trip * 60 round trips = 5400 stairs.

Here, two independent organizations, GSA and AWRA, have both measured the length of the river Rio-Coralio, yielding slightly different results, each with a margin of error. Let's break down the given data and calculate the error probability as requested: Step 1: Interpret the Measurements 1. **GSA Measurement:** - Length = 402 km - Margin of error = ±500 m (or ±0.5 km) - Probability of error = 0.04 2. **AWRA Measurement:** - Length = 403 km - Margin of error = ±500 m (or ±0.5 km) - Probability of error = 0.04 Step 2: Understand the Distribution of Errors Given the error margin of ±0.5 km from both measurements, the probability that the true length of the river differs from the measured value can be depicted as follows: - Probability that the true length is greater than the measured value + 0.5 km is 0.02. - Probability that the true length is less than the measured value - 0.5 km is 0.02. Step 3: Calculate Cumulative Probability When combining the results from the two measurements, the combined result would be somewhere between their error margins. Given each result has an independent error of 0.02 probability in either direction, we can combine these probabilities. For the GSA measurement: - Probability true length is greater than 402.5 km: (0.02) - Probability true length is less than 401.5 km: (0.02) And for the AWRA measurement: - Probability true length is greater than 403.5 km: (0.02) - Probability true length is less than 402.5 km: (0.02) # Step 4: Determine Overlapping Useful Range Both measurements fall within 402 ± 0.5 km and 403 ± 0.5 km: - GSA's range: ([401.5, 402.5]) - AWRA's range: ([402.5, 403.5]) Since the overlap of the ranges, where there is the combined probability, is the segment ([402, 402.5]), we consider how the error distributions intersect. # Step 5: Combine Probabilities The probabilities for the non-overlapping portions are: [ P(text{true length} > 402.5 text{ or } < 402) = 2 times 0.02 = 0.04 ] Thus, the confidence for the non-error measurement: [ P(text{true length} = 402.5 text{ km}) = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96 ] Conclusion: The statistician combines the data correctly, given both independent measurements with random unbiased error show high consistency.

We need to show that lines (AA'), (BB'), and (CC') are concurrent or parallel. 2. **Orthocenter Coincidence**: Let (H) be the common orthocenter of both triangles (ABC) and (A'B'C'). Since the orthocenter is the intersection of the altitudes, this implies that the altitudes of both triangles intersect at (H). 3. **Rotation and Similarity**: Since (ABC) and (A'B'C') are similar with different orientation, there exists a rotation (or rotation followed by a reflection) that maps (ABC) to (A'B'C'). Let this transformation be denoted by (T). 4. **Transformation Properties**: The transformation (T) preserves angles and ratios of lengths but reverses orientation. Therefore, (T) maps the orthocenter (H) of (ABC) to the orthocenter (H) of (A'B'C'), which is the same point (H). 5. **Concurrent or Parallel Lines**: Consider the lines (AA'), (BB'), and (CC'). Under the transformation (T), point (A) maps to (A'), point (B) maps to (B'), and point (C) maps to (C'). Since (T) is a similarity transformation, it preserves the collinearity and parallelism of lines. 6. **Homothety and Reflection**: The transformation (T) can be decomposed into a homothety (scaling) centered at (H) followed by a reflection. The homothety ensures that lines through corresponding points (like (A) and (A')) are either concurrent at (H) or parallel. 7. **Conclusion**: Since (T) is a similarity transformation that includes a reflection, the lines (AA'), (BB'), and (CC') must either be concurrent at a single point (which could be (H)) or parallel to each other.

If it is possible to convert the matrix ( A ) to a matrix with all zeroes using a finite number of such operations, we call ( A ) a “good matrix”. The problem asks for the number of good matrices ( A ). Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Matrix Operations and Representation**: - Suppose we reduce the matrix ( A ) to a zero matrix by adding or subtracting values from its rows and columns. - Let ( x_i ) be the value subtracted from the elements of the ( i )-th row. - Let ( y_j ) be the value subtracted from the elements of the ( j )-th column. 2. **Matrix Representation**: - Each element ( a_{ij} ) in the matrix ( A ) can be represented as ( a_{ij} = x_i + y_j ). 3. **Uniqueness of Elements**: - Since all elements ( a_{ij} ) are unique and cover the set ( {1, 2, ldots, p^2} ): - ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_p ) must be distinct, and ( y_1, y_2, ldots, y_p ) must also be distinct. - Otherwise, assuming ( x_1 = x_2 ) leads to a contradiction by implying repeated elements in ( A ). 4. **Row and Column Exchange Invariance**: - Permutations of rows and columns do not affect whether a matrix is \\"good\\".

Suppose ( k+1 ) is not in the first row. - Consider ( a_{21} = k+1 ). 7. **Constructing Tiles**: - Verify that subsequent groups of elements (blocks) fit this property. If true, all previous rows fit into blocks of size ( k ): - The contradiction arises showing the first row must be ( 1, 2, ldots, p ), and similarly for other rows ( (k-1)p+1 ) to ( kp ). 8. **Form of Good Matrix**: - A good matrix ( A ) occurs if it can be permuted (rows/columns) and reflected about the main diagonal. Thus, each unique good matrix has only factorial permutations: - Combining row and column permutations, ( A ) results in ( (p!)^2 ). - Doubling this for row/column and diagonal symmetries. 9. **Counting Good Matrices**: - The total number of unique good matrices is ( 2 times (p!)^2 ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{2(p!)^2} ]"},{"prompt":"Calculate the product of 1101_2 and 102_3 in base 10.","completion":"First, we need to convert the binary number 1101_2 and the ternary number 102_3 into base 10. 1.

This theorem also holds in the base12 numbering system.","completion":"1. **Understanding the problem**: We need to prove that a multi-digit perfect square cannot have all digits as odd numbers. Furthermore, the theorem must be validated in base-12 as well. 2. **Consider a general odd number in base-10**: Any odd number can be represented in the form: [ n = 10a + b ] where (a) is any non-negative integer, and (b) is an odd digit (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9). 3. **Square the number**: [ n^2 = (10a + b)^2 = 100a^2 + 2 cdot 10ab + b^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2 ] Here, we need to focus on the term involving (b^2) to understand its role in the overall digit structure of (n^2). 4. **Compute (b^2) for (b = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) in base-10**: Let's calculate (b^2) for each (b): - (1^2 = 1) - (3^2 = 9) - (5^2 = 25) - (7^2 = 49) - (9^2 = 81) Observe the last digit of each result: - (1) and (9) remain single digits. - (25), (49), and (81) have last digits 5, 9, and 1 respectively. Observe the tens place: - (25) has a tens digit of 2 (even). - (49) has a tens digit of 4 (even). - (81) has a tens digit of 8 (even). As (b^2) contributes at least one even digit in our scenarios (specifically, the tens place in multi-digit cases), the combination (100a^2 + 20ab + b^2) inherently contains at least one even digit on the tens place (or higher). 5. **Conclusion in base-10**: Therefore, it is impossible for (n^2) to have all its digits as odd. This contradicts the premise that a multi-digit perfect square can be composed entirely of odd digits. 6. **Validation in base-12**: The computation and reasoning extend similarly to base-12. 7. **Transformation to base-12**: - (n = 12a + b), where (b) is odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 in base-12). 8. **Square in base-12**: [ n^2 = (12a + b)^2 = 144a^2 + 24ab + b^2 ] Calculate (b^2) for each odd (b) in base-12: - (b = 1 : 1^2 = 1) - (b = 3 : 3^2 = 9) - (b = 5 : 5^2 = 21) (12 + 9) - (b = 7 : 7^2 = 41) (36 + 5) - (b = 9 : 9^2 = 69) (6*12 + 9) - (b = 11 : 11^2 = tau 1) (( tau = 10 ), (11^2 = 121) in base-12) Similar analysis: for (b)’s squares that produce multi-digit results in base-12 (like 21, 41, 69, ( tau 1)), at least one of the computed digits in the tens (or higher place) is even. 9. **Conclusion in base-12**: The analysis confirms that even in base-12, a multi-digit perfect square cannot be composed entirely of odd digits.

Hence, there are two possible slopes for line l that could yield the area of 2 for the enclosed triangle with the coordinate axes. However, we need to consider both positive and negative intercepts on the axes formed by the extended lines for both slopes. For example, a line with a positive slope (such as m=3) can intersect the axes in quadrants I and III, forming two different triangles with the required area. Similarly, the line with a negative slope (m=-1) can also form two triangles in quadrants II and IV.

Write ( P(x) = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)Q(x) ) for some nonzero polynomial ( Q ) and distinct integers ( a, b, c ). - If ( P(x) = 2 ), then we require ({x-a, x-b, x-c} = {2, 1, -1}) or ({1, -1, -2}).

The only polynomial of degree at most ( d ) which has at least ( d+1 ) roots is the zero polynomial, which cannot have degree ( d ). 8. **Conclusion:** - Thus, ( d geq 4 ) fails, and the only possible values for ( d ) are ( d leq 3 ).

The inclination angle is reduced by 20° - 10° = 10°, making the original and new incline angles supplementary to each other within a larger triangle formed by the extended base. To find the extended length, we have to consider the relationship between the hypotenuse and the base, which is associated with the cosine of the angle. For the original configuration with the slope at an inclination angle of 20°, the base of the slope can be calculated using the cosine function: [ text{Base (original)} = text{Hypotenuse} times cos(20°) = 1 times cos(20°) text{ kilometers}.] Now, when the angle is reduced to 10°, the new base length will be: [ text{Base (new)} = text{Hypotenuse} times cos(10°) = 1 times cos(10°) text{ kilometers}.] To determine the extended part of the base, we subtract the original base from the new base: [ text{Extension} = text{Base (new)} - text{Base (original)} ] [ text{Extension} = cos(10°) - cos(20°) text{ kilometers}.] Since cos(10°) is larger than cos(20°), the result will be positive, which means the base is indeed extended. However, the answer options provided do not match this result. Assuming a possible simplification, let's inspect the answer choices more closely. If the slope were projected onto the ground without changing its length, the base at a 10° incline would be the hypotenuse times the cosine of 10°. Since the slope length is unchanged (1 kilometer), this projection would be exactly 1 kilometer at 0° incline. In simple terms, the original problem description implies that no matter the angle, the slope (hypotenuse) is 1 kilometer. So when flat on the ground (0° incline), the slope covers 1 kilometer horizontally. Therefore, reducing the inclination to 10° would result in the same horizontal length.

Let's denote the triangular pyramid (tetrahedron) with a base ABC and apex D.

Let alpha be the angle between the planes of any lateral face and the base plane ABC. Let h be the height of the pyramid from the apex D to the base plane ABC. 3. The projection of point D onto the base plane is denoted as point P. We know that P lies in the base plane and the distance from D to P is precisely h. 4. Consider the distance from point P to any edge of the base, say AB. This distance is given by h cdot cot(alpha). To understand this step, we need to observe that the shortest distance from the vertex perpendicular to the plane gives the height of the pyramid, and considering the angle alpha formed with the base plane, the vertical height component along the normal of the base plane is h, while the other corresponding horizontal component directly gives the distance to the edge. 5. By examining the scenario geometrically, we see that if the angles (dihedral angles) between the base and the side faces of the pyramid are equal, many important properties come into play. To solidify this, let's use the concept of the correspondence between equal dihedral angles and the properties of the projection related to incircles and excircles of the base triangles. 6. If the dihedral angles at each edge of the base are equal, the projection P indeed becomes special. It is no ordinary centroidal property but a centralized locus in the sense of tangency and circle properties in planar Tetrahedral structures. Specifically, P must exactly be the center of the circle encompassing tangent distances equal due to symmetrical slope equivalencies. Hence, P is the incenter or the excenter for the circumcircle of the triangle ABC. # Conclusion: - If the dihedral angles of the pyramid's side faces to the base plane are all equal, then the projection of the pyramid's apex onto the base plane is the center of the inscribed or escribed circle of the base triangle. # Final Answer: [ boxed{text{Confirmed, the projection of the apex on the base is the incenter or excenter of the base triangle's circle.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Toothpicks of equal length are used to construct a rectangular grid.

From the original problem solution, we know lfloor x rfloor - {x} = {x} and thus {x} = x - lfloor x rfloor. This implies lfloor x rfloor = 2{x}. Since, lfloor x rfloor = 2 {x}, and {x} could be either 0 or frac{1}{2}, let's test {x} = frac{1}{2} leading lfloor x rfloor = 1 and x=1+frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2}. Now, {x}^2 = left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = frac{1}{4}, and {{x}^2} = frac{1}{4}. The common difference of the sequence is {x} - {{x}^2} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{4}.

Since x is an even integer and y and z are odd integers, the smallest difference between x and y (to ensure y is greater than x) is 2 (because the next odd number after an even number is exactly 2 units away). However, since y - x must be greater than N, and we are looking for the least possible value of z - x to be 7, we need to find the smallest odd y that satisfies both conditions. Let's start with the smallest possible even x, which is 2 (the smallest positive even integer). The next odd integer y would be 2 + 2 = 4, but since 4 is even, we must choose the next odd integer, which is 5. So, the smallest y that is greater than the smallest even x is 5. Therefore, y - x = 5 - 2 = 3. But y - x must be greater than N, so N must be less than 3 for this to be the smallest possible y that satisfies y - x > N. Now, we need to find the smallest possible odd z such that z - x is at least 7. Starting with x = 2, the smallest z that satisfies this is z = 2 + 7 = 9 (which is also odd, as required). So we have: - x = 2 (even) - y = 5 (odd, and y - x = 3) - z = 9 (odd, and z - x = 7) Since y - x > N and y - x = boxed{3,} the greatest possible value for N is just less than 3.

Hence, ( T_2 = A_1 B_1 C_1 ). 2. Since ( A_1, B_1, ) and ( C_1 ) are midpoints of the arcs, the lines ( AA_1, BB_1, ) and ( CC_1 ) are angle bisectors of triangle ( T_1 ).

We aim to show that line ( KO ) is parallel to line ( AC ). 4. In triangle ( AB_1O ), since ( B_1C_1 ) is both an angle bisector and an altitude, ( AB_1O ) forms an isosceles triangle. This is because the angle at vertex ( O ) is bisected and both sides ( OB_1 ) and ( OB_2 ) are equal (radii of the circumcircle). 5. Consequently, examining triangle ( AKO ), where ( K ) is the point of intersection of lines ( AB ) and ( C_1B_1 ), we see that this triangle is also isosceles, which results in ( KO ) being parallel to ( AC ). 6. This follows from the property that corresponding angles formed between a transversal intersecting two parallel lines must be equal. These angles are (angle K O A = angle K A O = angle O A C). In conclusion, the diagonals connecting opposite vertices of the hexagon formed by the intersection of triangles ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ) are indeed parallel to the sides of triangle ( T_1 ) and intersect at a single point, completing the proof.

First, let's determine how many circuits the squirrel makes as it travels up the 36-foot-tall post. Since it makes one circuit for each rise of 4.5 feet, we divide the total height of the post by the rise per circuit: Number of circuits = Total height of post / Rise per circuit Number of circuits = 36 feet / 4.5 feet per circuit Number of circuits = 8 Now that we know the squirrel makes 8 circuits, we can calculate the total horizontal distance it travels by multiplying the number of circuits by the circumference of the post: Total horizontal distance = Number of circuits × Circumference of post Total horizontal distance = 8 × 4 feet Total horizontal distance = 32 feet To find the total distance the squirrel travels, we need to consider both the vertical and horizontal distances. Each circuit forms a right triangle with the vertical rise of 4.5 feet and the horizontal distance of 4 feet (the circumference of the post). The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the actual path the squirrel travels for each circuit.

However, this is also true for a rhombus or a square, not exclusively a rectangle. Therefore, having AB=AD alone cannot guarantee that ABCD is a rectangle. - **Option B: ACbot BD** This condition means that the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular to each other. While this is a characteristic of some rectangles (when the diagonals are also equal), it is not a definitive condition for all rectangles, as other quadrilaterals like kites can also have perpendicular diagonals. Thus, ACbot BD alone does not ensure that ABCD is a rectangle. - **Option C: AB=AC** If one side of the parallelogram is equal to a diagonal, this does not necessarily imply a rectangle. This could indicate a rhombus or other types of quadrilaterals where a side can be equal in length to a diagonal. Hence, AB=AC cannot solely confirm that ABCD is a rectangle. - **Option D: AC=BD** For a parallelogram, if the diagonals are equal, it indicates that the parallelogram is a rectangle.

We denote the sums of the elements in each row and column by r_i and c_j respectively. The goal is to determine for which values of n the sums of all rows and columns are distinct. 2. **Range and Total Sum Constraints:** The possible sums for any row or column of an n times n array where each entry is either -1, 0, or 1 are integers from -n to n. Hence, we have 2n sums (from r_1 to r_n and c_1 to c_n) and they all must be distinct. 3. **Counting Distinct Sums:** Since each of these sums must take a unique value from the set {-n, -n+1, ldots, n-1, n }, clearly one value within this range will be unused because the total number of sums 2n is greater than 2n-1 (the number of elements in {-n, -n+1, ldots, n-1, n}). 4. **Nonnegative and Nonpositive Sums:** We can expect that out of 2n sums, at least n will be nonnegative and n will be nonpositive. Let's assume without loss of generality that r_1, r_2, ldots, r_k and c_1, c_2, ldots, c_{n-k} are nonnegative.

This result can be derived from properties of numbers in base 10. 3. **Digit Sum Analysis:** Consider a number ( k ) that is a multiple of ( n ) and contains only the digits 0 and 1.

This coloring is done independently for each edge. 2. **Fix a Set of ( k ) Vertices:** Consider a fixed subset of ( k ) vertices from ( K_n ). There are (binom{k}{2}) edges between these ( k ) vertices. We need to calculate the probability that all these edges are the same color. 3. **Probability Calculation:** The probability that all (binom{k}{2}) edges between ( k ) vertices are all yellow (or all purple) is: [ 2 times left( frac{1}{2} right)^{binom{k}{2}} = 2^{1 - binom{k}{2}} ] 4. **Union Bound:** To find the probability that there exists at least one monochromatic ( k )-clique in ( K_n ), we use the union bound.

This can be observed using simple approximations or induction. Thus, it follows that for ( k ge 3 ), the inequality holds, ensuring the probability is less than 1. # Conclusion: This shows that for ( k ge 3 ) and ( n > 2^{k/2} ), it is possible to color the edges of ( K_n ) such that no monochromatic ( k )-cliques exist.

Let's denote the medians of ( triangle ABC ) as ( AM_a ), ( BM_b ), and ( CM_c ), where ( M_a ), ( M_b ), and ( M_c ) are the midpoints of sides ( BC ), ( AC ), and ( AB ) respectively. 2. **Intersection of Medians**: - The centroid ( G ) (or ( O )) is the point of intersection of the medians of ( triangle ABC ). - To find this point, we first need to find the midpoints of each side of the triangle. 3. **Constructing the Midpoints**: - Use a compass and a straightedge to find the midpoints: - Draw the midpoint ( M_a ) of side ( BC ) by setting the compass width to more than half the length of ( BC ), drawing arcs from points ( B ) and ( C ) to intersect at two points, and then connecting those intersection points to locate ( M_a ). - Repeat this process to find the midpoints ( M_b ) of side ( AC ) and ( M_c ) of side ( AB ). 4. **Constructing the Medians**: - Draw the medians of ( triangle ABC ) using the midpoints found: - Connect vertex ( A ) to ( M_a ) (median ( AM_a )). - Connect vertex ( B ) to ( M_b ) (median ( BM_b )). - Connect vertex ( C ) to ( M_c ) (median ( CM_c )). 5. **Locating the Centroid**: - The centroid ( G ), also known as the center of mass or the barycenter, is located at the intersection of the medians. By construction, this point divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, where the longer segment is between the vertex and the centroid. 6. **Properties of the Centroid**: - The centroid ( G ) has the property that it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. - The area of each of the smaller triangles formed with the centroid (i.e., ( triangle ABG ), ( triangle BCG ), and ( triangle CAG )) is equal. By this property, ( S_{ABG} = S_{BCG} = S_{CAG} = frac{1}{3} S_{ABC} ). 7. **Verification of Areas**: - Since the centroid divides the triangle into three triangles of equal area, we have: [ S_{AOG} = S_{BOC} = S_{COA} = frac{1}{3} S_{ABC} ] - Therefore, the point ( M ) which ensures that the areas of ( triangle ABM ), ( triangle BCM ), and ( triangle CAM ) are equal is the centroid ( G ). 8. **Conclusion**: - The required point ( M ) is the centroid of the triangle.

Let's choose a checker, say at position (i,j). 2. Perform the operation of flipping all checkers in the same row i and the same column j, including the selected checker itself. 3. Note that the chosen checker (i,j) is flipped when we perform the operation on row i and is flipped again when we perform the operation on column j. Therefore, the chosen checker (i,j) is flipped an odd number of times. 4. All other checkers in the row i and column j are flipped exactly twice (once when flipping the row and once when flipping the column), which means they return to their original states (since flipping twice is equivalent to no flip).

This observation is key because if you start with exactly half black (15 black) and half white checkers, each operation changes the color of an even number of checkers. Mathematical reasoning: Upon each operation, the total number of flips must preserve the parity of the number of black checkers. Thus, since there are an odd number of black checkers initially (15), and an even number of flips cannot change the odd parity to even, it is impossible to end with all white (0 black, which is even).

(1) Since tan alpha = 2, we can replace the tan alpha in the numerator. However, we need to first rewrite the expression using only sin alpha and cos alpha. Given: tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} = 2 We rewrite the expression as: frac{sin alpha + 2cos alpha}{4cos alpha -sin alpha} Notice that this looks similar to frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} + frac{2cos alpha}{cos alpha} divided by frac{4cos alpha}{cos alpha} - frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha}, which simplifies the expression since we know tan alpha = 2. By substitution of tan alpha: frac{sin alpha + 2cos alpha}{4cos alpha -sin alpha} = frac{tan alpha + 2}{4 - tan alpha} Now we input the value of tan alpha: = frac{2 + 2}{4 - 2} = frac{4}{2} = 2 So, boxed{frac{sin alpha + 2cos alpha}{4cos alpha -sin alpha} = 2}. (2) To evaluate sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha, we can use the identity sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1 to express the entire expression over a common denominator of 1. sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha = frac{sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha}{sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha} Again, replace frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} with tan alpha and cos^2 alpha with 1 - sin ^2 alpha where necessary: = frac{tan alpha cos^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha}{tan^2 alpha cos^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha} Since cos^2 alpha is a common factor in the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out: = frac{tan alpha + 1}{tan^2 alpha + 1} Now replace tan alpha with its known value: = frac{2 + 1}{2^2 + 1} = frac{3}{5} Thus, boxed{sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha = frac{3}{5}}."},{"prompt":"A point (x,y) is randomly picked from inside the rectangle with vertices (0,0), (4,0), (4,1), and (0,1).

The base of this triangle is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,1), which is 1 unit long.

We express u^2 as: [ u^2 = (3^x + 3^{-x})^2 = 3^{2x} + 2 + 3^{-2x} ] Thus, 3^{2x} + 3^{-2x} = u^2 - 2. Substituting this into the expression for g(x), we get: [ g(x) = u^2 - 2 + 3mu + m^2 - 1 = u^2 + 3mu + m^2 - 3 ] Now, analyzing the function for its minimum value based on the value of m: When -frac{3m}{2} leq 2, i.e., m geq -frac{4}{3}, the function y = u^2 + 3mu + m^2 - 3 is monotonically increasing for u geqslant 2.

When -frac{3m}{2} > 2, i.e., m < -frac{4}{3}, the minimum of y occurs at u = -frac{3m}{2} because the function is monotonically decreasing before this point and monotonically increasing after. Thus: [ y_{min} = left(-frac{3m}{2}right)^2 + 3m cdot left(-frac{3m}{2}right) + m^2 - 3 = -frac{5}{4}m^2 - 3 ] Therefore, g(x)_{min} = boxed{-frac{5}{4}m^2 - 3} for m < -frac{4}{3}. **Conclusion:** Hence, the minimum value of the function g(x) is given by: [ boxed{ begin{cases} -frac{5}{4}m^2 - 3, & m < -frac{4}{3} m^2 + 6m + 1, & m geq -frac{4}{3} end{cases} } ]"},{"prompt":"A chemical factory plans to invest in a new production line, but this requires approval from the environmental protection department before it can go into production.

You'll try the keys ten times because of one suitcase, and because of ten a whole hundred times! Let’s summarize the essence briefly. A salesperson said that the number of attempts is no more than (10+9+8+ldots+2+1=55), and another employee proposed to reduce the number of attempts since if the key does not fit 9 suitcases, it will definitely fit the tenth one. Thus, the number of attempts is no more than (9+8+ldots+1=45). Moreover, they stated that this will only occur in the most unfortunate scenario when each time the key matches the last suitcase. It should be expected that in reality the number of attempts will be roughly [frac{1}{2} times text{the maximum possible number of attempts} = 22.5.] Igor Fedorovich Akulich from Minsk wondered why the expected number of attempts is half the number 45. After all, the last attempt is not needed only if the key does not fit any suitcase except the last one, but in all other cases, the last successful attempt also takes place. Akulich assumed that the statement about 22.5 attempts is unfounded, and in reality, it is a bit different. **Problem:** Find the expected value of the number of attempts (all attempts to open the suitcases are counted unsuccessful and successful, in the case where there is no clarity).","completion":"We will solve the problem in the general form, assuming we have n suitcases.

The event Y = n-1 occurs with probability frac{2}{n}, as it can happen in two equally probable cases: either the (n-1)-th or the n-th key is the suitable one.

Since line l is tangent to the circle x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1, the distance from the circle's center (0, 1) to line l must be equal to the radius of the circle.

Consider the seating arrangement in the parliament of the island state Promenade-and-Tornado, where there are 2019 native inhabitants who are either knights (always tell the truth) or liars (always lie). The seats are arranged in a rectangular layout of size ( 42 times 48 ), which gives a total of ( 42 times 48 = 2016 ) seats. The remaining 3 are the seats for the president and their deputies. 2. Suppose we need to determine the minimal number of liars such that each person claims their neighbors (left, right, front, behind, and diagonally adjacent) include both knights and liars. Neighbors for each person in the auditorium can thus range from 3 to 8, while the president and deputies have one or two neighbors. 3. If any two liars are adjacent, then they contradict each other’s statement since both are saying they have both knights and liars as neighbors, but they would only have liars as neighbors in this case. Thus, the minimum number of liars should not have any two liars adjacent. 4. Let us consider the rectangular grid ( 42 times 48 ).

The size ( 3 times 3 ) is chosen because it is the smallest square that allows the center square to be surrounded by all 8 neighbors. 5.

To find the percentage decrease in the price, we can use the following formula: Percentage Decrease = [(Original Price - New Price) / Original Price] * 100 Substituting the values we have: Percentage Decrease = [(P - (20P/25)) / P] * 100 Percentage Decrease = [(25P - 20P) / 25P] * 100 Percentage Decrease = [5P / 25P] * 100 Percentage Decrease = (1/5) * 100 Percentage Decrease = 20% So, the percentage decrease in the price of rice is boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"What is the smallest integer larger than (sqrt{5}+sqrt{3})^6? textbf{(A)} 3322 qquad textbf{(B)} 3323 qquad textbf{(C)} 3324 qquad textbf{(D)} 3325 qquad textbf{(E)} 3326","completion":"To solve for the smallest integer larger than (sqrt{5}+sqrt{3})^6, we use the binomial expansion: 1. **Expand (sqrt{5}+sqrt{3})^6 using the binomial theorem:** [ (sqrt{5}+sqrt{3})^6 = sum_{k=0}^6 binom{6}{k} (sqrt{5})^{6-k} (sqrt{3})^k ] Each term is calculated based on the value of k. 2. **Calculate each specific term in the expansion:** - When k=0: binom{6}{0} (sqrt{5})^6 (sqrt{3})^0 = 1 cdot 5^3 cdot 1 = 125 - When k=1: binom{6}{1} (sqrt{5})^5 (sqrt{3})^1 = 6 cdot 5^{2.5} cdot sqrt{3} = 6 cdot 25sqrt{5} cdot sqrt{3} - When k=2: binom{6}{2} (sqrt{5})^4 (sqrt{3})^2 = 15 cdot 25 cdot 3 = 1125 - When k=3: binom{6}{3} (sqrt{5})^3 (sqrt{3})^3 = 20 cdot 5sqrt{5} cdot 3sqrt{3} = 300 cdot sqrt{15} - When k=4: binom{6}{4} (sqrt{5})^2 (sqrt{3})^4 = 15 cdot 5 cdot 9 = 675 - When k=5: binom{6}{5} (sqrt{5})^1 (sqrt{3})^5 = 6 cdot sqrt{5} cdot 9sqrt{3} = 54 cdot sqrt{15} - When k=6: binom{6}{6} (sqrt{5})^0 (sqrt{3})^6 = 1 cdot 1 cdot 27 = 27 3. **Combine terms with and without sqrt{15}:** - Terms without sqrt{15}: 125 + 1125 + 675 + 27 = 1952 - Terms with sqrt{15}: 300sqrt{15} + 54sqrt{15} = 354sqrt{15} Thus, (sqrt{5}+sqrt{3})^6 = 1952 + 354sqrt{15}. 4. **Estimate sqrt{15} and calculate the value:** [ sqrt{15} approx 3.872 ] [ 1952 + 354 cdot 3.872 approx 1952 + 1370.848 approx 3322.848 ] 5. **Find the smallest integer larger than this value:** The smallest integer larger than 3322.848 is 3323.

Since the sum of the internal angles of a hexagon is (720^circ), each internal angle in an equiangular hexagon is (120^circ). 2. **Opposite Sides are Parallel:** In an equiangular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel. This is because each pair of opposite sides forms a parallelogram with the sides adjacent to them. 3. **Translation and Reduction:** Consider translating the hexagon such that one of the sides, say (a), is reduced to zero. This can be visualized as moving the hexagon parallel to side (d) until (a) coincides with (d). Since (a) and (d) are parallel and opposite, this translation does not affect the parallelism of the other sides. 4. **Reduction of Other Sides:** After reducing (a) to zero, we can similarly reduce (b) to zero by translating parallel to side (e), and then reduce (c) to zero by translating parallel to side (f). Each of these translations maintains the parallelism and equiangular property of the hexagon. 5. **Resulting Equilateral Triangle:** After reducing (a, b, c) to zero, the remaining sides (d, e, f) form an equilateral triangle. This is because the hexagon was equiangular, and reducing three sides to zero leaves an equilateral triangle. 6. **Equality of Differences:** Since the remaining sides form an equilateral triangle, the differences between the original sides must be equal: [ a - d = e - b = c - f ] Thus, we have shown that in an equiangular hexagon, the differences between opposite sides are equal.

Next, he divides each of the resulting groups into 6 equal parts: 100 books / 6 parts = 16.66 books per part Since we can't have a fraction of a book, this division is not possible. However, since Rick wants to end up with groups of 15 books, we can assume that the question meant to say that he divides each of the resulting groups into parts such that each part has 15 books (not 6 equal parts). Let's correct this step: 100 books / 15 books per part = 6.66 parts Again, we can't have a fraction of a part, so we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7 parts.

Finally, he wants to divide each of these groups into equally-sized categories such that each book ends up in a category with 14 other books.

Next, we observe that the equation e^{x}=yln(xy) can be transformed by multiplying both sides by x, leading to: [xe^{x}=xyln(xy)] This can be interpreted as ln(xy) cdot e^{ln(xy)}, suggesting we define a function g(x) = xe^{x} for x > 0. The derivative of g(x) is: [g'(x) = (x+1)e^{x}] Since g'(x) > 0 for all x in (0, +infty), g(x) is monotonically increasing.

Since the cosine of an angle is positive when the angle is acute, we conclude that angle A is acute. 3. **Acute Angle A Implication**: While having angle A as acute is a consequence of our given condition, it doesn't automatically imply that the entire triangle ABC is an acute triangle. The other two angles in triangle ABC could be right or obtuse, which would not fit the criteria of all angles being acute in an acute triangle. 4. **Acute Triangle ABC Implication**: If we start with the premise that triangle ABC is an acute triangle, then by definition, all angles, including angle A, are acute. This satisfies the condition of angle A being acute but does not directly rely on or require our given vector inequality to be true for all acute triangles, making it an implication that is true independently of the given condition. From these observations, we can conclude that the statement \\"|overrightarrow{AB}+overrightarrow{AC}| > |overrightarrow{AB}-overrightarrow{AC}|\\" serves as a necessary condition for triangle ABC to be an acute triangle because it must be true for angle A to be acute.

According to the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 or 3σ rule), we know the proportions of data within one, two, and three standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribution. To find the probability that the score X is between 110 and 120, we look at the symmetry of the normal distribution around the mean, μ = 100. The interval (110, 120] is one standard deviation away from the mean on the right side of the distribution. The empirical rule states that: P(μ-σ < X ≤ μ+σ) = 0.6826 This represents the total area within one standard deviation from the mean on both sides of the distribution. Because the distribution is symmetric, the area from μ to μ+σ is half of 0.6826: P(100 < X ≤ 120) = frac{1}{2} times 0.6826 However, the probability of interest is for the interval (110, 120], which is half of the right tail (100,120]: P(110 < X ≤ 120) = P(100 < X ≤ 120) - P(100 < X ≤ 110) Because of the symmetry, the probability that X is between 100 and 110 is the same as the probability that X is between 110 and 120. We need to subtract this value from the probability that X is less than or equal to 120: P(110 < X ≤ 120) = frac{1}{2} times 0.6826 - P(100 < X ≤ 110) And since the distribution is symmetric, the probability from 100 to 110 is half the area of P(100 < X ≤ 120): P(110 < X ≤ 120) = frac{1}{2} times 0.6826 - frac{1}{2} times 0.6826 times frac{1}{2} To find the probability from 100 to 110, we use the empirical rule again: P(μ-σ < X ≤ μ) = P(μ < X ≤ μ+σ) = frac{1}{2} times 0.6826 Substituting, we get: P(110 < X ≤ 120) = frac{1}{2} times 0.6826 - frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times 0.6826 P(110 < X ≤ 120) = frac{1}{2} times 0.6826 - frac{1}{4} times 0.6826 P(110 < X ≤ 120) = frac{1}{4} times 0.6826 Thus, P(110 < X ≤ 120) = frac{1}{4} times 0.6826 = 0.17065 The closest answer to the calculated probability is option D: 0.1359, which is the probability that must be half the difference between areas of one and two standard deviations from the mean due to the symmetry of the tails: P(110 < X ≤ 120) = frac{1}{2} times (P(μ-2σ < X ≤ μ+2σ) - P(μ-σ < X ≤ μ+σ)) P(110 < X ≤ 120) = frac{1}{2} times (0.9544 - 0.6826) P(110 < X ≤ 120) = frac{1}{2} times 0.2718 P(110 < X ≤ 120) = 0.1359 [boxed{P(110 < X ≤ 120) = 0.1359}]"},{"prompt":"A train 250 m long and traveling at 60 km/hr with a wind resistance force of 500 N, on an uneven terrain with an inclination of 5 degrees, can cross a bridge in 45 seconds.

(ii) To show that: [ g_n(1) = frac{F_1}{F_2} + frac{F_2}{F_3} + cdots + frac{F_{n+1}}{F_{n+2}}, ] we proceed as follows: 1. **Initial Condition:** Note that ( frac{F_1}{F_2} = 1 ) and ( f left( frac{F_i}{F_{i+1}} right) = frac{F_{i+1}}{F_{i+2}} ). 2. **Substituting the Series:** By definition and properties of the Fibonacci sequence, the given form for ( g_n(1) ) is a telescoping series: [ g_1(1) = 1 + frac{1}{2}, quad g_2(1) = 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{3}, quad text{and so on}. ] 3. **General Form:** Using the identity ( f left( frac{F_i}{F_{i+1}} right) = frac{F_{i+1}}{F_{i+2}} ), we see that: [ g_n(1) = 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{3} + cdots + frac{F_n}{F_{n+1}} = sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{F_i}{F_{i+1}}. ] Therefore, it follows: [ g_n(1) = frac{F_1}{F_2} + frac{F_2}{F_3} + cdots + frac{F_{n+1}}{F_{n+2}}, ] where ( F_1 = F_2 = 1 ) and ( F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n ).

We rewrite f(t) as: f(t) = -2left(t^2 - frac{1}{2}tright) = -2left(t^2 - frac{1}{2}t + left(frac{1}{4}right)^2 - left(frac{1}{4}right)^2right) = -2left(left(t - frac{1}{4}right)^2 - left(frac{1}{4}right)^2right) The maximum value of f(t) occurs at t = frac{1}{4} and is given by: f_{text{max}} = -2left(-left(frac{1}{4}right)^2right) = -2left(-frac{1}{16}right) = frac{1}{8} Therefore, the inequality f(t) > f_{text{max}} implies that a must be greater than the maximum value of f(t). Thus we have: a > frac{1}{8} Considering the given interval for t is [1, 3], we find the least upper bound of the values for a on this interval. Since the maximum value is frac{1}{8} and occurs at t = frac{1}{4}, which is outside of our interval [1, 3], we must evaluate the function f(t) at the endpoints of this interval. Evaluating f(t) at t = 1 and t = 3 we get: f(1) = 1 - 2(1)^2 = -1 f(3) = 3 - 2(3)^2 = 3 - 18 = -15 Since f(1) > f(3), the least upper bound on the interval [1, 3] is f(1) which is -1. Thus for a to satisfy the original inequality, we must have: a > -1 Therefore, the range of values for a is (-1, +infty). boxed{a in (-1, +infty)}."},{"prompt":"10 play kabadi, 15 play kho kho only, and some people play both games.

Preliminary Observations:** # Step 1: Note that no vertex of the quadrilaterals lies on the line (e), otherwise this would lead to a contradictory scenario of overlapping points. # Step 2: Using a spatial central projection, we create a perspective where both quadrilaterals and the line (e) are in a plane where each pair of lines mentioned above is parallel. The resulting image would then help us illustrate properties about the intersection. # Step 3: Define a point (O) outside the initial plane (S) and a plane (S_1), which is parallel to and different from the plane determined by (O) and (e). A point (P) in (S) projects to (P_1) in (S_1) through line (OP). # Step 4: In this projection, intersection points are visualized based on whether lines are parallel or not. Thus, if the corresponding lines in (S_1) are parallel, it can be concluded that they would intersect on (e) in the original setup. # Step 5: Acknowledge that the vertices of the quadrilaterals' images in plane (S_1) can be translated back to the original plane using the properties of perspective projections (assuming no degeneracy). # Step 6: By applying the properties and relationships of line pairs ( (AB, C'D'), (BC, D'A'), (CD, A'B'), (DA, B'C'), (AC, B'D') ), create a similarity transformation which shows how lines in the image perspective imply their intersection or parallelism in the original plane. # Step 7: Transform these properties back using the properties of geometric projections as mentioned in step 4. We find that the geometric configuration will be preserved through the projections. # Step 8: Apply mathematical proofs and properties related to parallel lines and transversals to verify the initial hypothesis. Specifically, use the intersecting lines scenario and properties of transversals to show the preservation of geometrical relationships under projection. # Step 9: Show through geometric properties and transformations (similarities, parallel lines, etc.) that if (A_1C_1'parallel B_1D_1'), then (BDparallel A' C') or they intersect on (e). # Conclusion: The detailed mathematical steps allow us to conclude that the line pair (BD) and (A'C') will also intersect on (e) or be parallel to (e).

To find the relationship between the areas, consider the center of the circumcircles around triangles ABM, BCM, CDM, and DAM. 3.

First, let's clarify the problem: We are given a fixed triangle (ABC) with side length (a). We need to find the geometric location of points (F') such that the triangle (DEF') is equilateral and determine its length. 2. Let's denote (A_0, B_0, C_0) as the midpoints of sides (BC, CA,) and (AB) respectively. 3. The triangle (ABC) is fixed, so the point (D) moves along segment (AC_0) and point (E) moves along segment (BA_0). 4. Considering quadrilateral (DEF' C_0), we observe that it is cyclic. This is because quadrilateral (DEF' C_0) can be inscribed in a circle (as angles (DE) and (EF') are both (60^circ)). 5. By the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and equilateral triangles, the angle (F' C_0 B) must also be (60^circ). Therefore, point (F') lies on a ray originating from (C_0) and parallel to side (AB). 6. Additionally, because ( angle F' E C_0) is strictly less than ( 60^circ) (as it’s within the cyclic nature constraints), point (F') must lie specifically along a segment and not just any point on the ray. 7. Given that (F') cannot be in another half-plane with respect to (AC_0), it must lie on a segment with a length of (2a). 8.

This is derived from rearranging the hyperbola equation into its asymptotic form. 2. **Focus of the Hyperbola**: The left focus of the hyperbola, denoted as F, has coordinates (-c, 0), where c is the distance from the center to the focus. The hyperbola equation is frac{{x}^{2}}{{a}^{2}} - frac{{y}^{2}}{{b}^{2}} = 1. 3. **Given Point P**: The point P is given as (0, sqrt{6}a). 4. **Slope of Line PF**: Since the line PF intersects the hyperbola at exactly one point and is parallel to the asymptotes, its slope, denoted as k_{PF}, must be equal to the slope of the asymptotes, i.e., k_{PF} = frac{b}{a}. 5. **Equation for Slope of PF**: The slope of line PF can also be expressed as frac{sqrt{6}a}{c}. Setting this equal to the slope of the asymptotes gives us frac{sqrt{6}a}{c} = frac{b}{a}. 6. **Relating a, b, and c**: From the slope equality, we get sqrt{6}a^2 = bc.

Let the constant term of ( g(x) ) be ( palpha ) and the constant term of ( h(x) ) be ( pbeta ) for some integers ( alpha ) and ( beta ).

On each turn, the player can choose a bun from either end of the row. Let’s denote the positions of the buns as either odd or even based on their numbers. Malysh always starts the game and can always choose an odd-numbered or even-numbered bun to begin his sequence. 3. **Strategy Analysis:** Suppose Malysh decides to consistently pick buns from positions with one specific parity (say odd-numbered). Since there are 20 odd-numbered positions (1, 3, 5, ..., 39) and 20 even-numbered positions (2, 4, 6, ..., 40), Malysh can systematically ensure he's picking all buns from the odd-numbered positions. 4. **Distribution Assumption:** Let's assume that of the odd-numbered positions, at least 10 buns are sugar buns (if there are fewer, the procedure can be analogously applied to cinnamon buns). Therefore, Malysh can ensure that final selection will lead to him collecting the required number of sugar and cinnamon buns. 5. **Iterative Process:** For each pair of moves: - Malysh picks an odd-numbered bun. - Carlson picks next, determining the bun from either parity that remains. - After each move by Carlson, the number of odd-numbered buns decreases by 1, and Malysh continues to pick odd-numbered buns. 6. **Calculation Check:** If initially, the count (number of sugar buns grabbed by Malysh + remaining sugar buns in even positions) did not exceed 10, and he continues this while excluding even positions, then after 20 moves, 20 odd-numbered buns will be exhausted.

Let's denote the tasks as follows: A = Add axles W = Add wheels to the axles I = Install the windshield to the frame P = Install the instrument panel S = Install the steering wheel C = Install the interior seating Since A must come before W, we can treat them as a single combined task (AW).

So after five days, the number of additional ripe peaches is 2 per day times 5 days, which equals 10. Adding this to the initial 4 ripe peaches, we get a total of 14 ripe peaches after five days. Now, let's consider the number of unripe peaches. Initially, there are 18 - 4 = 14 unripe peaches. Since 2 peaches ripen each day, after five days, 2 * 5 = 10 of these unripe peaches will have ripened. So, the number of unripe peaches remaining after five days is 14 - 10 = 4. According to the problem, after five days, there are 7 more ripe peaches than unripe peaches. We already calculated that there are 14 ripe peaches and 4 unripe peaches. So, the difference between ripe and unripe peaches should be 7, which is already the case (14 ripe - 4 unripe = 10, which is not the 7 more as stated in the problem). It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement or in the initial calculations. Let's re-evaluate the situation: If there are 7 more ripe peaches than unripe peaches, and we have 4 unripe peaches, then there should be 4 + 7 = 11 ripe peaches, not 14 as we initially calculated. This means that some peaches must have been eaten to reduce the number of ripe peaches from 14 to 11. The number of peaches eaten would be the difference between the initially calculated ripe peaches (14) and the actual number of ripe peaches after accounting for the 7 more than the unripe ones (11).

Therefore, each player will participate in (frac{n-1}{2}) games (since each game involves 4 players, and each player will be paired with every other player exactly once). - The total number of games can be calculated by considering that each game involves 4 players. Thus, the total number of games is (frac{n(n-1)}{8}). - For this to be an integer, (frac{n(n-1)}{8}) must be an integer.

Conclude the equality of projections: - Therefore, these projections are equal. This implies that the center O of the circumcircle of triangle H_1BH_2 lies on the line segment AC such that O is equidistant from B_1 and B_2. 7.

She put half of her savings in each account, so the amount in each account is S/2. For the simple interest account, the interest earned after two years is 112. The formula for simple interest is: Simple Interest = Principal × Rate × Time Here, the Principal is S/2, the Time is 2 years, and we'll call the Rate r (as a decimal). So we have: 112 = (S/2) × r × 2 For the compound interest account, the interest earned after two years is 120. The formula for compound interest is: Compound Interest = Principal × [(1 + Rate)^Time - 1] Here, the Principal is again S/2, the Time is 2 years, and the Rate is the same r.

It is known that students numbered 6, 32, and 45 are in the sample. What is the number of the fourth student in the sample? A: 3 B: 12 C: 16 D: 19","completion":"Systematic sampling implies that the sample is selected using a fixed interval between elements. To identify the missing number in the sample, we consider the numbers of the known students (6, 32, and 45) as part of an arithmetic sequence because systematic sampling means sampling at regular intervals. Let's denote the common difference of this arithmetic sequence as d. Since we have the numbers of three of the four students, we can set up the following relationships with the unknown number being x: [ 6 + d = 32, ] [ 32 + d = 45. ] From the first equation, d = 32 - 6 = 26. Then we use this common difference in the second equation: [ 32 + 26 = 45, ] [ 58 = 45. ] We find that this does not hold true, so we must re-evaluate our assumptions. We realize that since there are four samples, there should be three intervals, meaning that we should have used the third student and the first student to find the common difference, which corresponds to two intervals. Let's recalculate the common difference using the first and third student in the sample: [ 6 + 2d = 45, ] [ 2d = 45 - 6, ] [ 2d = 39, ] [ d = frac{39}{2} = 19.5. ] As we cannot have a common difference that is not a whole number in this context (since we cannot have a half student), we must also consider other potential systematic samples, such as those starting from another student before number 6. Therefore, the correct common difference would be the one that divides the difference between student numbers 32 and 6, which is 26. Let's divide 26 by the number of intervals in our sample, which is 3: [ d = frac{26}{3} = 8 text{ remainder } 2. ] The common difference d needs to be a whole number because the student numbers are integers. Therefore, the remainder when dividing 26 by 3 indicates that the starting point of our sample must be earlier than student number 6. So we subtract the remainder from 6 to find the start of the sequence: [ x = 6 - 2 = 4. ] Using the common difference of 8, we now verify our arithmetic sequence: [ 4 + 8 = 12, ] [ 12 + 8 = 20, ] [ 20 + 8 = 28, ] [ 28 + 8 = 36, ] [ 36 + 8 = 44, ] [ 44 + 8 = 52. ] This shows us the positions of the sampled students if we begin with number 4. We see that it is not possible for numbers 32 and 45 to be in this sequence when using 4 as a starting point. However, we can now find the correct start point by moving backward from number 6 with the common difference of 8: [ 6 - 8 = -2. ] Since we cannot have a negative number for a student's number, we add the total number of students to cycle back to the last student in the class: [ 52 + (-2) = 50. ] Continuing with a common difference of 8, we now confirm our solution: [ 50, ] [ 50 + 8 = 58 rightarrow 58 - 52 = 6 text{ (cycling back after 52)}, ] [ 6 + 8 = 14, ] [ 14 + 8 = 22, ] [ 22 + 8 = 30, ] [ 30 + 8 = 38, ] [ 38 + 8 = 46, ] [ 46 + 8 = 54 rightarrow 54 - 52 = 2, ] [ ... ] Since the student numbers should cycle back after reaching 52, we then make sure that the sequence includes 6, 32, and 45. The actual sequence including numbers 6, 32, and 45 will be: [ 50, 6 (58 - 52), 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, 2 (54 - 52), ...] So the full sequence that includes 6, 32, and 45 as part of the systematic sample would look like this: [ ... ,2, 10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, 2, ...] We see that the sequence that includes 6, 32, and 45 is: [ ..., 2, 10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 6, ...] This sequence (2, 10, 18, 26, ...) confirms the common difference of 8 and that student number 10 should be the missing number from the original sample. However, 10 is not one of our answer choices. Let's validate each choice by seeing which, if any, could fit into a sequence with an equal interval that includes 6, 32, and 45. We start by evaluating the lowest number, 3, as a potential starting number for our sample. If 3 is the first number in the sequence, the next numbers using a common difference of 29 (the difference between 32 and 3) would be: [ 3+29 = 32, ] [ 32+29 = 61, ] [ 61 text{ is outside of our range, so this is impossible.} ] Moving on to option B, 12: [ 12+(Delta) = 6, ] [ 6+(Delta) = 32,] [ 32+(Delta) = 45. ] We now solve for the common difference Delta: [ Delta = 6 - 12 = -6, ] [ Delta = 32 - 6 = 26, ] [ -6 = 26, ] [ text{This is incorrect.} ] Continuing to option C, 16: [ 16+Delta = 6, ] [ 6+Delta = 32, ] [ 32+Delta = 45, ] [ Delta = -10, ] [ Delta = 26. ] This is incorrect because Delta cannot be two different numbers. Lastly, checking option D, 19: [ 19, 19 + Delta = 6, ] [ 6 + Delta = 32, ] [ 32 + Delta = 45. ] Starting with the last two terms and solving for Delta: [ Delta = 45 - 32 = 13, ] [ 32 - 13 = 19. ] This is consistent, and now if we include 19 in the sequence: [ 19, ] [ 19 + 13 = 32, ] [ 32 + 13 = 45. ] We see that if we begin with 19 and use a common difference of 13, we do arrive at the other sampled numbers. To find the number before 19, we subtract 13: [ 19 - 13 = 6, ] [ 6 - 13 = -7, ] [ -7 text{ is not valid, so we add 52 to cycle back:} ], [ -7 + 52 = 45, ] [ 45 - 13 = 32, ] [ 32 - 13 = 19, ] [ 19 - 13 = 6, ] [ 6 - 13 = -7 + 52 = 45. ] Now we have a sequence of (45, 6, 19, 32), which in order becomes (6, 19, 32, 45).

This implies the derivative of |x-2a| with respect to x should be negative or 0, leading to the condition that 2a geqslant 2, which simplifies to a geqslant 1. **Step 2: Analyze the function for x > 2** For x > 2, fleft(xright) = x + frac{1}{x-2} + a.

Thus, f(x) reaches a minimum value of a + 4 when x = 3. **Step 4: Comparing minimum values** We have f(2) as the minimum value of f(x). So, 4 + a geqslant |2 - 2a|.

First, let's find the length of the space diagonal of the rectangular box: sqrt{1^2+2^2+3^2}=sqrt{14}. Thus, the diameter of the sphere is sqrt{14}, and its radius is frac{sqrt{14}}{2}. The surface area of the sphere can be calculated using the formula 4pi r^2, where r is the radius: 4pi times left(frac{sqrt{14}}{2}right)^2 = 14pi. Therefore, the surface area of the circumscribed sphere is boxed{14pi}. To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of a circumscribed sphere and the formula for the surface area of a sphere.

A simple sequence that fits this criterion is (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). - The sum of chips in rows following this pattern is ( sum_{i=0}^{7} i ). This sum is calculated as follows: [ sum_{i=0}^{7} i = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28 ] - Notice that (8k = 28). So each column should, in average, have ( frac{28}{8} = 3.5 ) chips, which isn't an integer. Hence, this exact method doesn't work. 3. **Visualization and Example Setup:** - To satisfy both conditions, an example distribution could break symmetry uniformly and still follow unique distributions in each row. For instance, a setup with each column having 4 chips could be designed in a zigzag or staggered manner. 4. **Example Configuration:** - Consider placing chips in a staggered pattern.

Since 1 in {1, 2, 3, ldots, m} and n in {m+1, m+2, ldots, n}, the probability that element 1 is chosen from the first subpopulation is determined by the number of ways to choose the second element from the remaining m-1 elements in the first subpopulation. Similarly for element n in the second subpopulation. Therefore, the expression for P_{1n} is given by: P_{1n} = frac {C_{m-1}^{1}}{C_m^2} times frac {C_{n-m-1}^{1}}{C_{n-m}^2} = frac {(m-1)(n-m-1)}{C_m^2 C_{n-m}^2} Simplifying the expression, we get: P_{1n} = frac{(m-1)(n-m-1)}{frac{m(m-1)}{2} times frac{(n-m)(n-m-1)}{2}} = frac {4}{m(n-m)} So, the expression for P_{1n} is boxed{ frac{4}{m(n-m)}}. 2.

Analogously for the second case, the sum of all P_{ij} where i and j are in {m+1, m+2, ldots, n} is also 1.
