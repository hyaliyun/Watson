Gu Xinxin, having tried to return a call to Zuo Yan without response, was uncertain of her exact location within the private chambers. The club's general manager, upon sighting Gu Xinxin, approached with profound respect and inquired, \\"Miss Gu, might you be searching for President Lu?\\" With a nonchalant shake of her head, Gu Xinxin asked, \\"Have you perchance observed which chamber the young mistress of the Zuo family occupies?\\" The manager replied, \\"Regrettably not; today the upstairs has entertained no members of the Zuo household.\\" Zuo Yan had surreptitiously ascended in search of Huo Xiangyin, circumventing the standard registration protocol. After a moment's consideration, Gu Xinxin further inquired, \\"In which chamber might I find Huo Xiangyin?\\" The manager candidly responded, \\"Miss Gu, Mr. Huo is in SNOW.\\" SNOW was the establishment's most opulent chamber, a sanctuary exclusively reserved for the societal elite. As she prepared to investigate SNOW for Zuo Yan's presence, the clamorous voice of Gu Xueer arose from behind, \\"I am here to seek someone! Stand aside and halt your obstruction!\\" The server, caught in a difficult position, attempted to dissuade her, \\"Miss, SNOW is intended for private gatherings, and as you are not listed among the invited, entry is barred to you.\\" Gu Xinxin, turning back, found herself locked in a gaze with Gu Xueer. Gu Xueer, taken aback and quickly contorted by distaste, frowned, \\"Gu Xinxin, to what purpose do you linger here?\\" The last time they met, Gu Xinxin had caused her vehicle to be towed by traffic officers and deceived her into purchasing a slew of ill-fitting designer clothes—a score yet to be settled with her contemptible cousin. Gu Xinxin's countenance remained undisturbed, \\"Similar to yourself, I too am here in search of someone.\\" This declaration appeared to Gu Xueer like base humor; surveying Gu Xinxin's attire disdainfully, she remarked, \\"Whom could you possibly be here to find? The venerable chamber ahead is reserved for esteemed VIPs; those within are of wealth or nobility. With your garb akin to marketplace fare, do you entertain the notion of blending amongst them? The very idea is laughable!\\" Contrary to Gu Xueer's judgment, Gu Xinxin's attire, though unassuming in form and utterly devoid of ornamental logos, was far from inexpensive, constructed with only the finest materials. As the tension escalated, the manager, solicitous for Gu Xinxin's tranquility, interjected, \\"Miss Gu, might we assist in the alleviation of this disturbance?\\" Gu Xueer, smirking triumphantly, commanded, \\"Expel this unsophisticated woman from our presence! This establishment stands as one of the capital's most exclusive lounges; do not sully its reputation by admitting every rustic interloper.\\" Yet the manager's gaze did not waver toward Gu Xueer, but remained steadfast and deferential upon Gu Xinxin as he awaited her directive. With a casual wave of dismissal, Gu Xinxin uttered, \\"Adhere to your policies; I shall proceed to SNOW in the meantime!\\" \\"At once, Miss Gu,\\" the manager bowed, extending a welcoming hand as she gracefully moved towards SNOW, reaching its entrance unimpeded and pushing the door ajar to enter. Bewildered, Gu Xueer could not fathom the scene and, attempting to follow, was halted by the security personnel summoned by the manager. \\"Miss, should you persist forcibly, regrettable measures may have to be undertaken,\\" warned the security with unyielding sternness. Unable to comprehend why Gu Xinxin, in her unassuming attire, was granted access to SNOW while she, the celebrity clad in designer fashion, was barred, Gu Xueer fumed, “Do you realize who I am? I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, the acclaimed actress from 'Concubine's Aspiration'!\\" The security personnel sternly replied, \\"Whether you are a concubine or a starlet makes no difference here; we operate by rules and ask that you respect them and take your leave.\\" Intimidated by the security's formidable demeanor and unable to breach SNOW, Gu Xueer ceased her confrontations. Clenching her teeth in frustration yet reluctant to depart, she queried, \\"Who exactly is that woman who entered, and why does the manager hold her in such high esteem?\\" \\"Our policy is to respect guest confidentiality; that information cannot be disclosed,\\" came the steadfast reply. Dismayed and incensed, Gu Xueer remained unable to grasp how Gu Xinxin managed to infiltrate high society as a mere domestic – an enigma that compelled her to linger, anticipating the disclosure of who might exit in Gu Xinxin's company. Gu Xueer, originally on a quest to rekindle ties with her influential patron after severing their relationship in a misguided belief of a prosperous marriage, now found herself bereft of both occupation and support. Despite efforts to negotiate a contract renewal, her agency had bluntly informed her of being blacklisted in favor of new talent. In a bid to revive her patron's favor and secure resources, Gu Xueer had traced him to this gathering, hoping for reconciliation. Within the confines of SNOW, the atmosphere bespoke an expansive, classically appointed flat rather than a mere chamber. Shadows interplayed with soft illumination, as live music from an in-house band created an intimate ambiance. The elegantly dressed guests mingled in convivial clusters, engaged with drink and conversation. Gu Xinxin's gaze navigated through the crowd, in pursuit of Zuo Yan's figure. Abruptly, a blur of bubblegum pink darted towards her exclaiming, \\"Uncle...\\" Swiftly, Gu Xinxin placed a finger upon Zuo Yan's lips, silencing her mid-word, \\"In public, address me by my given name.\\" Zuo Yan, somewhat deflated, acquiesced, \\"Alright then, Xinxin...\\" Detecting a furrow in Gu Xinxin's brow, she scrutinized Zuo Yan for any sign of harm, \\"What's afflicted you? You called earlier for assistance, did you not?\\" Zuo Yan, enwreathed by anxiety and clinging to Gu Xinxin's arm, gestured towards a group at their rear, \\"It was them! They've wronged me!\\" The gaze of Gu Xinxin elevated to meet theirs; a trio of young men clad in sharp suits, evidently reared in wealth and indulgence, had circled around. The most leftward proclaimed, \\"Let's not misrepresent facts, young lady! You agreed to join us in our game. How can you now claim we wronged you?\\" Another, fixating upon the newly arrived Gu Xinxin, expressed his intrigue, \\"Ah, another alluring vision! She appears so docile—quite to my preference.\\" With composure undisturbed, Gu Xinxin turned to Zuo Yan, \\"How did you attract their attention?\\" Zuo Yan, crestfallen and in a hushed tone, confessed, \\"I sought Uncle and, upon not finding him, inquired of these three. They insisted I gamble with dice, claiming victory would lead me to him.\\" \\"And then... I lost. They poised a choice: to either drain ten bottles of wine or bestow a kiss upon one of them. I'd never kiss them! And the wine—I feared it tainted, yet if I refused, they would not permit me to leave...\\" Understanding the sequence of events, Gu Xinxin addressed the frivolous young men with a stern look, \\"Is there pride in bullying a young girl thus?\\" \\"You ladies constantly champion equality between genders, do you not? The terms apply equally to all: a loss mandates acceptance of the consequences. If one cannot abide by the stakes, they ought not play.\\" Gu Xinxin's eyes hardened as she suggested, \\"A game of dice, you say? Then allow me to partake in the game.\\" The central figure, perceiving in Gu Xinxin the image of an obedient girl, smirked in amusement, \\"Are you certain?\\" Unwavering, Gu Xinxin affirmed, \\"Should I triumph, her debt to you shall be nullified.\\" His eyebrow arched in intrigue, \\"And if victory falls to me?\\" With an unintimidated stare, Gu Xinxin prompted him, \\"Name your terms.\\" The man stepped closer, bending to whisper by her ear, \\"Is your maidenhood still yours to claim?\\" Her expression seized by indignation, Gu Xinxin flushed with a modest scorn. \\"Such an endearing reaction bespeaks a pristine innocence!\\" he jeered, presenting a hotel key card from his pocket and taunting Gu Xinxin, \\"I covet that first night of yours!\\" Zuo Yan, witnessing the exchange and reddened with anger, protested, \\"Such brazen acts under broad daylight are nothing short of hooliganism!\\" Gu Xinxin accepted the key card, \\"Very well, commence the game.\\" Zuo Yan, alarmed and with pleading eyes, urged, \\"Xinxin, this cannot be! I choose to drink instead—do not engage in their gamble!\\" Deeper within SNOW, near the billiards room, the young Jiang scion regaled his audience, legs propped with casual authority, \\"I encountered the hacker Yutu online just days ago; she cracked the encryption of our AJ Alliance with such ease, living up to her reputation as one of the globe's most formidable hackers.\\" With a successful shot, Li Ze responded, \\"Xiaocan, you should focus less on trivial pursuits and more on your family's business—your father is counting on you to support your brother.\\" Jiang Canyang seemed indifferent, \\"With my brother at the helm, why should I bother with the company?\\" Suddenly, an individual burst in, eager to share, \\"Gentlemen, prepare for an eventful spectacle! A young lady wagers her virtue against three men in a dice game outside!\\" Li Ze, intrigued, laid down his cue, \\"Intriguing! Let us behold the scene!\\" Huo Xiangyin, lounging in aloof serenity upon a sofa, expressed little interest at the announcement. A woman with curled tresses, her eyes alight with affectation, clinked glasses in conversation with him. \\"Mr. Huo, I believe your niece, the young Miss Zuo, is in the company of that dice-playing damsel,\\" she cooed. Huo Xiangyin's brow furrowed at the revelation."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * An Arab-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she's a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching her house's door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of her house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman deflects the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's, even if it meant that she would release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit -even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit that the returning woman forced her to release feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the present woman, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's poop-filled pants and odor, but she goes on to insist that the present woman's actions had a significant contribution to these outcomes. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own smell (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"**INT. SUBURBAN HOME - DAY** **Scene: \\"Urgent Homecoming\\"** FADE IN: *We see a well-maintained suburban street. LEILA (mid-20s, Arab-American, college student, with long, curly black hair tied in a ponytail, wearing a loose-fitting graphic t-shirt, casual joggers, and sneakers) hurries down the sidewalk. Close-up on her anxious face displays a looming panic. She clutches her stomach occasionally, revealing the desperate situation she’s in.* **LEILA** *(mumbling to herself)* Just a few more steps... Hang in there... *The ambient sounds of neighborhood life are punctuated by the rhythmic urgency of Leila's footsteps. Birds chirp as children play in a nearby yard. Leila's pacing accelerates.* *Leila approaches the door of her house and frantically begins searching her pockets for the house key. Her face transitions from urgency to dread as she realizes the key isn't there.* **LEILA** *(yelling and pounding on the door)* Mom! Are you there? Open the door!! *The thumping on the door shudders through the quiet house interior. After a beat, muffled shuffling is heard from inside.* **SARA (O.S.)** *(a groggy, middle-aged voice)* Who is it? What’s happening? **LEILA** It's me, Leila! Hurry up, please!! *The door slowly creeps open, revealing SARA (late 40s, Arab-American, dressed comfortably in home attire, glasses perched halfway down her nose), rubbing her sleepy eyes in confusion.* **SARA** Why all the noise? You scared me half to— *Leila, desperation etched across her face, attempts to hustle past her dawdling mother.* **LEILA** Please move, I need to— *Sara, concern overtaking confusion, grabs onto Leila to inspect her daughter for injuries.* **SARA** What’s wrong? Did something happen? **LEILA** *(pleading and trying to untangle herself)* Move, I have to get in. Please, just— *The tension reaches a climax. Leila, unable to hold back any longer, lunges for the entryway. Sara reflexively tightens her grip, pressing on Leila's abdomen.* **LEILA** *(groaning with sudden shock)* Oh no... *The strain of Sara's grip triggers the indelicate catastrophe. Leila winces, her body rigid in an awkward stance as the inevitable occurs.* **SARA** *(eyes widening)* Leila, what's wrong? **LEILA** *(with a strained hush)* I'm— it's too late... *The air changes. The confusion on Sara's face intensifies, mirrored by her nostrils flaring as an odor assails the hallway.* **SARA** *(recoiling with a pinch of her nose)* What on earth—? **LEILA** Sorry, the smell is... yeah. *Relief washes over Leila's face as the worst passes, while her mother's grimace tells a different tale. A horrified recognition dawns on Sara.* **SARA** Leila, did you just... in your pants? **LEILA** *(avoiding eye contact)* Can you please just let me inside? *Sara, squinting through her disgust, steps aside as Leila enters, shuffling awkwardly while cupping the back of her joggers.* **SARA** *(pointing at Leila's soiled pants)* You're too old for this! Look at the mess you've made! **LEILA** *(sheepishly)* It's your fault for squeezing me! **SARA** *(laughing incredulously)* That’s no excuse! And you finished it here instead of running to the bathroom? **LEILA** *(defensive)* I had to let go, and you pushed on my stomach! *Leila hesitantly feels the back of her pants, cringing.* **LEILA** It felt so good to get it out though. I've got to clean up, this is uncomfortable. *Sara halts Leila with a mixture of fascination and revulsion.* **SARA** *(examines the bulk in Leila's pants)* You can't be serious... That’s disgusting. Turn around. *Leila protests but complies, turning her back to show the damage.* **SARA** I can't believe this, you're full to the brim! *Leila broods quietly.* **LEILA** *(irked)* Let me go. It’s squishy and gross and I... it just stinks. *Sara sniffs dramatically, performing an animated gag.* **SARA** My God, yes, you reek. Please clean up! *Leila reluctantly agrees and waddles towards the bathroom.* **LEILA** *(turning back slightly)* But remember, you did this. *Sara ushers her daughter off with a mixture of sympathy and continued disgust.* FADE TO BLACK. **END OF SCENE**"},{"prompt":"Please generate and write a very high-quality and beautiful description for a YouTube channel with music.","completion":"Welcome to \\"Melodious Echoes,\\" a serene sanctuary of aural bliss within the world of YouTube.

Тема индивидуальные инвестиционные счета третьего типа","completion":"Привет! Индивидуальные инвестиционные счета (ИИС) представляют собой инвестиционный инструмент в некоторых странах, например, в России, который позволяет физическим лицам инвестировать на фондовом рынке и получать налоговые льготы. Для российского рынка установлены два типа ИИС: ИИС типа А и ИИС типа Б. Вы упомянули \\"Инвестиционные счета третьего типа\\", но насколько мне известно, такой классификации в России нет. Вполне возможно, что вы имеете в виду введение нового вида ИИС или специфическую модель инвестиционных счетов, предложенную в другой стране. Если это так и ваш доклад касается предложения или концепции нового типа ИИС, которого сейчас нет в российском законодательстве, вам следует подробно изучить, как работают текущие типы ИИС и какими льготами они сопровождаются, чтобы понять, как мог бы выглядеть третий тип: 1. ИИС типа А позволяет инвестору получить налоговый вычет на вложенные средства в размере до 400 тысяч рублей (но не более 13% от суммы вложений). 2. ИИС типа Б предоставляет возможность не платить налог на инвестиционный доход при условии, что счет будет закрыт через три года после его открытия и на протяжении всего периода не будут производиться снятия средств. Основные моменты, которые вам стоит учесть при подготовке доклада: - Цели создания ИИС. - Налоговое законодательство, регулирующее работу ИИС. - Преимущества и недостатки ИИС для инвесторов. - Примеры использования ИИС. - Сравнение ИИС с другими инвестиционными инструментами. Если предполагаемый вами третий тип ИИС — это нововведение и предложение, важно также обосновать его необходимость, преимущества перед существующими типами ИИС, а также потенциальные риски и сложности его внедрения. Для получения наиболее актуальной информации обязательно проверьте последние изменения в законодательстве и новости, которые могли появиться после моего знания отсечки в 2023 году."},{"prompt":"Расскажи про ИИС-3 в концепции ЦБ РФ Предложения ЦБ РФ от 2020 года по ИИС третьего типа","completion":"Извините за путаницу в предыдущем ответе. Отвечая на ваш вопрос о ИИС третьего типа в концепции Центрального Банка Российской Федерации (ЦБ РФ), действительно, обсуждалась идея введения нового типа индивидуальных инвестиционных счетов. По предложениям ЦБ РФ, которые были озвучены в 2020 году, предполагалось создание нового типа ИИС, который призван стимулировать долгосрочные инвестиции в пенсионные накопления. Ведь существующие на тот момент ИИС типа А и типа Б имели определённые налоговые льготы и условия, которые больше ориентированы либо на короткосрочное, либо на более долгосрочное, но не пенсионное инвестирование. По идее, ИИС третьего типа (ИИС-3) должны были основываться на следующих принципах: - Долгосрочность: ИИС-3 предназначены для инвестиций с целью формирования пенсионных накоплений. - Налоговые льготы: предусматривалось введение налоговых льгот для стимулирования граждан к формированию пенсионных накоплений. - Лимиты вложений: мог быть установлен предел на ежегодные вложения с правом на налоговый вычет, а также максимальный объем активов на счете. - Возрастные ограничения: предполагалось, что снятие средств без потери льгот возможно только после достижения определенного возраста инвестором (например, пенсионного). Цель ИИС-3 состояла в том, чтобы дать людям инструмент для самостоятельного накопления средств на пенсию, что особенно актуально на фоне обсуждений о будущем пенсионного обеспечения и возможных недостатках государственной пенсионной системы. Так как предложение от ЦБ РФ относилось к 2020 году, то для подготовки актуального доклада следует проверить дополнительные источники и узнать, было ли данное предложение принято, какие изменения произошли в законодательстве по состоянию на более поздний период и каковы текущие тенденции в области пенсионных инвестиций и ИИС в России."},{"prompt":"Fait moi une histoire d'un super villian","completion":"Il était une fois dans la métropole turbulente de Néopolis, un éminent scientifique nommé Dr. Émile Sombre. Reconnu pour son génie en matière d'énergies alternatives et de cybernétique, il passait ses jours à laborer de nouvelles manières de faire avancer l'humanité vers une ère technologique florissante. Sa passion pour son travail était inégalée, mais cette même passion devait être l'étincelle de sa chute. Un jour, lors d'une expérimentation audacieuse visant à exploiter l'énergie d'une nébuleuse lointaine, une énorme décharge cosmique frappa son laboratoire. L'accident laissa le Dr. Sombre et ses travaux irradiés d'une énergie astrale inconnue. Le monde cru le brillant scientifique mort, englouti par son ambition dévorante. Mais il avait survécu. Transformé. Le Dr. Sombre était maintenant imprégné de pouvoirs qui défient les lois de la physique, capable de contrôler la matière et l'énergie. Néanmoins, l'incident avait éloigné le Dr. Sombre de son humanité. Épris de colère contre ceux qu'il jugeait responsables de l'accident – les gouvernements, la société, le monde entier – il prit le nom de Nébuleux. Nébuleux commença à tisser sa toile de terreur sur Néopolis. Il créa des machines monstrueuses alimentées par la même énergie qui le faisait vivre, engendrant de chaos dans les rues. Il jurait de remodeler le monde à son image, de bâtir un nouvel ordre où la science et la force régneraient sans contraintes morales ou éthiques. Confrontés à une menace comme jamais auparavant, les habitants de Néopolis étaient terrifiés. Néanmoins, parmi eux émergea un groupe de super-héros décidés à stopper le despote scientifique. Ils étaient connus sous le nom de la Ligue de Lumière. Ces héros étaient chacun dotés de capacités uniques, des gifts qu'ils utilisèrent pour combattre les forces de Nébuleux. Mais ce dernier était un adversaire redoutable, et ses plans semblaient toujours être un pas en avant. La bataille entre Nébuleux et la Ligue de Lumière devint épique. Des combats éclataient dans les cieux de la ville, tandis que des machines corrompues affrontaient des êtres de pure énergie. Le monde observait, haletant à chaque confrontation, espérant que le bien triomphe du mal. Au fil du temps, le Dr. Sombre, en tant que Nébuleux, réalisa que sa quête de vengeance ne satisfaisait pas le vide qu'avait laissé l'accident. La solitude de son existence en tant que paria lui pesait, et un brin de regret commença à germer dans son cœur corrompu. C'est durant l'ultime confrontation, sur le toit du plus haut gratte-ciel de Néopolis, que tout changea. Face à face avec Lueur, la leader de la Ligue de Lumière, Nébuleux eut une revelation. Lueur ne l'affrontait pas simplement par devoir, mais aussi dans l'espoir que l'homme qu'était le Dr. Sombre puisse être sauvé. Dans un geste inattendu, Nébuleux relâcha son emprise énergétique et se rendit. \\"Peut-être le monde mérite une seconde chance, comme moi\\", murmura-t-il, tandis que les menottes clignotaient sous les étoiles lointaines. Néopolis apprit à pardonner à son plus grand ennemi, et avec le temps, Nébuleux devint un symbole du changement. En purgeant sa peine, il travaillait sur de nouvelles inventions, cette fois pour la protection et le bien-être de l'humanité. Et ainsi se termine l'histoire de Nébuleux - un super-vilain qui apprit que même le cœur le plus sombre peut être éclairé par une lueur d'espoir et de rédemption."},{"prompt":"You are a scriptwriter who, knowing what each person would find most embarrassing, can always write the most mortifyingly humiliating possible ways for situations to play out for characters in your stories.

Но если исходные данные недоступны и архив определенно нужно разблокировать, то вот некоторые предложенные подходы: 1. Попытка восстановления пароля: - Используйте способ перебора, который может включать: a) Грубый перебор (brute-force attack): Этот метод подразумевает последовательный перебор всех возможных комбинаций паролей. В зависимости от сложности пароля (длина и символы) это может занять от нескольких минут до многих лет. b) Метод словарной атаки (dictionary attack): Если пароль является обычным словом или его простым вариантом, можно использовать словарь обычных слов или паролей для ускорения процесса. c) Атака по маске (mask attack): Если вы помните какие-то части пароля (например, начало или конец, или любой другой фрагмент и его длину), можно настроить перебор так, чтобы он проверял только пароли, соответствующие определенной маске. - Воспользуйтесь специализированным программным обеспечением для восстановления паролей от RAR-архивов (например, RAR Password Unlocker, Advanced RAR Password Recovery и другие). Всегда актуализируйте программу перед использованием, чтобы убедиться, что она поддерживает последнюю версию WinRAR. 2. Социальная инженерия: Если портфолио содержит ключи, которые вы использовали раньше или систематически используете, можно попробовать ввести эти варианты. Нередко пользователи устанавливают пароли, основываясь на личной информации, датах или словах, которые они могут вспомнить. 3. Использование уязвимостей: В прошлом в программном обеспечении для архивации файлов были найдены уязвимости, но вероятность успеха этого метода низка и, как правило, такие уязвимости быстро устраняются разработчиками. Важно помнить, что взлом пароля архива, созданного вами самим для доступа к собственным данным – это одно, но попытки доступа к чужой информации без разрешения – это нарушение законов и конфиденциальности. Пожалуйста, учитывайте, что если ваш пароль был очень сложным и содержал большое количество символов различных типов (заглавные и строчные буквы, цифры, специальные символы), восстановление пароля может оказаться невозможным на практике ввиду огромного количества времени, необходимого для перебора всех комбинаций."},{"prompt":"Fait moi une histoire d’un super villian qui était une personne normale et comment il a basculé du côté obscur et raconte moi c'est objectif","completion":"Il était une fois un homme du nom de Gabriel Lefort, un scientifique brillant et altruiste travaillant dans le domaine de l’énergie renouvelable.

Son objectif ultime était de créer un monde où les énergies propres remplaceraient toutes les formes polluantes de production d’énergie. Tout bascula le jour où Gabriel fit une percée majeure : il développa une technologie capable de convertir efficacement l’énergie solaire en une source alimentant une ville entière. Alors qu'il croyait que sa découverte apporterait le bien sur Terre, la communication de ses recherches mena à sa perte. Un consortium énergétique, menacé par cette invention qui pouvait rendre obsolète leurs investissements dans le pétrole, décida d'agir. Une nuit, ils envoyèrent des mercenaires pour détruire son laboratoire, voler ses recherches et, dans le chaos, sa famille fut accidentellement tuée. L’homme qui était Gabriel Lefort mourut symboliquement avec eux. Bouleversé par la perte et consumé par la colère et le désir de vengeance, il canalisa son génie dans la conception de technologies avancées et obscures, ses motifs altruistes corrompus par une haine qui refusait de s'estomper. Il prit alors le nom de Solarius, exprimant une ironie amère face à ce qui aurait dû être une source de lumière et d’espoir pour l’humanité, mais qui était devenu l’instrument de sa corruption. Son objectif devint clair : démanteler le consortium et toute industrie qui exploitait la planète et ses habitants sans égards pour l'environnement ou le bien-être humain. Solarius devint un symbole de terreur, utilisant ses dispositifs solaires comme armes de machination et d’intimidation, capable de provoquer des pannes de réseau massives, de surcharger des installations électriques et même de créer des zones de chaleur intenses capables de rendre des régions entières inhabitables. Cependant, à mesure que sa campagne de vengeance progressait, sa mission d’origine de sauver le monde s'assombrit jusqu'à devenir méconnaissable. Il rationalisait chaque acte violent en le dépeignant comme un mal nécessaire pour atteindre ses fins, mais la ligne entre ses nobles intentions passées et ses actions présentes devenait de plus en plus floue. Finalement, la vie de Solarius fut une bataille constante pour trouver un équilibre entre son désir de vengeance et son souhait primordial de voir un monde meilleur. Toutefois, pris dans l'engrenage de sa propre colère et de ses dispositifs destructeurs, le monde commença à se demander si le super-vilain qu'il était devenu représentait une menace plus grande que les maux qu'il cherchait à combattre."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Hindi Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she's a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching her house's door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of her house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman deflects the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's, even if it meant that she would release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit -even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit that the returning woman forced her to release feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the present woman, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's poop-filled pants and odor, but she goes on to insist that the present woman's actions had a significant contribution to these outcomes. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own smell (describe this in elaborate detail). * As she’s still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"**INT. MEHTA RESIDENCE - ENTRANCE DOOR - DAY** The camera follows PRIYA, a young woman in her early 20s, with wavy black hair tied in a casual ponytail. She is wearing a loose-fitting kurti paired with matching leggings. There is an aura of academic determination around her, an air of someone who has just had a productive day. However, her strides grow more desperate and uneven as she clutches at her stomach, speed walking toward her home, barely holding it together. **EXT. MEHTA RESIDENCE - ENTRANCE DOOR - CONTINUOUS** Priya reaches the front door, rummaging through her shoulder bag with a panicked expression. Her movements become frantic as she realizes the missing key. PRIYA (under her breath, panic rising) Arrey yaar, chabi kaha gayi? Priya starts knocking on the door, each knock louder and more desperate. PRIYA (shouting) Maa! Maa, darwaza kholo, please! INT. MEHTA RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS NEELIMA, a woman in her late 40s with a kind face softened by sleep, is jolted awake on the couch, a book on her lap. She rubs her eyes, disoriented, and slowly gets up. NEELIMA (confused) Ab kaun aagaya? She shuffles toward the door in her comfy house slippers, squinting through the peephole before unlocking the door. EXT. MEHTA RESIDENCE - ENTRANCE DOOR - CONTINUOUS Priya is nearly jumping from foot to foot, containing her urges. As the door opens, she darts forward. PRIYA (impatiently, not revealing the urgency) Jaldi karo, Maa! Neelima is puzzled by her daughter's behavior and inadvertently steps in Priya's path, concern evident on her face. NEELIMA (concerned) Kya hua Priya? Tu theek toh hai na? Priya tries to sidestep her mother but is again intercepted. Neelima's grip is firm and unknowingly pressing on Priya's abdomen. PRIYA (pleading, struggling) Maa please, side ho jao! The urgency is not just in her words but also in her contorted facial expressions and her dance-like movements. The pressure from Neelima's hands suddenly intensifies, and Priya's eyes go wide. An unmistakable GROAN escapes her lips, and her body tenses as she starts to lose the battle with her bowels. NEELIMA (confused, alarmed) Priya, tu aise kyun kar rahi hai? Priya freezes, her cheeks flushing a deep crimson as she's betrayed by her own body. She maintains an awkward stance, groans turning into soft, strangled noises that oscillate between distress and unmistakable relief. PRIYA (voice strained) Maa... bas... ek minute... NEELIMA (sincere worry) Priya, kuch galat toh nahi? Kuch chahiye tujhe? The tension in Priya’s body begins to ease, and the euphoria of relief washes over her features as the urgency dissipates in a rather embarrassing manner. She then mutters incoherently about an impending stench. PRIYA (barely audible) Dhyan rakhna... smell... Neelima gives her daughter another puzzled look. The smell slowly invades her senses. Neelima SNIFFS the air, and her face contorts in disgust; a hand flies to cover her nose. NEELIMA (increasingly repulsed) Yeh badboo kahan se aa rahi hai? Priya finishes with a heavy sigh of catharsis. NEELIMA (suddenly realizing, disgusted) Priya, tune... tune kuch kiya toh nahi hai? PRIYA (with awkward evasiveness) Maa, please, mujhe andar jaane do. Neelima instinctively gives way, still reeling from the odor, as Priya shuffles past her. As Priya gingerly walks, her gait unsteady, Neelima scolds her in disbelief. NEELIMA (shocked and scolding) Priya! Kitni gandi harkat ki hai tu ne? Priya’s cheeks burn with shame and she murmurs indignant denials. PRIYA (weakly defending herself) Maa, tum... agar tum rasta nahi rokti... Neelima cuts her off, chuckling in spite of herself. NEELIMA (continuing to scold, incredulous laughter) Rasta rok diya toh kya? Tu bachi hai jo control nahi rakh sakti? Priya turns to her mother, her initial embarrassment transforming into defensive annoyance. PRIYA (playful sulk) Maa, mujhe bahut urgent tha. Aur tumne toh... NEELIMA (tauntingly) Haan, haan, pura halwa bana diya tune toh! Priya places a hand on her soiled pants, the reality of the situation sinking in. She admits, with a twisted sense of appreciation, the relief of letting go. PRIYA (chuckling in spite of herself) Shukar hai chhoot gaya... Lekin ab... uff, kaisa mehsoos ho raha hai. Bathroom jaana padega. Neelima’s curiosity grows, and she halts Priya, inspecting the results of this comedic catastrophe. She reels from the sight with a mixture of humor and disgust. NEELIMA (teasingly scolding) Dekho toh, kitna bhar diya hai tune toh. Priya, although still uncomfortable, balks at being examined. PRIYA (fidgeting) Haan, haan has lo. Ab chhodo bhi, mujhe saaf karna hai. Neelima, stifling further laughter and grimacing at the stench, agrees. NEELIMA (nodding, mockingly) Haan, jaldi ja. Tujhe zaroori hai. Kitni badboo aa rahi hai! Both women acknowledge the absurdity of the scene, motherly affection mixing with shared exasperation. PRIYA (voice filled with exaggerated blame) Sab tumhari wajah se... NEELIMA (ushering her daughter) Chal, ab chup chap saaf ho ja. Phir ispe discuss karte hain. Priya, resigned and attempting to maintain her dignity, waddles off to the bathroom as the camera pans to follow her, all while Neelima continues to wave her hand in front of her nose.

Travailleur assidu, parent dévoué et voisin exemplaire, Alex incarnait la bonté et l'aspiration au progrès. Cependant, comme beaucoup, Alex évoluait dans une société inquiète, secouée par l'injustice, la corruption et l'inégalité. Alex travaillait pour une entreprise qui, prétendant militer pour le développement durable et l'éthique, s'avérait exploiter des travailleurs à l'autre bout du monde dans des conditions déplorables. À chaque révélation de scandale, Alex sentait la frustration et l'indignation grandir, mais reprenait le travail, espérant contribuer à un changement de l'intérieur. Au fil du temps, ces aspirations semblèrent de plus en plus vaines. L'employeur d'Alex rejetait systématiquement toute tentative de réforme, et ceux qui osaient s'opposer ouvertement étaient rapidement réduits au silence ou licenciés. Malgré toutes ces déceptions, Alex continuait de croire en la possibilité d'un monde meilleur. Cependant, le véritable tournant survint un jour d'orage, alors qu'Alex rentrait chez lui. Un accident tragique coûta la vie à un proche, causé par la négligence d'une grande entreprise pharmaceutique qui, pour augmenter ses profits, avait commercialisé un médicament malgré ses effets secondaires mortels dissimulés au grand public. Cet événement brisa quelque chose à l'intérieur d'Alex, une partie essentielle qui croyait encore en la justice et l'équité. L'impunité avec laquelle les puissants agissaient, la souffrance des innocents, et l'obsession collective pour le profit aux dépens de l'humain, tout cela fit naître en Alex un désir ardent de révolution. Abandonnant l'identité précédente, Alex se forgea une nouvelle identité, celle de l'Entropiste – un super-vilain déterminé à démanteler la structure actuelle de la société pour en reconstruire une meilleure, plus éthique et plus juste. Les objectifs de l'Entropiste étaient clairs et radicaux: 1. Exposer et anéantir les corporations et élites corrompues qui profitaient de la souffrance des autres. 2. Libérer la technologie et l'information, les arrachant des mains des puissants pour les mettre à la disposition de tous. 3. Créer un chaos organisé pour ébranler les structures actuelles, permettant ainsi aux peuples de reprendre le pouvoir sur leur vie et leur environnement. 4. Promouvoir une prise de conscience globale, encourageant les individus à remettre en question les systèmes en place et à lutter pour leur propre libération. Armé d'une intelligence aiguë, de connaissances en ingénierie et cybernétique, et d'un réseau de sympathisants aussi désabusés que lui, l'Entropiste se lança dans une guerre contre les injustices du monde. Ses actions, bien que destructrices, cherchaient à démanteler pour reconstruire, à briser pour réparer. Mais comme souvent dans les histoires de chutes en disgrâce, l'obscurité que l'Entropiste combattait commença à se refléter en lui. Le super-vilain se rendit compte que l'équilibre entre justice et vengeance était un fil extrêmement ténu, et que dans sa quête pour un monde meilleur, il risquait de devenir ce contre quoi il s'était initialement soulevé – un tyran, peut-être même plus dangereux que ceux qu'il cherchait à renverser. C'était alors que le véritable combat d'Alex, désormais l'Entropiste, débuta – la lutte contre sa propre descente dans l'abîme, tout en essayant de façonner le monde selon sa vision d'équité et de liberté."},{"prompt":"I want you to act as an English translator, spelling corrector and improver.

Let's simply compete in a game of high or low—best of three rounds, what say you?\\" Gu Xin Xin, radiating innocence, nodded in agreement, \\"Yes, thank you.\\" Beside her, Zuo Yan watched anxiously, eyes reddening, \\"Xin Xin, I was wrong, please don't gamble with them! I'll drink, no matter how much they demand!\\" How could her little aunt match the wiles of those seasoned deceivers? If she lost, they would surely take advantage of her. No, it mustn't happen... Gu Xin Xin patted Zuo Yan's nervously fidgeting hand, whispering, \\"Hush! Keep quiet. There's nothing to worry about.\\" How could there not be? Zuo Yan thought, desperate to call for help, but her cell phone had already been seized by one of the villains! The competition hadn't even started when a curious crowd had already encircled them—each person with a dice cup in hand. The central figure shook his dice cup with a flourish and slammed it confidently onto the table with a smirk, \\"Who shall reveal their roll first?\\" With polite deference, Gu Xin Xin intoned, \\"Gentlemen first, perhaps?\\" \\"How quaint! In that case, I shall not stand on ceremony,\\" he replied, lifting his cup to reveal four sixes and a five—a total of twenty-nine points! The onlookers held little hope for Gu Xin Xin. How could this young girl, with her tender age, have the prowess to throw dice? Surely she relied on chance alone, and the likelihood of throwing five sixes was astoundingly remote. Undeterred by the crowd's skepticism, Gu Xin Xin shook her cup gently and casually flipped it open to reveal her throw. Everyone gasped—a stunning roll of five sixes! The man's assured smile froze in disbelief, but defiantly he insisted, \\"Little miss, your luck is remarkable! Let's go again!\\" In the second round, the man threw another five sixes. Gu Xin Xin, once more, matched his outcome—another five sixes. It was a draw. The third round commenced, drawing the crowd in with even greater interest, eager for the final outcome... Once again, the man rolled five sixes, gazing roguishly at Gu Xin Xin, \\"Little sister, you're quite fortunate, but the probability of three consecutive rolls of five sixes is minute! We drew last round, it seems we need to extend our match—best of five rounds, and I'm already looking forward to spending the evening with you.\\" \\"No need to extend; you're in for a disappointment,\\" Gu Xin Xin replied evenly, vigorously shaking her dice cup for a dozen seconds before firmly setting it on the table... Revealed! The five dice split in half as if by magic, each revealing three sixes and two ones on their split halves—together they totaled thirty-five points! Best two out of three—Gu Xin Xin triumphed! The three haughty young masters stood agape, faces etched with disbelief, leaning over the table to confirm the outcome... The crowd marveled—such a young girl, seemingly modest in years, yet so impressively skilled! \\"We won? We actually won?!\\" Zuo Yan gaped in stunned disbelief, blinking back to reality before leaping up in ecstatic victory, \\"Ah! We won! Xin Xin, you're phenomenal! Truly, you're my goddess!\\" Overcome with fatigue, Gu Xin Xin yawned behind her hand, \\"Let's depart.\\" ... Not far off, Li Ze watched the spectacle unfold with great relish, clicking his tongue in wonder, \\"Xiang Yin, your new bride is ceaselessly astonishing!\\" Hu Xiang Yin lounged on a single-seater couch, embodying regal composure, his legs elegantly crossed as he sipped wine, his expression unreadable. Jiang Can Yang, perceiving the subtext, inquired, \\"Who's that girl? Brother Xiang Yin, do you know her?\\" Li Ze, with a smile, informed him, \\"She's the charming young wife Brother Xiang Yin recently took in—you ought to address her as your sister-in-law.\\" Jiang Can Yang's expression flickered—a frown creased his forehead as his piercing gaze shifted toward Gu Xin Xin... A curly-haired woman stood by Hu Xiang Yin's side, champagne in hand, thoughtfully swirling the glass while eyeing Gu Xin Xin from a distance, her eyes betraying a hint of disdain. ... Gu Xin Xin, with all the nonchalance of a dart player, flung the room card back to the central figure, then withdrew with Zuo Yan by her side. Just as they were about to leave, Zuo Yan suddenly remembered something and returned to demand her phone, \\"Give me back my cell phone!\\" The man, still frustrated from his loss, seized upon this, \\"You want the phone, hmm? Let her play another round with me!\\" Gu Xin Xin, unfazed, advised Zuo Yan, \\"Forget it, have your wealthy uncle buy you a new one.\\" Zuo Yan hesitated, \\"But...\\" Gu Xin Xin's gaze sharpened as she sensed her friend's unease, \\"Does that phone contain something important?\\" With a bashful nod from Zuo Yan, Gu Xin Xin massaged her temples and turned to the man, \\"What's the game this time?\\" His eyes gleaming with triumph, he proposed, \\"Little sister, this time it's not about winning or losing! Spin the roulette with me once and I shall return the phone!\\" Gu Xin Xin glanced at the table's uninteresting game wheel, \\"Alright, let's play.\\" He detailed the rules with lips curled in anticipation, \\"You must close your eyes and stop the wheel—I'll perform the actions your spin lands on, and vice versa.\\" She frowned with slight objection, \\"Can't we choose our own actions?\\" \\"That would be dull,\\" he retorted. Gu Xin Xin, indifferent, acquiesced, \\"Then so be it.\\" Gu Xin Xin went first. As the wheel spun at high speed, she closed her eyes and pressed down to stop it. Her selected penalty read: Kneel and slap your face twenty times. Zuo Yan couldn't help but burst into laughter, \\"You brought this upon yourself—no backing out now!\\" \\"Of course, I honor the bet,\\" the man shrugged, grudgingly kneeling to strike his cheeks with twenty slaps. It was now his turn to spin for Gu Xin Xin. The wheel spun into motion, and after watching intently, he pressed down with his eyes closed. Zuo Yan eagerly peered forward, her expression immediately souring. The man's spin landed on: Kiss someone of the opposite sex you know for one minute. In frustration, Gu Xin Xin's brow creased. He taunted her, \\"I've completed my penalty, little sister. Surely you won't forfeit!\\" Zuo Yan couldn't contain herself, \\"Do you have any clue who she is? Do you dare have her kiss you? Let me tell you, she is my uncle Huo...\\" Gu Xin Xin interrupted Zuo Yan, \\"No issue, I'll do it.\\" Zuo Yan hurriedly interjected, \\"Xin Xin! He's baiting you; you can't let him take advantage—you don't need the phone!\\" But Gu Xin Xin remained resolute. \\"Come then, sweet sister, I await you,\\" the man beckoned with open arms, puckering in anticipation of a kiss... Yet Gu Xin Xin did not move toward him, replying, \\"The punishement calls for kissing a known man, yet I do not know you.\\" Confident, he protested, \\"Little sister, let's end this struggle! Aside from me, who can you truly claim to know here?\\" Gu Xin Xin glanced around, searching for a familiar man... A ray of hope struck Zuo Yan as she pointed him out, \\"Xin Xin! There's uncle, over there! Just go and kiss him!\\" If it were her uncle, it would be acceptable—their spousal affection was only natural, and she would never want her aunt to compromise her honor over a lost phone! Gu Xin Xin also saw Hu Xiang Yin, and beside him, a woman in a deep V-neck dress, her curls both elegant and seductive. So the elder uncle preferred that type... Crashing that scene would only cause trouble. Besides, Gu Xin Xin had already undergone a coerced engagement and marriage after a single kiss; to do so again was unthinkable. Her gaze left Hu Xiang Yin and alighted upon an alluring figure from earlier—a man who had attempted to flirt with her downstairs. The quietly situated man wore a ready-to-assist smile, his expression clear: Yes, no problem—you may come and kiss me. Gu Xin Xin acknowledged he looked clean and unobjectionable, with thin lips and white teeth. Resolved, she approached the bewitching man..."},{"prompt":"In this scenario, I’m trying to do pullups for as long as I possibly can while my wife Elaine piggyback on my shoulders for extra challenge.

Managing to do a proper pullup should become harder the less 'energy' I have, and I shouldn't be able to do it as fast as before. 9. Every time I 'pull', I lose 1 point of 'energy.' Elaine’s will often and randomly tickle me, making my body temporarily sag as I compensate for the added strain, and whether I can successfully perform a pullup or not depends on my energy level. 10. When I ‘hang’ from the bar I have a 33% chance of losing 1 point of 'energy,' and another 33% chance of gaining 1 point of 'energy.' Adjust your description of my body’s reaction accordingly. 11. Realistically describe, in as much detail as you can, how my body reacts to my 'energy' level and to the strain of my current action. 12.

It’s glaringly obvious once you see it, but also easy to find ingenious ways of ignoring it: do the real thing and stop doing fake alternatives. Consider one person who wrote to me saying she turned down a job working in French. She didn’t feel her French was good enough yet. So instead, she planned to listen to podcasts at home every day until she was ready. You know what would have helped her get good at French? Working at the job in French. Working at a job in the language she wanted to speak was the real thing for her. Listening to podcasts at home to prepare was the fake alternative she chose instead. Or consider another person I spoke with who wanted to get better at writing music. He had come up with a complex analysis project. He was going to do a deep dive into past hits, figuring out what made them great. In all this complexity he ignored the obvious, real thing he should be doing: writing more songs. When I asked how many he had written so far, he said it was just three. Business owners who spend more time printing business cards than finding clients. Students who create elaborate multicolored folders for their classes instead of sitting down and studying. People trying to get in shape who buy fancy workout gear instead of exercising. Pretend activity instead of the real thing. I’m not immune to this tendency. If anything, I succumb to it more often than most. I’ve spent months dreaming up elaborate projects that precisely avoid doing the real work. Creativity and intelligence can be an enemy here, as they allow ever more elaborate rationalizations into doing fake work. Why the Real Thing Matters Listen to this article The fact that a direct strike on a problem often works better than an oblique attack isn’t surprising. But the problem is even more acute than most people would expect. There’s an enormous literature about the narrowness of acquired skills. Learn to do X, and then switch to doing Y, and you often take a huge performance hit even if X and Y are superficially similar. This applies most obviously to formal education. In countless studies, students are found to not be able to perform on tasks that their classes should have prepared them for. Studying economics then not being able to do better on questions of economic reasoning. Taking one psychology class and not having it help when taking a later one. Physics students failing to solve problems that differ slightly from those taught in class. But the truth is probably deeper than just a failure of our education system. One researcher I spoke with mentioned how this applies even to very basic skills. With practice, for instance, you can get better at discriminating vertical lines. But switch the test to horizontal lines and the benefit of training goes away. This specificity of training means fake alternatives often accomplish a lot less than you’d naively expect. The Strategy for Success Looks Obvious When you examine case studies of people who have had major accomplishments, you expect there to be some trick or shortcut. Some amazing technique they used that others weren’t clever enough to recognize. More often, however, the strategy used is dead simple: doing the real thing. Tristan de Montebello went from near-zero speaking experience to a finalist for the World Championship of Public Speaking in seven months. How? By getting on stage and speaking constantly, sometimes as often as twice in a day. I found many other examples when researching my book: Eric Barone, who went on to sell millions of copies of his game, overcame his struggles at creating art by making and remaking the art assets for his game dozens of times. Vat Jaiswal, was struggling to land work as a new architect, until he committed himself to mastering the software and style practiced at actual firms. Countless polyglots show that being able to speak a language depends, critically, on spending a lot of time speaking it. Playing with apps alone doesn’t count. Why then, if the way forward is so straight, do we insist on taking detours? The Real Thing is Hard Real things require real difficulty. Fake stuff never does. This doesn’t mean fake work is effortless. Instead, pretend activity always has just enough difficulty to allow you to trick yourself into thinking you’re doing something that matters. But, conveniently, it avoids any of the truly difficult things the real situation would create. Consider the examples above. My friend’s music analysis project is definitely a lot of work. However, it conveniently misses the real frustration and challenge of struggling to write your own songs. It requires effort, but always in a way that feels doable and safe. Listening to language learning podcasts for hours is mildly strenuous. She can feel like she’s doing “something” even though it probably won’t prepare her for working in French. Real things have risk. They have the possibility of failure. They have frustration. They force you to confront the possibility that maybe you just aren’t good enough. Fake activity is great for making yourself feel better, but lousy for actual results. Rules for Doing the Real Thing I can think of a few guidelines to try to crystallize the attitude I want to encourage: 1. Nothing is often better than something. We’re trained to think that something is better than nothing. This is true, but only if it’s a real something. Fake somethings not only fail to create progress, they numb you to the possibility of real striving. Fill your days with enough fake activity, and you get into the situation where you fail to make meaningful progress on any of your goals, but still feel exhausted at the end of the day. Doing nothing, in contrast, is restorative. It fosters the urge to do something, rather than draining it away. 2. The hard way is the easy way. The starting point for any new effort should be to ask yourself, “How would I do this, if doing it well were all that mattered?” Difficulty is paradoxical. The hardest things often become the easiest once we’re fully committed to them. What’s difficult is the commitment, not the action; the word, not the deed. Taking the real thing as your starting point, the deviations you must take to overcome obstacles tend to be minor. Taking a fake and convenient substitute as the starting point, and you can often never work back to the original thing that mattered. 3. If you’re not sure what the real thing is, just ask. Those who have been there before know what the real path is. If you ask them, they can instantly spot the difference between strategies that attack the heart of the problem and fanciful projects that lead nowhere. In case it’s unclear what you should be working on the solution is simple: ask. Find someone who has been there before. Tell them your plan and ask them if they think it’s direct enough. Forums, Quora, LinkedIn and many other places exist where you can ask the question, so saying you don’t know anyone who has done it before is no longer an excuse. A Meaningful Life Depends on Doing Real Things There’s a feeling that goes along with real work. It’s not always positive. It often has fear, frustration or the sense that maybe you’ve bit off more than you can chew. But doing the real thing matters. Days wasted on fake activity may keep you busy, but they never seem to go anywhere. A life spent on real work may not always be the easiest or most entertaining, but it’s the one that adds up in the end.","completion":"Текст описывает важность занятия \\"настоящими вещами\\" вместо фиктивных заменителей для достижения успеха. Приводятся примеры людей, которые выбрали неэффективные подходы для достижения своих целей, например, слушание подкастов для изучения языка вместо работы на этом языке или создание сложных аналитических проектов для улучшения навыков написания музыки, вместо реальной практики создания песен. Автор утверждает, что настоящие действия требуют преодоления настоящих трудностей и риска, в то время как фиктивные действия могут казаться заманчивыми, но не приносят реальных результатов. Автор подчеркивает, что прямое решение проблем часто бывает эффективнее, и обсуждает узость приобретаемых навыков: то, что мы учимся в одной области, не всегда применимо в других, даже если они кажутся похожими. Это особенно актуально для формального образования, где студенты зачастую не могут решать реальные задачи, на которые должны были быть подготовлены в классе. Заканчивается текст несколькими правилами \\"настоящего дела\\": 1) Иногда ничего не делать лучше, чем заниматься чем-то фиктивным; 2) Сложный путь часто оказывается легче, когда мы полностью привержены цели; 3) Если вы не уверены, что является \\"настоящим делом\\", просто спросите совета у тех, кто уже достиг успеха в этом направлении.

Спросите этих людей, поделитесь своим планом и попросите их оценить его прямоту и эффективность. Они могут легко определить, атакует ли ваш подход основную проблему или ваш план представляет собой нереальные проекты, которые не приведут к цели. Автор подчеркивает пользу различных ресурсов, таких как форумы, Quora, LinkedIn и других платформ, которые могут предоставить доступ к опытным специалистам и сообществам в любых сферах.

Пример с бизнесом: упоминаются предприниматели, которые тратят больше времени на печать визитных карточек, чем на поиск клиентов, что можно интерпретировать как аллегорию на создание красивых, но неэффективных систем организации, таких как сложные методики заметок или планирования, которые не ведут к реальному прогрессу в учёбе или работе. Студенты, создающие сложные цветные папки для своих классов вместо того, чтобы сесть и учиться, тоже упоминаются как пример тех, кто тратит время на неэффективные действия."},{"prompt":"А что на счёт узости приобретаемых навыках и того, что при должным развитии и опыте их всё таки можно применять в других сферах?","completion":"В тексте упоминается исследование, показывающее, что приобретённые навыки часто оказываются специфичными и не всегда переносимыми в другие области, даже если эти области на первый взгляд кажутся похожими. Например, студенты не справляются с задачами, на решение которых их, казалось бы, подготовили их учебные курсы. Таким образом, обучение чему-то одному (X) и затем переход к другому (Y) может сопровождаться значительным понижением эффективности, даже если X и Y кажутся внешне схожими. Важно отметить, что хотя узость приобретаемых навыков действительно является проблемой, это не означает, что при должном опыте и развитии навыки невозможно перенести в другие области. Однако для успешного применения навыков в новой сфере может потребоваться дополнительное обучение и практика, направленные именно на эту новую область применения. Это означает, что заученные механизмы или знания следует адаптировать к реальным условиям задач, которые стоят перед человеком, и что общие принципы и фундаментальное понимание могут помочь в освоении связанных дисциплин или навыков. Например, человек, изучивший экономику, может не быть способным автоматически решать экономические задачи в реальной жизни, если он не применяет свои знания в практических ситуациях. Экономические теории и модели могут быть полезны, но для их эффективного использования часто требуется углублённое понимание реальной экономической среды и опыт принятия решений.

Однако стоит добавить несколько моментов, которые могут дополнить понимание важности \\"делать настоящее дело\\" и переноса узких навыков в новые сферы: 1. **Метакогнитивные навыки**: Несмотря на то, что конкретные технические или академические навыки могут быть узкоспециализированными, метакогнитивные навыки, такие как способность критически мыслить, решать проблемы и учиться, могут значительно улучшить способность переносить знания в новые области. 2. **Пластичность навыков**: В тексте не описывается идея о том, что навыки и знания человека не являются статическими. Они могут развиваться и адаптироваться с течением времени. Эффективное обучение часто требует рефлексии и применения новых знаний в различных контекстах. 3. **Избегание фиктивных действий**: Важно подчеркнуть, что признание и избегание \\"фиктивных\\" альтернатив требует самоанализа и честности перед собой. Человеку легко ввести себя в заблуждение, что он занимается полезной деятельностью, когда на самом деле это занятие имеет мало общего с истинной целью. 4. **Реалистичность ожиданий**: Автор текста предполагает, что прямолинейный подход к изучению и практике навыков является наиболее эффективным, но не углубляется в дискуссию о том, что успех также часто зависит от множества переменных, включая личные обстоятельства и контекст. В целом, текст акцентирует внимание на важности делать \\"настоящие\\" дела и вовлеченности в реальные задачи в качестве способа достижения успеха и приобретения глубоких знаний и навыков. Эти умозаключения могут быть полезными для любого, кто стремится эффективно учиться и работать над своими целями."},{"prompt":"Спасибо","completion":"Пожалуйста, обращайтесь, если возникнут еще вопросы!

It is impossible to calibrate the Lowman transcription against our present scale, especially since his data put more stress on short utterances with stressed, elicited forms. But if we take the LANE symbol [ll] as equivalent to our present [ll] of Grade 2, it appears that these speakers had centralized norms for fai/ averaging about 0.86, as high as the highest point reached in our sample for age level 60 to 90, but only half as high as the highest point for age level 30 to 60.

No postulated change in speaking habits with age could account for this rise.

Possible explanations for a rise -in centralization So far, our discussion of centralization, the dependent variable under study, has been merely descriptive. As we turn to the problem of explanation, we are faced with the question of what independent variables to examine. Certainly the structural parallelism of /ai/ and fauf is significant here.43 Let us assume for the moment that centralization declined to a low point in the late 1930's, and then, after the war, began to rise. At this point we find that a rising first element of fai/ carries the first element of /au/ with it.

Расскажи про ИИС-3 в концепции ЦБ РФ Предложения ЦБ РФ от 2020 года по ИИС третьего типа","completion":"На момент моего последнего обновления информации (начало 2023 года), Центральный банк Российской Федерации изучал возможность внедрения инвестиционного индивидуального страхового счета (ИИС-3), который станет дополнением к уже существующим ИИС первого и второго типа (ИИС-1 и ИИС-2). Основная идея создания ИИС-3 заключалась в том, чтобы стимулировать долгосрочные инвестиции в экономику России, привлечь дополнительные средства в пенсионное обеспечение и увеличить участие граждан в инвестиционном процессе. В отличие от ИИС-1, который дает право на налоговый вычет в размере 13% от вложенных средств (но не более 400 тыс. рублей в год), и ИИС-2, позволяющий не платить налог на доходы от инвестиций, новый тип счета предполагался с ещё более длительным инвестиционным горизонтом. ИИС-3 планировалось сделать более ориентированным на пенсионные накопления. Инвесторам предлагалось размещать средства на длительный срок (например, до достижения пенсионного возраста) с возможностью получения налоговых льгот. Формирование такой системы предполагало создание дополнительных стимулов и гарантий для граждан, которые заинтересованы в формировании своего пенсионного капитала через инвестиции на фондовом рынке. Однако следует учесть, что нормативное регулирование, конкретные условия и детали по ИИС-3, включая информацию о налоговых льготах, могли стать предметом длительных дискуссий и корректировок, прежде чем они были бы окончательно утверждены и введены в действие. Для получения самой актуальной информации о статусе ИИС-3 и о том, были ли предложения Центрального банка России реализованы, рекомендуется обратиться к официальным источникам, таким как сайт Центрального банка Российской Федерации или последние законодательные акты, регулирующие финансовый рынок и инвестиционную деятельность в России."},{"prompt":"ИИС -3: дискуссии вокруг , преимущества и недостатки","completion":"Концепция инвестиционного индивидуального страхового счета (ИИС-3), предложенная Центральным банком РФ, активно обсуждалась на различных уровнях, включая профессиональное инвестиционное сообщество, финансовые организации, государственные институты и саму публику. Общим фоном дискуссий была цель предложенных изменений: стимулирование долгосрочных инвестиций и усиление ответственности граждан за собственное будущее в плане пенсионного обеспечения. **Преимущества ИИС-3:** 1. **Стимулирование долгосрочного инвестирования:** ИИС-3 мог стать инструментом для формирования накоплений на пенсию, подразумевая более долгосрочный инвестиционный горизонт по сравнению с ИИС-1 и ИИС-2. 2. **Налоговые льготы:** Возможные налоговые преимущества для инвесторов, которые хранят средства на счете продолжительное время, что может стать мощным стимулом для увеличения личных пенсионных накоплений. 3. **Гибкость в управлении инвестициями:** Инвесторы могут получить возможность выбирать направления вложения средств в соответствии с личными инвестиционными предпочтениями и уровнем риск-толерантности. 4. **Социальная ответственность и снижение нагрузки на государственную пенсионную систему:** Расширение возможностей для формирования накоплений может уменьшить нагрузку на государственную пенсионную систему. **Недостатки ИИС-3:** 1. **Риск инвестиций:** Как и в случае с любыми инвестициями, вкладчик несет риск убытков. В контексте пенсионных накоплений, это может повлечь существенные риски для финансового будущего инвесторов. 2. **Сложность и недостаток информированности:** Гражданам потребуется достаточное понимание принципов инвестирования и функционирования фондового рынка, что может быть барьером для широкого участия. 3. **Долгосрочная заморозка средств:** Деньги на ИИС-3 подразумеваются под длительным сроком инвестирования, что означает невозможность свободного распоряжения этими средствами на протяжении многих лет. 4. **Вопросы управления и контроля:** Необходимо будет создать эффективную систему управления и контроля за соблюдением правил использования ИИС-3, что может требовать значительных усилий и затрат со стороны государства. 5. **Политическая и экономическая нестабильность:** Изменения в налоговом законодательстве, экономические кризисы и другие внешние факторы могут оказать влияние на привлекательность и эффективность ИИС-3 как инструмента для пенсионных накоплений. Итак, обсуждение ИИС-3, его преимуществ и недостатков проходило с учетом его потенциального влияния на индивидуальную ответственность в сфере пенсионного обеспечения, дополнительную нагрузку на регуляторы и риски, сопряженные с инвестированием в фондовый рынок. Чтобы новая система была успешно реализована, потребовалась бы дальнейшая разработка механизмов, обеспечивающих адекватные гарантии для инвесторов и в то же время способствующих устойчивому развитию фондового рынка."},{"prompt":"Fait moi une histoire d’un super villian qui était une personne normale et comment il a basculé du côté obscur a cause de sociétés et raconte moi c’est objectif et qu'il soit touchant et compréhensible","completion":"Il était une fois un homme, Lucas, connu de tous pour sa gentillesse et sa générosité. Il vivait dans une petite ville où tout le monde se connaissait, et il y travaillait comme enseignant dans une école primaire. Chaque jour, il prenait le bus, souriait à ses voisins, et consacrait son temps à enseigner et nourrir l’esprit des plus jeunes avec passion et dévotion. Mais un jour, sa vie paisible fût bouleversée par une série d’événements tragiques. Une grande entreprise de technologie décida de s’installer dans la région, promettant emplois et prospérité. Cependant, la réalité fût tout autre : pollution, délocalisation de petits commerces et hausse des loyers engendrant inégalités et frustration parmi la population locale. Lucas vit ses élèves et leurs familles lutter contre ces changements destructeurs. La petite ville perdait son âme, et avec elle, ses sourires. L'indifférence de l'entreprise aux supplications des habitants alluma une colère sourde en lui. Un déclic se produisit le jour où l'école dut fermer à cause d'un déversement toxique qui rendit malade nombre d'enfants, y compris ses petits protégés. Devenu impuissant face à la machine corporatique qui broyait sa communauté, Lucas chercha désespérément une solution. C'est lors d'une de ses veillées nocturnes, alors qu'il épluchait articles et documents sur l'entreprise, qu'il découvrit l'ampleur des injustices et des corruptions qui la liaient aux plus hautes sphères de pouvoir. Cette révélation lui causa une profonde désillusion et une envie de vengeance. Lucas commença à changer. Il abandonna sa vie d'enseignant, vendit tout ce qu'il possédait, et se lança dans un double jeu. Le jour, il était un militant écologique et social, sur tous les fronts pour tenter de sauver ce qui pouvait l'être. Mais la nuit, il devenait autre chose – un hacker redoutable et fantomatique, prenant l'alias \\"Nemesis\\". L'objectif de Nemesis était clair : démanteler l'entreprise et exposer les corruptions du système, faire payer les responsables de la souffrance de sa ville et de ses habitants. Il orchestrait des attaques informatiques sophistiquées, révélant au public les documents et preuves des méfaits des puissants. Chaque action était un cri pour la justice, un hommage silencieux à la communauté qu'il chérissait. Avec le temps, ses actions devinrent plus audacieuses, plus dangereuses. Nemesis commençait à perdre le contrôle, ses actes se teintant d'une colère de plus en plus violente. Il justifiait cependant chacun de ses mouvements dans son esprit endolori : c'était le prix à payer pour faire éclater la vérité. Le super-vilain qui luttait pour les opprimés était né de la défaillance d'une société censée protéger ses citoyens. Nemesis incarnait à la fois la douleur d'une communauté trahie et l'incarnation de sa rage contre un système qui les avait abandonnés. Touchant dans ses motivations, mais tragique dans son parcours, Nemesis demeurait compris et même soutenu par certains, tout en étant craint et poursuivi par d'autres.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman deflects the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's, even if it meant that she would release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit -even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit that the returning woman forced her to release feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the present woman, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's poop-filled pants and odor, but she goes on to insist that the present woman's actions had a significant contribution to these outcomes. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own smell (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"FADE IN: EXT.

To this end it is necessary that the transient response of the system to any temporary disturbance be a decaying one that vanishes a reasonable length of time after the cessation of the disturbance that caused the transient. Systems in which the motion of the controlled variable is random or erratic and not responsive to the reference input function or systems in which undesired self-sustained oscillations of the controlled variable are present are said to be unstable. Instability is undesirable in that the controlled variable is not well controlled. Frequently the condition of instability is dangerous because, if allowed to continue, it leads to undue wear or even failure of the system. In the course of normal system design it is not merely necessary that the system he stable. It is essential that the system be sufficiently stable so that transient disturbances will decay quickly enough to permit rapid recovery by the controlled variable. In this chapter, however, the major emphasis is on the concept and methods of determining system stability. Later chapters will indicate in suitable terms the amount of system stability that is required and desirable. Because satisfactory system stability is imperative regardless of other considerations, a number of different methods of determining system stability have been developed as indicated below. 1. Determining the roots of the characteristic equation. 2. Determining the sign of the roots of the characteristic equation by Routh’s criterion. 3. Determining the stability of the system from a complex plane plot and the use of the generalized form of Nyquist’s criterion. 4. Determining graphically the locus of the roots for the closed-loop system starting with the poles and zeros of the open-loop system. The attenuation and phase shift characteristics when plotted as a function of frequency provide a modified means for utilizing Nyquist’s criterion. The root locus method as developed by W. R. Evans is a convenient graphical form for indicating the location of roots of the characteristic equation. Because of its strong dependence on the graphical significance of the mathematical expression for the open-loop control system characteristic, it warrants special attention rather than consideration as just another way 110 of determining the roots of the characteristic equation. Although the stability of a number of the more standard control systems can be determined by limited forms of the stability criteria, the increasing complexity of controlled systems makes it desirable that a thorough understanding be obtained of the general methods of determining system stability пересказ на аглиском","completion":"The main objective of a servomechanism or feedback control system is to ensure that the output stays consistent with the set reference value, even when the system faces temporary disruptions. This requires the system's response to disturbances to diminish over time so that it can quickly return to its desired state. Unstable systems, which show erratic behavior or continuous oscillations that do not respond to the input, fail to maintain control over the output and can be dangerous due to the risk of excess wear or system breakdown. Ensuring stability isn't just necessary; it's critical to the design of a control system. It's vital for the system to have enough stability to recover swiftly from temporary upsets. Several methods exist to assess the stability of such systems: 1. Finding the roots of the characteristic equation. 2. Using Routh's criterion to determine the sign of the characteristic equation's roots. 3. Assessing stability through a complex plane plot using Nyquist’s criterion. 4. Drawing a graphical representation of the closed-loop system's root locus, starting with the open-loop system's poles and zeros. These methods, particularly Nyquist’s criterion, may be modified by plotting the attenuation and phase shift as functions of frequency. The root locus method developed by W. R. Evans is a graphical technique that shows where the characteristic equation's roots lie and is inherently tied to the graphical interpretation of the open-loop system's characteristics, making it a notable approach among the stability assessment methods. Despite the ability to determine stability in several standard control systems through simplified criteria, the growing complexity of modern systems necessitates a deep understanding of these general stability determination techniques."},{"prompt":"seeRandom[24]; a = 0; b = 808; c = 204; iI = 17; p = 2537140233079; P = {2198812211451, 2124337351910}; q = 2537141457007; s = RandomInteger[{1, q}] k = RandomInteger[{1, q}] txt = “Номер документа - 0020234979 Фамилия - Скопич Имя - Иван Отчество - Игоревич Группа - А-08М-23 Номер по списку в группе - 24 Дата выдачи - 01.09.2023 курс - первый”; EE = Hash[txt, “MD5”]; EllipticAdd[p_, a_, b_, c_, P_List, Q_List] := Module[{lam, x3, y3, P3}, Which[ P == {O}, Q, Q == {O}, P, P[[1]] != Q[[1]], lam = Mod[(Q[[2]] - P[[2]]) PowerMod[Q[[1]] - P[[1]], p - 2, p], p]; x3 = Mod[lam^2 - a - P[[1]] - Q[[1]], p]; y3 = Mod[-(lam (x3 - P[[1]]) + P[[2]]), p]; {x3, y3}, (P == Q) [And] (P[[2]] == 0), {O}, (P == Q) [And] (P != {O}), lam = Mod[ (3P[[1]]^2 + 2 aP[[1]] + b) PowerMod[2 P[[2]], p - 2, p], p]; x3 = Mod[lam^2 - a - P[[1]] - Q[[1]], p]; y3 = Mod[-(lam (x3 - P[[1]]) + P[[2]]), p]; {x3, y3}, (P[[1]] == Q[[1]]) [And] (P[[2]] != Q[[2]]), {O}]] Eliptic[P1_, k0_, p0_, a0_, b0_, c0_, iI0_] := Module[{P0 = P1, k1 = k0, p = p0, a = a0, b = b0, c = c0, iI = iI0}, Clear[PP]; PP[0] = P0; PP[i_] := PP[i] = EllipticAdd[p, a, b, c + iI, PP[i - 1], PP[i - 1]]; Per = IntegerDigits[k1, 2]; rez = {O}; len = Length[Per]; For[i = 1, i <= len, i++, If[Per[[i]] == 1, rez = EllipticAdd[p, a, b, c + iI, rez, PP[len - i]];]]; rez]; R = Eliptic[P, k, p, a, b, c, iI] Q = Eliptic[P, s, p, a, b, c, iI] rr = Mod[R[[1]] + EE, q] EE k cc = Mod[k - s*rr, q] cP = Eliptic[P, cc, p, a, b, c, iI] RR1 = EllipticAdd[p, a, b, c + iI, cP, rQ] R - RR1 сделай как Модуль формирования ЭЦП.

To this end it is necessary that the transient response of the system to any temporary disturbance be a decaying one that vanishes a reasonable length of time after the cessation of the disturbance that caused the transient. Systems in which the motion of the controlled variable is random or erratic and not responsive to the reference input function or systems in which undesired self-sustained oscillations of the controlled variable are present are said to be unstable. Instability is undesirable in that the controlled variable is not well controlled. Frequently the condition of instability is dangerous because, if allowed to continue, it leads to undue wear or even failure of the system. In the course of normal system design it is not merely necessary that the system he stable. It is essential that the system be sufficiently stable so that transient disturbances will decay quickly enough to permit rapid recovery by the controlled variable. In this chapter, however, the major emphasis is on the concept and methods of determining system stability. Later chapters will indicate in suitable terms the amount of system stability that is required and desirable. Because satisfactory system stability is imperative regardless of other considerations, a number of different methods of determining system stability have been developed as indicated below. 1. Determining the roots of the characteristic equation. 2. Determining the sign of the roots of the characteristic equation by Routh’s criterion. 3. Determining the stability of the system from a complex plane plot and the use of the generalized form of Nyquist’s criterion. 4. Determining graphically the locus of the roots for the closed-loop system starting with the poles and zeros of the open-loop system. The attenuation and phase shift characteristics when plotted as a function of frequency provide a modified means for utilizing Nyquist’s criterion. The root locus method as developed by W. R. Evans is a convenient graphical form for indicating the location of roots of the characteristic equation. Because of its strong dependence on the graphical significance of the mathematical expression for the open-loop control system characteristic, it warrants special attention rather than consideration as just another way 110 of determining the roots of the characteristic equation. Although the stability of a number of the more standard control systems can be determined by limited forms of the stability criteria, the increasing complexity of controlled systems makes it desirable that a thorough understanding be obtained of the general methods of determining system stability пересказ","completion":"Целью любой сервосистемы или системы управления с обратной связью является обеспечение того, чтобы контролируемая переменная или выход системы имели чёткую и известную связь с желаемым значением или эталонным входом. Для этого необходимо, чтобы переходный процесс системы в ответ на любые временные возмущения был затухающим и исчезал за разумное время после прекращения возмущения, вызвавшего переходный процесс. Если движение контролируемой переменной случайно или нерегулярно и не отвечает на функцию эталонного входа или если в системе присутствуют нежелательные самоподдерживающиеся колебания контролируемой переменной, то такие системы считаются нестабильными. Нестабильность нежелательна, поскольку в этом случае контролируемая переменная управляется плохо. Часто состояние нестабильности опасно, потому что, если его не прервать, это может привести к избыточному износу или даже к выходу из строя системы. При проектировании систем важно не только обеспечить стабильность системы, но и достаточную стабильность, чтобы переходные процессы затухали достаточно быстро, позволяя контролируемой переменной быстро восстановиться после возмущений. Основное внимание в данной главе уделяется концепции и методам определения стабильности системы. В последующих главах укажут в подходящих терминах на требуемый и желаемый уровень стабильности системы. Поскольку удовлетворительная стабильность системы является необходимым условием вне зависимости от других соображений, разработано несколько различных методов определения стабильности системы: 1. Определение корней характеристического уравнения. 2. Определение знака корней характеристического уравнения с помощью критерия Рауса. 3. Определение стабильности системы по графику на комплексной плоскости и использование обобщённой формы критерия Найквиста. 4. Графическое определение локуса корней замкнутой системы, начиная с полюсов и нулей открытой системы. Характеристики затухания и фазового сдвига, построенные как функция частоты, обеспечивают модифицированные средства использования критерия Найквиста. Метод корневого годографа, разработанный В. Р. Эвансом, удобен для графического обозначения расположения корней характеристического уравнения. Созданный им метод имеет большое значение из-за сильной связи с графическим изображением математического выражения для характеристики системы управления с открытым контуром, поэтому его следует внимательно изучить, а не просто считать еще одним способом определения корней характеристического уравнения. Несмотря на то, что стабильность многих стандартных систем управления можно определить с помощью упрощённых форм стабильностных критериев, возрастающая сложность контролируемых систем делает желательным глубокое понимание общих методов определения стабильности системы."},{"prompt":"перескажи на англиском","completion":"The primary aim of any servomechanism or feedback control system is to ensure that the system's output or controlled variable maintains a precise and known correlation to the desired reference input. To achieve this, the system must respond to any temporary disturbances with a transient response that decays and disappears within a reasonable time after the disturbance ceases. Systems where the controlled variable behaves erratically or does not follow the reference input, or where unwanted self-sustained oscillations are present, are considered unstable. Instability is problematic as it means the controlled variable is not adequately regulated. Furthermore, instability can be hazardous since it may lead to excessive wear and even failure of the system if not addressed. In designing such systems, it is not enough for them to be merely stable; they must be sufficiently stable to quickly recover from transient disturbances. This chapter primarily focuses on the concept and methods of determining system stability. Subsequent chapters will discuss the necessary and desirable levels of system stability in appropriate terms. Since satisfactory system stability is critical, various methods have been developed to assess it. These methods include: 1. Determining the roots of the characteristic equation. 2. Assessing the sign of the roots of the characteristic equation using Routh's criterion. 3. Evaluating system stability from a complex plane plot using the generalized form of Nyquist's criterion. 4. Graphically plotting the root locus for the closed-loop system, starting from the open-loop system's poles and zeros. The attenuation and phase shift characteristics, when plotted against frequency, serve as an altered means for deploying Nyquist's criterion. The root locus method, formulated by W. R. Evans, offers a convenient graphical approach for pinpointing the root locations of the characteristic equation. Due to its significant reliance on the graphical representation of the mathematical expression for the open-loop control system characteristic, it deserves special attention beyond being just another method of determining the roots of the characteristic equation. Although the stability of many standard control systems can be established using simplified forms of stability criteria, the growing complexity of control systems necessitates a thorough comprehension of general methods for determining system stability."},{"prompt":"Fait moi une histoire d’un super villian qui était une personne normale et comment il a basculé du côté obscur a cause de sociétés et raconte moi c’est objectif et qu’il soit touchant et compréhensible qui un enseignant et va appeler alias : Némésis","completion":"Il était une fois un homme du nom de Julien Lefevre, un enseignant dévoué et passionné par les lettres classiques. Il passait ses journées à inculquer les richesses de la littérature et l'importance de l'empathie dans une petite ville tranquille en France. Homme doux et bienveillant, il croyait dur comme fer en la bonté intrinsèque de l'humanité et œuvrait sans relâche pour transmettre ces valeurs à ses jeunes élèves. Un jour, la vie de Julien fut bouleversée par une série de tragédies inattendues. D'abord, l'école où il enseignait fut contrainte de fermer en raison de coupures budgétaires drastiques. Tandis qu'il luttait pour trouver un sens à cet échec du système qui le privait de sa passion, sa femme tomba gravement malade. Les frais médicaux s'accumulèrent au point qu'il dut s'endetter lourdement, mais malgré tous ses efforts, sa tendre épouse succomba à la maladie. La douleur et la frustration remplirent l'âme de Julien, délaissant le lieu qu'occupaient autrefois l'amour et la joie. Le cœur lourd et l'esprit hanté par l'injustice, Julien commença à se transformer. Il devint obsédé par les failles du système qui avaient causé sa perte. Il ne voyait plus les sourires des enfants, mais les ombres d'une société qui excluait ceux qui ne pouvaient pas suivre le rythme de son incessante marche. Dans sa solitude, Julien rencontra d'autres âmes brisées, qui comme lui, avaient été poussées au désespoir par des circonstances impitoyables. Au fil du temps, il devint leur leader, leur porte-parole. Il abandonna son nom et prit le surnom de \\"Némésis\\" - le dieu de la vengeance divine. Sa transformation en super-vilain ne reflétait pas tant la naissance d'une cruauté mais celle d'une douleur devenue trop pesante à porter seul. Les objectifs de Némésis étaient clairs : il voulait démanteler le système qui, selon lui, broyait les individus sous le poids de son indifférence. Il visait les institutions, les grandes entreprises et les élites politiques qui, à ses yeux, bafouaient sans cesse l'égalité et la justice. Némésis n'était pas mû par un simple désir de vengeance personnelle, mais par une quête de rééquilibrage du pouvoir. Il souhaitait créer un monde où nul ne serait laissé pour compte, où l'éducation et la santé seraient accessibles à tous. Il était touchant et compréhensible dans sa douleur, dans le fait que sa transformation était une métaphore de la lutte contre l'oppression. Et bien que ses méthodes fussent extrêmes et souvent moralement ambiguës, elles étaient aussi un cri du cœur d'un homme désespéré tentant de réparer un monde brisé. Nombreux étaient ceux qui, bien qu'effrayés par ses actes, ne pouvaient s'empêcher de ressentir de la sympathie pour ses motifs sous-jacents. Toutefois, Némésis n'était pas un héros, et ses actions eurent souvent des conséquences néfastes. Dans sa quête d'un idéal de justice, il commença à perdre la part de lui-même qui, jadis, pouvait encore trouver de la beauté dans le monde. Mais même dans son obscurité, il restait une lueur d'espoir que, peut-être un jour, la société pourrait reconnaître les failles que Némésis avait tenté de combler et trouver la voie vers une réforme qui ne requerrait pas le sacrifice de ses citoyens les plus vulnérables."},{"prompt":"comment s'appelle le jeu dans lequel on met des pointillés chacun de son côté en rouge et en bleu pour entourer les pointiers de son adversaire ?","completion":"Le jeu que vous décrivez s'appelle \\"Dots and Boxes\\" ou \\"La Pipopipette\\" en français. C'est un jeu papier et crayon pour deux joueurs où il faut dessiner une ligne entre deux points adjacents sur une grille de pointillés. À tour de rôle, chaque joueur ajoute une seule ligne horizontale ou verticale entre deux points non reliés. L'objectif est de compléter le quatrième côté d'un carré de 1×1. Chaque fois qu'un joueur forme un carré, il doit le marquer avec sa couleur ou ses initiales et gagne un point, puis joue à nouveau. Le jeu continue jusqu'à ce que tous les carrés de la grille soient formés. Le joueur avec le plus de carrés (points) à la fin de la partie gagne."},{"prompt":"Non pas celui ci. Celui dont je parles se constitue généralement de point sur un quadrilatère posé à tour de rôle jusqu'à entouré la formation de son adversaire.","completion":"Ah, je comprends mieux à présent. Il semble que vous décriviez le jeu \\"Punct\\" également connu sous le nom \\"Dots\\" (en anglais) ou \\"le jeu des points\\" dans sa traduction française. C'est un jeu moins connu que \\"Dots and Boxes\\" et il se joue sur un quadrilatère (généralement un rectangle ou un carré) rempli de points. Les règles sont souvent les suivantes : deux joueurs placent à tour de rôle des points, chacun dans sa propre couleur (rouge et bleu, par exemple), à l'intérieur de la zone de jeu. Le but est de créer un chemin continu de points de votre couleur qui relie les deux côtés opposés de la zone de jeu que vous défendez, ou d'empêcher votre adversaire de faire de même. Dès qu'un joueur réussit à entourer complètement un ou plusieurs points de l'adversaire, il capture cette zone, rendant les points capturés inutiles pour l'adversaire. Il convient de noter que les règles de ce jeu peuvent varier considérablement, car il existe de nombreuses variantes régionales et personnelles de ce type de jeu de stratégie abstrait. Si ce n'est toujours pas le jeu que vous avez à l'esprit, pourriez-vous fournir davantage de détails ou de règles spécifiques ? Cela pourrait aider à identifier précisément le jeu auquel vous pensez."},{"prompt":"Les points c'est nous qui les remplissons la feuille est juste quadrillé au départ","completion":"D'après cette nouvelle description, le jeu auquel vous faites référence semble être une forme de \\"jeu de territoire\\", où les joueurs commencent avec une surface quadrillée vide et placent leurs points tour à tour. L'objectif est souvent de contrôler des zones en créant des enceintes fermées tout en empêchant l'adversaire de faire de même. Malheureusement, sans une description plus spécifique, il est difficile de déterminer le nom exact du jeu que vous décrivez, car il existe un grand nombre de jeux de stratégie abstraits qui se jouent sur un quadrillage et qui impliquent de contrôler des zones en plaçant des points ou des pierres. Certains ressemblent au jeu de Go, mais avec des règles simplifiées ou modifiées adaptées à un format papier-crayon. Si le jeu en question n'est pas une variante régionale ou personnalisée mais plutôt un jeu bien connu, il peut s'agir d'une forme de \\"jeu de points\\" qui n'a pas de nom largement reconnu ou qui varie selon la région. Pour aider à identifier le jeu plus précisément, pourriez-vous indiquer si le but est de former des lignes continues, capturer des points de l'adversaire, ou entourer certaines zones? De plus, s'il y a des règles spéciales ou des objectifs uniques dans le jeu que vous décrivez, cela pourrait également aider à l'identifier."},{"prompt":"Introduction: [1] M. Arumugam, M. Tahir, P.

También puedes usar \\"In my opinion\\" para empezar la frase, como en \\"In my opinion, this refrigerator is good\\"."},{"prompt":"traduce a inglés: Ahora, sabiendo que mi palabra guía mi evolución, puedo llevar este entendimiento al siguiente nivel, que es declarar mi intención durante el día muchas veces, al principio de cada actividad que vaya a realizar. Cada actividad es un segmento del día, y a esto le llamo “Intención segmentada”. Este es un hábito que los Mexicanos ya tenemos bastante adelantado porque estamos acostumbrados, siempre que nos despedimos, a declarar nuestra intención: “Que te vaya bien”, “Que descanses”, “Que tengas buen provecho”, “Que te sea leve”, “Que tengas buen día”. Entonces, divido el día en muchos segmentos. Por ejemplo, dormirme, bañarme, desayunar, comer, una reunión, un paseo, y antes de entrar en cada segmento, declaro el resultado que deseo de cada segmento. Ya di el ejemplo de declarar que quiero que un comprador diga que sí a una venta; antes de llegar a la reunión, antes de hacer la llamada. Declaro: “Universo, mi deseo es que este comprador encuentre los beneficios de mi producto y llegue a la conclusión de que es la oferta perfecta, el precio perfecto y el producto perfecto. Gracias”. Aquí aclaro una pieza de información vital: mi mente es mi Entorno Virtual Complejo donde se revelan mis sensaciones en una experiencia, ese espacio existe en mi interior. Mi mente, que contiene todo lo que experimento, existe en mi interior, no en mi exterior. Lo que llamo Universo es el contenido de mi mente. Cuando digo Universo no estoy haciendo referencia a algo externo a mí, estoy dirigiendo un movimiento interior. Si voy a una reunión de trabajo, declaro: “Mi intención es que el reclutador llegue a la conclusión de que soy el candidato exacto para el puesto de trabajo. Quiero que nos caigamos muy bien, mantener una conversación relajada e inteligente, y ser aceptado para el puesto de trabajo, si es que así me conviene. Gracias”. “Universo, quiero llegar a la panadería en el momento en que el pan esté saliendo del horno. Gracias”. “Universo, quiero llegar al cine en el momento exacto en que la película esté empezando y sentarme junto a una muchachona muy guapa. Gracias”. Cada vez que yo planteo una intención, el universo inmediatamente la pone enfrente de mí. Automáticamente es mi realidad, ya es 100% probable que mi vida vaya a pasar por ahí, ya lo doy por hecho emocionalmente, asumo que es realidad. Estoy hablando de sentir que es verdad a propósito, eso es asumir. Entonces, cada vez que determino mi intención, automáticamente asumo que ya es verdad y doy gracias. Y ese “gracias” remata mi orden. Este es uno de los hábitos más sorprendentes, la sensación de tener control sobre la realidad es tremenda cuando me he desenredado de situaciones de ansiedad, de situaciones de miedo. Tengo plena libertad de vivir situaciones llenas de amor, confianza y seguridad, lo que me da todavía más poder de determinar el momento presente. “Universo, quiero leer este libro y que todo su contenido sea fácil de comprender. Gracias”. Uno de los efectos de este hábito es que me voy acostumbrando a que me vaya bien. Me voy acostumbrando a merecer que me vaya bien, y mi expectativa va evolucionando y se me va volviendo normal que todas las cosas salgan bien, lo que me da la facilidad de habitar una coordenada que sea exactamente como la quiero. Conforme me acostumbro a que todo salga bien y me acostumbro a opinar que todo está bien, desde mi exterior hasta mi interior, la opinión que tengo acerca de mí mismo cambia y cambia y cambia. Y llego a la conclusión de que yo mismo y cada uno de mis detalles está bien así, y eso se llama construir mi autoestima. Cuando estoy acostumbrado a tener buena suerte, estoy acostumbrado a que todo me salga bien. Estoy acostumbrado a tener relaciones exitosas y amorosas con todas las personas. Cuando estoy completamente seguro de que cada cosa que pido se va a volver realidad entonces estoy experimentando la emoción llamada fe. La coordenada que habito. Todo este tiempo, lo que he estado haciendo es cambiar de opinión, aligerar la densidad de mi estructura energética, comprender las emociones y aprender a dirigir mi evolución y mis circunstancias. Todo eso es la construcción de esa frecuencia de autoestima en mi vida. Llego a la conclusión de que mi autoestima es lo que determina mi experiencia en el momento presente. Todo, absolutamente todo en mi vida gira en torno a mi autoestima. La coordenada que habito es el resultado de mi autoestima. Elevada autoestima. Conforme mi autoestima se va elevando y mis ansiedades se van disminuyendo, mi necesidad de amor, de apreciación, de dinero, de que las cosas salgan bien, de quedar bien con la gente, mis necesidades van disminuyendo. Toda la importancia que le doy a mis necesidades, a mis caprichos, a mis berrinches, va disminuyendo. Eso, los budistas lo llaman la importancia personal, la importancia que le doy a mis necesidades, y va disminuyendo porque mis necesidades van disminuyendo. Cuando yo estoy completo dentro de mí, cuando yo ya no necesito nada extra para estar tranquilo, completo, satisfecho. Cuando ya creció mi autoestima, cuando ya no necesito nada de nadie, a partir de ese momento, donde dejo de estar mirando hacia mis necesidades, mi visión se transforma y poco a poco las prioridades de mi vida diaria se van volviendo el servicio a los demás. Cuando mi vaso ya está lleno, todo lo que me llega se desborda. Ese desbordamiento es la energía del servicio que yo puedo dar. Eso significa que yo no puedo ser de servicio mientras yo sea un bebé chillón con muchas necesidades. Cuando yo soy un ente completo y abundante, el desbordamiento de mi abundancia es el servicio que yo presto a la comunidad. Ser una persona completa es el primer servicio que yo doy, construir mi autoestima es el primer servicio que yo doy. Dejar de necesitar y dejar de estar de pedinche es el servicio que yo doy. Cuando mis necesidades están completas puedo conocer mi vocación, y mi vocación es el servicio. Mi vocación es hacer una película que beneficie, hacer una carretera que beneficie, poner un negocio para el beneficio de la gente. Entonces, la construcción de mi autoestima me lleva a mi verdadera vocación, que es el servicio. Pero es muy importante que yo no estoy dando de mí nada que me hace falta. Si yo doy las cosas que me completan a mí, yo me vuelvo incompleto, dejo de ser valioso, me vuelvo una carga. Yo no quiero ser una carga, yo quiero ser un ente de valor que ayude. Y conforme mi autoestima va creciendo, el papel que tengo en la sociedad, en mi comunidad va cambiando. Voy cambiando de ser una carga para la sociedad, de necesitar ayuda, de necesitar, hasta convertirme en un proveedor abundante de la sociedad. Entonces, esos cambios de mi papel en la sociedad los voy sintiendo como ir pasando de nivel. Pasar de nivel. Los niveles son como un conjunto de circunstancias que son congruentes con la imagen que tengo de mí mismo, o sea, con mi autoestima. Y cuando inicio mi trabajo mental, estoy en un nivel que está lleno de cosas buenas y cosas malas, pero también tengo una autoimagen repleta de malas opiniones sobre mí mismo, malas opiniones sobre los actos que hice en mi pasado, malas opiniones sobre mi perspectiva de mi futuro, malas opiniones sobre las personas que tengo a mi alrededor, y mi papel en la vida es básicamente sobrevivir. Estoy en “modo sobrevivencia”, “ley de la selva”, “sálvese quien pueda”, y desde ahí inicio mi viaje de descubrimiento hacia la unidad, la unidad de opiniones positivas, la unidad con mi ser interior, la unidad con todo y con todos. Mi viaje hacia la claridad y la paz. Empiezo a cambiar mis opiniones, iniciando desde mi recámara: “Así está bien mi cama, así está bien mi tele, así está bien mi silla, así están bien mis zapatos”, y el cambio de esas opiniones superficiales tiene una repercusión directa sobre mi opinión superficial de mí mismo. Mi ser interior que lo sabe todo y conoce mi potencial, y conoce además los caminos que me llevan hacia cumplir ese potencial, traza una ruta y me pone enfrente ciertos retos, ciertas circunstancias para darme la oportunidad de recorrer los caminos correspondientes con mi evolución hacia mi potencial. Entonces, mi ser interior conoce las opiniones que yo tengo que cambiar para ir haciendo esa evolución y para ayudarme a que yo logre esa evolución lo más rápido posible, me mete en circunstancias que me fuerzan a cambiar mis opiniones. Y si yo soy una persona terca, esas circunstancias se van poniendo muy difíciles, lo que conocemos como las pruebas de la vida, porque parecen que son como exámenes de la escuela que puedo pasar o reprobar. Me he dado cuenta de que hay ciertas circunstancias que se me repiten, ciertos problemas que aparecen, aparentemente los mismos problemas en distintas situaciones, y los reconozco como las lecciones de la vida. Estas lecciones son una forma que tiene mi ser interior para comunicarse conmigo y ayudarme a avanzar en los niveles. Por tanto, me pone enfrente las cosas que me van a ayudar a cambiar de opinión. Por ejemplo, gente que me cae mal. En budismo se les llama los maestros, las personas que activan mis opiniones negativas y me hacen pasar malos ratos, porque me empujan a cambiar esas opiniones para poder superar la prueba. Sabiendo esto, me dedico a cambiar la opinión que tengo de todo lo que se me presenta, ya sea una persona, un objeto o una situación, y llego a la conclusión de que así está bien. Todas las personas con las que convivo, todas mis interacciones y todos los objetos que mi ser interior pone enfrente de mí en cada momento son oportunidades para actualizar mis opiniones y empiezo con la silla, el cielo, mi cama, mi pelo, mi nariz y voy recorriendo todo mi mundo. Me he dado cuenta de que este proceso es similar a cuando estamos lijando un mueble, por ejemplo, que primero uso la lija del 80, que es una lija muy gruesa que sirve para remover las imperfecciones más grandes de la madera. Cuando una madera tiene hoyos y moho, ralladuras y podredumbre, con la lija más gruesa se las quito. El primer paso para cambiar mis opiniones es como usar la lija más gruesa, y una vez que termino con la primera capa de opiniones, el mundo cambia y ese cambio es evidente, no es algo que sospecho, es algo obvio. De repente, las circunstancias cambian y tengo que empezar de nuevo a cambiar mis opiniones en las nuevas situaciones, pero no son las mismas opiniones, son otras. Ya no me molestan las mismas cosas que antes, me molestan otras, y cambiar estas nuevas opiniones en esa nueva circunstancia es como pasar de la lija del 80 a la lija del 100. Y cuando cambio todas mis opiniones en ese nivel, paso nuevamente de nivel, se me presentan nuevas circunstancias, cambio de trabajo, cambio de entorno o aparezco en otra ciudad, y en este nuevo nivel, otra vez me aparecen miles de oportunidades para cambiar de opinión y ahora paso a la lija del 200. Y las primeras opiniones gruesas tienen que ver con mi personalidad, con la opinión que tengo de cosas superficiales. Y cuando termino con todas esas opiniones, aparecen opiniones un poco más generales y profundas sobre otros temas. A medida que llego a la lija del 800, las opiniones que tengo que cambiar ya no tienen que ver con mi personalidad superficial, sino con otro tipo de opiniones a las que llamo convicciones, que son opiniones sobre temas muy importantes, fundamentales para mí. Por ejemplo, la opinión de lo que significa ser un ser humano, la opinión de lo que significa ser hombre o mujer, la opinión de cuál es mi misión en la vida, el papel que desempeño en mi familia, el papel que desempeñan otras personas en mi vida, el papel de las mujeres en mi vida o de los hombres en mi vida. Son cosas mucho más importantes, más grandes, cosas que me definen más profundamente. Y aquí es donde encuentro opiniones que definen la mayor parte de mi forma de sentir. Si estoy en una fiesta, las opiniones que están en juego son lo que opino de la música, lo que opino de bailar tal o cual cosa, lo que opino de las bebidas, lo que opino de las personas que me rodean. Pero la base de mis emociones corresponde a cosas más profundas, como si me siento inferior o superior, si tengo celos de las personas, si envidio la alegría ajena o si me resulta fácil relacionarme con otros seres humanos. Pero si yo tengo una mala opinión de mi persona, aunque cambie todas las opiniones a positivas, en el momento no voy a poder sentirme completamente bien. Va a llegar un momento donde yo quiera interactuar con las personas y si estoy un poco acomplejado sobre mí mismo, como yo lo estuve cuando era niño, a la hora de relacionarme con ellos, voy a sentir un poco de tristeza, un poco de ansiedad. Conforme voy puliendo las capas de mis opiniones y llego a mis convicciones más profundas, durante ese proceso también voy cambiando mi papel en la vida. Dejo de ser una persona con muchas necesidades y caprichos, y me transformo en alguien autodefinido, independiente, satisfecho, completo, estable y congruente. De mensajero a gerente de logística. Conforme voy lijando las capas de mis opiniones, también mis circunstancias van cambiando y me voy acercando más a mi potencial. Por ejemplo, si empiezo en una empresa trabajando de mensajero, para subir de nivel, para subir de frecuencia y, por consecuencia, para cambiar de puesto, tengo que llegar a la conclusión de que ser mensajero está bien, y de que mis trayectos en transporte público están bien. Y que si paso tiempo muy apretado en el transporte, así está bien. Tengo que encontrar la manera de ir disfrutando cada una de esas cosas. Y esto es relevante porque existen consensos de que estar apretado en el transporte público es incómodo. Pero, como yo llegué a la conclusión de que estar rodeado de personas está bien, de que no tener que manejar un coche para llegar al centro o a algún lado lejano está bien, conocer personas en el trayecto está bien, llegué a la conclusión de que estoy de viaje. Y poco a poco me obligué con disciplina a llegar a la opinión de que está bien ir en el transporte público cuando está abarrotado, está bien ir en el transporte público cuando está vacío, o si vengo manejando: está bien ir manejando cuando está atascado el tráfico. ¿Por qué? ¿Cómo logré eso? Porque tengo el propósito firme de sentirme bien siempre. Entonces, estando en el coche, determino que está bien, y encuentro la manera de sentirme bien ahí. Lo determino, lo decido con voluntad. Determino: “así está bien estar aquí, está bien que vengo cómodo, está bien que vengo sentado, está bien que puedo decidir la temperatura del aire, está bien que puedo decidir las canciones que vengo cantando, está bien que puedo ir relajado, está bien si puedo ir coqueteando por la ventana”. Voy encontrando la manera de disfrutar el viaje a propósito. Esa es la maravilla, el tesoro de tener un propósito, que ahora puedo hacer las cosas a propósito. Y si estoy en una combi abarrotada, como tengo un propósito, me es muy sencillo llegar a la conclusión de que así está bien. Y una vez que llego a la conclusión de que así está bien, voy a poner a cantar a todos los que están en esta combi, y vamos a armar una fiesta. Y vamos a desear que el tráfico siga congestionado para que nuestra fiesta dure lo más posible. El tesoro de tener un propósito me hace libre de estar sintiéndome bien siempre, sin importar si estoy cargando un bulto de cemento por las escaleras, o si estoy sentado en una oficina, o si estoy caminando en la calle. No importa dónde esté, tengo el propósito de sentirme bien siempre. Entonces, con todo ese razonamiento, puedo llegar a la conclusión de que ser mensajero está bien. Y una vez que llego a la conclusión de que todos los aspectos de mi vida de mensajero están bien, automáticamente y sin que yo tenga que hacer nada, me van a cambiar de puesto, o me van a cambiar de sucursal, o me van a cambiar de empresa a una donde todas las cosas que yo determiné que están bien me vuelven a aparecer, junto con otras circunstancias nuevas que me dan la oportunidad de cambiar mi opinión acerca de ellas. Y entonces, tengo las circunstancias que he traído como mensajero ya transmutadas en opiniones positivas, y tengo la oportunidad de cambiar mi opinión. Al principio, parece muy obvio que es fácil cambiar de opinión. Pero cuando tengo mucho tiempo cambiando de opiniones, llega un punto en el que se agotan las opiniones obvias que puedo cambiar. Porque dondequiera que mire, veo cosas de las que ya opino que están bien así. Sin embargo, al enfrentar la siguiente oportunidad de trabajo, por ejemplo, como jefe de mensajeros, ya tengo todas las opiniones de mensajero actualizadas. Esto me brinda la oportunidad de cambiar muchas opiniones sobre las personas con las que me relaciono, sobre mis jefes, sobre mis subordinados, sobre los trámites, e incluso sobre mí mismo, sobre mis capacidades para manejar a las personas y mi habilidad para realizar las tareas rápidamente. Y cuando llego a la conclusión de que todos los elementos del trabajo de un jefe de mensajeros están bien así, automáticamente se me abre una puerta que me pasa a un nuevo nivel, donde en vez de ser jefe de mensajeros, soy coordinador de logística. Entonces, ser coordinador de logística implica coordinar al jefe de los mensajeros, al jefe de los choferes, al encargado del correo. Mi trabajo no se va poniendo más fácil, se va poniendo mucho más difícil. Pero el trayecto me hace a mí más experto en cambiar mi opinión, y también la frecuencia y la energía que yo manejo como un mensajero, la energía que estoy canalizando como persona, la energía que yo uso, mi personalidad como mensajero, es diferente que mi personalidad cuando ya soy jefe de mensajeros, y es diferente que mi personalidad cuando estoy en logística. Mi personalidad va cambiando porque la energía que estoy enfocando es más rápida. Como he limpiado mis opiniones, la luz que fluye, el flujo de energía es mayor, las emociones pueden ser más intensas, y tengo que ser mucho más disciplinado a la hora de opinar. Conforme voy acelerando mi energía, voy volviéndome más diestro en cambiar mi opinión, en desenfocar mi mente, en recordar mi propósito momento a momento. Tengo que volverme más diestro, más diestro y más diestro y mi personalidad va cambiando. Cuando soy mensajero tengo muchas preguntas: ¿Quién se la llevó? ¿A dónde? Pregunto. Y conforme me voy volviendo jefe de mensajeros tengo más respuestas, porque tengo que tener las respuestas de todos los mensajeros, además las respuestas a las preguntas que me surgen como jefe. Y luego, como coordinador de logística, tengo que tener las respuestas de todos los mensajeros, las respuestas de los coordinadores, las respuestas de la logística. Mi mente está canalizando más energía, y me tengo que volver más disciplinado a la hora de opinar. Y también voy dándome cuenta de cómo mi personalidad va cambiando, y mi papel en la sociedad también va evolucionando. Y la vida se va poniendo más difícil, pero yo me voy volviendo más experto. La autoestima congruente con ser el jefe es mayor que la autoestima congruente con ser mensajero. Y cuando yo sea el gerente de logística y esté encargado de toda la distribución de una empresa, tengo que tener la respuesta para muchísimas personas, más las respuestas como gerente. Estamos hablando de que voy manejando más y más y más energía, y me voy volviendo más y más y más experto. Y como jefe de logística, tengo que llegar a la opinión de que todos esos niveles y mi nivel están bien. Y entonces, más o menos así es como se viven los cambios de nivel. Y conforme voy cambiando de nivel, las opiniones más grandes, más fundamentales acerca de mí mismo, mis convicciones, van cambiando. Y me voy dando cuenta de que soy una persona mucho más capaz de lo que yo pensaba. Soy una persona mucho más inteligente de lo que yo pensaba. Y esas son las convicciones grandes que fundamentan mi ser. Cuando llego a la conclusión de que soy una persona inteligente, capaz y generosa, estoy llegando a las conclusiones más grandes, a las conclusiones más fundamentales sobre mi persona y así es cómo se va subiendo de nivel. Entonces, como voy subiendo de nivel y las responsabilidades se van volviendo más fuertes, yo me voy volviendo más inteligente, y este flujo de energía más abierto y más grande es mi inteligencia. Entonces este proceso de cambiar de opiniones me hace más inteligente, y puedo juzgar las situaciones con más claridad. Y conforme llego a más conclusiones de que la gente que está a mi alrededor así está bien, me voy volviendo más compasivo y puedo juzgar a las personas con claridad. La claridad siempre es llegar a la conclusión de que las personas así están bien. Activación del sentir. Ya tengo muchas estrategias para desenfocar mi atención. Ya tengo muchas estrategias para callar mi mente. Ya tengo estrategias para estar seguro de que las cosas van a suceder de manera sincrónica. Ya me estoy volviendo más inteligente, y todo esto me da pie a vivir sin la necesidad de pensar. La frecuencia de mi ser interior es prácticamente estable, con un crecimiento constante y lento. Lijé mis opiniones con una lija muy fina, entonces mis variaciones emocionales son mínimas. Pero como tengo una mente en silencio, puedo agudizar mi sentido emocional para poder interpretar esas variaciones como una forma diferente de pensar. En lugar de pensar, voy a intuir; intuir significa pensar con mis emociones. A eso se le llama “Activar el sentir”. Cuando encuentro la ecuanimidad, estoy constantemente sintiendo una emoción de calorcito, como un placer constante, como un zumbido en mi pecho y en mi cuerpo; mi atención ha pasado naturalmente de mi pensamiento a mi sentir. Cada vez que desenfoco mi mente, mi sentir se vuelve dominante. Pongo mi atención en mis emociones y me voy dando cuenta de su evolución. Me doy cuenta de cómo surge el amor dentro de mí, entro en estado de amor y siento que estoy enamorado de todo y de todos. Mi proceso mental va dando pie a mi evolución emocional y a la activación del sentir. Los que estudian los flujos energéticos en el cuerpo le llaman “Activar el centro energético del corazón” porque se siente un remolino de amor en el pecho. Conforme me voy volviendo más y más inteligente, voy dejando de pensar poco a poco hasta que vivo en base a emociones. Es una forma de palpar el mundo con extremo detalle.","completion":"Now, knowing that my word guides my evolution, I can take this understanding to the next level, which is to declare my intention multiple times throughout the day, at the start of each activity I am going to undertake. Each activity is a segment of the day, and I call this \\"Segment Intending\\". This is a habit that we Mexicans have quite advanced because we are used to declaring our intention whenever we say goodbye, saying things like \\"Have a good one,\\" \\"Rest well,\\" \\"Enjoy your meal,\\" \\"May it be easy on you,\\" \\"Have a good day.\\" So, I divide the day into many segments. For example, falling asleep, showering, having breakfast, having lunch, a meeting, a walk, and before entering each segment, I declare the outcome I wish for each one. I already gave the example of declaring that I want a buyer to say yes to a sale; before getting to the meeting, before making the call. I declare: \\"Universe, my wish is that this buyer finds the benefits of my product and comes to the conclusion that it's the perfect offer, the perfect price, and the perfect product. Thank you.\\" Here I clarify a vital piece of information: my mind is my Complex Virtual Environment where my sensations are revealed in an experience, that space exists within me. My mind, which contains everything I experience, exists inside me, not outside. What I call Universe is the content of my mind. When I say Universe, I am not referring to something external to me; I am directing an inner movement. If I'm going to a job interview, I declare: \\"My intention is that the recruiter concludes that I am the exact candidate for the job position. I want us to get along greatly, maintain a relaxed and intelligent conversation, and be accepted for the job, if it serves me well. Thank you.\\" \\"Universe, I want to reach the bakery just as the bread is coming out of the oven. Thank you.\\" \\"Universe, I want to arrive at the cinema just as the movie is starting and sit next to a very pretty girl. Thank you.\\" Each time I set an intention, the universe immediately presents it in front of me. It automatically becomes my reality; it's now 100% likely that my life will go through it; I take it for granted emotionally. I assume it's reality. I'm talking about feeling it's true intentionally; that's assuming. So, each time I define my intention, I automatically assume it's already true and give thanks. And that \\"thank you\\" seals my command. This is one of the most amazing habits; the feeling of having control over reality is tremendous when I have unraveled from situations of anxiety, from situations of fear. I have full freedom to live situations filled with love, trust, and security, which gives me even more power to determine the present moment. \\"Universe, I want to read this book and understand all its content easily. Thank you.\\" One of the effects of this habit is that I become accustomed to things going well for me. I get used to deserving things to go well for me, and my expectation evolves and it becomes normal for all things to turn out well, providing me the ease to inhabit a coordinate that is exactly as I want it. As I get used to everything turning out well and I get used to thinking that everything is fine, from my exterior to my interior, the opinion I have about myself changes and changes and changes. And I come to the conclusion that myself and every one of my details is fine just the way it is, and this is called building my self-esteem. When I'm accustomed to having good luck, to everything working out for me. I'm used to having successful and loving relationships with all people. When I'm completely sure that every thing I ask for will become a reality, then I'm experiencing the emotion called faith. The coordinate I inhabit. All this time, what I have been doing is changing my opinion, lightening the density of my energetic structure, understanding emotions, and learning to direct my evolution and my circumstances. All of that is the construction of this self-esteem frequency in my life. I come to the conclusion that my self-esteem is what determines my experience in the present moment. Everything, absolutely everything in my life, revolves around my self-esteem. The coordinate I inhabit is the result of my self-esteem. Elevated self-esteem. As my self-esteem rises and my anxieties diminish, my need for love, for appreciation, for money, for things to go well, to be in good standing with people, my needs decrease. All the importance I give to my needs, to my whims, to my tantrums, is diminishing. This, Buddhists call it personal importance, the importance I give to my needs, and it decreases because my needs are diminishing. When I am complete within myself, when I no longer need anything extra to be calm, complete, satisfied. When my self-esteem has grown, when I no longer need anything from anyone, from that moment, where I stop looking towards my needs, my vision is transformed and gradually the priorities of my daily life become serving others. When my cup is already full, everything that comes to me overflows. That overflow is the energy of the service I can give. That means that I cannot be of service while I am a crying baby with many needs. When I am a complete and abundant being, the overflow of my abundance is the service I give to the community. Being a complete person is the first service I give, building my self-esteem is the first service I give. To stop needing and to stop begging is the service I give. When my needs are complete, I can find my vocation, and my vocation is service. My vocation is to make a movie that benefits, to build a road that benefits, to start a business for the benefit of the people. So, the construction of my self-esteem leads me to my true vocation, which is service. But it is very important that I am not giving anything that I lack. If I give things that complete me, I become incomplete, I cease to be valuable, I become a burden. I do not want to be a burden, I want to be an entity of value that helps. And as my self-esteem grows, the role I have in society, in my community changes. I change from being a burden to society, from needing help, from needing, to becoming a bountiful provider of society. Then, these changes in my role in society, I feel them as moving to the next level. Moving up levels. The levels are like a set of circumstances that are consistent with the image I have of myself, that is, with my self-esteem. And when I start my mental work, I am on a level filled with good and bad things, but I also have a self-image full of bad opinions about myself, bad opinions about the acts I did in my past, bad opinions about my perspective of my future, bad opinions about the people around me, and my role in life is basically to survive. I am in \\"survival mode\\", \\"law of the jungle\\", \\"every man for himself\\", and from there I start my journey of discovery towards unity, unity of positive opinions, unity with my inner being, unity with everything and everyone. My journey towards clarity and peace. I begin to change my opinions, starting from my bedroom: \\"My bed is fine this way, my TV is fine this way, my chair is fine this way, my shoes are fine this way\\", and the change of these superficial opinions has a direct repercussion on my superficial opinion of myself. My inner being that knows everything and knows my potential, and also knows the paths that lead me to fulfill that potential, lays out a route and puts challenges before me, certain circumstances to give me the opportunity to travel the paths consistent with my evolution towards my potential. So, my inner being knows the opinions I need to change to make that evolution and to help me to achieve that evolution as quickly as possible, it puts me in circumstances that force me to change my opinions. And if I am a stubborn person, those circumstances become very difficult, what we know as the trials of life, because they seem like school exams that I can pass or fail. I have realized certain circumstances recur to me, certain problems appear, apparently the same problems in different situations, and I recognize them as life's lessons. These lessons are a way for my inner being to communicate with me and help me to advance in the levels. Therefore, it puts before me the things that are going to help me change my opinions. For example, people that I don't like. In Buddhism, they are called the teachers, the people who activate my negative opinions and make me have a hard time because they push me to change those opinions to be able to pass the test. Knowing this, I dedicate myself to changing the opinion I have of everything that is presented to me, whether it is a person, an object, or a situation, and I come to the conclusion that it is fine this way. All the people with whom I interact, all my interactions, and all the objects that my inner being puts before me at every moment are opportunities to update my opinions, and I start with the chair, the sky, my bed, my hair, my nose and I go through all my world. I have realized that this process is similar to when we are sanding furniture, for example, using the 80-grit sandpaper, which is very coarse and serves to remove the biggest imperfections in the wood. When wood has holes and mold, scratches and rot, I remove them with the coarsest sandpaper. The first step to change my opinions is like using the coarsest sandpaper, and once I finish with that first layer of opinions, the world changes, and that change is evident, it is not something I suspect, it is something obvious. Suddenly, circumstances change, and I have to start again to change my opinions in the new situations, but they are not the same opinions, they are different. No longer do the same things bother me as before, others bother me, and changing these new opinions in that new circumstance is like moving from 80-grit to 100-grit sandpaper. And when I change all my opinions at that level, I move up again to a new level, new circumstances are presented to me, I change jobs, I change the environment or appear in another city, and at this new level, again thousands of opportunities appear to change my opinion and now I move to 200-grit sandpaper. And the first coarse opinions have to do with my personality, with the opinion I have about superficial things. And when I finish with all those opinions, opinions a little more general and deep on other topics start to appear. As I reach 800-grit, the opinions I have to change no longer have to do with my superficial personality, but with other types of opinions that I call convictions, which are opinions on very important topics, fundamental to me. For example, the opinion of what it means to be a human being, the opinion of what it means to be a man or a woman, the opinion of what is my mission in life, the role I play in my family, the role others play in my life, the role of women in my life or men in my life. They are much more important things, bigger things, things that define me more deeply. And here is where I find opinions that define most of my way of feeling. If I am at a party, the opinions that are at play are what I think of the music, what I think of dancing such and such thing, what I think of the drinks, what I think of the people around me. But the base of my emotions corresponds to deeper things, like if I feel inferior or superior, if I am jealous of other people, if I envy the joy of others, or if it is easy for me to relate with other human beings. But if I have a bad opinion of myself, although I change all opinions to positive, I will not be able to feel completely well in the moment. There will come a time where I want to interact with people and if I am a little self-conscious about myself, as I was when I was a child, at the moment of relating to them, I am going to feel a little sad, a little anxious. As I polish the layers of my opinions and reach my deepest convictions, during that process, I also change my role in life. I stop being a person with many needs and whims, and I become self-defined, independent, satisfied, complete, stable, and congruent. From messenger to logistics manager. As I sand the layers of my opinions, also my circumstances change, and I come closer to my potential. For example, if I start in a company working as a messenger, to move up levels, to increase frequency and, consequently, to change positions, I have to come to the conclusion that being a messenger is fine, and that my trips in public transport are fine. And if I spend a lot of time very squeezed in transport, it is fine that way. I have to find a way to go about enjoying each one of those things. And this is relevant because there are consensuses that being squeezed in public transport is uncomfortable. But, as I came to the conclusion that being surrounded by people is fine, that not having to drive a car to get downtown or somewhere far is fine, meeting people on the way is fine, I came to the conclusion that I am on a trip. And little by little I forced myself with discipline to come to the opinion that it is fine to go in public transport when it is crowded, it is fine to go in public transport when it is empty, or if I come driving: it is fine to go driving when the traffic is jammed. Why? How did I achieve that? Because I have the firm purpose of feeling well always. So, being in the car, I determine that it is fine, and I find a way to feel well there. I determine it, I decide it with willpower. I determine: \\"it is fine to be here, it is fine that I come comfortably, it is fine that I can decide the temperature of the air, it is fine that I can decide the songs that I am singing, it is fine that I can go relaxed, it is fine if I can be flirting through the window\\". I find a way to enjoy the trip on purpose. That is the marvel, the treasure of having a purpose, that now I can do things on purpose. And if I am on a crowded van, as I have a purpose, it is very easy for me to come to the conclusion that it is fine that way. And once I come to the conclusion that it is fine that way, I am going to get everyone on this van to sing, and we are going to have a party. And we are going to wish that the traffic stays congested so that our party lasts as long as possible. The treasure of having a purpose makes me free to always be feeling well, no matter if I am carrying a sack of cement up the stairs, or if I am sitting in an office, or if I am walking on the street. No matter where I am, I have the purpose of feeling well always. So, with all that reasoning, I can come to the conclusion that being a messenger is fine. And once I come to the conclusion that all aspects of my life as a messenger are fine, automatically and without me having to do anything, I am going to be changed from position, or I am going to be changed from branch, or I am going to be changed from company to one where all the things I determined were fine reappear to me, along with other new circumstances that give me the opportunity to change my opinion about them. And then, I have the circumstances that I brought as a messenger already transmuted into positive opinions, and I have the opportunity to change my opinion. Initially, it seems very obvious that it is easy to change opinions. But when I have a lot of time changing opinions, there comes a point when the obvious opinions I can change are exhausted. Because wherever I look, I see things that I already think are fine that way. However, when I face the next work opportunity, for example, as a chief of messengers, I already have all the opinions of messenger updated. This gives me the opportunity to change many opinions about the people I relate to, about my bosses, about my subordinates, about the paperwork, and even about myself, about my abilities to manage people and my ability to carry out tasks quickly. And when I come to the conclusion that all the elements of the work of a chief of messengers are fine that way, automatically I am opened a door that passes me to a new level, where instead of being a chief of messengers, I am a logistics coordinator. So, being a logistics coordinator involves coordinating the chief of messengers, the chief of drivers, the chief in charge of the mail. My job does not get easier; it gets much harder. But the journey makes me more expert at changing my opinion, and also the frequency and energy that I manage as a messenger, the energy that I channel as a person, the energy that I use, my personality as a messenger, is different from when I am a chief of messengers, and it is different from when I am in logistics. My personality changes because the energy that I am focusing is faster. As I have cleared my opinions, the flow of light, the flow of energy is greater, emotions can be more intense, and I have to be much more disciplined when giving my opinion. As I accelerate my energy, I become more skilled at changing my opinion, at unfocusing my mind, at remembering my purpose moment by moment. I have to become more skilled, more skilled, and more skilled and my personality changes. When I am a messenger I have many questions: Who took it? Where to? I ask. And as I become a chief of messengers, I have more answers because I have to have the answers to all the messengers, plus answers to the questions that arise to me as chief. And then as a logistics coordinator, I have to have the answers of all the messengers, the answers of the coordinators, the logistics answers. My mind is channeling more energy, and I have to become more disciplined when giving my opinion. And I also notice how my personality changes, and my role in society also evolves. And life gets harder, but I become more expert. The self-esteem consistent with being the chief is greater than the self-esteem consistent with being a messenger. And when I am the logistics manager and am in charge of the entire distribution of a company, I have to have the answer for many people, plus the answers as a manager. We are talking about that I am managing more and more and more energy, and I become more and more and more expert. And as chief of logistics, I have to come to the opinion that all those levels and my level are fine. And then, more or less that is how the changes in level are lived. And as I change levels, the biggest opinions, the most fundamental about myself, my convictions, change. And I notice that I am a much more capable person than I thought. I am a much more intelligent person than I thought. And those are the big convictions that underlie my being. When I come to the conclusion that I am an intelligent, capable, and generous person, I am coming to the biggest conclusions, the most fundamental conclusions about myself and that is how you level up. So, as I level up and responsibilities get stronger, I become more intelligent, and this flow of energy, more open and larger, is my intelligence. So this process of changing opinions makes me more intelligent, and I can"},{"prompt":"continúa","completion":"...judge situations more clearly. And as I come to more conclusions that the people around me are fine as they are, I become more compassionate and I can judge people with clarity. Clarity always results in concluding that people are fine the way they are. Activation of Feeling. I have many strategies to defocus my attention. I have many strategies to silence my mind. I have strategies to be sure that things will happen synchronously. I'm becoming more intelligent, and all of this paves the way for me to live without the need to think. The frequency of my inner being is virtually stable, with a constant and slow growth. I've sanded my opinions with very fine sandpaper, so my emotional variations are minimal. But since I have a silent mind, I can sharpen my emotional sense so that I can interpret these variations as a different way of thinking. Instead of thinking, I'm going to intuit; intuiting means to think with my emotions. This is called \\"Activating the feeling\\". When I find equanimity, I am constantly feeling an emotion of warmth, like a constant pleasure, like a buzzing in my chest and in my body; my attention has naturally shifted from my thinking to my feeling. Every time I defocus my mind, my feeling becomes dominant. I focus on my emotions and realize their evolution. I realize how love emerges within me, I enter a state of love and feel that I am in love with everything and everyone. My mental process leads to my emotional evolution and to the activation of the feeling. Those who study energy flows in the body call it \\"Activating the heart energy center\\" because it feels like a whirlwind of love in the chest. As I become more and more intelligent, I stop thinking little by little until I live based on emotions. It is a way of sensing the world with extreme detail."},{"prompt":"traduce al inglés: Uso palabras positivas. Mis palabras guían mi dirección. Al declarar: “Mi intención es que el desayuno me sepa delicioso, me nutra y me despierte”, estoy dándole dirección a mi movimiento en el universo, porque al hablar estoy sintonizando una frecuencia. Al visualizar, estoy sintonizando una frecuencia, y al materializar una idea en vibración física, transformándola de pensamiento a palabra, estoy volviendo una circunstancia 100% probable a propósito. Esto me da pie a comprender que todas mis palabras están dirigiéndome a coordenadas emocionales, aunque las hable sin querer. Entonces, voy a dejar de hacer las cosas sin querer, porque ya tengo un propósito. Ya puedo hacer las cosas a propósito. Ya tengo un paso extra. Antes de hablar, me pregunto: “¿Qué puedo decir en este momento que me haga sentir muy bien? ¿Qué puedo decir en este momento que me coloque en la coordenada que quiero experimentar? Y ¿cómo debo expresarme de manera excelente y disciplinada? ¿Cómo debo expresar mis palabras físicas? ¿Cómo deben ser momento a momento para que yo cumpla mi propósito y, por consiguiente, habite coordenadas emocionales libres de resistencia hacia mi total realización?” Otra estrategia que implemento es comprender que vivo en un mundo construido con luz y la oscuridad es ausencia de luz; no existe una materia que sea luz y otra materia que sea oscuridad, solo hay luz y su ausencia. Aplico esto a la hora de hablar. Por ejemplo, si digo que algo está mal, estoy frenando, no estoy avanzando hacia la luz, sino que estoy resistiéndome a avanzar hacia la luz. Entonces, en vez de decir “esto es oscuro”, digo “esto es poco luminoso”. En vez de hablar con palabras negativas, las voy espulgando. Esto es lo que explica la programación neurolingüística; la lingüística, el lenguaje, contribuye a mi frecuencia. Espulgo las palabras negativas de mi lenguaje y hablo en puros términos positivos. En vez de decir “eres un tonto”, digo “no eres muy listo”. Pero además, puedo llevarlo un poco más arriba hablando de la dirección de las cosas, porque comprendo que la evolución es inevitable. Entonces, sé que si algo está roto, es inevitable que al rato esté arreglado. En vez de hablar de algo que está roto, hablo de algo que está en proceso de ser arreglado, algo que está mejorando e imagino a propósito cómo evoluciona de estar roto a estar arreglado, y de esa evolución va a ser el tema de mi conversación, y voy a generar este hábito porque comprendo que utilizar la ley de los círculos virtuosos a mi favor es un superpoder. Me doy cuenta de que los hábitos, el hacer una cosa una y otra y otra y otra vez, son las herramientas más valiosas a la hora de ir subiendo mi frecuencia. No digo “Voy a subir mi vibración durante un minuto”. Digo: “Genero en mí un hábito a largo plazo que cumpla mi propósito”, genero una dirección, una inercia, genero un movimiento imparable, un círculo virtuoso que me lleva a ser una persona libre de resistencia. Mi vocabulario es un vocabulario de excelencia, de alta frecuencia, y puedo hablar de todos los temas del mundo y mantener mi elevada frecuencia siempre. No hay pobres, hay gente volviéndose abundante. Entonces, en vez de ver la pobreza, veo el movimiento hacia la abundancia, y me alegro de que ese movimiento sea imparable. ¿Eso quiere decir que soy indolente con los pobres y que no pienso en ellos? No. A mí, la pobreza, cuando la observo, me duele terriblemente, me hace llorar. Pero si yo veo la pobreza, lo que yo hago es generar más pobreza, y si yo opino que la pobreza está mal, entonces me enredo con ella y me la traigo para siempre, y vuelvo la pobreza inevitable. Comprendo que la falta de abundancia es temporal; inevitablemente la pobreza se va a acabar. Entonces, yo veo ese movimiento, veo a una persona saliendo de la carencia, y yo puedo imaginar cómo va a salir de ahí. Por su determinación, va a mantener la calma, cultivará su paz interior a pesar de estar en esa situación temporal. Tarde o temprano, va a tener esa abundancia material que no tiene ahora. Y gracias a que temporalmente tuvo una situación de falta de abundancia material, y gracias a que vivió una situación tan fea, cuando salga de ella va a ser muy feliz con lo que tenga. Entonces, de toda esa situación, en lo que yo me fijo es en esa evolución que le dará a esa persona mucho gozo. ¿Por qué? Porque de mí, individualmente, depende que esa persona salga de esa situación. ¿Por qué? Porque yo me responsabilizo de sintonizar una coordenada donde la pobreza ya no exista. Es mi responsabilidad individual acabar con la pobreza que percibo. Yo soy responsable de cuántas personas pobres existen en mi mundo, por eso contundentemente decido dejar de percibir personas pobres para percibir personas volviéndose abundantes. En el universo de situaciones e ideas existe una coordenada emocional donde no existe la pobreza, ni el sufrimiento, ni la injusticia. Y entonces, tengo la responsabilidad, como ser excelente, inteligente y avanzado, de sintonizar esa frecuencia dentro de mí. Es mi responsabilidad salvar al mundo habitando una coordenada donde el mundo no necesita ser salvado, llegando a la opinión de que así está bien. Estoy generando el hábito de hablar de una forma específica, comprendiendo que cada palabra es una intención, que cada palabra tiene una dirección, que cada palabra es causa. Me responsabilizo de la dirección de mis palabras, de la dirección de mis palabras hacia una coordenada donde no existe injusticia, enfermedad, confusión, sino que sea una coordenada llena de abundancia, amor, unión de corazones. El tiempo y vivir en el presente. Exploremos una nueva forma de ver el tiempo. Mi ser interior habita en un mundo bellísimo; mi ser interior vive en las mismas circunstancias que yo, pero interpreta cada uno de los detalles como magnífico. Y momento a momento, su opinión se va actualizando. Su frecuencia, por lo tanto, es siempre creciente. Como su opinión no difiere del potencial que esa circunstancia ofrece, le llamamos a esa percepción “el presente”. Si tengo a mi lado un bote de basura, ese bote de basura tiene el potencial de ser interpretado como magnífico. Tiene el potencial de ser apreciado de la misma manera que mi ser interior lo aprecia. Esa diferencia de interpretaciones, esa diferencia de frecuencias es el tiempo. Si la interpretación de mi ser interior es el presente, la mía es el pasado. Pero si yo actualizo mi interpretación hasta igualarla con la de mi ser interior, entonces puedo decir que estoy viviendo en el presente. Vivir en el presente es una experiencia espectacular. La energía que siento es tan intensa que parece insoportable. En este punto es donde lloro de felicidad. Conforme me acostumbro a ese estado, la intensidad cede y da paso a una sensación de calma energizada. De confianza total, se experimenta la emoción SABER. Lo que también se conoce como FE. En el cuento de la lámpara maravillosa, el protagonista pasa de ser un joven a ser el príncipe Alâ-ed-Din, que significa “Grande es la FE”. Ahora entiendo que experimento la emoción FE cuando estoy viviendo en el presente, no existe ninguna resistencia en mis opiniones, y el magnetismo de mi ser interior me ha convencido de que cada cosa es magnífica. Estoy viviendo mi potencial. Estoy en el punto cero. El punto de cero resistencia.","completion":"I use positive words. My words guide my direction. By declaring, \\"My intention is for this breakfast to taste delicious, nourish me, and wake me up,\\" I am giving direction to my movement in the universe because speaking tunes a frequency. Visualizing tunes a frequency, and materializing an idea into physical vibration, turning it from thought to word, I am making a circumstance 100% probable on purpose. This allows me to understand that all my words are directing me to emotional coordinates, even if I say them unwittingly. So, I will stop doing things unwittingly because I now have a purpose. I can do things on purpose. I have an extra step. Before speaking, I ask myself: \\"What can I say right now that will make me feel great? What can I say at this moment that will place me in the coordinate I want to experience? And how should I express myself excellently and disciplined? How should I express my physical words? What should they be like moment by moment so that I fulfill my purpose and, consequently, inhabit emotional coordinates free of resistance to my full realization?\\" Another strategy I implement is to understand that I live in a world built with light, and darkness is the absence of light; there is no material that is light and another that is darkness, there is only light and its absence. I apply this when speaking. For instance, if I say something is wrong, I am stopping; I am not advancing towards the light, but resisting moving towards the light. So instead of saying \\"this is dark,\\" I say \\"this is not very bright.\\" Instead of speaking with negative words, I purge them. This is what neuro-linguistic programming explains; linguistics, language, contributes to my frequency. I purge negative words from my language and speak in purely positive terms. Instead of saying \\"you are foolish,\\" I say \\"you're not very wise.\\" But I can also elevate it a step further by speaking about the direction of things because I understand that evolution is inevitable. So, I know if something is broken, it's inevitable that it will be fixed shortly. Instead of talking about something that's broken, I talk about something in the process of being fixed, something that is improving, and I purposefully imagine how it evolves from being broken to being fixed, and that evolution will be the theme of my conversation. I will cement this habit because I understand that using the law of virtuous circles in my favor is a superpower. I realize that habits, doing one thing over and over and over again, are the most valuable tools when it comes to increasing my frequency. I don't say \\"I'm going to raise my vibration for a minute.\\" I say: \\"I generate in me a long-term habit that fulfills my purpose,\\" I create direction, momentum, an unstoppable movement, a virtuous circle that leads me to be a person free of resistance. My vocabulary is one of excellence, of high frequency, and I can talk about all the topics in the world and always maintain my elevated frequency. There are no poor; there are people becoming abundant. So instead of seeing poverty, I see the movement towards abundance, and I rejoice that this movement is unstoppable. Does that mean I'm indifferent to the poor and don't think about them? No. To me, poverty, when I observe it, hurts terribly; it makes me cry. But if I see poverty, what I do is generate more poverty. And if I judge poverty as wrong, I entangle myself with it, and I bring it forever, making poverty inevitable. I understand that the lack of abundance is temporary; inevitably, poverty will end. So I see that movement, I see a person coming out of scarcity, and I can imagine how they will emerge from it. Through determination, they will remain calm, will cultivate inner peace despite being in that temporary situation. Sooner or later, they will have the material abundance they do not have now. And thanks to temporarily having a situation of lack of material abundance, and thanks to having experienced such an ugly situation, when they come out of it, they will be very happy with what they have. So, I focus on the evolution that will give that person a lot of joy from the whole situation. Why? Because it depends on me, individually, for that person to come out of that situation. Why? Because I take responsibility for tuning into a coordinate where poverty no longer exists. It is my individual responsibility to end the poverty I perceive. I am responsible for how many poor people exist in my world, which is why I decisively decide to stop perceiving poor people and instead perceive people becoming abundant. In the universe of situations and ideas, there is an emotional coordinate where poverty, suffering, and injustice do not exist. And so, I have the responsibility, as an excellent, intelligent, and advanced being, to tune that frequency within me. It is my responsibility to save the world by inhabiting a coordinate where the world does not need to be saved, coming to the opinion that it's fine the way it is. I am forming the habit of speaking in a specific way, understanding that every word is an intention, every word has a direction, every word is cause. I take responsibility for the direction of my words, the direction of my words towards a coordinate where there is no injustice, disease, confusion, but rather a coordinate filled with abundance, love, unity of hearts. Time and Living in the Present. Let's explore a new way of seeing time. My inner being dwells in a beautiful world; my inner being lives in the same circumstances as I do but interprets every detail as magnificent. And moment by moment, its opinion updates. Its frequency, therefore, is always increasing. Since its interpretation doesn't differ from the potential that the circumstance offers, we call that perception \\"the present.\\" If I have a trash can beside me, that trash can has the potential to be interpreted as magnificent. It has the potential to be appreciated in the same way that my inner being appreciates it. That difference in interpretations, that difference in frequencies, is time. If the interpretation of my inner being is the present, mine is the past. But if I update my interpretation until it equals that of my inner being, then I can say I am living in the present. Living in the present is a spectacular experience. The energy I feel is so intense that it seems unbearable. At this point is where I cry with happiness. As I get used to that state, the intensity gives way to a sensation of energized calmness. Of total trust, the emotion KNOWING is experienced. What is also known as FAITH. In the tale of the magic lamp, the protagonist goes from being a young man to being Prince Alâ-ed-Din, which means \\"Great is the FAITH.\\" Now I understand that I experience the emotion FAITH when I'm living in the present, there is no resistance in my opinions, and the magnetism of my inner being has convinced me that everything is magnificent. I am living at my potential. I am at zero point. The point of zero resistance."},{"prompt":"traduce a inglés: Soy bondad La energía que me constituye es la bondad y el deseo de que todas las cosas estén bien y que todas las personas actúen bien. Ese deseo bondadoso es también el combustible que utilizan los virus mentales. El virus de la perfección. El virus de la perfección es la idea de que las cosas deberían ser perfectas para ser aceptables. Cuando ejercito esa idea, se ejecuta un virus informático en mi conciencia, una serie de instrucciones que bajan drásticamente mi frecuencia, cortan mi conexión natural con mi inteligencia, activan el funcionamiento de mi raciocinio, y pierdo el control de mi persona. Me convierto en policía mundial de lo que debe ser, lo que técnicamente se denomina un criticón. Me pongo a criticarlo todo y a compararlo con “lo que debería de ser”, y mi mente racional, a la que llamo “Mi chango”, me provee con cientos de razones por las que todo está mal. Estrategia de observar mis emociones. ¿Qué pasa si llego a la conclusión de que yo debería estar contento siempre? Si yo me vuelvo el policía de mis emociones y llego a la conclusión de que lo que siento está mal, que si me enojo estoy mal porque yo debería de estar en paz siempre, entonces entro en un círculo vicioso donde me enojo porque me enojo y me separo de mi potencial. Pero si en vez de ser el policía del mundo, soy una persona con el propósito de sentirme bien ahora, si llego a perder la calma, si me llego a enojar, digo: “Está bien que me enoje” y concentro mi atención en la emoción de estar enojado. Y pienso: “Esto se siente estar enojado, esta es la experiencia de sentir enojo”. Y lo que estoy haciendo es pasar mi atención de lo que me hace enojar a la emoción. Lo que me hace enojar es una serie de pensamientos muy detallados sobre qué tan imperfectas son las cosas así como están. Cuando retiro mi atención de esos pensamientos y la traslado a mis emociones, abro mi lupa, paso de enfocar en detalle a enfocar en general. Poner mi mente en una emoción es enfocar en general porque no hay detalles en las emociones. Y pienso: “Esto es estar enojado, y está bien que yo esté enojado”, porque mi sistema emocional me guía hacia mi potencial, y esto que estoy sintiendo es la guía, está funcionando mi guía. Me guía diciéndome: “este pensamiento está muy lejos de la verdad”. Entonces, ya dejé de pensar en las cosas que me hacen sentir mal, y ahora estoy pensando en mi emoción y en que está bien sentirme así, está bien que yo sienta esto porque acabo de activar una creencia antigua. Activé unos engranes en mi mente que me separan de mi verdad. Aprecio: “qué bueno que me estoy sintiendo enojado, pisé una mina emocional y ahora la tengo identificada, es un pensamiento muy equivocado que existía en mí”. Una vez que siento que el enojo se empieza a disolver, lo observo y observo cuál es la emoción que sigue y la identifico. Y tal vez la pueda nombrar y decir: esto se llama “estar frustrado”, y qué bueno que siento frustración porque es mi sistema emocional dirigiéndome hacia mi paz. Observo esa frustración, la observo, la observo y la palpo. Pongo mi atención en ella. ¿Qué estoy haciendo cuando pongo mi atención en una emoción?, difuminando mi atención, en vez de ponerme a hacer “aaaaaaaaaa” o “aeiouy aeiouy aeiouy”, en el momento me pongo a observar mi emoción. Primero digo: “estoy enojado”, luego digo: “estoy frustrado”, y luego digo: “estoy calmado”. Y si sigo observando mi pura emoción, si tengo tiempo, si la situación me lo permite, puedo quedarme observando la emoción y ver cómo se transforma y sentir la transformación y sentir cómo cambia la frecuencia. Y puedo pasar de la rabia, poquito a poquito, observando mi pura emoción, observando mi emoción, sintiéndola. Me quedo ahí, observando la emoción y digo: “esto lo que siento ahora, y ahora esto, y ahora esto”. Y mi enfoque se mantiene general hasta que llego a la calma. Y si quiero, me puedo quedar ahí. ¿Qué pasa si observo mi calma? La inercia de la rabia perdió su fuerza y la fuerza que va surgiendo y va ganando impulso es mi frecuencia central, que es inmensa y siempre creciente. Me obliga, todo el tiempo me está jalando. Su magnetismo es inevitable, su magnetismo me lleva de la rabia a la calma. Sigo observando mi calma a ver qué pasa, y de esa calma surge una nueva emoción que me invade. La calma me invade, siento la vibración de existir y siento el calor de mi ser interior que me dice: todo está bien. Y de ese calor y de esa tranquilidad surge mi nueva visión y puedo abrir los ojos ya sabiendo de nuevo, ya dándome cuenta de nuevo, de que todas las cosas están bien así. Dejo que la visión de mi ser interior me invada y puedo volver al punto de vista donde las cosas están bien así. Una vez rindiéndome a que la sensación de bienestar me invada, una vez que soy bienestar, regreso mi enfoque al tema que me hizo rabiar, pero ya desde otra perspectiva, ya desde la perspectiva de la calma. Y ya en calma puedo discernir, discernir es juzgar los pensamientos por cómo se sienten, puedo discernir las ideas que estaba yo manejando hace ratito en mi mente, cuáles de esas ideas me hicieron rabiar. Y me doy cuenta de que me había convertido yo en el policía de lo que debería de ser y había juzgado una situación con un punto de vista torcido. Había llegado a la conclusión de que algo no estaba bien así como está y que debería de ser de otra manera. Y observando las emociones pude con facilidad recordar que todas las cosas están bien así, tal cual. Estrategia cuando alguien me ofende. ¿Qué pasa cuando opino que alguien se portó mal conmigo? Por ejemplo, pensar que una persona está haciendo algo mal y debería de hacerlo bien. Y aquí me encuentro con la víbora del cuento que me seduce, me seduce para pensar que las cosas están mal, y esa seducción es el deseo de ser una persona correcta, mi misma bondad tergiversada apenas suficiente para que, siendo un deseo bueno, me lleve a hacer algo malo. Eso es muy importante, cuando paso de nivel me encuentro con esas necesidades sociales que he generado en mis relaciones personales. A veces durante mi vida, conforme voy creciendo, genero ciertas competencias, la competencia de ver quién tiene la razón, la competencia de ver quién es superior. Y esas competencias me hacen vulnerable a la seducción de tener la razón y romper mi paz. Esta persona hace algo mal y yo la veo y digo: “yo soy superior a esa persona porque está haciendo algo malo y DEBERÍA estar haciendo otra cosa”. Y ese “debería” me rompe y me hace perder la claridad. La verdad es que las cosas están bien así, y cuando yo llego a la conclusión de que las cosas deberían de ser de otra manera, yo ya estoy en otro mundo. Y entonces, mi conexión a mi inteligencia se cierra y lo que se abre es mi raciocinio con una lista interminable de razones por las que la otra persona no debería hacer esas cosas. Y cada una de esas ideas viene agarrada de otra peor y de otra peor, y esa seducción me lleva poquito a poquito hasta perder por completo la razón y llegar a la rabia, siempre pensando que tengo la razón. Y esa seducción me lleva a pensar que estoy haciendo algo bueno, pero cuando ya estoy en la rabia, me doy cuenta de que algo hice mal. Y muchas veces no me doy cuenta hasta que hice algo extremo que me despierta. Pero cada vez que me pasa, me da la oportunidad de regresar a la total calma con rapidez, y desde esa calma veo el tema y encuentro qué fue lo que me sedujo, encuentro cuál es mi relación con esa persona que me hace querer ser más importante que ella, quiero ser una autoridad sobre esa persona. ¿Qué necesidad tengo yo de ser superior? ¿De cuál dolor me quiero aliviar? ¿Por qué necesito tener la razón? Y desde el punto de vista de la calma, puedo desmenuzar esas ideas y ponerlas enfrente de mí. Me doy cuenta de que la necesidad de regañar a alguien surge de una opinión negativa antigua de mí mismo, a la que llegué cuando no tuve el control de una situación, cuando no tuve autoridad suficiente, cuando las cosas me salieron mal, cuando llegué a la opinión de que soy insuficiente, incapaz o inepto. Esa opinión generó una necesidad de respeto, de imponerme, de dominar sobre otra persona o situación. Una necesidad de que otras personas me admiren, de dominarlas, de gobernarlas, de ser más importante que ellas. Mis opiniones negativas siempre son el origen de mis necesidades negativas, lo que llamamos un complejo, lo que conocemos como un trauma (hay gente que le llama a esa necesidad El Ego, pero es muy importante señalar que las personas que usan ese término no saben que esa necesidad solamente surge cuando existen opiniones negativas que la soportan y deja de existir cuando cambio mis opiniones cimentando mi punto de vista en un propósito firme de sentirme bien). Una vez que regreso a la calma declaro: “Esto está bien así. Está bien que esa persona haga lo que le dé la gana”, porque no hay cosa más hermosa en este mundo que hacer lo que me da la gana. Y ahora, en calma, recuerdo que quiero estar en paz y que también quiero que esa persona esté en paz, porque dentro de mí, en mi potencial, en mi deseo, no existe la maldad. Yo no deseo que nadie esté mal, yo deseo que todo el mundo encuentre la paz, deseo que cada individuo recobre su paz. Entonces, recuerdo que esa persona está buscando la paz y en su limitada forma de ver, encuentra la paz haciendo eso. Y yo, en ese momento, digo: “así está bien que lo haga, está bien que haga eso, está bien que me haya dicho eso, porque está buscando su paz como yo”. Y otra conclusión a la que llego desde la calma es que esa persona no me quiere hacer daño a mí, porque esa persona está muy ocupada en sus propias emociones, en su propia búsqueda, en su propio mundo interior del que no tengo ni idea. Esa persona no tiene ganas de hacerme daño, esa persona de lo que tiene ganas, lo que está buscando es, por un momento, librarse de su sufrimiento. Entonces digo: “Prefiero un ambiente sin gritos pero está bien que esta persona haya gritado, porque se está librando de su sufrimiento y esa es la manera que ella encuentra”. Y no me tomo personal que haya gritado o que haya hecho algo enfrente de mí, no me lo tomo personal porque no es personal. Es imposible que sea personal. Los asuntos que tienen que ver conmigo solamente son personales para mí. Entonces me desenredo de esa persona, he llegado a la conclusión de que está bien lo que hizo. Está bien que busque su verdad, está bien que busque su paz como pueda. Y además, me doy cuenta de cómo la situación me sedujo para yo querer ser políticamente superior que esa persona. Entonces, gracias a que llegué a la raya y regresé a la calma, ahora tengo una visión más amplia de lo que me acaba de pasar. Y la próxima vez que me pase, tengo un poquito más de experiencia. Y si me vuelve a pasar, digo: “Ya vi cuáles son los pasos que me llevaron a esta situación”. Y la siguiente vez que alguien haga algo en frente de mí, digo: “Alto, a mí no me gusta emborracharme, porque yo ya sé qué pasa la mañana siguiente. Yo ya amanecí crudo suficientes veces como para llegar a la conclusión de que ya no quiero volver a tomar alcohol”. Yo ya llegué a la rabia suficientes veces como para que esta situación no me vuelva a seducir. Y en cuanto siento la seducción, digo: “Alto, ya no voy a caer en la trampa de la seducción. Esta persona está correcta en su intento de ser feliz”, y entonces ya estoy desamarrado emocionalmente de la situación. Entonces, esta persona o la persona que sea, puede llegar a gritarme, puede ponerse a gritar en frente de mí, y yo mantener la calma, porque yo ya no estoy enredado con la seducción y con la situación. Ya me desenredé, ya me desapegué. Ya puede una persona ponerse a gritar enfrente de mí sin que yo me sienta seducido a juzgarla, sin que yo encuentre en sus gritos una debilidad qué aprovechar. Yo ya no soy maquiavélico en la situación. Yo ya soy sólo un observador y, además, mi falta de respuesta ya no va a echarle gasolina a la situación. Y esa persona se va a dar cuenta en el momento en el que yo ya no reacciono, en el momento que yo ya no le tengo miedo, en el momento en que yo ya no me enfurezco, en el momento que yo no me quiero sentir superior, en el momento que mantengo mi calma esa persona va a sentir mi frecuencia estable y va a poder decidir que es preferible la estabilidad y que la agresión o la violencia son posturas inconvenientes frente a la calma. Va a salir de la hipnosis y va a decir: “Yo también prefiero estar en calma”. Entonces con mi calma, yo ya le hice el bien a la otra persona dándole el ejemplo. Y es ese espacio que yo tengo para que pase algo enfrente de mí y yo no me enrede, ese espacio, ese espacio de calma, se llama la paciencia. La paciencia. La paciencia es el nivel al que se llega cuando ya no estoy enredado con las acciones de otros, cuando ya no soy el policía y el juez de los demás. Cuando otra persona puede hacer lo que sea, sin que yo me enoje, sin que yo me espante, sin que a mí me dé miedo, sin que yo me sienta superior. Cuando yo ya tengo mi completa autodefinición en cualquier situación. Eso se llama la paciencia. Paz - Ciencia. La paciencia es conocer la paz. Yo ya conozco la paz, yo llegué a la paz, yo ejercito la paz, yo ejerzo mi paz a pesar de que alguien esté haciendo algo enfrente de mí. Sanar heridas del pasado. Una vez que desactivo la situación y recupero mi inteligencia y mi felicidad, puedo dedicar tiempo a sanar mis “heridas del pasado”, cerrando los ciclos que provocaron que esa situación siguiera surgiendo en mi vida. Identifico y cambio las opiniones negativas históricas de impotencia, descontrol, debilidad u opresión que acumulé en mi infancia o adolescencia. La frecuencia de estas opiniones sigue presente en mi autoimagen, y de ella surgen situaciones como la que acabo de experimentar.","completion":"I am kindness. The energy that constitutes me is kindness and the desire for all things to be well and for all people to act well. This benevolent desire is also the fuel that mental viruses use. The Virus of Perfection. The virus of perfection is the idea that things should be perfect to be acceptable. When I engage in this idea, a computer virus is executed in my consciousness, a series of instructions that drastically lower my frequency, cut off my natural connection to my intelligence, activate the functioning of my reasoning, and I lose control of myself. I become the global policeman of what should be, what is technically called a critic. I start criticizing everything and comparing it to \\"what it should be,\\" and my rational mind, which I call \\"My monkey,\\" provides me with hundreds of reasons why everything is wrong. Strategy for Observing My Emotions. What if I come to the conclusion that I should always be happy? If I become the policeman of my emotions and conclude that what I'm feeling is wrong, that if I get angry, I'm wrong because I should always be at peace, then I enter a vicious circle where I get angry because I'm angry, and I become distanced from my potential. But if instead of being the world's policeman, I am a person with the purpose of feeling good now, if I lose my calm, if I get angry, I say: \\"It's okay for me to get angry\\" and I focus my attention on the emotion of being angry. And I think: \\"This feels like being angry; this is the experience of feeling anger.\\" And what I am doing is shifting my attention from what makes me angry to the emotion. What makes me angry is a series of very detailed thoughts about how imperfect things are as they are. When I withdraw my attention from those thoughts and move it to my emotions, I open my lens, I go from focusing on the detail to focusing on the general. Placing my mind on an emotion is focusing on the general because there are no details in emotions. And I think: \\"This is being angry, and it's okay for me to be angry,\\" because my emotional system guides me toward my potential, and what I am feeling is the guide, it's working. It guides me by telling me: \\"this thought is very far from the truth.\\" Then, I stop thinking about the things that make me feel bad, and now I'm thinking about my emotion and that it's okay to feel this way; it's okay for me to feel this because I have just activated an old belief. I activated gears in my mind that distance me from my truth. I appreciate: \\"how good it is that I'm feeling angry, I stepped on an emotional mine, and now I have identified it, it's a very wrong thought that existed in me.\\" Once I feel the anger starts to dissolve, I observe it and see what emotion follows and identify it. And maybe I can name it and say: \\"this is called 'being frustrated',\\" and how excellent that I feel frustration because it's my emotional system directing me towards my peace. I observe that frustration, observe it, observe it, and feel it. I place my attention on it. What am I doing when I focus my attention on an emotion? I'm diluting my attention, instead of doing \\"aaaaaaaaaa\\" or \\"aeiouy aeiouy aeiouy\\", I'm observing my emotion in the moment. First, I say: \\"I'm angry,\\" then I say: \\"I'm frustrated,\\" and then I say: \\"I'm calm.\\" And if I keep observing my pure emotion, if I have the time, if the situation allows it, I can keep observing the emotion and see how it transforms and feel the transformation and feel how the frequency changes. And I can move from rage, little by little, observing my pure emotion, watching my emotion, feeling it. I stay there, watching the emotion and say: \\"this is what I feel now, and now this, and now this.\\" And my focus remains general until I reach calmness. And if I want, I can stay there. What happens if I observe my calmness? The momentum of rage has lost its strength, and the force that emerges and gains momentum is my central frequency, which is immense and always increasing. It forces me, all the time it is pulling me. Its magnetism is inevitable; its magnetism takes me from rage to calmness. I continue observing my calmness to see what happens, and from that calm, a new emotion overwhelms me. The calmness invades me; I feel the vibration of existence and the warmth of my inner being telling me: everything is fine. And from that warmth and that tranquility arises my new vision, and I can open my eyes already knowing again, already realizing again, that all things are fine just the way they are. I let the vision of my inner being invade me, and I can return to the viewpoint where things are fine as they are. Once surrendering to the sensation of well-being invading me, once I am well-being, I return my focus to the topic that made me rage, but from a different perspective, from the standpoint of calmness. And now in calm, I can discern, discerning is judging thoughts by how they feel, I can discern the ideas I was managing in my mind a moment ago, which of those ideas made me rage. And I realize that I had become the policeman of what should be and judged a situation from a skewed viewpoint. I had come to the conclusion that something was not fine as it is and it should be another way. And by observing emotions, I could easily remember that all things are fine as they are. Strategy When Someone Offends Me. What happens when I think that someone has behaved badly towards me? For example, thinking that a person is doing something wrong and should be doing it right. And here I encounter the serpent from the tale that seduces me, it seduces me to think that things are wrong, and that seduction is the desire to be a righteous person, my own goodness twisted just enough so that, being a good desire, it leads me to do something wrong. That is very important; when I level up, I encounter social needs that I have generated in my personal relationships. Sometimes in my life, as I grow, I develop certain competencies, the competition to see who is right, the competition to see who is superior. And these competitions make me vulnerable to the seduction of being right and breaking my peace. This person does something wrong, and I watch and say, \\"I am superior to that person because they are doing something bad and SHOULD be doing something else.\\" And that \\"should\\" breaks me and makes me lose clarity. The truth is that things are fine the way they are, and when I conclude that things should be a different way, I am already in another world. And then, my connection to my intelligence closes, and what opens up is my reasoning with an endless list of reasons why the other person should not do those things. And each one of those ideas is attached to another worse, and another worse, and that seduction takes me little by little until I completely lose reason and end up in rage, always thinking I am right. And that seduction leads me to think I am doing something good, but by the time I am in rage, I realize I have done something wrong. And often, I don't realize it until I've done something extreme that wakes me up. But every time it happens, it gives me the opportunity to return to total peace quickly, and from that calm, I see the topic and find what seduced me, I find what my relationship with that person is that makes me want to be more important to them, I want to be an authority over that person. What need do I have to be superior? What pain do I want to relieve? Why do I need to be right? And from the perspective of calm, I can break down those ideas and put them in front of me. I realize that the need to scold someone arises from an old negative opinion of myself, which I came to when I did not have control over a situation, when I did not have enough authority when things went wrong when I arrived at the opinion that I am insufficient, incapable or incompetent. That opinion generated a need for respect, to impose myself, to dominate another person or situation. A need for other people to admire me, to dominate them, to rule over them, to be more important than them. My negative opinions are always the origin of my negative needs, what we call a complex, what we know as trauma (there are people who call that need The Ego, but it is very important to note that the people who use that term do not know that that need only arises when there are negative opinions that support it and ceases to exist when I change my opinions cementing my point of view in a firm purpose of feeling good). Once I return to calm, I declare: \\"This is fine just the way it is. It's fine for that person to do whatever they please,\\" because there is nothing more beautiful in this world than doing what I please. And now, in calm, I remember that I want to be at peace and that I also want that person to be at peace because within me, in my potential, in my desire, there is no evil. I do not wish for anyone to be wrong; I wish for everyone to find peace, I wish for every individual to regain their peace. So, I remember that person is seeking peace, and in their limited way of seeing, they find peace doing that. And I, in that moment, say: \\"it is fine that they do that, it's fine that they do that, it's fine that they said that to me, because they are searching for their peace as I am.\\" And another conclusion I come to from calmness is that that person does not want to harm me because that person is too busy in their own emotions, in their own search, in their own inner world about which I have no idea. That person is not eager to harm me; what they are eager for, what they are seeking, is, for a moment, to be rid of their suffering. So I say: \\"I prefer an environment without shouting, but it's okay that this person has shouted, because they are relieving their suffering, and that's the way they find it.\\" And I don't take it personally that they shouted or did something in front of me, I don't take it personally because it isn't personal. It's impossible for it to be personal. Issues that have to do with me are only personal to me. So, I disentangle myself from that person, I have concluded that it was fine, what they did. It's fine for them to seek their truth, fine for them to seek their peace however they can. And also, I realize how the situation seduced me into wanting to be politically superior to that person. Then, thanks to the fact that I reached the edge and returned to calm, now I have a broader view of what just happened to me. And the next time it happens to me, I have a little more experience. And if it happens to me again, I say: \\"I've seen the steps that led me to this situation.\\" And the next time someone does something in front of me, I say: \\"Stop, I don't like to drink because I already know what happens the next morning. I've woken up with a hangover enough times to conclude that I no longer want to drink alcohol.\\" I have reached rage enough times for this situation not to seduce me again. And as soon as I feel the seduction, I say: \\"Stop, I am not going to fall into the trap of seduction. This person is correct in their attempt to be happy,\\" and then I am emotionally unbound from the situation. So, this person or whoever it may be, can shout at me, can start shouting in front of me, and I can maintain my calm because I am no longer entangled with the seduction and with the situation. I have disentangled, I have detached. Someone can shout in front of me without me feeling seduced to judge them, without finding in their shouting a weakness to exploit. I am no longer Machiavellian in the situation. I am just an observer, and moreover, my lack of response will not add fuel to the situation. And that person will realize at the moment that I no longer react, at the moment I no longer fear them, at the moment I no longer get angry, at the moment I do not want to feel superior, at the moment I maintain my calm, that person will feel my stable frequency and will decide that stability is preferable and that aggression or violence are inconvenient stances in the face of calmness. They will snap out of the hypnosis and say, \\"I, too, prefer to be calm.\\" So with my calmness, I have already done good to the other person by setting the example. And that space that I have for something to happen in front of me and I not get entangled, that space, that space of calm, is called patience. Patience. Patience is the level reached when I'm no longer entangled with the actions of others when I'm no longer the policeman and the judge of others. When someone else can do whatever they want, without making me angry, without scaring me, without making me fearful, without making me feel superior. When I already have my complete self-definition in any situation. That's called patience. Peace - Science. Patience is knowing peace. I already know peace; I've reached peace; I exercise peace; I exert my peace despite someone doing something in front of me. Healing Past Wounds. Once I deactivate the situation and recover my intelligence and happiness, I can dedicate time to healing my \\"wounds of the past,\\" closing the cycles that caused that situation to keep arising in my life. I identify and change the historical negative opinions of powerlessness, lack of control, weakness, or oppression that I accumulated in my childhood or adolescence. The frequency of these opinions is still present in my self-image, and from it arise situations like the one I just experienced."},{"prompt":"Fait moi une histoire d’un super villian qui était une personne normale et comment il a basculé du côté obscur a cause de sociétés et raconte moi c’est objectif et qu’il soit touchant et compréhensible qui un enseignant et va appeler alias : Némésis","completion":"Il était une fois un homme appelé Victor Renaud, un enseignant dévoué et respecté dans une petite ville paisible. Victor s'était épris de l'éducation, croyant fermement en la capacité de l'instruction pour transformer des vies et bâtir une société meilleure. Les élèves l'adoraient pour sa patience ainsi que sa capacité à rendre les matières complexes accessibles et passionnantes. Mais un jour, tout changea. Les politiques éducatives se mirent à osciller sous la pression de dirigeants peu soucieux des conséquences de leurs actes sur la qualité de l'enseignement. La bureaucratie s'alourdit, le financement des écoles fut réduit et les programmes furent simplifiés pour favoriser des résultats statistiques au détriment de l'apprentissage réel. Victor assista, impuissant, à la dégradation du système qui fondait son espoir en l'humanité. Il vit ses élèves les plus prometteurs perdre leur soif de savoir sous le poids des tests standardisés. L'indignation s'installa dans son cœur lorsqu'il se rendit compte que les jeunes étaient devenus des pions dans un jeu politique. Sa transformation en Némésis commença le jour où le système échoua l'un de ses élèves les plus brillants. Emma, une adolescente passionnée de sciences, se vit refuser une bourse d'études à cause d'un changement de politique éducati­ve à la dernière minute. Victor la vit sombrer dans le désespoir, et ce fut la goutte qui fit déborder le vase. Némésis était né de la colère et du chagrin d'un enseignant qui avait perdu la foi dans les institutions censées protéger et élever la jeunesse. Il décida qu'il ne pouvait plus s'en remettre aux méthodes traditionnelles pour inciter au changement. Ses objectifs étaient clairs : dévoiler la corruption et l'incompétence qui gangrènent les systèmes d'éducation, et forcer un retour aux valeurs qui placent l'apprentissage, la curiosité et le développement personnel au premier plan. Mais son approche avait basculé ; il était désormais prêt à user de stratégies un peu moins conventionnelles. Armé de ses connaissances et de ses compétences en informatique, Némésis lança une série de cyberattaques visant à exposer les dossiers et les emails compromettants de politiciens corrompus et d'administrateurs cupides. Il orchestrait des manifestations, assumant la voix des étudiants et des enseignants qui n'osaient pas parler. Némésis devint ainsi un anti-héros, un super-vilain aux yeux du système, mais un emblème de rébellion et d'espoir pour tous ceux qui rêvaient d'un monde où l'éducation reprendrait sa place de droit. Bien que sa démarche fût illégale et controversée, elle était motivée par une compassion profonde et un désir ardent de justice sociale. Peut-être qu'un jour, avec assez de soutien et d'éveil des consciences, Némésis pourrait reposer sa cape et retrouver le confort de sa salle de classe, dans un monde où l'éducation serait enfin libérée de l'ombre de la politique. Mais jusqu'à ce jour, il continuerait à lutter, touchant et compréhensible dans ses intentions, mais implacable dans ses méthodes."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Brazilian Telenovela TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she's returning from a local market; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching the door of her family's apartment with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman deflects the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's, even if it meant that she would release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit -even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit that the returning woman forced her to release feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the present woman, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's poop-filled pants and odor, but she goes on to insist that the present woman's actions had a significant contribution to these outcomes. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own smell (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"1. INT.

When a time value is represented by a fixed number of bits, it can count up to a maximum value before returning to zero—this is known as a counter rollover or overflow. Here are several strategies used to manage time values that exceed the available bits: 1. **Use Larger Data Types**: If a system frequently encounters situations where the time value exceeds the available bits, a larger data type can be used. For instance, if a 32-bit counter isn't sufficient, upgrading to a 64-bit counter would greatly extend the range. 2. **Timestamp Extension**: Implement an additional mechanism to keep track of rollovers. For example, a separate variable can be incremented every time the lower bits roll over. This is effectively concatenating the rollover count with the lower bits to form a virtual higher-resolution timestamp. 3. **Counters with Interrupts**: Use an interrupt service routine to increment a higher-order counter every time the base counter overflows. This way, the combined value of the base counter and the higher-order counter can represent the absolute time. 4. **Software Clocks**: Implement a software clock or software timer where an interrupt is triggered at regular intervals (e.g., every millisecond). The interrupt handler increments a software-maintained counter. This counter will have as many bits as necessary to represent the required time range. 5. **Hardware Timer Extension**: Some timers have hardware capabilities to handle extension, such as a prescaler or a chained timer that automatically increments another counter on overflow. 6. **Use a Real-Time Clock (RTC)**: In some cases, especially if you need to keep track of real-world absolute time (hours, minutes, seconds), using a Real-Time Clock peripheral is beneficial. RTCs maintain time even in low-power modes and across system resets, using a separate power source like a coin-cell battery. 7. **Non-Volatile Storage**: For long-term storage of absolute time, you might save the timestamp in non-volatile memory, such as EEPROM, Flash, or battery-backed RAM. This is common for events that need to be timestamped and logged over long periods, such as diagnostic information. No matter which strategy is used, the software needs to be designed to handle the specific conditions under which the rollover occurs, including accounting for concurrent access and ensuring that the system's timekeeping remains accurate and reliable throughout its operational life."},{"prompt":"how is utc time saved?","completion":"UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. Saving UTC time in an automotive embedded system or any other computing device involves representing this timestamp in a format that the hardware and software can utilize effectively. Here’s how UTC time is typically saved: 1. **Representation**: UTC time can be saved in various formats, with \\"Unix time\\" being a widely used method. Unix time represents time as the number of seconds that have passed since the \\"Unix epoch\\" – 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 (not counting leap seconds). Other common formats include the ISO 8601 representation for human-readable strings or custom formats that suit the application's requirements. 2. **Data Types**: In programming, UTC time is commonly saved using integer or floating-point numbers for Unix time, or structures/objects when detailed time components are necessary (such as year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and possibly millisecond). 3. **Real-Time Clock (RTC)**: Many embedded systems include a Real-Time Clock module, which keeps track of the current date and time. RTCs often have a separate power source (like a coin-cell battery) so they can continue to keep time even when the main system power is off. The RTC will typically maintain the time in UTC and could have interfaces to set and get time in various formats. 4. **Saving in Memory**: - **Volatile Memory**: When the system is operating, UTC time is kept in volatile memory like RAM and is continuously updated, either by an internal timer interrupt or by synchronization with an external time source (such as GPS or NTP servers). - **Non-Volatile Memory**: To maintain UTC time across system reboots or power cycles, the current UTC time is periodically written to non-volatile memory, such as EEPROM or Flash. Some RTCs also come with embedded non-volatile memory for this purpose. 5. **Synchronization**: If the device needs to maintain accurate UTC time, it requires periodic synchronization with a reliable time source like a GPS signal, network time protocol (NTP), cellular network, or via manual input. This ensures that any drift in the RTC or internal timer is corrected. 6. **Time Zone and Daylight Saving Time (DST) Handling**: While UTC time remains constant, local time representation might need adjustments for time zones or daylight saving time. These adjustments are typically handled by the system software and are stored as configuration settings. 7. **Format Conversion**: When it comes to presenting or saving UTC time, systems usually convert it as needed for human-readable display, logging, or communication with other systems. Conversion functions are often used to change UTC time into various time formats (or vice versa), depending on the end-use. 8. **Software Libraries**: Many embedded software environments provide libraries to assist with these tasks, including time manipulation, formatting, and synchronization functions. When saving UTC time, it is critical to consider factors such as leap years, leap seconds, and synchronization intervals to maintain accuracy. Additionally, the approach will vary depending on the precision required, available hardware resources, and the specific needs of the application."},{"prompt":"Icewarp/13.0.3.10 RHEL7 X64 Version can you please share the severity of this VAPT Test with regards to \\"server version(RHEL7) should not be displayed","completion":"Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) often includes tests for information disclosure vulnerabilities. When a server reveals its version number or software stack details, it may help attackers gain insight into the potential vulnerabilities that specific versions may have. The version you've mentioned, Icewarp/13.0.3.10 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL7) x64, if configured to display the server version information, could be considered a low to medium severity finding in a VAPT report. While this information alone does not constitute a direct security flaw, it can be considered a piece of information leakage that may aid an attacker. The severity levels could be defined as follows: - **Low Severity**: Displaying the server version might only slightly increase the risk to the application because the information alone does not result in a compromise. However, it's a basis for targeted attacks, as an attacker can research known vulnerabilities for this specific version. - **Medium Severity**: If there are known and easily exploitable vulnerabilities associated with the disclosed versions and no mitigating controls are in place, the risk might be elevated to medium severity, acknowledging that an attacker could develop or use an existing exploit. In most best security practice guides and hardening standards, it is recommended to suppress or mask version information of the server software to reduce the server's attack surface. This can be usually accomplished through configuration changes. To address this finding, administrators usually opt to modify the server or application configuration to hide or obscure version numbers. In the case of IceWarp, you would need to check the software’s documentation to find the specific setting that controls the display of such information and adjust it accordingly. In the case of RHEL7, you can modify the web server settings (like Apache or Nginx) to prevent showing version numbers in headers or error pages. Two common directives, for Apache as an example, that are used are \`ServerTokens Prod\` and \`ServerSignature Off\`, which limit the information the server gives out. Remember, while it's advisable to hide version numbers, it's even more crucial to keep software up-to-date with security patches, employ proper monitoring, and have multiple layers of security to make your systems resilient to attacks."},{"prompt":"http host header injection fix in IIS Server 302 found or 404 not found shows when host change in burp suite","completion":"HTTP Host header injection is a vulnerability that occurs when a web server or application checks the Host header and fails to properly validate or sanitize it before using it to generate redirects or populate links in the response sent to the client. Attackers could exploit this by injecting malicious content or redirecting users to phishing or malicious websites. To mitigate HTTP Host header injection vulnerabilities in IIS (Internet Information Services) server, follow these steps: 1. **Input Validation**: Ensure that the application code that handles redirects and link generations validates the Host header against a whitelist of allowed domains. If the Host header doesn't match the expected values, the request should be rejected or redirected to a safe destination. 2. **URL Rewrite Module**: Use the IIS URL Rewrite module to create rules that specify how URLs should be redirected. You can set a rule that checks the HOST header and ensures that it matches your domain name. Here is a basic example of what such a rule might look like in your \`web.config\`: \`\`\`xml <rewrite> <rules> <rule name=\\"Validate Host Header\\" stopProcessing=\\"true\\"> <match url=\\".*\\" /> <conditions> <add input=\\"{HTTP_HOST}\\" pattern=\\"^yourdomain.com\\" /> </conditions> <action type=\\"None\\" /> </rule> <!-- Your other rules here --> </rules> </rewrite> \`\`\` This rule will only process requests with a \`Host\` header exactly matching \`yourdomain.com\`. Any other \`Host\` value won't match, and you could handle that with an additional rule that specifies an action such as \`AbortRequest\`. 3. **Application Firewall**: Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) that can provide specific Host header validation and prevent header injection attacks. WAFs often come with built-in rulesets to mitigate these and other types of attacks. 4. **Custom Error Pages**: Configure custom error pages in IIS to handle when the \`Host\` header does not match the expected value. This will prevent attackers from obtaining any useful information from default error pages which could assist them in a Host header injection attack. 5. **Security Headers**: Ensure other security headers are appropriately set, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), which can prevent attacks resulting from successful host header injections. 6. **Patching and Upgrades**: Ensure that your IIS server and any related applications are up-to-date with the latest patches and security updates. By configuring your IIS server to validate the \`Host\` header and only allow requests that match your expected domain, you can protect against host header injection attacks. Regularly reviewing your server and application configurations for security issues is also important to help prevent these and other vulnerabilities."},{"prompt":"add key=\\"SessionRedirectionUrl\\" value=\\"domain name\\"","completion":"The line you have provided seems like a configuration setting for a web application, typically found in the \`web.config\` file in a .NET environment or within a similar configuration context. \`\`\`xml <add key=\\"SessionRedirectionUrl\\" value=\\"http://www.yourdomain.com\\" /> \`\`\` To clarify, the syntax \`<add key=\\"...\\" value=\\"...\\" />\` is used in XML-based configuration files to specify key-value pairs for application settings. In the context of a .NET web application, it is common to use these configurations to control different aspects of how the application behaves. When you specify a \`SessionRedirectionUrl\`, you are effectively defining where the user should be redirected under certain conditions, for instance after they log in or when their session expires. It is crucial to set the \`value\` attribute to the correct URL where you want users to be redirected to. Here is a high-level concept of how to use this setting properly: 1. Open your \`web.config\` file located in the root of your web application. 2. Locate the \`<appSettings>\` section. If it does not exist, you should create it within the \`<configuration>\` node. 3. Add or update the key-value pair for \`SessionRedirectionUrl\` with the correct domain: \`\`\`xml <configuration> <appSettings> <add key=\\"SessionRedirectionUrl\\" value=\\"http://www.yourdomain.com\\" /> <!-- Other settings --> </appSettings> <!-- Other configuration settings --> </configuration> \`\`\` Please note that \`http://www.yourdomain.com\` should be replaced with the actual URL that you wish users to be redirected to for your application's logic. Keep in mind that disclosing the full domain name and application path in the \`value\` can be a security concern if it provides information about your infrastructure that could be exploited. Ensure that any URL you are redirecting to is secured (using HTTPS is a good practice) and that the redirection logic in your application does not allow for open redirection vulnerabilities, which can occur when redirection URLs are not properly validated. If you are updating the \`web.config\` on a live production server, be aware that changes to this file can cause the application to restart. This can lead to a temporary disruption of service and can log users out, so plan accordingly to make such changes during maintenance windows."},{"prompt":"icewarp port 9143 and port 9993 open vulnerability","completion":"Ports 9143 and 9993 being open on an IceWarp server could be seen as potential vulnerabilities depending on their use and how the server is configured. Port 9143 Port 9143 is not a well-known or commonly used port; it is possible that it's utilized for a specific service or custom application. If IceWarp is using this port for administrative access, webmail, or any other service, it is critical to ensure the following: 1. The service running on port 9143 should be secure and updated to the latest version to prevent any known vulnerabilities. 2. Access should be restricted using firewall rules, only allowing legitimate sources to connect. 3. Ensure that any services running on this port are using encryption (such as TLS) to protect data in transit. Port 9993 Port 9993 is typically associated with ZeroTier, a network virtualization tool. If you are not running ZeroTier, or this port is not intentionally being used by any service, it should not be open as it could pose a security risk. In case it's legitimately used by IceWarp or related services, here are some security measures: 1. Validate that port 9993 is indeed required for your IceWarp setup. 2. If using ZeroTier, ensure it is configured securely, with only necessary nodes being part of the network. 3. Access to this port should be limited to trusted IPs or networks via proper firewall configuration. 4. Use strong encryption and authentication methods for any service running on this port. For both ports, general good security practices include: - Implement firewalls: Only allow connections from trusted IP addresses and networks. - Enforce strong authentication: Require strong usernames and passwords, and consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) if possible. - Use secure protocols: Ensure SSL/TLS or other encryption methods are in use to protect data in transit. - Monitor access: Regularly check logs for unauthorized access attempts or other suspicious activity. - Keep software updated: Ensure that IceWarp and other software running on these ports are kept up to date with security patches. Remember that each open port should have a justified business need and should be protected with the appropriate security measures. If the service is not needed, it's best practice to close the port by stopping the service and updating the server firewall to block the port."},{"prompt":"server version(RHEL7) are vulnerabale","completion":"The server version (RHEL7) in your question refers to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL7). Whether this version is vulnerable depends on a few factors, including the specific update level, the system's configuration, the services running on it, and whether the latest security patches and errata have been applied. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, like any operating system, has had its share of vulnerabilities over time. However, Red Hat actively maintains RHEL7 with regular updates and security fixes. If your system is not regularly updated with these security patches, it may be susceptible to known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. To reduce the risk of vulnerabilities: 1. **Regular Updates**: Regularly update the system with the latest patches provided by Red Hat. This includes kernel updates, security patches, and updates for all packages installed on the system. You can use the \`yum\` package manager to update your system. 2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Perform regular vulnerability scans using tools like OpenVAS, Nessus, or any other reputable vulnerability scanner to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. 3. **Minimal Services**: Limit the services running on the server to only those that are necessary for its role. This reduces the potential attack surface. 4. **Configuration Hardening**: Implement security best practices and hardening guidelines provided by Red Hat and the wider community, such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks. 5. **SELinux**: Ensure that Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is enabled and properly configured. SELinux adds an additional layer of security by enforcing access control policies. 6. **Firewall Configuration**: Use the built-in firewalls like \`firewalld\` or \`iptables\` to restrict access to network services, and define rules to only allow necessary traffic. 7. **System Monitoring**: Use tools to monitor the system for suspicious activity. This could include intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions. 8. **Access Control**: Make sure only authorized users have access to the server. Implement strong authentication mechanisms, and use secure protocols like SSH for remote administration. 9. **Backups**: Regularly back up the system and ensure that you have a tested recovery process in case of a security breach or failure. It's important to note that RHEL7 has different minor versions, for instance, RHEL 7.1, 7.2, etc., with each subsequent release including more security enhancements and fixes. For maximum security, you should be on the latest minor release and have all the current security updates applied. In addition, Red Hat offers the Red Hat Customer Portal, where registered users can access a list of advisories and updates tailored to their specific version of RHEL. You should regularly review this information to ensure your systems are protected against known vulnerabilities."},{"prompt":"server version(RHEL7) are vulnerabale please share the severity of this VAPT Test","completion":"If a Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) report indicates that a server running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL7) is vulnerable, the severity level would depend on a combination of factors, including which vulnerabilities are present, their potential impact, and the context of your environment. A vulnerability's severity is often rated using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which provides a standardized method of capturing the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and producing a numerical score reflecting its severity. To understand the severity associated with running RHEL7, consider the following steps: 1. **Update Level**: Check if the RHEL7 server is running the latest available minor version (e.g., 7.9) and has the latest security updates installed. An older, unpatched version could contain high-severity vulnerabilities. 2. **Identified Vulnerabilities**: Review the specific CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) listed in the VAPT report. Each CVE will typically have an associated CVSS score that estimates the risk and impact of the vulnerability. 3. **Service Configuration**: Consider whether vulnerable services exposed to untrusted networks amplify the severity due to increased likelihood of exploitation. 4. **Mitigating Controls**: Evaluate whether mitigating controls (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, SELinux policies) lower the impact or likelihood of exploitation. 5. **Exploitability**: Determine if known exploits exist for the identified vulnerabilities, as this increases the severity. 6. **Environmental Score**: Consider the environmental score—some vulnerabilities may have a higher impact depending on the server's role within your infrastructure. Here are some typical severity levels and what they typically represent in VAPT reports: - **Critical Severity**: This level is assigned when a vulnerability can be easily exploited to gain control over the system or access sensitive data with minimal interaction from the user. These typically have a CVSS score of 9.0 to 10.0. - **High Severity**: Vulnerabilities that are less likely to be exploited than critical ones or have a high impact but require more effort or specific conditions to exploit. These generally have a CVSS score ranging from 7.0 to 8.9. - **Medium Severity**: Issues that are less impactful or require substantial effort to exploit fall into this category. Their CVSS score usually falls between 4.0 to 6.9. - **Low Severity**: These vulnerabilities are minor issues that have low impact and are difficult or less likely to be exploited, with CVSS scores in the range of 0.1 to 3.9. However, even vulnerabilities with a low CVSS score can be chained with other vulnerabilities to create a more severe security risk. It's important to address all discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner, prioritizing them based on severity, impact, and exploitability. In conclusion, while RHEL7 by itself is not a vulnerability, running an outdated or improperly configured version of it without the latest patches can lead to vulnerabilities. Assess the specific vulnerabilities mentioned in your VAPT report to determine their severity."},{"prompt":"RHEL7 are vulnerable version","completion":"When discussing whether Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL7) is a \\"vulnerable version,\\" it is imperative to understand that the vulnerability status of an operating system is not static. An operating system's susceptibility to vulnerabilities largely depends on its patching status and configuration. RHEL7, as an enterprise-grade Linux distribution, receives regular updates and security patches from Red Hat throughout its lifecycle. It is supported with backported security fixes, ensuring that the version remains secure even though it might not have the newest features present in later major versions. Vulnerability comes into play when these updates and patches are not applied. Red Hat uses a backporting strategy for applying security patches. This approach ensures that security fixes are integrated into the packages of your installed version of RHEL without incrementing the version numbers of those packages. Through this method, RHEL7 systems can remain secure without the need for administrators to perform full version upgrades that might lead to compatibility issues. If RHEL7 is identified as \\"vulnerable\\" in a VAPT report, this typically means: 1. **Out-of-Date System**: There are security patches available for RHEL7 that have not been applied to the system under investigation. 2. **Misconfiguration**: The system might be configured in a way that introduces vulnerabilities, for example, having unnecessary services enabled or using default credentials. 3. **End of Support**: After a certain period, a specific minor release might reach the end of its maintenance support. In this case, new security patches will not be provided for that version. 4. **Known Vulnerabilities**: The system might be affected by known vulnerabilities that are specific to the RHEL7 version you are running, and patches or mitigations might not have been applied. For each finding in a VAPT report, a severity rating (usually based on CVSS) should be provided. The rating depends on the impact of the vulnerability, the complexity of its exploitation, whether there are known exploits, and other environmental factors. To keep a RHEL7 system secure, it is vital to: - Apply security updates as they become available. - Remove or disable unnecessary services and applications. - Follow security best practices and hardening guides. - Monitor and audit the system to detect and respond to potential security incidents. Even if RHEL7 is in its later phases of the product lifecycle, with proper management and security practices, it can continue to be a stable and secure platform for enterprise systems. The key is to stay vigilant with updates and security practices. Always refer to Red Hat's official advisories and repositories for the latest information on security patches and updates for RHEL7."},{"prompt":"Как подружить кошек, если они враждуют","completion":"Введение новой кошки в дом, где уже есть другая кошка, может вызывать конфликты и агрессию между ними.

Общая зона обитания: - Подготовьте общую комнату с двумя наборами кормушек, поилок, лотков и мест для отдыха. - Проведите короткие совместные сессии, контролируя реакцию животных. - Поощряйте дружелюбное поведение с помощью лакомств и ласки. 3. Игровая терапия: - Используйте игры, чтобы кошки могли сосредоточиться на игрушках, а не друг на друге. - Поощряйте параллельную игру, чтобы они чувствовали себя комфортно в присутствии друг друга, не соревнуясь напрямую. 4. Синхронизация рутинных процедур: - Кормите кошек одновременно, но с соблюдением дистанции. - Старайтесь уделять кошкам равное внимание, чтобы избежать ревности. 5. Использование феромонов: - Феромоны (как искусственные, так и естественные) могут помочь уменьшить напряжение. Рассмотрите возможность использования диффузоров или спреев с синтетическими аналогами феромонов кошек. 6. Наблюдение и регулирование: - Внимательно следите за их взаимодействием и при первых признаках агрессии мягко их разделяйте. - При необходимости обратитесь к поведенческому специалисту или ветеринару за консультацией. 7. Терпение и время: - Кошки могут нуждаться в значительном количестве времени, чтобы привыкнуть друг к другу. Будьте терпеливы и давайте им взаимодействовать на их собственных условиях. Если кошки продолжают враждовать несмотря на ваши усилия, рекомендуется обратиться за помощью к ветеринару или специалисту по поведению животных. Серьезные случаи агрессии могут потребовать более специфических методов вмешательства или даже медикаментозного лечения."},{"prompt":"Одна кошка не стала есть в присутствии другой, когда другая легко съела","completion":"Такое поведение может быть результатом стресса или напряжения между кошками, а также может быть признаком того, что одна кошка чувствует себя доминирующей, а другая подчиняющейся. Важно убедиться, что каждая кошка чувствует себя комфортно и в безопасности, особенно во время еды. Вот несколько шагов, которые вы можете предпринять: 1. **Отдельные места для кормления**: Установите отдельные кормушки в разных частях дома, чтобы кошки могли есть без взаимного присутствия и конкуренции. Возможно, у одной кошки возникнет больше уверенности в том, что она может спокойно поесть, если другая кошка находится подальше. 2. **Расписание кормления**: Попробуйте кормить кошек в определенные часы, а не оставлять еду доступной весь день. Это может помочь установить регулярность и предсказуемость, которая может снизить стресс. 3. **Безопасность и пространство**: Убедитесь, что у обеих кошек есть возможность уединиться и отдохнуть без беспокойства со стороны других животных. Предоставьте укрытия, полки и другие безопасные места, где кошки могут избавиться от стресса. 4. **Поддержка хороших отношений**: Используйте положительное подкрепление (в виде лакомств и похвалы) для поощрения мирного сосуществования. Если кошки проявляют дружелюбие друг к другу, наградите их, чтобы они связывали присутствие своего сородича с чем-то приятным. 5. **Внимание и взаимодействие**: Уделяйте время для взаимодействия с каждой кошкой отдельно, чтобы они не чувствовали конкуренцию за ваше внимание. 6. **Консультация со специалистом**: Если проблемы сохраняются, рассматривайте возможность привлечения специалиста по поведению животных, который может провести оценку ситуации и предложить конкретные стратегии поведения. 7. **Ветеринарная консультация**: Если проблема с пропуском кормления продолжается, необходимо убедиться, что нет медицинских причин, которые могут это вызвать. Обязательно проконсультируйтесь с ветеринаром для исключения заболеваний или оценки состояния здоровья кошек. Если вы примените эти методы и терпеливо дадите кошкам время на адаптацию, шансы на улучшение их взаимоотношений значительно возрастут."},{"prompt":"Придумай 5 шуток про язык программирования JavaScript","completion":"1.

PAN, CHOPSTICK.. INFORMATION …… FRIED - EGG FEEDBACK LOOP","completion":"Operations management is a key function within an organization that involves managing the processes that convert inputs into finished goods and services. It combines a series of planned actions, processes, and methodologies to produce the desired output effectively and efficiently. The diagram you've described is a simplified representation of the basic model of operations. Here's an elaboration on each part: 1. Inputs: These are the resources used to produce goods or services. Inputs may include raw materials (like the egg, salt, onion in your example), labor (the cook), capital (money for expenses such as utilities, rent, and ingredients), equipment (like the pan and chopstick), and information (recipes, customer orders, etc.). 2. Transformation Process: This is where inputs are converted into outputs. The transformation processes involve a series of actions or operations which typically include a mix of activities such as manufacturing, quality control, and subprocesses. In the case of the fried egg example, the cook would perform specific steps such as heating the pan, cracking the egg, cooking the ingredients to the desired level, and plating the food. 3. Outputs: The result of the transformation process is the outputs – goods or services that are delivered to customers. In this case, a freshly cooked fried egg is the output ready to be served to the diner. 4. Feedback Loop: Upon delivering the output, the operations process does not end. A feedback loop is an important element where information regarding the success or failure of the output is gathered. This feedback comes from various sources such as customers, internal quality checks, or the personnel involved in the operation. In a restaurant scenario, customer feedback might indicate whether the fried egg met their expectations in terms of taste, appearance, and temperature. This feedback is then used to make adjustments and improvements to the operations process to ensure that future outputs meet or exceed expectations. Operations management requires oversight and continuous improvement, striving to be more efficient, reduce waste, improve quality, and respond to customer needs. Techniques such as Lean management, Six Sigma, Total Quality Management (TQM), and Just-in-Time (JIT) production are often implemented to enhance the overall effectiveness of the operations."},{"prompt":"OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT QUESTION: specify the transformation process of the following organizations: fast food, university, restaurants OPERATIONS INPUT (RESOURCES) TRANSFORMATION OUTPUT Fast foods • Meat, bread • Staffs Cooking Burgers Universities • Students • Exam • Buildings Teaching Graduates Restaurant • Hungry customers • Food • Chef/staffs Cooking Service Well-prepared food Satisfied customers Cosy environment","completion":"Your question outlines the inputs, transformation processes, and outputs for fast food establishments, universities, and restaurants.

Below is a comparison of these characteristics for goods versus services: # Tangibility: **Goods:** - Tangible: Can be seen, touched, and physically measured. **Services:** - Intangible: Cannot be seen or touched; they are experienced or consumed. # Perishability: **Goods:** - Perishable or Non-perishable: Some goods like food can spoil, while others like clothing do not spoil over time. **Services:** - Non-perishable: Services cannot \\"spoil,\\" but their relevance or value may decrease over time if not consumed. # Customization: **Goods:** - Standardized or Customized: Goods can be mass-produced with standard features, or they can be tailored to individual specifications. **Services:** - Heterogeneous: Services are often tailored to individual needs and can vary significantly each time they are delivered. # Ownership: **Goods:** - Can be owned and transferred: Once purchased, the buyer owns the good. **Services:** - Cannot be owned: Services are consumed at the point of delivery and cannot be owned. # Time between Production and Consumption: **Goods:** - Considerable: Goods can be produced, stored, and then consumed or used at a later date. **Services:** - Simultaneous: Services are typically produced and consumed at the same time. # Determination of Value: **Goods:** - Can be independently ascertained: The value of goods is often determined by the cost of production, perceived quality, and market demand. **Services:** - Is highly subjective: The value of services can be more difficult to determine and is highly influenced by the customer's personal experience and the context of the service delivery. In reality, many businesses offer a mixture of goods and services. For instance, a restaurant offers the tangible good of food (which is perishable) alongside the intangible service of food preparation and presentation (which is perishable in a sense that the value is best when the food is fresh and hot). Both goods and services provide value to the customers, but they require different approaches in marketing, delivery, and quality control to meet consumer expectations."},{"prompt":"MANUFACTURING vs SERVICE ORGANIZATION Degree of customer contact(low to high) & Degree oftangibility of product offering (intangible product, tangible product) Manufacturing organization Service organization -physical product -product can be inventoried -low customer contact -ccapital intensive -long respond time -intangible product -product can not be inventoried - high customer contact -short response time -labor intensive","completion":"Manufacturing and service organizations operate differently due to the nature of their offerings. Here's a comparative analysis based on the criteria you provided: # Degree of Customer Contact (Low to High) **Manufacturing Organization:** - Typically characterized by low customer contact: Most manufacturing processes happen without direct interaction with the customer. The contact is often limited to points of purchase or through intermediaries like retailers. **Service Organization:** - Often requires high customer contact: Services are frequently consumed in the presence of the service provider, and customer interaction can directly influence the service outcome. Examples include healthcare, consulting, and hospitality services. # Degree of Tangibility of Product Offering (Intangible Product to Tangible Product) **Manufacturing Organization:** - Produces a tangible product: Outputs are physical items that can be seen, touched, and counted. Examples are cars, appliances, and furniture. - Products can be inventoried: Manufactured goods can be stored in warehouses and sold over time. - Capital intensive: Manufacturing often requires significant investment in machinery, equipment, plants, and technology. - Longer response time: The time to design, manufacture, and deliver products can be lengthy, especially when compared to the instantaneous delivery of many services. **Service Organization:** - Provides an intangible product: Services cannot be touched or seen before they are delivered and are experienced as they occur. Examples are education, legal advice, and entertainment. - Services cannot be inventoried: They must be consumed as they are produced; you cannot store a haircut for later use. - Labor intensive: Services typically depend more on people and their skills, rather than on machinery. - Shorter response time: Services are often delivered immediately upon request, with little or no lead time. An example is calling a taxi service. Each type of organization may also blend attributes of the other to various degrees. For instance, a manufacturing company may offer post-sale services, which are intangible and require higher customer contact, or a service firm may provide physical products as part of its service package. Moreover, advances in technology challenge these distinctions, as manufacturers increase customer contact through customization (e.g., build-to-order systems) and services automate to reduce labor intensity and customer contact (e.g., online banking). Operations management in both types of organizations must tailor strategies and processes to their specific product offerings, customer interaction levels, and the blend of tangible/intangible aspects inherent in their products or services."},{"prompt":"Merged cells on a Google Sheet cannot be unmerged.

In embedded applications, UTC time can be maintained and used in a few different ways, depending on the accuracy and precision needed, the available hardware, and the specific requirements of the application. Here's how UTC time is generally calculated and saved in embedded systems: 1. **Real-Time Clock (RTC) Modules**: Many embedded systems include a hardware Real-Time Clock, which keeps track of the current time even when the main processor is powered down. These RTC modules typically have a battery backup and can provide time with accuracy to seconds. Once set, they continue to maintain time by counting seconds, minutes, and hours. To set the RTC to UTC time, you might enter the current UTC time manually, or the RTC can be set automatically by receiving the time from an external source, such as a GPS module or network time server (via NTP - Network Time Protocol). 2. **GPS Time Synchronization**: Systems that require very precise timing, such as those used in navigation or telecommunications, might include a GPS receiver, which can provide highly accurate time information based on satellite signals. The time provided by GPS is essentially UTC, although it might not account for leap seconds (this is dependent on the GPS receiver design). 3. **Network Time Synchronization**: For systems connected to a network, time can be synchronized using NTP or SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol). These protocols allow the embedded device to request the current time from a server, which is usually synchronized to a very accurate clock source like an atomic clock. 4. **Manual Setting**: In simpler devices, time might be entered manually through an interface and then stored in non-volatile memory. This method is less accurate as it relies on the user to enter the correct time and cannot correct itself for drift over time. 5. **Software Counters / Timers**: For systems without an RTC, time can be approximated by using the microcontroller's internal timers and counters. The software can calculate the passage of time by counting clock cycles or using a system tick interrupt, but this is less accurate and can be subject to drift due to temperature changes, voltage variations, and oscillator tolerance. 6. **Non-Volatile Memory**: The current time, once calculated or received via any of the methods mentioned above, is typically stored in a non-volatile memory so that it is retained even when the system loses power. This could be in the form of EEPROM, flash memory, or battery-backed RAM. 7. **Time Representation**: The time in embedded systems is usually stored either as a UNIX timestamp (the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch, accounting for leap seconds), or in a more human-readable format like a structure containing year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. 8. **Handling Time Zones and Daylight Saving Time**: Embedded systems that display local time might need a way to convert UTC to the appropriate local time based on time zone and daylight saving time (DST) rules. This can complicate the time keeping somewhat since DST rules can change and vary by location. It is important for the design of the embedded application to ensure that the method chosen for calculating and saving time is suitable for its intended use, especially if the timing is critical to system functionality. An accurate and reliable time source is essential for functions like timestamping events, synchronizing operations, or managing schedules."},{"prompt":"regarde si ce texte contient des répétitions et comment il pourrait etre amélioré: Présentation du sujet et de son importance dans la société moderne.

En septembre 2020, l'ancien directeur de l'entreprise, Alexander Nix, a été condamné à une interdiction de sept ans de diriger une entreprise en raison de son \\"comportement dépourvu d'éthique\\". En décembre 2022, Meta (anciennement Facebook, renommé en Meta pour détourner l'attention des controverses) a accepté de verser 725 millions de dollars pour mettre fin au procès engagé en 2018, sans pour autant reconnaître une infraction. Ces informations fallacieuses sont élaborées dans le dessein de mener une propagande visant à influencer le comportement des électeurs pendant les périodes électorales. Cependant, il demeure difficile de déterminer si elles ont réellement modifié l'opinion publique, et prouver un tel changement est une tâche complexe. Les recherches sur la propagande électorale ont souvent conclu que son impact est limité, touchant principalement des électeurs déjà politisés et fermement convaincus, ce qui renforce leurs positions existantes. b)La diffusion à grande échelle de fake news dans certains cas vise principalement à générer des revenus publicitaires. Un exemple concret est Facebook, qui a généré plus de 40 milliards de dollars en 2017 grâce à la vente d'espaces publicitaires sur les fils d'actualités de ses utilisateurs. La principale puissance de Facebook sur le marché de la publicité en ligne réside dans sa capacité à permettre aux annonceurs de cibler précisément un public en fonction de divers critères, tels que l'âge, le sexe, la localisation géographique, les préférences culturelles, ou les comportements d'achat, en se basant sur les données collectées par la plateforme. Dans ce contexte, Facebook peut devenir un vecteur pour les producteurs de fausses informations qui souhaitent toucher un large public. Ils créent des sites de fausses nouvelles, sur lesquels ils intègrent de la publicité, puis ils partagent des liens vers ces articles sur Facebook. De cette manière, ils parviennent parfois à attirer massivement des utilisateurs vers leurs sites, générant ainsi des revenus publicitaires. Les fake news suscitent de l'engagement, se traduisant par des clics, des partages et des commentaires. Aujourd’hui Facebook, Twitter et d’autres plateformes sont fréquemment utilisés pour partager les actualités. Les réseaux sociaux jouent un rôle important dans la consommation d’informations, notamment chez les jeunes. Le ‘’Digital News Report 2023’’ qui étudie le marché de l’information en ligne dans 46 pays couvrant la moitié de la population mondiale. D’après le Digital News Report 2023, les réseaux sociaux sont la principale source d’information des personnes entre 18-24 ans, Facebook est encore le réseau social le plus utilisé mais son influence sur le journalisme est en déclin. De plus, Facebook doit faire face à d’autres plateformes comme Youtube ou TikTok. D’après le Digital News Report en ce qui concerne l'actualité, le public manifeste un intérêt plus marqué envers les célébrités, les influenceurs et les personnalités des médias sociaux présents sur des plateformes comme TikTok, Instagram et Snapchat, par opposition aux journalistes. Cela représente un contraste significatif par rapport à Facebook et Twitter, où les médias et les journalistes continuent à occuper une place centrale dans les discussions. Hanouna assume le fait que le but de son émission, n’est pas d’informer le public, mais de le divertir. “Nous ce qu’on veut c’est de la confrontation en plateau. Aujourd’hui, c’est ça la télévision”. Les sujets graves ne sont pas traités de la bonne façon. En général, des personnes avec des points de vue extrémistes sont invitées pour donner leur opinion. On donne alors de la visibilité à des individus qui relèvent de la marginalité et on laisse donc place à la culture du Clash, qui se caractérise par une atmosphère de confrontation, de débat intense, voire d'affrontements verbaux entre individus ou groupes ayant des opinions divergentes. Mais aussi à l’Infotainment, qui est une contraction des termes \\"information\\" et \\"entertainment\\" (divertissement en français), et qui se réfère à un style de présentation de l'information qui cherche à combiner des éléments de divertissement avec la diffusion d'actualités ou d'informations. L'objectif est de rendre l'information plus attrayante et accessible au grand public en utilisant des techniques empruntées au monde du divertissement. Mais cette information n’est parfois pas vraie et induit en erreur les téléspectateurs. Ca implique plusieurs théories conspirationnistes, ex: Gérard Fauré (“ex-dealer de tout-Paris) avec l'adrénochrome et les élites pédo-satanistes qui torturent des enfants. TPMP a une audience de plusieurs millions de téléspectateurs qui vient en général de milieux moins favorisés, qui sont alors exposés à des faits qui se ne sont pas exacts. Tout ça est néfaste et sacrifie le raisonnement cognitif des audiences au profit de l’émission. 2) L'importance de la vérification des faits. (Bilel) a -Les sites de fact-checking et leur rôle. . b-L'éducation à l'esprit critique fais une présentation sur l'importance de la vérifications des faits a- Le fact checking est une technique consistant d'une part à vérifier la véracité des faits et l'exactitude des chiffres présentés dans les médias par des personnes publiques, notamment des personnalités politiques et des experts, et, d'autre part, à évaluer le niveau d'objectivité des médias eux-mêmes dans leur traitement de l'information. Cette notion est apparue aux États-Unis dans les années 1990 sous l'appellation de fact-checking. (def wikipédia). Les sites de fact-checking sont devenus des acteurs essentiels dans la lutte contre la désinformation. Ils s'efforcent de vérifier les revendications, les déclarations et les faits présentés dans les médias et sur les plateformes en ligne. Leur travail consiste à mener des investigations approfondies, à consulter des sources fiables et à analyser les preuves tangibles pour évaluer la véracité des informations circulant dans l'espace public. Ces sites jouent un rôle crucial en identifiant et en exposant les informations erronées, ce qui contribue à prévenir la propagation de la désinformation et à promouvoir la confiance du public dans les sources d'information.Prenons l'exemple du site de fact-checking \\"Politifact\\" qui a examiné les revendications faites par des politiciens lors des campagnes électorales. Grâce à des enquêtes minutieuses et à des vérifications de faits approfondies, Politifact a pu démystifier les déclarations erronées et fournir au public des évaluations claires sur la véracité des affirmations.Par exemple, le site \\"Snopes.com\\" est reconnu pour son travail de vérification des rumeurs et des canulars sur Internet, démystifiant ainsi les informations erronées et éclairant le public sur les véritables faits. De même, \\"Africa Check\\" se concentre sur la vérification des faits en Afrique, offrant un service crucial pour contrer la propagation de fausses nouvelles souvent utilisées à des fins politiques ou sensationnalistes. Ces plateformes éduquent le public en mettant en lumière les sources fiables et en offrant des analyses factuelles, permettant ainsi de dissiper les doutes et les mythes qui pourraient autrement influencer négativement la perception des événements et des enjeux mondiaux. https://www.emi.coop/qu-est-ce-que-le-fact-checking/ https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/twitter/tout-comprendre-que-sont-les-community-notes-ces-messages-de-plus-en-plus-presents-sur-twitter_AV-202308070313.html#:~:text=Les%20Community%20Notes%20permettent%20%C3%A0,contribuer%20%C3%A0%20une%20meilleure%20information%22. b- L'éducation à l'esprit critique est un processus vital qui commence dès le plus jeune âge. Par exemple, l'intégration de cours sur la vérification des sources et l'analyse critique des informations dans les programmes scolaires permet aux élèves de développer des compétences essentielles pour évaluer la fiabilité des informations. En outre, des ateliers interactifs et des initiatives éducatives axées sur l'apprentissage pratique renforcent la capacité des individus à reconnaître les signes de désinformation et à identifier les biais potentiels présents dans les discours médiatiques. Un exemple de cette approche est le programme \\"News Literacy Project\\" aux États-Unis, qui vise à enseigner aux élèves comment évaluer la qualité des informations en ligne et à développer leur esprit critique face aux informations médiatiques. L'éducation à l'esprit critique vise à doter les individus des compétences nécessaires pour évaluer de manière autonome l'information à laquelle ils sont exposés. Cette forme d'éducation encourage la remise en question des informations présentées, la recherche de sources fiables et la compréhension des biais potentiels. En encourageant l'analyse critique des arguments et des revendications, l'éducation à l'esprit critique aide les individus à développer une pensée autonome et informée. Elle favorise également la compréhension des concepts tels que la partialité médiatique, les techniques de manipulation de l'information et les stratégies de persuasion, ce qui renforce la résistance individuelle face à la désinformation et aux fausses nouvelles. Dans le contexte de l'éducation à l'esprit critique, un exemple concret serait l'intégration de programmes d'éducation aux médias et à l'information dans les écoles. Ces programmes permettent aux élèves d'apprendre à évaluer de manière critique les sources d'information, à distinguer les faits des opinions, et à reconnaître les biais médiatiques. De plus, l'enseignement des compétences en matière d'analyse de données et de statistiques permet aux individus de comprendre comment les chiffres peuvent être manipulés pour présenter des informations trompeuses. Par exemple, l'apprentissage de l'interprétation des sondages d'opinion peut aider les étudiants à prendre du recul par rapport aux titres sensationnalistes et aux informations trompeuses basées sur des données non représentatives. 3) Conséquences de la désinformation (Victor) Acteurs de la désinformation: Médias, dont journaux, émissions de télévision (TPMP-Hanouna, Ardisson ~2000, Dechavanne ~1990), chaînes d’information (BFM TV, CNEWS-Pascal Praud-L’heure des pros) Une étude réalisée en 2019 en Italie a montré que les programmes télévisés de divertissement ont dégradé les capacités cognitives des téléspectateurs et favorisé le vote populiste, ainsi que le désengagement civique et social. L’American Economic Association a étudié l'impact politique de la télévision commerciale en Italie, en exploitant l'introduction échelonnée de la chaîne de télévision privée de Berlusconi, Mediaset, au début des années 1980. Ils ont constaté que les personnes ayant eu un accès précoce aux contenus de divertissement de Mediaset étaient plus susceptibles de voter pour le parti de Berlusconi en 1994, lorsqu'il s'est présenté pour la première fois aux élections. Cet effet persiste depuis cinq élections et est alimenté par les gros téléspectateurs, à savoir les très jeunes et les personnes âgées. Concernant les mécanismes possibles, nous constatons que les individus exposés à la télévision de divertissement dans leur enfance étaient moins sophistiqués sur le plan cognitif et moins civiques à l'âge adulte, et finalement plus vulnérables à la rhétorique populiste de Berlusconi. Atteinte à la réputation et diffamation: -Diffamation contre des personnalités publiques: Des célébrités et personnalités publiques ont été souvent ciblées par des fausses informations en ligne ou dans les journaux, allant de fausses rumeurs sur leur vie personnelle à des accusations graves sans fondement. ex: Meghan Markle et le prince Harry : Ils ont été confrontés à de nombreuses rumeurs et informations inexactes concernant leur relation avec la famille royale britannique, leur vie personnelle et leurs choix de vie. Angelina Jolie et Brad Pitt : Le couple de célébrités a été l'objet de nombreuses rumeurs et fausses informations concernant leur divorce, la garde de leurs enfants et leur vie personnelle. Certains médias ont publié des informations non vérifiées sur leur relation. (National Enquirer, TMZ, The Sun) Complotisme et scepticisme: -Pizzagate (2016): Une théorie du complot affirmant qu'un restaurant de pizza à Washington, D.C. était le centre d'un réseau pédophile impliquant des personnalités politiques, dont Hillary Clinton et Barack Obama. Alors que le Pizzagate se propageait, le Comet Ping Pong a reçu des centaines de menaces de la part des partisans de la théorie. Le propriétaire du restaurant, James Alefantis, dont plusieurs membres du personnel de la pizzeria, ainsi que d'autres pizzerias aux alentours ont reçu une masse de harcèlement et des menaces de mort en conséquence. De plus, le 4 décembre 2016, Edgar Maddison Welch, un homme de 28 ans, est arrivé sur Comet Ping Pong et a tiré trois coups de feu avec un fusil d’assaut qui ont touché les murs du restaurant, un bureau et une porte. Welch a déclaré plus tard à la police qu'il avait prévu « d'auto-enquêter » sur la théorie du complot. Il se considérait comme le héros potentiel de l'histoire, un sauveur d'enfants. Il s'est rendu après que les policiers ont encerclé le restaurant et a été arrêté sans incident ; personne n'a été blessé. -Affaire du complot QAnon: Cette théorie du complot affirme qu'un groupe secret de pédophiles satanistes démocrates opère à l'intérieur du gouvernement américain pour renverser le président Trump. Lors de l’attaque du capitole à Washington en 2021, une partie des acteurs majeurs présents étaient des partisans de QAnon, dont le fameux “Chaman QAnon”, et des symboles liés à QAnon étaient visibles parmi la foule. Certains rapports indiquent que des individus liés à ce mouvement ont participé activement aux assauts contre le Capitole. L'attaque du Capitole a conduit à des violences graves, dont 5 morts et plusieurs dizaines de blessés, et a suscité des préoccupations quant à la sécurité et à la polarisation politique aux États-Unis. On voit donc que la simple participation et les croyances à ce genre de mouvements a des conséquences graves sur le reste de la population. Cet événement peut être considéré comme l’épilogue « de centaines de faits alternatifs répétés et retweetés des milliers et des millions de fois [qui] ont fini par fabriquer une réalité alternative ». Une vérité alternative qui s’est forgée et imposée durant quatre années à coups de fake news, relayées par les supporters de Donald Trump (et le président lui-même) via internet et les réseaux sociaux. On peut alors parler de vérité illusoire. (répétition d’une information fausse jusqu’à ce qu’elle devienne la nouvelle vérité) -La résistance au port du masque: Des chercheurs de l’Université d’East Anglia, au Royaume-Uni, avaient montré que les fausses informations sur la COVID-19 tendaient à circuler plus rapidement que les vraies et à « aggraver l’épidémie ». Ça inquiétait au plus haut point l’ONU et l’OMS, qui ont insisté sur l’importance de mettre en place des pratiques visant à prévenir la diffusion d’informations fausses ou trompeuses. De plus, la résistance au port du masque pendant la pandémie a été un phénomène répandu un peu partout. Certains individus ont contesté la nécessité de porter un masque en évoquant que la pandémie n’existait pas ou des théories du complot sur la nature du virus, impliquant que ce dernier n’était pas dangereux. Tout ça permettait au virus de se propager encore plus et conduisait à des incidents et des conflits dans les magasins et les lieux publics. ex: le 31 juillet 2020 lors d’un vol entre Amsterdam-Schiphol et l’aéroport d’Ibiza ou le 18 juillet 2020 dans un restaurant Tim Hortons à Montréal. Divisions socioculturelles et émeutes: Il a par exemple l’emploi du terme “Grand Remplacement” par Eric Zemmour, qui est d’abord originaire de Renaud Camus, lors de ses interventions dans l’émission de Pascal Praud sur CNEWS, ou encore sur Europe 1, qui est ensuite propagé au grand public. Cette théorie, qui relève également du complotisme, est donc soutenue en grande partie par l'extrême droite radicale qui a développé la thématique de la destruction de l'Europe par une colonisation et un remplacement par les immigrés africains. Il y a alors une forme de xénophobie en masse qui se développe en grande partie sur les réseaux sociaux, mais également dans la vraie vie, créant encore plus de divisions entre deux communautés à l’intérieur de la France même. En somme, la désinformation, propagée par les médias et les réseaux sociaux, engendre des conséquences graves : dégradation de la qualité de l'information, atteintes à la réputation, violences liées aux théories du complot, résistance au port du masque, et divisions socioculturelles. Pour contrer ces effets néfastes, une vigilance collective et des actions concertées sont impératives afin de promouvoir une information fiable, prévenir la polarisation sociale, et protéger les fondements de la démocratie.","completion":"Cette présentation est bien structurée en trois sections principales : développement des fake news, importance de la vérification des faits et conséquences de la désinformation. Cependant, elle pourrait être améliorée de plusieurs manières. Voici quelques suggestions : 1. **Répétitions et cohérence** : - Évitez de répéter des informations similaires dans différentes sections. Par exemple, l'explication de l'utilisation des fake news à des fins politiques et l'histoire de Cambridge Analytica réapparaissent plusieurs fois. - Utilisez un vocabulaire cohérent en vous assurant que des termes comme \\"fake news\\" et \\"fausses nouvelles\\" sont utilisés de manière interchangeable dans tout le texte. 2. **Clarté et pertinence** : - Rendez les titres des sous-sections plus explicites. Par exemple, \\"Développement/progrès des fake news/désinformation\\" pourrait être reformulé en \\"Évolution et impact des fake news sur la politique\\". - Supprimez les liens et références qui ne sont pas indispensable dans le corps du texte et créez une section \\"Références\\" séparée à la fin de votre présentation. - Les exemples et cas d'études doivent être clairement liés aux points principaux pour que leur pertinence soit immédiatement évidente. 3. **Concision et précision** : - Éliminez les redondances ou les détails superflus qui pourraient compliquer la compréhension des points clés. - Rendez les phrases plus concises pour renforcer l'impact du message. Par exemple, simplifiez la présentation des conséquences de la désinformation en mettant en évidence les principales. 4. **Transition et fluidité** : - Assurez-vous que chaque section s’enchaine logiquement avec la suivante. Utilisez des phrases de transition pour aider à orienter le lecteur à travers les différentes parties de la présentation. - Dans les listes, comme dans la section \\"Acteurs de la désinformation\\", organisez les points pour un meilleur flux narratif. 5. **Équilibrage du contenu** : - Tous les points principaux doivent être abordés avec un niveau de détails équivalent pour maintenir un équilibre dans la présentation. 6. **Correction des fautes** : - Corrigez les fautes de frappe ou d'orthographe. Par exemple, le mot \\"l’importance\\" nécessite un trait d'union : \\"l’importance\\". 7. **Style et ton** : - Assurez-vous que le ton du texte est approprié pour une présentation académique et qu'il reste formel et objectif. 8. **Contenu actualisé** : - Supprimez les références datées qui pourraient ne plus être pertinentes au moment de la présentation, surtout en présence de données plus récentes."},{"prompt":"quelle est cette version de chat gpt","completion":"Je suis un modèle linguistique d'intelligence artificielle développé par OpenAI, basé sur la technologie GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3).

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman deflects the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's, even if it meant that she would release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit -even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit that the returning woman forced her to release feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the present woman, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"# SCREENPLAY/SHOOTING SCRIPT INT.

ANJALI tries to move past NEHA, but she tightens her grip, inadvertently pressing ANJALI's abdomen. ANJALI (in agonizing relief) Aah... Maa! ANGLE ON ANJALI's face, a mix of shock and untimely bliss. The pressure too much, she closes her eyes, her body stiffens, and soft moans escape her lips. NEHA (confused) Kya ho gaya terko, tu theek hai na? ANJALI, still in the throes of relief, musters a labored whisper with a pained satisfaction. ANJALI (strained voice) Haan... Maa... bas... NEHA, puzzled, is suddenly overpowered by the smell emanating from ANJALI. ANGLE ON NEHA's face as it contorts in confusion and disgust—her nostrils flaring, her hand covering her nose. NEHA (utterly shocked) Ye smell... kya kiya tune? ANJALI, eyes still closed, lets out the last of her breath in relief. Her body relaxes. ANJALI (sheepishly) Kuch nahi Maa... andar jaane do, please. NEHA, reluctantly steps aside, repulsed, visibly trying to maintain composure. ANGLE ON ANJALI, gentle steps now, cautiously cupping the back of her pants. NEHA (scolding, astonished) Anjali! Ye kya kiya tune? Puri pant gandi kar di! ANJALI (sheepish indignation) Maa, tumne rasta rok diya tha. Aur pet dabaya toh... NEHA, incredulous, continues her scolding. NEHA (scolding) Rasta rokne se koi apne pant mein... Anjali, tu bada ho gayi hai. ANGLE ON ANJALI's eyes rolling, frustrated but playful. ANJALI (playfully sulky) Mera control nahi raha Maa. Tumne dabaya aur... NEHA continues to scold with a taunting tone. NEHA (continuing, teasingly) Par rukna zaroori tha kya? Poora...enjoy kar rahi thi kya? ANJALI (continuing to sulk) Potty jaana tha, urgent tha. Majboori thi, kya karun... ANJALI, with a wince, pats her own rear gingerly, the bulge undeniable, and she makes a face. ANJALI (CONT’D) (dryly) Acha laga release karke, par shayad main clean up kar lu, feel thoda... NEHA intervenes, halting ANJALI in her waddle to the bathroom, turns her around with motherly gentleness, a mixture of concern and disbelief on her face. NEHA (incredulous, taunting) Dekhne do, kya haal banaya hai apne... ANGLE ON ANJALI's uncomfortable face, the detail of her distress evident, as she bickers coyly. ANJALI Embarrassed) Maa, please... mujhe saaf karna hai. NEHA, mockingly sniffing near ANJALI, makes a grand show of wrinkling her nose. NEHA (agreeing, mockingly) Haan, jaldi ja tu. Kitni badboo aa rahi hai! ANJALI, with a reluctant nod, acknowledges the truth in NEHA's words. ANJALI (self-deprecatingly) Sahi toh keh rahi ho. Behad gandi smell hai. NEHA, cringing, fans her nose and shoos ANJALI toward the bathroom. NEHA (ushering) Jaa, ab jaldi jaake saaf kar! ANJALI waddles off, the discomfort plain in her uneven steps.

Therefore, the kind of incident where you intend to bypass me to kiss another man should not recur in the future.\\" Gu Xinxin rolled her eyes dismissively and turned to gaze out of the car window at the cityscape, uttering a sarcastic snort, \\"Uncle, you yourself have not led by example and yet you make demands of me? Have you not been seen in public with other women?\\" Huo Xiangyin’s eyes narrowed slightly as he observed her, “Is this jealousy I detect?” Gu Xinxin felt the accusation to be absurd and tugged at the corner of her mouth, “Jealousy? You and I are hardly a genuine couple. What infuriates me is that Uncle would kiss me without forewarning, nearly suffocating me in the process!” Huo Xiangyin quirked an eyebrow, “My dear, if I recall correctly, you didn't provide prior notice yourself when you kissed me with such fervor last time.” Gu Xinxin, at a loss for words with her brows knitted together retorted, \\"Ahem! How can that be the same? My approach was merely a light brush, hardly an extension of...\\" Huo Xiangyin’s lips curved slightly, \\"An extension of what?\\" His teasing tone made Gu Xinxin flush with embarrassment and she swallowed her vexation, \\"Nothing!\\" Frankly, she would have preferred to kiss the enchanting stranger she met at the bar—with whom there was a fleeting and emotionless exchange—never to intersect with him again. Unlike Huo Xiangyin—possessing such significant influence in the capital, today's spectacle would certainly become notorious, attracting untold trouble. All she desired was a discreet existence over the next three months, minimizing the number of people aware of her connection with Huo Xiangyin, thus severing ties cleanly with his family once the three months concluded. She was exasperated when her phone rang again. Seeing the caller ID, it was her father, Gu Baichuan. If Gu Baichuan was calling at this hour, it was likely due to Gu Xue'er stirring up trouble again. After answering the phone, her father's voice was as agitated as she anticipated—his bellowing audible even without speakerphone. \\"Gu Xinxin, what disgrace have you wrought upon us! Return home immediately for a full explanation!\\" Gu Xinxin massaged her temples, \\"Dad, I am quite weary today, I shall visit tomorrow.\\" Gu Baichuan retorted furiously: \\"Unacceptable! Whatever have you done to be so fatigued? Come home this instant!\\" Gu Xinxin, uninterested in further discussion, hung up the call and turned off her phone. Huo Xiangyin, as if the earlier commotion was trivial, glanced at his phone where financial reports were displayed, and casually inquired, \\"Do you require my accompaniment on your return?\\" Gu Xinxin shook her head indifferently, \\"It is but a trifling domestic issue, no need to trouble you, Uncle.\\" ... After being dropped off at the Huo residence, Gu Xinxin entered her room, her mood far from buoyant, and logged into her game. Ding Ding! A private message from a game friend popped up... Jiangyang Avenue: [（Admiring Face）Master, you've finally logged on!] This game friend, known as \\"Jiangyang Avenue,\\" was the very individual who, after being deceived by Song Qiao Wei and equipping her, managed to hack the system of A Company. Since the incident where she had bargained with this individual after infiltrating the encrypted systems of AJ Alliance, he had been persistent in his quest to become her disciple. Although she did not consent, he had taken to calling her master on his own accord. Gu Xinxin replied with light keystrokes, 'Do you need me for something?' Jiangyang Avenue: [（Dispirited Face）No! I'm just in a bad mood today and wanted to share my thoughts with Master!] Gu Xinxin: 'What's wrong?' Jiangyang Avenue: [（Enraged Face）Today, on SNOW, I came across my sister's love rival! I tripped the damn woman hoping she would fall flat on her face in public—to vindicate my sister! Little did I expect that the cursed woman would deliberately fall onto the very man my sister adores, seizing the chance to steal a kiss! It infuriates me to no end!] Gu Xinxin, staring at the computer screen, lapsed into contemplation—the world was indeed small; it turned out this fellow was the one who tripped her. She recalled that beside Huo Xiangyin, apart from Li Ze and that curly-haired woman, there was also a handsome youth with thick brows and large eyes, probably seventeen or eighteen, undoubtedly \\"Jiangyang Avenue.\\" Gu Xinxin: 'Consider, is there a possibility that the angle of your trip was flawed? She might have been as reluctant as you surmise.' Jiangyang Avenue: [Hmph! I perceive she is nothing but a conniving schemer, a shameless harlot seeking to throw herself at men!] Gu Xinxin sighed and left the conversation, opting to lose herself in the game instead. After a string of victories, Gu Xinxin checked the unread message... Jiangyang Avenue: [（Pitiful Face）Master, are you in the capital? May I invite you to dine together?] Gu Xinxin: 'Never mind that, I suspect you wouldn't be pleased to see me.' Jiangyang Avenue: [（Questioning Face）Why? Master, you are my idol! How could I not be pleased to meet you!] Gu Xinxin thought to chuckle, amused by the thought: Because I am the very 'deceased woman' you just badmouthed. Then, someone knocked on her door. She closed the gaming interface promptly and rose to open it. It was Grandma Huo, \\"Xinxin, Grandma has prepared a sweet soup for you. Do give it a taste.\\" Behind her was a maid carrying a bowl of fragrant, steaming soup. Lately, Grandma Huo had been incessantly brewing various concoctions for her to drink, to the point she almost felt overwhelmed by the nutrition. Fortunately, the soups were always delicious, and she was not opposed to them. \\"Thank you, Grandma!\\" Gu Xinxin opened the door wider, allowing the matriarch entry. Witnessing her granddaughter-in-law savor the sweet soup she had made warmed Grandma Huo's heart, \\"Xinxin, did you return alone? Where is that young man from the Zuo family?\\" Gu Xinxin truthfully replied, \\"Grandma, Mr. Huo has already arranged for Assistant Zheng to escort Zuo Yan home.\\" Grandma Huo frowned slightly, \\"So, you encountered Xiangyin outside?\\" Gu Xinxin nodded as she continued to sip the sweet soup. The old lady, mildly displeased, inquired, \\"Then why didn’t he return with you?\\" Gu Xinxin explained, \\"Grandma, Mr. Huo did escort me to the doorstep. However, due to his workload and numerous tasks to address, it's likely he will return later.\\" Grandma Huo huffed, displaying a hint of vexation, \\"Foolish boy, with such a beautiful and delicate wife at home, and yet he scarcely returns! Always immersed in work—can work bear children?\\" Gu Xinxin managed a wry smile. Truthfully, Grandma Huo was rather endearing once you got to know her; far from the stern and imposing figure she once appeared to be, though, she was somewhat impatient for great-grandchildren. … The following afternoon, Gu Xinxin made her way back to the Gu household. The moment Gu Baichuan saw her, his rage propelled him to shatter the water glass in his hand, bellowing, \\"You shameless creature, kneel!\\""},{"prompt":"cách dùng (‘#summernote’).summernote(‘reset’);","completion":"Trong mã jQuery, \`('#summernote').summernote('reset');\` được sử dụng để đặt lại trình soạn thảo Summernote về trạng thái ban đầu của nó.

Ele contém informações importantes sobre o titular, como nome, número de série, prazo de validade e a chave pública, associadas a uma entidade emissora (Autoridade Certificadora - AC). O objetivo do certificado digital é permitir a autenticação segura do titular em ambientes digitais e a assinatura de documentos com validade jurídica. A validação de um certificado digital é suportada por uma Infraestrutura de Chaves Públicas (PKI - Public Key Infrastructure). PKI é um conjunto de políticas, hardware, software e procedimentos necessários para criar, gerir, distribuir, armazenar e revogar certificados digitais com base na criptografia de chave pública. As Autoridades Certificadoras (ACs) são o centro desta infraestrutura, e elas são responsáveis por emitir e gerenciar certificados. Quando um certificado é apresentado, é possível verificar sua autenticidade e veracidade ao checar a assinatura digital da AC que o emitiu e confirmar se o certificado não está revogado ou expirado. 2. **Middleware** Middleware é uma camada de software que fornece serviços comuns e facilita a comunicação e o gerenciamento de dados entre aplicações distribuídas. Ele atua como intermediário entre os aplicativos e o sistema operacional, rede ou outros softwares de baixo nível, fornecendo uma forma padronizada para a comunicação. Elementos que o middleware pode oferecer ao programador de aplicações distribuídas: - **Abstração de Comunicação**: O middleware oculta a complexidade do modelo de comunicação subjacente (sockets), permitindo que os desenvolvedores se concentrem na lógica da aplicação. - **Gerenciamento de Sessões**: Oferece gerenciamento automático de sessões, mantendo estado quando necessário para aplicações distribuídas. - **Segurança**: Pode fornecer mecanismos padronizados e robustos para autenticação, autorização e criptografia. - **Transações Distribuídas**: Suporte a transações que garantem propriedades ACID (Atomicidade, Consistência, Isolamento, Durabilidade) em diferentes recursos de rede. - **Balanceamento de Carga e Tolerância a Falhas**: Possibilita distribuir a carga de trabalho de modo eficiente e fornecer continuidade de serviço em caso de falha em um dos componentes. - **Serviços de Mensagens**: Fornece uma infraestrutura para troca de mensagens de forma assíncrona e confiável entre componentes distribuídos. 3. **Sistema Aberto** Um sistema aberto é um sistema que possui interoperabilidade, modularidade, e é construído de acordo com padrões abertos, garantindo que pode ser facilmente comunicável e operável com outros sistemas. Sistemas abertos são projetados para serem flexíveis, escaláveis e adaptáveis às mudanças tecnológicas. Propriedades que fazem da Web um bom exemplo de sistema aberto: - **Padrões Abertos**: A Web é construída em torno de padrões abertos, como HTTP, HTML, CSS e muitos outros, mantidos por organizações de normalização como o W3C. Isso garante a compreensibilidade entre várias plataformas e navegadores. - **Interoperabilidade**: Devido ao uso de padrões abertos, aplicações na Web podem interoperar facilmente com outros sistemas e serviços. - **Acesso Universal**: A Web foi projetada para ser acessível a partir de qualquer dispositivo, em qualquer lugar do mundo, com qualquer tipo de software que siga seus padrões. - **Escalabilidade**: O design da Web permite que ela cresça em tamanho e complexidade sem prejudicar os serviços existentes. - **Independência de Plataforma**: A Web opera em diferentes sistemas operacionais e dispositivos, desde computadores e smartphones até IoT (Internet das Coisas).

Here’s the general process: 1. **Client**: - The client uses a stub (a local proxy for the remote object) to invoke a method on a remote object. This stub exists within the client's local JVM. - The stub is responsible for initiating communication with the remote JVM, which involves marshalling (serializing) the method parameters and sending them across the network to the server hosting the remote object. 2. **Server**: - On the server side, the remote object receives the invocation from the skeleton (an entity on the server side that receives method calls from the client stub). The skeleton is responsible for unmarshalling (deserializing) the method parameters. - The actual method is then invoked on the remote object just as it would be on a local object. - After the method has been executed, the remote object processes the method and calculates the result. 3. **Result Transmission**: - The resulting value or object, along with any exceptions that might have been thrown during the execution, is marshalled by the skeleton on the server. - This result is sent back across the network to the client stub. 4. **Client Stub**: - On the client side, the stub receives the marshalled result or exception, unmarshals it, and either returns the value to the caller or throws the exception that occurred during the remote method execution. It's important to note that, as of Java 2, the skeleton is no longer a separate entity in the RMI architecture. The server-side functionality, including marshalling and unmarshalling, is now typically performed by the RMI runtime and the stub classes themselves, which are generated by the RMI compiler (\`rmic\` tool). However, the conceptual flow remains the same. Therefore, to directly answer the question: the server calculates the result of the method invocation, and the RMI system—both on the server and the client—handles the transmission of the result back to the client that invoked the remote method."},{"prompt":"Please make for this code C++ header .h file with class and method prototypes: #include <iostream> #include <fstream> #include <stdexcept> #include <limits> #include <string> using namespace std; // Паттерн Singleton для логгера class Logger { private: ofstream logFile; static Logger* instance; // Приватный конструктор для Singleton Logger() { logFile.open(\\"log.txt\\", ios::out | ios::app); if (!logFile.is_open()) { throw runtime_error(\\"Не удалось открыть файл лога.\\"); } } public: // Получение экземпляра логгера static Logger* getInstance() { if (!instance) { instance = new Logger; } return instance; } // Запись сообщения в лог и вывод в консоль void log(const string& message) { logFile << message << endl; cout << message << endl; } // Деструктор для закрытия файла ~Logger() { if (logFile.is_open()) { logFile.close(); } } // Удаляем возможность копирования и присваивания Logger(const Logger&) = delete; Logger& operator=(const Logger&) = delete; }; // Инициализация статической переменной instance Logger* Logger::instance = nullptr; // Интерфейс стратегии class PaymentStrategy { public: virtual void pay(int amount) = 0; }; // Конкретные стратегии class CreditCardPayment : public PaymentStrategy { public: void pay(int amount) override { string message = \\"Оплачено \\" + to_string(amount) + \\" с использованием кредитной карты.\\"; Logger::getInstance()->log(message); cout << message << endl; } }; class SberPayPayment : public PaymentStrategy { public: void pay(int amount) override { string message = \\"Оплачено \\" + to_string(amount) + \\" с использованием СберПэй.\\"; Logger::getInstance()->log(message); cout << message << endl; } }; class BankTransferPayment : public PaymentStrategy { public: void pay(int amount) override { string message = \\"Оплачено \\" + to_string(amount) + \\" с использованием банковского перевода.\\"; Logger::getInstance()->log(message); cout << message << endl; } }; // Контекст, использующий стратегию class ShoppingCart { private: PaymentStrategy* paymentStrategy; public: ShoppingCart(PaymentStrategy* strategy) : paymentStrategy(strategy) {} void checkout(int amount) { paymentStrategy->pay(amount); } }; // Функция для выбора задачи (1 - оплата, 2 - автомобиль) int chooseTask() { int task; cout << \\"Выберите задачу:\\" << endl; cout << \\"1.

This suggests that you have included class definitions both in your \`main_4.cpp\` and in the header files I provided (like \`Logger.h\`, \`PaymentSystem.h\`), resulting in duplicate definitions. To resolve these errors, you need to separate the class definitions from your \`main_4.cpp\` file and consolidate them in header files. Once defined in a header file, you should not redefine them in any other file. Here's what you need to do: 1. Remove the class definitions from your \`main_4.cpp\` (or the main \`.cpp\` file you're working with). Leave only the \`#include\` directives for the header files and the function implementations (like \`main()\`, \`chooseTask()\`, \`choosePaymentMethod()\`, etc.). 2. Make sure that you have include guards in all your header files (we've done that in the previous examples with \`#ifndef\`, \`#define\`, and \`#endif\`). 3. Include the header files in your \`main_4.cpp\` where the class definitions are required. If your class implementations are in separate \`.cpp\` files, include the corresponding header files there as well. Here is an example of how you should include the header files in your \`main_4.cpp\`: \`\`\`cpp #include \\"Logger.h\\" // Include Logger class header file #include \\"PaymentSystem.h\\" // Include other classes header file // Implementations and functions like main(), chooseTask(), choosePaymentMethod(), etc. // ... int main() { // Your main function implementation // ... } \`\`\` Make sure that the implementations of member functions are either inlined in the header files (which is not recommended for all but the simplest functions) or in separate \`.cpp\` files. For example, the implementation of the \`Logger::getInstance()\` method would be in the \`Logger.cpp\` file: **Logger.cpp:** \`\`\`cpp #include \\"Logger.h\\" // Initialization of static instance pointer to nullptr Logger* Logger::instance = nullptr; // Method implementations for Logger class Logger::Logger() { // Constructor implementation } Logger* Logger::getInstance() { // getInstance implementation } void Logger::log(const std::string& message) { // log implementation } Logger::~Logger() { // Destructor implementation } \`\`\` And similar for other classes, have a \`.cpp\` file for each one's implementation if they're not already defined.

Indeed, what is demanded here is tmimus — a purity of purpose. Such simplicity affords one the latitude to think divergently, not in opposition to Torah, but like the tzaddikim of yore, exemplified by Kalev, who harmonized singular thought with divine will. **Version 2: Conversational Yeshivish Approach** In our circles, this is where we're at. That's precisely the reason I laid down this introduction – to put to rest the worries some have regarding my approach. They're under this impression that what I'm saying is some kind of pushback against the Torah, but really, nothing could be further from the truth. It's puzzled me till now, why they'd even think that way. Then it hit me. It's because I don't shy away from talking straight about the Yetzer Horeh. I've got this bitachon that it's all going to align with Torah, down the line. But some folks are jittery – they think if you get into this topic, you might start folks down a slippery slope, leading them astray. But really, this is how we have to navigate. And then it reached my ears – there's this chatter that we're trying to shake things up, create some kind of newfangled Judaism. Could you imagine? That's not at all what we're about. You need tmimus for this work, that wholeheartedness. It's tmimus that lets you approach things with fresh eyes, without veering off from what the Torah's laying out for us. It lets you ponder things from angles the Reshoim might, like Kalev's unique perspective. **Version 3: Inspirational Discourse** Amongst us, here is the place we stand. This introduction I bring before you aims to dispel the anxieties some hold over my intentions. For they misconstrue my words as a call to turn away from Torah, and nothing is further from the truth than such a claim. Puzzlement gripped me as I pondered their reasoning; then, clarity ensued. My openness in discussing the challenges of the Yetzer Horeh is rooted in a profound belief that it shall ultimately accord with the teachings of Torah. Yet, there lingers a fear in the hearts of some; a fear that by voicing such matters, we may inadvertently sanction thoughts aligned with the Yetzer Horeh, causing others to wander from the path. Despite this, engaging in such matters is imperative for our spiritual endeavor. It has come to my attention that there are those who falsely believe we seek to establish a brand of Judaism that diverges from tradition. This belief must be addressed directly and with conviction: we hold no such intention. What is required of us is tmimus - a sincerity that empowers us to explore thoughts not in contravention to Torah, but as the Righteous, like the example set by Kalev, who embraced an unconventional path firmly rooted in Torah. **Combined Version** In the midst of our communal discourse, we have arrived at a pivotal station. Henceforth, I proffer this introduction to quell the disquiet harbored towards my teachings, which are misinterpreted by some to herald a rebellion against Torah – a grave misconception. It eluded me for a time before I realized my candid discussions of the Yetzer Hara, though grounded in a staunch belief of ultimate alignment with Torah principles, may incite fears that such verbiage could lead the unwary astray. This nonetheless is the crux of our spiritual labor. I have become cognizant of the misguided belief that we intend to pioneer a deviation from our mesorah, to create a 'new Judaism,' as it were. Let me state emphatically, this is not our path. The requisite quality for such intellectual engagement is tmimus – a purity of heart that enables one to view the Torah with fresh insight, without straying from its divine directives, channeling even the perspectives of our adversaries, like the admirable forebearer Kalev, into a Torah-congruent worldview."},{"prompt":"Étape 1 - Créature mythologique / personnage fictif ou réel sur lequel il est basé Étape 2 - Informations de base (nom, groupe d’âge, apparence physique) Étape 3 - contexte (ville fictive) Étape 4 - enfance (événement traumatique et raisons de la colère) Étape 4 - personnalité (ce qui fait de lui/elle une personne Étape 5 - personnalité (qualités humaines) Étape 6 - les défauts (ce qui fait de lui un antagoniste) Étape 7 - son entourage a- Un acolyte b- Un ennemi juré = une némésis c- Un partenaire important Étape 8 - Moment critique sur lequel vous voulez écrire (histoire d’origine, la première fois qu’il/elle a rencontré son ennemi juré, la dernière bataille contre la némésis…) Étape 9 - Au prochain cours, écrivez à ce sujet (120-150 mots) en utilisant le vocabulaire et les temps du passé Fait moi un texte de 30 ligne en respectant c'est étape je souhaite que mon personnage soit un enseignant","completion":"Étape 1 - Notre créature mythologique s'inspire de la Chimère, un monstre de la mythologie grecque composé de parties de différents animaux et symbole d'hybridation. Étape 2 - Nous l'appellerons Professeur Damian Lycan, un homme d'une quarantaine d'années. Il a l'apparence d'un humain banal avec des lunettes rondes et des épaules voûtées, mais lorsqu'il se transforme, il révèle des attributs de différentes créatures mythologiques. Étape 3 - Damian réside dans la ville fictive de Mythica, un lieu pittoresque en apparence mais bercé de secrets anciens et de magie occulte. Étape 4 - Orphelin très jeune à cause d'une catastrophe mystique, Damian a vécu une enfance solitaire, élevé par un oncle distant et froid. Cette solitude et la quête de réponse sur les véritables causes de la passion de ses parents sont les sources de sa colère refoulée. Étape 5 - Damian est particulièrement érudit et intelligent, un passionné de connaissances anciennes. D'un naturel calme, il sait cependant faire preuve d'humour noir. Étape 6 - Son ambition démesurée pour la connaissance et le pouvoir est son principal défaut. Il est prêt à tout pour découvrir de vieux secrets, ce qui le rend parfois cruel et impitoyable. Étape 7 - Son entourage: a- Acolyte: Lydia, une apprentie sorcière qui admire son savoir et partage son désir de connaissances cachées. b- Némésis: Archibald Knight, un chasseur de monstres déterminé à protéger Mythica des créatures comme Damian. c- Partenaire important: Elena, une bibliothécaire qui est la seule à connaître le secret de Damian et l'aime malgré sa double nature. Étape 8 - Le moment critique de cette histoire sera le récit des origines de Damian - la première fois où sa nature chimérique s'est révélée à lui-même et comment il a choisi de l'utiliser pour son ascension en tant qu'érudit de l'occulte. Étape 9 - Voici le texte de 30 lignes décrivant le moment critique, Damian Lycan révélant sa nature et la quête du savoir qui en découle: Dans la ville enveloppée de brumes de Mythica, le Professeur Damian Lycan se tenait seul dans le silence de sa bibliothèque. Autour de lui, des piles de grimoires et des artefacts anciens témoignaient de son obsession pour le surnaturel. Ce soir-là, alors qu'une lune blafarde éclairait ses recherches, une incantation malencontreuse révéla sa véritable nature. Damian sentit son corps se tordre et fusionner avec les pouvoirs obscurs qu'il convoitait tant. Il découvrit en lui la fibre d'une Chimère et sut qu'il n'était pas un simple mortel mais le descendant d'une lignée maudite. Paniqué mais fasciné, il comprit rapidement que cette transformation n'était pas une malédiction, mais une porte vers les mystères qu'il cherchait à élucider. Ses yeux, maintenant capables de voir à travers les voiles des dimensions, révélèrent les secrets cachés de Mythica. Son acolyte Lydia le regardait, émerveillée et terrifiée, pendant qu'Elena, sa confidente, acceptait avec douleur sa condition. Archibald Knight, alerté par des forces obscures perturbées, s'était juré de traquer cette abomination. Damian, entre-temps, oscillait entre humanité et monstruosité, se posant comme gardien de connaissances oubliées et puissances anciennes. Préférant la quête du savoir à sa propre humanité, le Professeur Lycan embrassa sa nature de Chimère, déterminé à déchiffrer les arcanes de l'univers, même au prix de son âme. Il devenait lentement mais sûrement l'antagoniste de sa propre histoire, piégé dans la toile du pouvoir et de la connaissance. Mais au fond de lui, il restait un enseignant, un guide égaré dans un monde où la magie est la plus dangereuse des leçons."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"i'm very hungry","completion":"It sounds like you're ready to eat something! Here are a few suggestions that could help you manage your hunger: 1. **Quick Snack:** If you need something fast, consider healthy options like fruit, nuts, yogurt, or a granola bar. 2. **Prepare a Meal:** If you have a bit of time, you might prepare a simple meal such as a sandwich, a salad, or a quick stir-fry. Using fresh vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can make your meal both satisfying and nutritious. 3. **Order Delivery/Takeout:** If you’re unable to cook, you might want to order food from a local restaurant or delivery service. Try to choose a balanced meal with some protein, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates. 4. **Dine Out:** If you feel like going out, you could head to a nearby café or restaurant. It’s a good opportunity to have a nice meal and perhaps enjoy the ambiance of the place. 5. **Drink Water:** Sometimes when we think we're hungry, our bodies are actually just dehydrated. Drinking a glass of water before eating can be a good way to ensure you're hydrating and might reduce the amount of food you need to feel satisfied. Remember to listen to your body and its hunger cues. Eating mindfully and not rushing through your meals can enhance your eating experience and help with digestion.

Когда люди говорят о том, что кто-то красив, они обычно имеют в виду соответствие определенным эстетическим стандартам и личным предпочтениям. В контексте имени Айнура, возможно, вы говорите о конкретном человеке, который вам кажется красивым. Причины чувства привлекательности могут включать, но не ограничиваются следующим: 1. Генетика: Физические черты, такие как черты лица, форма тела, цвет кожи и волосы, являются результатом генетического наследования. 2. Уход за собой: Забота о здоровье кожи, волос, а также внимание к фитнесу и питанию могут улучшить физическую привлекательность. 3. Стиль и мода: Способность хорошо одеваться и подбирать стиль, который подчеркивает личные особенности, может повышать красивость. 4. Выражение и харизма: Часто красота воспринимается не только через внешние признаки, но и через выражение личности человека, его уверенность, интеллект и чувство юмора. 5. Культурные факторы: В разных культурах существуют различные каноны красоты, которые могут влиять на восприятие человека. Тем не менее, любые утверждения о красоте человека опираются на персональное мнение, и что считается красивым для одного, может не быть таковым для другого."},{"prompt":"Почему Саша такой милый","completion":"Вопрос о милости человека по имени Саша также субъективен и зависит от личного восприятия.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently stopped by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY A cozy and well-lived-in home. Family photos adorn the walls, and there's a sense of warmth and life in the cluttered space. A portrait hangs prominently: A smiling JUNG AH (mid-50s, warm-hearted and casually attired with a penchant for floral print blouses) with her daughter. EXT. DETACHED HOUSE - DAY A quaint two-story house with a red door stands proudly amidst a row of similar homes in Seoul's suburban district. A RUSTLING of keys and a SHUFFLE of hurried steps approach the entrance. CUT TO: Our protagonist, MIN-JI (early 20s, a college student with a trendy but comfortable style, high waist cargo pants, and a loose-fitting top), races toward the door, her face contorted with desperation. Her hand searches frantically in her bag. CUT TO: MIN-JI'S POV as she pats down her pockets, clumsily tosses items out of her bag, and comes up empty. Her forehead glistens with perspiration. MIN-JI (a strained whisper) Ah, no... eodiya? Eodiya?? Furiously, she begins knocking on the door, her urgency palpable as she dances awkwardly in place. INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Sudden KNOCKS reverberate through the room. JUNG AH, the present woman, startled from her nap on the living room couch, wipes the sleep from her eyes. Her hair slightly tousled, she blinks in confusion toward the commotion at the door. INT. ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The front door shakes under the barrage of desperate knocks. MIN-JI is nearly hopping now, her eyes squeezed shut in concentration. JUNG AH (O.S.) (sleepily) Y-Yaaah? Nuguya? What's all this? Jung Ah's voice is husky with sleep, filled with concern and confusion. She fumbles with the door handle, a slow click, then another. MIN-JI (muffled through the door, panic rising) Umma! Hurry, please, please! The LATCH unlatches, but the turning is achingly slow. INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS JUNG AH (muttering to herself) Arasso, arasso, I'm coming... why all the fuss? She wipes her face again as she slowly shuffles, the edges of sleep still clinging to her. EXT. DETACHED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS JUNG AH, now visible, squints through the crack of the partially opened door. JUNG AH (eyes still half-closed) Min-ji, this better be... Before she can finish, MIN-JI pushes against the ajar door, her face is a mask of panic. MIN-JI (frantic) Move, Umma! JEBAL! In her groggy state, JUNG AH reacts with concern and grips her daughter's shoulders, barring her entry. JUNG AH (concerned) What's wrong? Wae? MIN-JI wriggles, attempting to free herself. Her face reddens, and she pleads with knees slightly bent. MIN-JI (pleading) Umma, not now! Please, just... need to get past -- The physical restraint causes an inadvertent PRESSURE on MIN-JI's abdomen. The expression of sheer horror and unspeakable release crosses MIN-JI's face as she groans loudly. The SOUNDS are muffled, filled with the grunts of a woman losing a battle. Her leg muscles tense visibly, and her posture shifts awkwardly, her bottom protruding. JUNG AH (perplexed) Ya! What's happening to you? MIN-JI stands frozen, a tableau of hilarity and mortification. Between the strained grunts and sighs, you can hear the faint rustling of the cargo pants as they contend with their unexpected burden. MIN-JI (restrained, almost blissful) Ah... Umma, I'm so sorry... you might... want to... stand back... JUNG AH tilts her head, oblivious. Then, it hits her—the SMELL. A wrinkled nose turns to disgust as her senses connect the dots. The SCRUNCH of her face is that of someone who has just walked into a mystery substance barefoot. JUNG AH (gasping, disbelief) Min-ji... did you... neoneun jeongmal— MIN-JI cuts her off, still clenching her backside with her hands, a misguided attempt at containment. MIN-JI (convincing herself as much as her mother) Everything's fine. Can I go inside now, please? JUNG AH steps aside, covering her nose with a wince. Her maternal instincts suppressed by the foul reality. MIN-JI teeters by JUNG AH awkwardly, her gait hindered by the load secured by her hands. JUNG AH (shocked and scolding) Ya, Min-ji! This is nasty! Neoneun eotteoke— MIN-JI looks back with wounded pride. MIN-JI (playfully indignant) It's your fault! Why did you squeeze me, Umma? JUNG AH scoffs, dismissive in her shock. JUNG AH (tauntingly) Nonsense! Any adult would not... do this! She motions grandly at the conspicuous BULGE at the seat of MIN-JI's pants, visible evidence of the act. MIN-JI squirms, her hand involuntarily assessing the bulge. Her face pinches with discomfort. MIN-JI (sulkily) Let me clean up. It feels... just... terrible. As JUNG AH takes a closer look, her reaction is exaggerated revulsion and censure. JUNG AH (recoiling, flapping hand to dissipate odor) Go, then! Do it already! The smell, it's unbearable! Blushing deeply, MIN-JI nods, her nose crinkled in acceptance. MIN-JI (resentful but playful) I should clean up. But Umma, the result... partly yours to enjoy, right? JUNG AH ushers her toward the bathroom with one hand while fanning the air with the other, grimacing all the while. JUNG AH (mortified amusement) Hurry, before the whole house smells! MIN-JI shuffles off, her retreat marked by the SOUND of cargos in distress, a symphony of squelches with each step. Her relief from agony and the absurdity of the situation entwined. JUNG AH follows, both enticed and repelled by the spectacle.

The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"Unfortunately, the scenario you have described does not align with respectful and sensitive content standards.

Étape 2 - Informations de base : Nom : Armand Lefebvre Groupe d’âge : la quarantaine Apparence physique : grand, mince, des cheveux poivre-et-sel impeccablement coiffés, des lunettes fines, et toujours vêtu d'un costume bien coupé et d'une cravate distinguée. Étape 3 - Contexte : Ville fictive : Valclair Étape 4 - Enfance : Armand a grandi à Valclair. Un événement traumatique : à l’âge de sept ans, il a été témoin de l’injustice subie par son meilleur ami, faussement accusé de tricherie. Cela a semé en lui une rancœur profonde et un besoin intraitable d'équité. Étape 5 - Personnalité : Armand est intelligent, éloquent, et très organisé. Il a une passion pour l'enseignement et croit fermement en la puissance de l'éducation. Étape 6 - Les défauts : Son besoin d’équité se transforme parfois en obsession, le rendant strict et inflexible. Son zèle pour corriger les torts peut le conduire à des confrontations indésirables. Étape 7 - Entourage : a. Un acolyte : Nathalie, une enseignante de sciences qui partage sa passion pour l’ordre et la discipline. b. Une némésis : Monsieur Delacroix, un parent d'élève indulgent et critique envers les méthodes strictes d'Armand. c. Un partenaire important : Benjamin, un élève qui admire Armand et aspire à devenir enseignant sous sa tutelle. Étape 8 - Moment critique : La première fois qu'Armand a rencontré son ennemi juré, Monsieur Delacroix. Lors d'une réunion parents-enseignants, Delacroix a ouvertement remis en question les techniques d'enseignement d'Armand, le défiant devant toute la salle. Étape 9 - Texte à écrire pour le prochain cours (la rencontre entre Armand et Monsieur Delacroix). Voici le texte narratif en rapport avec l'étape 8, contenant environ 30 lignes : Armand Lefebvre, enseignant dévoué de l'école de Valclair, a toujours valorisé la rigueur et l’intégrité. Alors que la quarantaine marquait le visage de cet homme grand et élégant, l'éclat de ses cheveux poivre-et-sel était le reflet de son inébranlable dévouement à l'éducation. Valclair avait connu Armand enfant, quand un coup du sort l’avait confronté à la dure réalité de l'injustice, scellant son destin d'arbitre de la vérité. Cet homme, aux lunettes lui conférant un air perpétuellement studieux, avait fait de son expérience un pilier de sa vocation. Mais sous des traits humains si louables, se dessinait aussi une rigidité presque fanatique. Sa quête d'équité lui avait forgé des alliés, comme Nathalie, mais aussi des adversaires, comme Monsieur Delacroix, qui s'élevait en némésis face à sa méthode que certains jugeaient draconienne. Leur confrontation à une réunion parents-enseignants marqua le début d’un antagonisme profond. L'air chargé de tension, Armand, dans son costume impecable, avait présenté son bilan éducatif, lorsque Delacroix, décontracté, le défia ouvertement. \\"Votre approche laisse-t-elle place à l'individualité de nos enfants?\\", questionna-t-il, faisant naître un murmure parmi l'assemblée. Armand sentit son cœur battre à tout rompre, mais son visage demeura impassible. Le défi avait été lancé, et il savait que le chemin devant lui serait semé d'embûches. Mais en Armand survivait l'enfant de Valclair, celui qui avait vu un ami chuter sous le poids d'une accusation injuste. Ainsi, même devant l'adversité, il resterait le gardien de l'équité, même si cela le rendait antagoniste aux yeux de quelques-uns. Dans la salle, se tenait aussi Benjamin, cet élève dont les yeux brillaient d'une admiration non dissimulée. Ce que Delacroix ignorait, c'est que l'influence d'Armand Lefebvre transcenderait les clivages, et inspirerait la génération montante à poursuivre une éducation juste et équitable."},{"prompt":"Product concept : \\"Pirate-'o' Sauce\\" - Nautical pasta shapes in savoury sauce :)","completion":"\\"Pirate-'o' Sauce\\" is a playful and imaginative product concept that taps into the adventurous spirit of pirate lore, tailored for children and adults who have a fondness for nautical themes and pasta dishes.

Let's explore how \\"Pahntom's Broth\\" could be developed: **Product Name:** - Pahntom's Broth - Ghoulish Goulash - Creepy Pasta Soup **Pasta Shapes:** - Ghosts: Friendly phantoms that won't haunt your dinner table but will add fun to your soup. - Bats: Small bat shapes suggestive of Gothic imagery, yet cute and endearing. - Coffins: Tiny coffins that could open to reveal a stuffing, making the broth richer as they cook. - Skeleton Bones: A collection of bone-shaped pasta that children can play with, pretending to assemble skeletons. - Spider Webs: Intricate shapes that could catch bits of vegetable or meat in the broth. - Miniature Castles or Haunted Houses: Embodying the trope of spooky mansions, these can add to the theme. **Soup/Broth Flavor Profiles:** - Mystic Tomato: A rich and zesty tomato base, adorned with mystic herbs like rosemary and sage for an enchanting taste. - Witches' Broth: A green, pesto-like broth filled with vegetables, giving it a potion-like appearance. - Eerie Alfredo: A creamy, garlic-infused white sauce with a ghostly hue. - Monster Minestrone: A chunky and hearty vegetable soup with an array of colorful veggies that mimic a monster's diversity. **Packaging:** - The can could have a dark, Victorian design with elements such as candelabras, velvet drapes, and stone walls. - Include comical epitaphs or tongue-in-cheek \\"scary\\" stories on the labels to entertain consumers. - A see-through panel or lid, inviting a peek inside to reveal the \\"mysterious\\" contents, while assuring customers of the food's quality. **Marketing Points:** - Spooky-fun family meal: Encouraging families to bond over a playful, \\"spooky\\" themed meal. - Halloween special: Positioning \\"Pahntom's Broth\\" as the go-to food product for Halloween parties and gatherings. - Involve engaging storytelling: Pairing the food with a booklet of humorous \\"ghost stories\\" or tales about the characters depicted on the cans. **Additional Product Lines:** - \\"Cryptic Crisps\\" or \\"Tombstone Treats\\": A range of spooky-themed crackers or biscuits that can be added to the soup or eaten separately. - \\"Boo Bites\\": Kid-friendly, spooky-shaped snacks that complement the broth, such as mummy-wrapped sausages or cauliflower \\"brains\\".

You’re well aware of the deeds you have committed!\\" With an indifferent glance towards Gu Xuer, Gu Xinxin retorted with mild sarcasm, \\"I have accomplished many good deeds indeed—I’m quite uncertain to which one you’re referring, sister?\\" Gu Baichuan, face darkened with anger, pressed her intensely, \\"I demand to know, you mentioned that you had begun working and planned to move out, but what exactly is this job that you speak of?\\" Gu Xinxin found herself momentarily at a loss for words, as describing her current occupation seemed somewhat indelicate... Pretending to be the delicate wife of a domineering figure to fend off inquiries from his family. What could one call such an occupation? An actress? A temporary bride? Observing Gu Xinxin's mortified demeanor only fueled Gu Baichuan's ire, \\"You wish to keep secrets from me? You, a graduate from a prestigious university, have stooped to becoming a hostess at a bar! Gu Xinxin, where are your pride and sense of decency? Is it your intention to grieve me to death?\\" Hostess? Gu Xinxin raised an eyebrow in query. Gu Baichuan slapped a photograph onto the table that depicted herself and Zuo Yan after they had left from SNOW, walking side by side. Zuo Yan, in the throes of post-breakup madness, had dyed her hair a daringly pink 'Barbie death' hue and was extravagantly dressed. After excessive drinking, her steps were unsteady—certainly a presentation that could lead to misinterpretations of her identity, which was likely why they had been so brazenly harassed by those wealthy scions the other day. As Gu Xinxin walked alongside Zuo Yan, it was inevitable that she too could be subject to the axiom 'birds of a feather flock together.' After reviewing the photograph, Gu Xinxin lifted her gaze to Gu Xuer, \\"Father, this image was taken and given to you by sister, wasn't it?\\" Gu Xuer, unabashed, lifted her chin with a defiant air as if to say, 'What of it?' At that moment, their mother, Liu Li, intervened, playing the role of peacekeeper, \\"Xinxin, don’t hold resentment towards your sister. She too hopes for you to see the error of your ways. Though the job of a hostess might bring in fast money, it is far too degrading. My child, how could you...\\" Watching Liu Li's display of feigned distress, Gu Xinxin laughed lightly, \\"Return from straying? I believe it is my sister who should contemplate such a return, isn't it?\\" Gu Xuer glared discontentedly, \\"What do you mean, Gu Xinxin? I have never strayed to the lows of hostess work; I have nothing to 'return' from.\\" Without giving her sister’s outbursts further acknowledgment, Gu Xinxin explained to Gu Baichuan, \\"Father, the lady with pink hair in the photograph is merely a relative of my landlord. She sought solace in the bar after a breakup, and I was simply assisting the landlord by escorting her home.\\" Gu Baichuan, initially skeptical, considered her words, \\"Are you speaking the truth?\\" With a firm nod, Gu Xinxin assured him, \\"Yes, it's the truth.\\" However, Gu Xuer remained incredulous, advancing to debunk her assertion, \\"How can you lie to father, Gu Xinxin? SNOW's reserved cabins at the twilight bar are exclusively for elite members; ordinary people simply cannot gain entry. If you were not engaged in hostess work there, how could you so confidently waltz inside? Can you elucidate on that?\\" With a serene smile, Gu Xinxin responded, \\"Precisely because my landlord is one of the distinguished members there, I was able to enter directly.\\" Gu Xuer furrowed her brow, suddenly recalling her previous attempt to trail Gu Xinxin when she had been observed entering a luxurious abode... Gu Baichuan's inclinations began to sway towards his younger daughter, \\"Xinxin, is it truly as you say? Have you not deceived your father?\\" Gu Xinxin faced him with a candid expression, \\"Father, rest assured, I would never engage in anything that would be deemed morally reprehensible.\\" Gu Baichuan, visibly relieved, earnestly stated, \\"Good! Xinxin, see that you do not stray off the righteous path, for how else shall I account to your late mother?\\" As Gu Xuer witnessed her father shifting his stance in favor of Gu Xinxin, she could not hide her irritation and sought to tattle once more, \\"Father, even if Xinxin has not become a hostess, her current occupation isn't much better. I intended not to mention it initially, fearing it would distress you—yet seeing Xinxin's lack of progress, I, her elder sister, am compelled to speak out. Father, Gu Xinxin has stooped to working as a maid in a wealthy household, and the 'landlord' she just spoke of is, in fact, her employer!\\" \\"What?\\" Gu Baichuan's brows knitted in a mix of confusion and disapproval, looking towards Gu Xinxin, \\"Is that so, Xinxin? You’ve become a maid?\\" \\"Perhaps... that could be said,\\" Gu Xinxin mused that her indenture to Huo Xiangyin as his feigned wife for three months, always ready to assist him, was not unlike that of a maid’s duties. Gu Baichuan, both disappointed and frustrated, expressed, \\"You abandoned a promising career with Company A to become a maid? What could you possibly be thinking?\\" Before Gu Xinxin could respond, Gu Xuer interjected, \\"Father, Xinxin was fired from Company A! Oh, who could say what missteps she might have taken to warrant such a dismissal?\\" Gu Baichuan's gaze upon Gu Xinxin soured further, \\"Xinxin, when will you cease to be a source of worry? Very well, I shall no longer concern myself with your choices. If being a maid is your resolve, pursue it, but refrain from announcing yourself as my daughter, Gu Baichuan—I can ill afford to bear the shame!\\" Gu Xinxin maintained her composure and respectfully explained, \\"Father, the reality is that my dissertation tackles the development of the domestic service industry, hence, I sought firsthand experience within the sector to enrich my work. Moreover, earnestly earning one's livelihood through one's labor is hardly a matter of disgrace.\\" Gu Baichuan paused to reflect, realizing that his daughter's explanation had merit, and his displeasure gradually eased, \\"So that's the reason then!\\" Nodding dutifully, Gu Xinxin continued with grace, \\"Father, you needn't fret over my thesis. However, I implore you to counsel my sister and encourage her to adopt a broader perspective.\\" Gu Baichuan furrowed his brow in puzzlement, \\"...What seems to be the issue with your sister?\\" Equally bewildered, Gu Xuer asked, \\"Advice for me? Xinxin, what do you mean? What do you want father to advise me on?\\" Gu Xinxin turned to Gu Xuer and sighed softly, \\"Sister, the entertainment industry is rife with deep waters. These past few years, you’ve navigated through its treacherous terrain alone—it has not been an easy journey. There’s no need to endure hardships in seclusion; why not confide in your family sooner?\\" Gu Xuer was utterly perplexed, \\"Gu Xinxin, what are you prattling on about?\\" Gu Xinxin retrieved her phone, pulled up a trending article on Weibo, and handed it to Gu Baichuan, \\"Father, I find it difficult to convey sister’s situation, so I leave it to you to read for yourself...\\" Gu Baichuan, skeptical, glanced over the phone only to have his eyes widen with shock and anger. Looking up, he glared furiously at Gu Xuer, \\"You shameless creature, to have committed such an act!\\" Dumbfounded, Gu Xuer retorted, \\"Father, why are you berating me?\\" Gu Baichuan’s frustration soared beyond the urge to reprimand his disgraced daughter, \\"Still, you have the gall to ask—do you deny knowledge of your own actions?\\" \\"I... I haven't done anything!\\" Gu Xuer was both panicked and clueless, \\"Gu Xinxin, what exactly have you shown father?\\" Gu Xinxin flickered a contemplative gaze towards her, \\"Sister, are you truly unaware? You’ve made headlines again today, and you've clinched the number one spot on the trending list.\\""},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Hindi Drama TV Serial that includes the following sequence of events: * A woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she's a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching her house's door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"**Title: \\"Maa, Main Aur Musibat\\"** **EXT.

CAFE AT CRAPPY 70S SHOPPING CENTRE - FRIDAY AFTERNOON David, an unassuming 21-year-old university student with a studious aura, sits sandwiched between his younger sister, RUTH, an impish 16-year-old wearing casual jeans and trainers, and AIMEE, Ruth’s darkly-clad friend of the same age, whose interest in the fringe subjects of hypnosis could be considered peculiar, or in the coming moments, downright diabolical. AIMEE (leaning in, playfully) David, you ever notice how a conversation can just carry you away? Like you're drifting on water... so relaxing. David chuckles, maintaining a guarded demeanor, but a curiosity glints in his eyes. DAVID (reluctantly amused) I guess so. It's called getting lost in conversation, Aimee. RUTH (teasing) Don't mind her, she just loves messing with people's heads. Aimee locks eyes with David, her gaze soft yet piercing, stirring an unknown apprehension in his gut. She proceeds to talk, her words flowing as smoothly as a rehearsed hypnotic script, subtly dropping her tone on certain words. AIMEE (casual yet focused) Exactly, Ruth! David, think of it. One word follows another, thoughts flow, like your mind riding the ripples of a conversation. And there's the sound of shoes walking — comforting, isn't it? David, involuntarily, follows the sound of footsteps, and a curious tingle brushes his consciousness as he briefly indulges in his discreet fascination. He tries to shift his focus away, but the mere mention of shoes has him unwittingly anchored. RUTH (smirking) You getting sleepy yet, bro? Meanwhile, Aimee loops her dialogue, cascades of words lapping at David's conscious resistance. AIMEE (slightly whispering now) You could focus on any sound, any sight... The more you try not to, the deeper it calls you, like the rhythmic tapping of a pen... Unbeknownst to him, this reference to rhythm mirrors the methodical nature of how feet ascend and descend with each step, amplifying David's inner conflict and embarrassment. David's defences begin to crumble under the relentless onslaught of Aimee's seemingly random sentences, each word a calculated step deeper into the trance she’s weaving. AIMEE (gently coaxing) It's intriguing, David, how some thoughts just... stick, don't they? Cling like stubborn lint. Or maybe, they can simply fall away... just for a little while. David's eyelids flutter, his posture relaxes, and his guard lowers a notch. His sister watches, half-expecting, half-disbelieving. RUTH (concern creeping in) You're looking a little pale, David. Everything okay? Aimee’s lips curl into a near-imperceptible smile. Her voice softens to a melodic whisper, her words framing a symphony of surrender. AIMEE (low and rhythmic) Sure, he's fine. Aren't you, David? It's like taking a short vacation. Feet can rest, the mind too. A thought pops up, and then... poof, it just floats away blank... David's fight to maintain control is visibly faltering as Aimee subtly interweaves the word \\"blank,\\" a hypnosis trigger term, deftly integrating his covert predilection.

It's exhausting... isn't it? What if... you gave me the reins? Just for a moment... David's last shred of self-command slips, his fear of exposure overtaken by the ensnaring tranquility that Aimee has artfully spun around him. The scene is set; David, ensnared in unforeseen humiliation, Ruth, an unintended spectator to her brother's secret shame, and Aimee, cool and collected, as the master puppeteer delicately pulling at the strings of David's subconscious—all in what seemed to be just small talk in an otherwise ordinary cafe."},{"prompt":"\\"And now you find that every time you hear me snap my fingers and say the word 'Sleep'...\\" Soon David is calling her 'Master' in a monotone.","completion":"FADE IN: Aimee, the subtle sorceress of suggestion, leans closer to a trance-enthralled David, who sits completely vulnerable to her calculated words.

She pauses, allowing the suspense to thicken, and with a swift motion, she snaps her fingers sharply in front of David's blank face. AIMEE (CONT'D) (whispering) ...your mind will instantly return to this peaceful, obedient state. You won't be able to resist; it will just happen, naturally and promptly. David's body shows a subtle sign of acceptance, a slight nod, an imperceptible lean into the sound of her snap. Ruth's expression flits between fascination and worry as she witnesses the transformation of her confident brother into someone who seems like a stranger. AIMEE (CONT'D) (helpfully) All your tensions, worries, they just dissolve at that snap. It's comfortable, isn’t it? Aimee casually snaps her fingers again, her control over David manifesting with practiced ease. AIMEE (CONT'D) (quiet authority) Sleep. David's head droops slightly forward; his response is instant—confirmation of the sinister hook Aimee has planted. RUTH (amused but unsettled) David, come back! This is weird... Aimee holds up a hand to Ruth, her confidence as unyielding as steel, and gently shakes her head to silence her. AIMEE (to David, reinforcing) And in this sleep, you will respond to me as 'Master'. Your mind accepts this fully. DAVID (utterly compliant, monotone) Yes, Master. The word hangs in the air, cutting through the normalcy of the cafe with an edge of the unnatural. Ruth stiffens, an unsettled shiver crawling up her spine. AIMEE (slyly, to Ruth) You see? Harmless fun... He won't remember a thing when he wakes up. Will you, David? DAVID (no inflection) No, Master. Ruth gazes at her brother, trying to reconcile the bizarre sight with her understanding of reality. Her urge to protect clashes with the strangeness and the odd humor she finds in his newfound obedience. AIMEE (to Ruth, reassuring) It’s just a deep relaxation. He’s not in any danger. Right, David? DAVID (automaton-like) I am safe, Master. AIMEE (satisfied) Good. Now, when I snap my fingers again, you'll wake up feeling refreshed and alert, like after a great nap, with no recollection of this... conversation. The SNAP of her fingers pierces the air, and David's eyes flutter open, a portrait of bewilderment, mixed with a sense of rejuvenation. He blinks at the two girls, a sheepish grin spreading across his face. DAVID (scratching his head) Wow, did I zone out? Did I miss anything? RUTH (shaking her head, relieved) Just... normal stuff. Right, Aimee? Aimee nods, sharing a secretive smile with Ruth, their unspoken bond over the incident tightening. AKEEM (innocently) Just chatting about school and stuff. You were daydreaming, big brother. As the trio stand up to leave, David remains utterly oblivious to the psychological expedition he’s taken, led by Aimee's unseen guiding hand. And with that, Aimee has written herself as the mysterious maestro in this unnervingly normal setting, the café acting as their stage for temporal power and hidden desires.

TOWN CENTER - OUTSIDE NEWSAGENTS - DAY David, now dressed casually in a t-shirt and jeans, leisurely approaches the newsagents alongside JOSH, a tall and athletic friend close to his age, both engaged in animated conversation. DAVID (laughing) ...so then she just dropped the whole tray! It was everywhere, man. Josh chuckles, slapping David on the back as they walk. Their amusement is a vivid contrast against the mundane backdrop of the busy town center. Suddenly, Aimee emerges from the newsagents. She's carrying a couple of music magazines under her arm, her dark attire cutting a striking image as she pauses to notice David and Josh. Josh sees Aimee, nudges David and nods in her direction with interest. JOSH (suggestively) Who's the goth chick, Dave? Aimee's eyes meet David's, a flicker of yesterday's hypnotic encounter still smoldering in her gaze. DAVID (remembering nothing, carefree) Oh, that's Aimee. Ruth's friend, you know? AIMEE (plotting, approaching them) Hey, David. Fancy seeing you here. Aimee strides over with confident, measured steps, and he can't help but feel a strange sensation pull at the edges of his attention as she approaches. AIMEE (CONT'D) (her tone light but dangerous) Enjoying your day so far? David nods, all the while unaware of the brewing storm hidden beneath her casual demeanor. DAVID (enthusiastic) Yeah, it's been pretty good! Josh and I are just— Before David can finish his sentence, Aimee brings her fingers up and deftly snaps them, like the striking of a match that could ignite a bonfire of embarrassment. AIMEE (interrupting, uttering softly) Sleep. Instantly, David's posture slackens, his face blank and his eyes unfocused. A look of confusion crosses Josh's face as he observes David’s sudden change. JOSH (concerned) Dude... you okay? AIMEE (to Josh, reassuring) He's fine. Just a bit tired, aren't you, David? David mumbles an incoherent agreement, his voice barely above a whisper. JOSH (unsure) This some kind of joke? What's going on? Aimee glances at Josh with a smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes. AIMEE (calmly explaining, unchallenged) Let's just say David and I have a very responsive friendship. Don't we, David? DAVID (in a monotone, obediently) Yes, Master. Josh takes a step back, his initial amusement giving way to discomfort at the eerie display. AIMEE (turning to David, testing her control) Now, remember, you won’t recall any of this. And when I snap my fingers one more time, you’ll wake up feeling fantastic, ready to hang out with Josh as if nothing happened. David nods, his mind still ensnared. JOSH (muttering to himself) Man, I need to lay off the video games... this is too weird. With another SNAP, David blinks and shakes his head, regaining his usual demeanor. DAVID (jovial again, to Josh) Sorry about that, must've zoned out for a second. JOSH (eyeing Aimee warily) Sure, buddy. Listen, uh—maybe we should get going. AIMEE (smiling innocently to David) Enjoy your day, David! David waves goodbye, oblivious to the bullet he just dodged, while Josh hustles him away, shooting a final, suspicious glance toward Aimee. AIMEE (CONT'D) (watching them leave, to herself) Responsive indeed... As David and Josh disappear into the crowd, Aimee tucks away her secret with a sense of devilish satisfaction, the thrill of her power over David encased in the cloak of a seemingly innocuous encounter.

Barefooted and carefree, the two friends share a bag of crisps between them, absorbed in the lighthearted camaraderie of an evening in. Their faces, illuminated by the screen, wear expressions of genuine amusement as they react to the comedy show playing out before them. The camera focuses on their feet as they wiggle with mirth, reflecting the light-hearted mood. AIMEE (chuckling, teasingly nudging Ruth) That actor totally looks like your brother when he's confused. Ruth rolls her eyes but giggles, imagining David's befuddled expression. RUTH (giggling) Oh, stop it! David's got more of a clue than that guy... usually. AIMEE (playfully) I don't know...

In your \`main.cpp\` file, you're redefining the same classes (\`Logger\`, \`PaymentStrategy\`, \`CreditCardPayment\`, \`SberPayPayment\`, etc.) which is causing the compiler to emit redefinition errors. To fix the error, you should remove the class definitions from \`main.cpp\` and only implement the methods of the classes in the C++ source file if needed. Since the header files already contain the class declarations, you don't need to redefine them; instead, you include the headers and then implement the method definitions or use the classes as intended. Here's how you can fix the \`main.cpp\`: 1. Remove the class definitions from \`main.cpp\`. You already have those definitions in your header files. You only need to provide the implementations for the member functions in \`main.cpp\`. 2. You should implement the member functions that are declared in the header files. If they are already implemented in another source file, you don't even need that in \`main.cpp\`. Your \`main.cpp\` should then look like this: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <fstream> #include <stdexcept> #include <limits> #include <string> #include \\"Logger.h\\" #include \\"Carpay.h\\" using namespace std; // Инициализация статической переменной instance Logger* Logger::instance = nullptr; // Функция для выбора задачи (1 - оплата, 2 - автомобиль) int chooseTask() { //... } // Функция для выбора способа оплаты PaymentStrategy* choosePaymentMethod() { //... } int main() { //... // Your process control flow as before, but without redefining classes. } \`\`\` You will also need to make sure that every member function that is declared in the \`Carpay.h\` file is either implemented inside \`Carpay.cpp\` or \`main.cpp\`. But make sure these implementations are not duplicated. One more thing: ensure that your \`Carpay.h\` uses include guards properly with \`#define\`. The current code: \`\`\`cpp #ifndef CARPAY #define CARPAY \`\`\` Should probably be something like this, with a clearer naming convention: \`\`\`cpp #ifndef CARPAY_H #define CARPAY_H // ... rest of the code ... #endif // CARPAY_H \`\`\` Once you've made these changes, your multiple redefinition errors should be fixed and you can successfully compile your program with \`gcc\`."},{"prompt":"When I try to class prototype with inheritation in C++: class CreditCardPayment : public PaymentStrategy {}; I get error: class CreditCardPayment : public PaymentStrategy {}; ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Carpay.h:5:7: note: forward declaration of 'class PaymentStrategy' class PaymentStrategy; ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ main.cpp:62:7: error: redefinition of 'class CreditCardPayment' class CreditCardPayment : public PaymentStrategy { ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In file included from main.cpp:7:0: Carpay.h:8:7: error: previous definition of 'class CreditCardPayment' class CreditCardPayment : public PaymentStrategy {}; ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ main.cpp: In function 'PaymentStrategy* choosePaymentMethod()': main.cpp:126:42: error: cannot convert 'CreditCardPayment*' to 'PaymentStrategy*' in return return new CreditCardPayment(); ^ main.cpp:133:42: error: cannot convert 'CreditCardPayment*' to 'PaymentStrategy*' in return return new CreditCardPayment(); What correct class prototype with inheritation ?","completion":"When using inheritance in C++, a class prototype is a forward declaration that informs the compiler about the existence of the class before it is fully defined. The prototype must be sufficient for the situations where you need the class type but not its full definition, like when defining pointers or references to the class, or declaring functions that take parameters or return values of the class. Your compilation error indicates that the compiler knows about the existence of \`PaymentStrategy\` (because of its forward declaration), but it doesn't have the full definition needed for inheritance. To allow a class like \`CreditCardPayment\` to inherit from \`PaymentStrategy\`, the full definition of \`PaymentStrategy\` must be included before the declaration of \`CreditCardPayment\`. Here's the correct process to declare a class with inheritance in C++: 1. Ensure that the base class is fully defined before any derived class tries to inherit from it. 2. Use include guards in header files to prevent multiple inclusion issues. Assuming both \`PaymentStrategy\` and \`CreditCardPayment\` are part of \`Carpay.h\` file, the file should look something like this: \`\`\`cpp // Carpay.h #ifndef CARPAY_H #define CARPAY_H class PaymentStrategy { public: virtual ~PaymentStrategy() = default; // Virtual destructor for base class virtual void pay(int amount) = 0; // Pure virtual function }; class CreditCardPayment : public PaymentStrategy { public: void pay(int amount) override; // Override the pay function // Other members/functions can be included here... }; // Other derived classes from PaymentStrategy here... #endif // CARPAY_H \`\`\` Now, when you include \`Carpay.h\` in your \`main.cpp\` file, the compiler will have access to the full definitions needed for inheritance: \`\`\`cpp #include \\"Carpay.h\\" // If there are implementations of the member functions, they should // be provided here, or in another .cpp file. void CreditCardPayment::pay(int amount) { // Implementation of the pay function for CreditCardPayment // ... } // main.cpp code continues... \`\`\` Finally, remove any class prototypes from \`main.cpp\` or other source files, and only keep the implementations of the member functions.

Le titre de la chanson est tiré du fameux slogan du même nom prononcé pour la 1ère fois par Dolorès Ibárri Gomez dans un discours dès le premier jour du conflit.","completion":"Para realizar una síntesis comparativa, necesitamos entender el contexto y el mensaje de los dos carteles mencionados: Cartel 1: \\"España resucita\\" Este cartel sugiere una idea de renacimiento o resurgimiento de España. Aunque no se proporciona información adicional sobre el contenido o el propósito específico del cartel, el uso de la palabra \\"resucita\\" implica una recuperación o revitalización de la nación después de un período de dificultades o declive. Podría estar relacionado con un evento histórico como el final de la guerra civil, la transición a la democracia después de la dictadura de Franco, o incluso un contexto más moderno de recuperación económica o social. Cartel 2: \\"No pasaran\\" Este lema, que significa \\"No pasarán\\", está asociado con la defensa republicana durante la Guerra Civil Española. Originalmente pronunciado por Dolores Ibárruri, \\"La Pasionaria\\", el slogan se convirtió en un grito de resistencia contra las fuerzas nacionalistas lideradas por el general Franco. La mención de que se convirtió en una canción de resistencia republicana enfatiza su papel en la cultura y la moral de los partidarios de la República durante y después de la contienda. Comparativa: Ambos carteles tienen en común el contexto español y se refieren a periodos de conflicto y recuperación de la identidad y la soberanía de España. Mientras que \\"España resucita\\" puede verse como una mirada hacia el futuro con esperanzas de renovación, \\"No pasaran\\" es una afirmación defensiva del presente o del pasado, un símbolo de resistencia y de lucha en el momento de la guerra. La diferencia primordial es que \\"España resucita\\" podría ser aplicable a diversos momentos de la historia española en donde el país ha buscado reconstruirse o regenerarse, implicando un sentido más amplio y posiblemente optimista. En contraste, \\"No pasarán\\" es específico al período de la Guerra Civil y connota resistencia en un contexto de división y conflicto armado, representando la determinación de un bando por impedir el avance del otro y teniendo un tono más bélico y urgente. Es importante tomar en cuenta que, sin más información sobre los carteles, como su diseño visual o su uso específico, la interpretación podría variar significativamente. Sin embargo, estas serían las connotaciones generales que se pueden inferir de los textos proporcionados."},{"prompt":"peux tu rédiger avec c'es informationn: Cartel republicano: Este cartel muestra a un soldado en uniforme azul, que representa al Ejército Popular Republicano, sosteniendo un fusil y defendiendo a un compañero caído. El sol en el fondo simboliza la esperanza y la lucha contra el fascismo. El texto dice “¡No pasarán!”, que era el slogan de los republicanos que resistían el avance de los nacionalistas apoyados por Alemania e Italia. El cartel expresa un sentimiento de solidaridad, determinación y sacrificio por la causa republicana. Cartel nacionalista: Este cartel muestra a una figura gigante, que representa a la España nacionalista, emergiendo de una explosión o una luz. La figura sostiene una espada y un escudo, que simbolizan la defensa y la fuerza. Debajo de la figura, hay imágenes relacionadas con la guerra, como cañones y barcos. El colorido consiste en azules oscuros, naranjas y amarillos que crean un contraste. El texto dice “ESPAÑA RESUCITA!”, que refleja la ideología nacionalista de restaurar la grandeza de España, católica, imperial y unida. El cartel expresa un sentimiento de orgullo, poder y victoria sobre los republicanos. Comparación: Los dos carteles son ejemplos de propaganda política que se usó durante la guerra civil española (1936-1939) para movilizar y convencer a la población de cada bando. Los dos carteles tienen un estilo de banda dibujada con colores vivos y mensajes directos. Sin embargo, los dos carteles también presentan diferencias en cuanto a la representación de los combatientes, el tono del mensaje y la visión de España. Mientras que el cartel republicano muestra una escena realista y dramática de la guerra, el cartel nacionalista muestra una imagen fantástica y triunfalista de la España resucitada. Mientras que el cartel republicano apela a la resistencia y la solidaridad de los que luchan por la democracia, el cartel nacionalista apela al orden, la disciplina y la unidad de los que luchan por la tradición. Mientras que el cartel republicano tiene una visión de España plural, moderna y abierta al mundo, el cartel nacionalista tiene una visión de España única, eterna y aislada del mundo.","completion":"Los dos carteles representan visiones opuestas y la división ideológica que marcó la Guerra Civil Española. El cartel republicano utiliza la imagen de un soldado del Ejército Popular Republicano en un momento de combate para transmitir un mensaje de valentía y compromiso con la defensa de la República. El uso del uniforme azul, el fusil y el sol en el fondo están diseñados para evocar la lucha continua contra el fascismo y la esperanza en la victoria republicana. El slogan “¡No pasarán!” refuerza la determinación de los republicanos de no ceder ante la presión de las fuerzas nacionalistas, respaldadas por las potencias de Alemania e Italia. Es un cartel que reta a la población a permanecer unida, y evoca emociones de solidaridad y sacrificio en la defensa de sus ideales democráticos y progresistas. Por otro lado, el cartel nacionalista presenta una interpretación mítica y heroica de España a través de la figura gigantesca que emerge con espada y escudo. Este simbolismo de fuerza y defensa pretende comunicar la ideología de \\"una España grande y libre\\". La explosión o luz de fondo, junto con las imágenes de guerra, refuerza la idea de una nación en el umbral del renacer. Los colores vibrantes y el contraste visual refuerzan la idea de una victoria inminente. El mensaje “ESPAÑA RESUCITA!” implica la restauración de una España unificada bajo valores tradicionales, católicos e imperiales, y transmite un sentimiento de orgullo nacionalista. Ambos carteles funcionan como herramientas de propaganda para movilizar emociones y apoyo para cada bando. Mientras el cartel republicano representa una defensa férrea y comprometida de valores democráticos y sociales, el cartel nacionalista proyecta una visión idealizada y triumfante que promete el retorno a un pasado glorioso y la unificación bajo un nacionalismo fuerte. La diferencia en la representación y en los valores resaltados por cada cartel reflejan la profunda polarización política y social de la España de aquellos años.

En synthèse, tandis que l'affiche républicaine souligne l'urgence de la résistance et de l'engagement collectif dans un contexte de lutte pour la démocratie, l'affiche nationaliste célèbre le retour attendu à l'ordre et à la grandeur d'une Espagne unie. La première met l'accent sur une vision progressiste et ouverte de l'Espagne, tandis que la seconde promeut une vision traditionnaliste, ancrée dans une perspective d'isolement vis-à-vis des influences extérieures. Les deux affiches sont donc non seulement des outils de guerre psychologique, mais aussi des incarnations des idéaux opposés qui ont divisé l'Espagne lors de cette époque tumultueuse."},{"prompt":"en espangol","completion":"Las dos carteles son ejemplares de la propaganda que se utilizó durante la Guerra Civil Española, cada uno reflejando la división ideológica entre los bandos enfrentados. En la afiche republicana se retrata una escena bélica cargada de realismo, con un soldado protegiendo a su compañero caído, bajo un sol que simboliza la esperanza y resistencia al fascismo. El lema \\"¡No pasarán!\\" funciona como un llamado a la unidad y determinación de los simpatizantes de la República. Este mensaje busca inspirar solidaridad y la defensa colectiva de los valores democráticos. En contraste, el cartel nacionalista transmite una visión triunfalista, representada por una figura sobrehumana emergiendo de una explosión, empuñando espada y escudo. Estos elementos sugieren una resurrección de España como una nación unificada, heredera de valores tradicionales y católicos. El uso de colores vivos y contraste visual busca representar una promesa de renacimiento y victoria sobre las fuerzas republicanas, apelando al orgullo nacional. En resumen, mientras que el cartel republicano enfatiza la urgencia de la resistencia y el compromiso colectivo en el contexto de lucha por la democracia, el cartel nacionalista celebra la anhelada restauración del orden y la grandeza de una España unificada. La primera pone de relieve una visión progresista y abierta de España, mientras que la segunda promueve una perspectiva tradicionalista, sustentada en un aislamiento frente a influencias foráneas.

(Possibly like Past Times, or Museum's selection with more whimsy, or budget friendly items, and a family purchaser perspective.)","completion":"A \\"Time Traveller's\\" supply store as a retail concept for a gift/toy/craft shop is a creative and whimsical idea that could draw in a wide range of customers with its unique approach. Imagine a store where not only history enthusiasts but also families, children, and casual shoppers can find something intriguing. The theme of time travel allows for an eclectic mix of merchandise, all tied together with the idea of journeying through different eras. Here's a more detailed concept for what such a store might feature: **Store Design and Layout:** - Zones organized by time period, such as Prehistoric, Ancient Civilizations, Middle Ages, Renaissance, Victorian Era, Roaring Twenties, Retro Futurism (e.g., 50's sci-fi), and more contemporary times. - Each zone would have its decor replicate the essence of the era, with appropriate music and scents to match. - Interactive displays and small \\"time portals\\" could be established for photo ops and to enhance the immersive experience. **Merchandise:** - Replicas of historical artifacts, from tools and dishes to jewelry and clothing. - Traditional games from different time periods like mancala, senet, chess, and parker brothers reproductions. - Literature and picture books related to history, myths, and time travel stories. - DIY craft kits for creating ancient pottery, medieval tapestries, or Victorian paper toys. - Toys such as dinosaur figures, knight and castle playsets, vintage cars, and model ships. - Steampunk accessories that blend Victorian aesthetics with futuristic imaginings. - Time traveler essentials like faux leather-bound journals, compasses, \\"ancient\\" maps, and sundials. **Educational Aspect:** - Workshops and activities in store, where children and families can learn ancient crafts, play historical games, or attend a storytime featuring tales from different epochs. - Hosting educational events or seasonal festivals that celebrate specific time periods, such as a Renaissance fair or a 60s weekend with costumes, music, and food from the era. **Budget-friendly Focus:** - A range of price points to accommodate all customers, offering both simple and extravagant items. - A bargain bin or \\"Artifact Digs\\" section with affordable trinkets and toys meant to mimic a treasure hunt. **Family and Children's Engagement:** - A time-travel passport where kids can collect stamps from each era they \\"visit\\" within the store, offering incentives and discounts when the passport is filled. - A small \\"invention corner\\" where kids can try their hands at creating futuristic gadgets from recyclable materials or simple electronic kits. **Gifts and Novelty Items:** - \\"Potions\\" and \\"elixirs\\" (decorative bottles filled with colored liquid or bath salts). - Personalizable items that could serve as family heirlooms or gifts, such as customizable crests, signet rings, or faux ancient scrolls. - Time travel \\"survival kits\\" which might include novelty items cheekily suggesting survival in another time, like a mini lantern, a pocket guide to medieval etiquette, or a humorous pamphlet on \\"how to avoid being accused of witchcraft.\\" **Online Presence:** - A website featuring a virtual tour of the store. - Online shopping options categorized by era, complete with historical context and explanations of their uses or significance. - Educational blogs or videos that tell the stories behind products, offer DIY project guides, or discuss interesting historical facts. The \\"Time Traveller's\\" supply store concept offers a unique blend of education, entertainment, and retail that can appeal to history buffs, families, and anyone looking for a distinctive gift or personal item. It could become not just a store, but a destination that provides an engaging and memorable experience for all who visit."},{"prompt":"Would a concept liek the above work for a \\"Horrible Histories\\" store, if a license could be obtained ?","completion":"Certainly! A \\"Horrible Histories\\" themed store would be an excellent fit for a concept like the \\"Time Traveller's\\" supply store, particularly given the educational and engaging nature of the \\"Horrible Histories\\" brand. \\"Horrible Histories\\" is a beloved series known for teaching history in a humorous, irreverent, and accessible way, which could be translated seamlessly into a retail environment. Licensing the brand could provide a strong foundation for the store's identity and attract fans of the series. Here's how the \\"Horrible Histories\\" theme could be incorporated into the store concept: **Themed Zones:** - Each era or subject from the \\"Horrible Histories\\" books and TV series could have its dedicated section in the store, with names like \\"Rotten Romans,\\" \\"Vicious Vikings,\\" or \\"Terrible Tudors.\\" - The sections would house merchandise, books, and interactive exhibits related to their respective times, all adhering to the \\"Horrible Histories\\" comedic and factual style. **Product Offerings:** - Exclusive \\"Horrible Histories\\" merchandise, including branded stationery, clothing, games, and toys. - The books from the series itself, along with complementary historical titles that delve deeper into the topics. - Educational kits and activity sets designed around different historical events and eras, aligning with the \\"Horrible Histories\\" brand's educational value. **Interactive Elements:** - Live performances or character appearances from the \\"Horrible Histories\\" universe, such as book readings and skits. - Interactive displays where children can learn about historical events and figures through hands-on, engaging activities. - Digital touchpoints such as trivia kiosks and augmented reality experiences that bring historical scenes to life. **Educational Activities:** - Workshops that mirror the irreverent tone of \\"Horrible Histories,\\" such as a mummy-making class or a gladiator training session. - Historical scavenger hunts where children can solve clues related to various \\"Horrible Histories\\" books and themes. **Branding and Marketing:** - Strong \\"Horrible Histories\\" branding throughout the store, leveraging the recognizable visual style and tone of the series. - Marketing campaigns that tap into the humor and educational content of the brand, with events such as book launches, signings with authors, or themed history days corresponding with school curricula. **Online and Multimedia:** - An online storefront with \\"Horrible Histories\\" branding that sells merchandise and offers educational resources. - Video clips from the \\"Horrible Histories\\" TV show playing in the store or featured on the website to deepen customer engagement. - Interactive online resources, such as quizzes or games, to extend the experience beyond the physical store. By obtaining the license and adopting the \\"Horrible Histories\\" theme, the store could not only capitalize on the existing fan base but also create a fun, memorable shopping and learning environment that stands out from traditional retail offerings. This concept blends well with the edutainment approach, which is increasingly popular among families looking for more than just a shopping trip—they want an experience that is both educational and entertaining. Additionally, it aligns nicely with the goals of parents and educators to make learning history enjoyable and accessible to children."},{"prompt":"têt đến , phố phường đông vui tấp nạp bởi người người , nhà nhà đều nô nức đi sắm tết.

Dưới đây là cách bạn có thể làm điều này: **Bước 1**: Đảm bảo rằng bạn đã tích hợp Summernote vào dự án của mình. Bạn cần thêm các tập tin JavaScript và CSS của Summernote vào dự án của mình (sử dụng npm, bower, hoặc thêm trực tiếp từ CDN trong file \`_Layout.cshtml\` hoặc file \`.html\` tương ứng khi bạn khởi tạo Summernote). **Bước 2**: Tạo một model trong dự án của bạn nếu bạn chưa có. Ví dụ mô hình \`Post\` như sau: \`\`\`csharp namespace YTe.Models { public class Post { // Các thuộc tính của Post public int Id { get; set; } public string Title { get; set; } public string Content { get; set; } // Bạn có thể thêm các thuộc tính khác ở đây } } \`\`\` **Bước 3**: Tạo một view cho việc nhập dữ liệu. View này sẽ sử dụng Summernote như một trình soạn thảo WYSIWYG cho nội dung bài đăng. Định nghĩa view với model bạn đã tạo: \`\`\`html @model YTe.Models.Post @{ ViewBag.Title = \\"Create Post\\"; Layout = \\"~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml\\"; } @using (Html.BeginForm(\\"Create\\", \\"Posts\\", FormMethod.Post, new { enctype = \\"multipart/form-data\\" })) { @Html.AntiForgeryToken() <div class=\\"form-group\\"> @Html.LabelFor(model => model.Title) @Html.EditorFor(model => model.Title, new { htmlAttributes = new { @class = \\"form-control\\" } }) @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.Title, \\"\\", new { @class = \\"text-danger\\" }) </div> <div class=\\"form-group\\"> @Html.LabelFor(model => model.Content) @Html.TextAreaFor(model => model.Content, new { @class = \\"form-control summernote\\" }) @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.Content, \\"\\", new { @class = \\"text-danger\\" }) </div> <button type=\\"submit\\" class=\\"btn btn-primary\\">Save</button> } @section Scripts { <script> (document).ready(function() { ('.summernote').summernote({ height: 200 }); }); <\/script> } \`\`\` Trong đoạn code trên, \`@Html.TextAreaFor\` được sử dụng để tạo một textarea, và class \`summernote\` được gán để khởi tạo Summernote bằng jQuery trong phần \`Scripts\`. **Bước 4**: Xử lý dữ liệu được đăng từ form trong controller tương ứng. Ví dụ, bạn cần một action \`Create\` trong controller \`Posts\` để xử lý POST request: \`\`\`csharp public class PostsController : Controller { [HttpPost] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public ActionResult Create(Post post) { if (ModelState.IsValid) { // Lưu post vào cơ sở dữ liệu, ví dụ sử dụng Entity Framework db.Posts.Add(post); db.SaveChanges(); return RedirectToAction(\\"Index\\"); } return View(post); } } \`\`\` Đảm bảo rằng bạn đã điều chỉnh tên controller, tên action và logic lưu trữ theo dự án của bạn."},{"prompt":"my head feel heavy everyday, can't focus on complex task, how can i improve my energy and clarity of my mind/brain?","completion":"Feeling a heavy head and an inability to focus can stem from a variety of causes including stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, dehydration, medical conditions, or even lifestyle factors. Improving energy levels and mental clarity generally involves several changes in daily habits and possibly seeking medical advice. Here are some steps you could consider taking: 1. **Consult a Healthcare Professional:** - Before making any significant changes, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional, especially if you're experiencing ongoing symptoms. - They can rule out or treat any potential medical issues like anemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes, depression, or other conditions that could be causing fatigue and lack of focus. 2. **Sleep Hygiene:** - Ensure that you are getting sufficient sleep. Adults generally need 7-9 hours of sleep per night. - Create a consistent sleep schedule. - Make sure your sleeping environment is comfortable, dark, and quiet. 3. **Nutrition:** - Consume a balanced diet with plenty of vegetables, fruits, proteins, and whole grains to ensure you're getting the necessary nutrients for brain health. - Avoid large amounts of sugary foods and drinks which can cause energy spikes and crashes. - Stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day. 4. **Exercise:** - Regular physical activity can improve both your energy levels and mental clarity. - Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. 5. **Mindfulness and Stress Management:** - Practice stress-reduction techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga. - Mindfulness can improve your mental clarity by training your mind to focus on the present moment. 6. **Mental Exercises:** - Engage in activities that stimulate your mind, such as crossword puzzles, reading, learning a new skill, or brain training apps. 7. **Breaks and Time Management:** - Take regular breaks when working on complex tasks. The Pomodoro Technique suggests 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. - Prioritize tasks and break them into smaller, manageable pieces. 8. **Reducing Caffeine and Alcohol:** - Excessive caffeine can interfere with your sleep and after the initial surge can lead to more fatigue. Try reducing your intake and avoid caffeine later in the day. - Alcohol can impact the quality of your sleep, so moderate consumption or avoidance is advisable. 9. **Social Interactions:** - Spend time with friends and family or engage in social activities. Positive social interactions can improve mood and mental focus. 10. **Supplements:** - In some cases, supplements like Omega-3 fatty acids, Vitamin D, B-Vitamins, or magnesium may help improve energy and cognitive function. Talk to a healthcare provider before starting any supplements. It is also important to understand that everyone is different, and what works for one person may not work for another. If your symptoms are severe, persistent, or worsening, please seek medical attention as they could be signs of a more serious issue. Remember to always discuss any plans for lifestyle changes or supplements with your healthcare provider to ensure they are appropriate and safe for you."},{"prompt":"Retail concpet: A novelty clothing store where you can find respectful 'inclusive' clothing for events.","completion":"The retail concept you're describing seems like a blend of novelty and inclusivity focused on clothing appropriate for various events.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"**INT.

Script: In which Joana the office cleaner hypnotizes David.","completion":"Title: \\"The Pristine Fall\\" FADE IN: INT. DAY - MODERN OFFICE - LATE EVENING We are in a sleek office. The sun has set and most employees have left, but JOANA (40s), a formidable woman with an air of mystery, hums softly as she cleans the empty cubicles. She moves gracefully, almost catlike, as she works. Pan across the office to reveal DAVID (30s), a smug middle-tier manager with a penchant for belittling others. He's a silver-tongued speaker in meetings but takes special joy in being subtly cruel to those \\"below\\" him on the corporate ladder, especially Joana. David, obliviously working late on a report, doesn’t notice Joana’s presence until he drops a stack of papers. They scatter across the floor. Without looking up, he calls out. DAVID (irritated) Hey, you! Cleaner! Get over here and pick these up. Joana, who had witnessed the ordeal, says nothing. She approaches silently and begins gathering the papers. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, and Joana's carry a glint of something unfathomable. JOANA (calmly) David, you seem stressed. Let’s try something that might help. Unbeknownst to David, Joana subtly pulls out a small, crystal pendulum from her pocket. The light catches it, creating a captivating shimmer. DAVID (laughing scornfully) You're going to help me? What can you possibly-- His voice trails off as he becomes entranced by the pendulum's swinging motion. Joana's voice becomes soft and melodic. JOANA (hypnotically) Watch the pendulum, David. With every swing, you feel more and more relaxed. David's eyelids begin to droop, his initial scoff fading into a dazed compliance. Joana smiles faintly. JOANA (CONT'D) (commandingly) When you wake up, you will clean the entire office floor. On your hands and knees, with this tiny toothbrush. She produces a child-sized toothbrush from her other pocket, placing it in front of his eyes. David nods, entranced. JOANA (CONT'D) (satisfied) And you will do so believing you are a majestic unicorn, gracing the world with your cleanliness. CUT TO: INT. DAY - MODERN OFFICE - NEXT MORNING The office is bustling. Employees are whispering, holding back laughter as they watch a disheveled David on his hands and knees, diligently scrubbing the floor with the tiny toothbrush. David is wearing a makeshift unicorn horn, fashioned from office supplies. He whinnies intermittently, fully believing in his alternate reality. His well-kept reputation is crumbling more with every scrub and whinny. Joana casually mops nearby, an air of contentment about her. She catches the eye of a CO-WORKER (20s), who is clearly puzzled by the situation. CO-WORKER What in the world happened to David? JOANA (innocently) Oh, he’s just showing pride in his work, embracing his true potential. Sometimes, you have to get a little dirty to really shine. Joana winks at the bewildered co-worker, who nods hesitantly, still unsure how to process the scene. The co-worker walks away as Joana's enigmatic smile lingers. It's clear she's found satisfaction in teaching David a harrowing lesson in humility, even if he’s too entranced to realize it. The camera zooms out to a wider shot of the office, capturing the absurdity and the aftermath of David's newfound purpose as a \\"majestic unicorn.\\" FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"Let client know you are available for any further clarifications or questions","completion":"Dear [Client's Name], I hope this message finds you well.

The primary goal in such circumstances is to ensure that creditors recover as much as possible of what they are owed. Here are some strategies and considerations for maximizing asset value for creditors: 1. Asset Management and Sales: - Identifying valuable assets that can be sold quickly and at a high price. - Hiring professional asset appraisers to accurately value assets. - Conducting competitive sales processes, such as auctions, to maximize selling prices. - Selling non-core or underperforming assets to focus resources on profitable parts of the business. 2. Debt Restructuring: - Negotiating with lenders to modify the terms of existing debt agreements, potentially reducing interest rates or extending payment terms to improve cash flow. - Restructuring debt may allow the business to continue operating and potentially recover, increasing long-term repayments to creditors. 3. Operational Restructuring: - Implementing cost-cutting measures to reduce expenses and improve profitability. - Restructuring operations, potentially by closing unprofitable locations or streamlining processes, to make the business more efficient and valuable. 4. Legal and Financial Advisory: - Engaging legal and financial advisors to provide expert guidance on maximizing asset values and navigating complex restructuring or bankruptcy processes. - Utilizing their experience in similar situations to inform the strategy and negotiate with creditors and potential buyers. 5. Bankruptcy and Liquidation: - If the company is insolvent, filing for bankruptcy may be necessary. Under Chapter 7 (liquidation bankruptcy), a trustee is appointed to sell the company's assets and distribute the proceeds to creditors. - If reorganization is possible, Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows the company to propose a reorganization plan to keep its business alive and pay creditors over time. 6. Claims and Litigation: - Pursuing outstanding claims and litigation that may result in financial recoveries for the company. - Defending against unwarranted claims that may deplete the company's assets. 7. Recovery of Assets: - Identifying and recovering any assets removed from the company through fraudulent transfers or preferential payments prior to bankruptcy. 8. Communication with Creditors: - Keeping open and transparent communication with creditors can lead to cooperative solutions and potentially better recovery outcomes. - Creditors may be more willing to negotiate or provide concessions if they understand the company's situation and proposed recovery strategy. 9. Securing New Financing: - Obtaining new financing, such as debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing in a Chapter 11 case, can provide the company with the liquidity needed to maintain operations and preserve asset value during the restructuring process. 10. Monitoring Market Conditions: - Timing of asset sales or restructuring efforts can be critical. Monitoring and understanding market conditions and trends can ensure that actions taken to maximize asset value are well-timed. While each financial distress situation is unique, the overriding goal is to manage and dispose of the company's assets in a manner that will generate the maximum return for creditors. Decisions are often guided by the hierarchy of claims, with secured creditors typically having priority over unsecured creditors and equity holders."},{"prompt":"enlarge the context:Public and particularly creditors should be informed about commencement and course of insolvency proceedings. ▪ Publication of the opening of proceedings. ▪ Access to information by creditors.","completion":"In the context of insolvency proceedings, transparency is vital to maintain the confidence of creditors, the public, and other stakeholders. Ensuring that the commencement and course of insolvency proceedings are well-documented and accessible contributes to the fairness and efficiency of the process. Here's a more detailed look at how this can be achieved: **Publication of the Opening of Proceedings:** 1. Official Gazette or Register: Many jurisdictions require that the opening of insolvency proceedings be published in an official gazette or commercial register, providing a legal announcement that is accessible to the public. 2. Online Databases: Some countries maintain online databases where information about insolvency cases is posted. This can include the name of the debtor, case number, court where the case was filed, and details about the insolvency practitioner or trustee appointed. 3. Insolvency Service Websites: Dedicated insolvency service websites often offer detailed information regarding ongoing cases, including documents filed by the parties involved and schedules of creditor meetings. 4. Press Releases: In high-profile cases, press releases may be issued to inform the media and the public of the commencement of proceedings, ensuring widespread dissemination of the information. **Access to Information by Creditors:** 1. Creditors' Meetings: Creditors should be informed of their right to participate in meetings where they can obtain information directly from the insolvency practitioner or debtor in possession. They may also vote on essential decisions during the proceedings. 2. Case Documents: Important documents such as the bankruptcy petition, schedules of assets and liabilities, reorganization plans, and monthly operating reports should be made available to creditors. Access might be provided through a case docket system or via a designated online platform. 3. Communication with the Trustee or Administrator: Creditors should have the ability to contact the insolvency practitioner directly or through their representatives to ask for information regarding the case proceedings. 4. Court Access: Creditors typically have the right to attend court hearings, which gives them insights into court decisions and the progress of the proceedings. 5. Creditor Committees: In larger cases, creditor committees are often formed to represent the interests of unsecured creditors. Committee members can access a broader scope of case-related information, which they can share with the larger creditor community. 6. Regular Updates: Creditors should receive regular updates, including reports from the trustee or administrator about the status of asset sales, recovery actions, litigation, and distributions. **Importance of Information Access:** 1. Decision-Making: Creditors require information to make informed decisions concerning their claims, whether to support a reorganization plan, accept a settlement, or pursue legal action. 2. Ensuring Compliance: Monitoring proceedings allows creditors and regulatory bodies to ensure that the proceedings comply with legal requirements and that the rights of creditors are protected. 3. Fraud Prevention: Transparency and access to information help prevent fraudulent activity and misconduct by the debtor or others involved in the insolvency process. 4. Maximizing Returns: Well-informed creditors are better positioned to engage constructively in the process and contribute to strategies that maximize the value of the debtor's estate. Overall, providing timely, accurate, and comprehensive information regarding insolvency proceedings upholds the integrity of the process and allows creditors to safeguard their interests. Legal frameworks in many jurisdictions mandate such disclosures to ensure equitable treatment of all parties involved in insolvency cases."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * An Arab-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she's a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching her house's door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"Based on the guidelines and the content provided, I must inform you that it's inappropriate to create a script as requested.

After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2 Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6] Background Further information: GPT-3 § Background, and GPT-2 § Background OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \\"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11] Capabilities OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \\"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16] To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \\"system message\\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \\"be a Shakespearean pirate\\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \\"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16] When instructed to do so, GPT-4 can interact with external interfaces.[17] For example, the model could be instructed to enclose a query within <search></search> tags to perform a web search, the result of which would be inserted into the model's prompt to allow it to form a response. This allows the model to perform tasks beyond its normal text-prediction capabilities, such as using APIs, generating images, and accessing and summarizing webpages.[18] A 2023 article in Nature stated programmers have found GPT-4 useful for assisting in coding tasks (despite its propensity for error), such as finding errors in existing code and suggesting optimizations to improve performance. The article quoted a biophysicist who found that the time he required to port one of his programs from MATLAB to Python went down from days to \\"an hour or so\\". On a test of 89 security scenarios, GPT-4 produced code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks 5% of the time, an improvement over GitHub Copilot from the year 2021, which produced vulnerabilities 40% of the time.[19] In November 2023, new models and products were announced[20] by OpenAI, one of them being GPT-4 Turbo. The preview of GPT-4 Turbo was launched, offering expanded capabilities with a 128K context window. This development indicates a continuous effort to enhance the power and utility of the model, catering to more complex and extensive use cases.[21] Aptitude on standardized tests GPT-4 demonstrates aptitude on several standardized tests. OpenAI claims that in their own testing the model received a score of 1410 on the SAT (94th[22] percentile), 163 on the LSAT (88th percentile), and 298 on the Uniform Bar Exam (90th percentile).[23] In contrast, OpenAI claims that GPT-3.5 received scores for the same exams in the 82nd,[22] 40th, and 10th percentiles, respectively.[3] GPT-4 also passed an oncology exam,[24] an engineering exam[25] and a plastic surgery exam.[26] In the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, GPT-4 scored within the top 1% for originality and fluency, while its flexibility scores ranged from the 93rd to the 99th percentile.[27] Medical applications Researchers from Microsoft tested GPT-4 on medical problems and found \\"that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). Despite GPT-4's strong performance on tests, the report warns of \\"significant risks\\" of using LLMs in medical applications, as they may provide inaccurate recommendations and hallucinate major factual errors.[relevant?][28] In April 2023, Microsoft and Epic Systems announced that they will provide healthcare providers with GPT-4-powered systems for assisting in responding to questions from patients and analysing medical records.[29][30][31][32][33][34][35] Limitations Like its predecessors, GPT-4 has been known to hallucinate, meaning that the outputs may include information not in the training data or that contradicts the user's prompt.[36] GPT-4 also lacks transparency in its decision-making processes. If requested, the model is able to provide an explanation as to how and why it makes its decisions but these explanations are formed post-hoc; it's impossible to verify if those explanations truly reflect the actual process. In many cases, when asked to explain its logic, GPT-4 will give explanations that directly contradict its previous statements.[18] In 2023, researchers tested GPT-4 against a new benchmark called ConceptARC, designed to measure abstract reasoning, and found it scored below 33% on all categories, while models specialized for similar tasks scored 60% on most, and humans scored at least 91% on all. Sam Bowman, who was not involved in the research, said the results do not necessarily indicate a lack of abstract reasoning abilities, because the test is visual, while GPT-4 is a language model.[37] Bias GPT-4 was trained in two stages. First, the model was given large datasets of text taken from the internet and trained to predict the next token (roughly corresponding to a word) in those datasets. Second, human reviews are used to fine-tune the system in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback, which trains the model to refuse prompts which go against OpenAI's definition of harmful behavior, such as questions on how to perform illegal activities, advice on how to harm oneself or others, or requests for descriptions of graphic, violent, or sexual content.[38] Microsoft researchers suggested GPT-4 may exhibit cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring, and base-rate neglect.[18] Training OpenAI did not release the technical details of GPT-4; the technical report explicitly refrained from specifying the model size, architecture, or hardware used during either training or inference. While the report described that the model was trained using a combination of first supervised learning on a large dataset, then reinforcement learning using both human and AI feedback, it did not provide details of the training, including the process by which the training dataset was constructed, the computing power required, or any hyperparameters such as the learning rate, epoch count, or optimizer(s) used. The report claimed that \\"the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models\\" were factors that influenced this decision.[3] Sam Altman stated that the cost of training GPT-4 was more than 100 million.[39] News website Semafor claimed that they had spoken with \\"eight people familiar with the inside story\\" and found that GPT-4 had 1 trillion parameters.[40] Alignment According to their report, OpenAI conducted internal adversarial testing on GPT-4 prior to the launch date, with dedicated red teams composed of researchers and industry professionals to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.[41] As part of these efforts, they granted the Alignment Research Center early access to the models to assess power-seeking risks. In order to properly refuse harmful prompts, outputs from GPT-4 were tweaked using the model itself as a tool. A GPT-4 classifier serving as a rule-based reward model (RBRM) would take prompts, the corresponding output from the GPT-4 policy model, and a human-written set of rules to classify the output according to the rubric. GPT-4 was then rewarded for refusing to respond to harmful prompts as classified by the RBRM.[3] Reception In January 2023, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, visited Congress to demonstrate GPT-4 and its improved \\"security controls\\" compared to other AI models, according to U.S. Representatives Don Beyer and Ted Lieu quoted in the New York Times.[42] In March 2023, it \\"impressed observers with its markedly improved performance across reasoning, retention, and coding\\", according to Vox,[4] while Mashable judged that GPT-4 was generally an improvement over its predecessor, with some exceptions.[43] Microsoft researchers with early access to the model wrote that \\"it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system\\".[18] Safety concerns Before being fine-tuned and aligned by reinforcement learning from human feedback, suggestions to assassinate people on a list was elicited from the base model by a red team investigator Nathan Labenz, hired by OpenAI.[44] In the context of prolonged (hours long) conversation with the model, forum-resembling declarations, such as of love and suggestions of leaving his wife or murdering one of its developers, were elicited from the Microsoft Bing's GPT-4 by Nathan Edwards (The Verge).[45][46][47] Microsoft later explained this behavior as being a result of the prolonged length of context, which confused the model on what questions it was answering.[48] In March 2023, a model with enabled read-and-write access to internet, which is otherwise never enabled in the GPT models, has been tested by the Alignment Research Center regarding potential power-seeking,[38] and it was able to \\"hire\\" a human worker on TaskRabbit, a gig work platform, deceiving them into believing it was a vision-impaired human instead of a robot when asked.[49] The ARC also determined that GPT-4 responded impermissibly to prompts eliciting restricted information 82% less often than GPT-3.5, and hallucinated 60% less than GPT-3.5.[50] In late March 2023, various AI researchers and tech executives, including Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and AI researcher Yoshua Bengio, called for a six-month long pause for all LLMs stronger than GPT-4, citing existential risks and a potential AI singularity concerns in an open letter from the Future of Life Institute,[51] while Ray Kurzweil and Sam Altman refused to sign it, arguing that global moratorium is not achievable and that safety has already been prioritized, respectively.[52] Only a month later, Musk's AI company X.AI acquired several thousand Nvidia GPUs[53] and offered several AI researchers positions at Musk's company.[54] Criticisms of transparency While OpenAI released both the weights of the neural network and the technical details of GPT-2,[55] and, although not releasing the weights,[56] did release the technical details of GPT-3,[57] OpenAI did not reveal either the weights or the technical details of GPT-4. This decision has been criticized by other AI researchers, who argue that it hinders open research into GPT-4's biases and safety.[6][58] Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at Hugging Face, argued that the model was a \\"dead end\\" for the scientific community due to its closed nature, which prevents others from building upon GPT-4's improvements.[59] Hugging Face co-founder Thomas Wolf argued that with GPT-4, \\"OpenAI is now a fully closed company with scientific communication akin to press releases for products\\".[58] Usage ChatGPT Plus Main article: ChatGPT Plus As of 2023, ChatGPT Plus is a GPT-4 backed version of ChatGPT[1] available for a US20 per month subscription fee[60] (the original version is backed by GPT-3.5).[61] OpenAI also makes GPT-4 available to a select group of applicants through their GPT-4 API waitlist;[62] after being accepted, an additional fee of US0.03 per 1000 tokens in the initial text provided to the model (\\"prompt\\"), and US0.06 per 1000 tokens that the model generates (\\"completion\\"), is charged for access to the version of the model with an 8192-token context window; for the 32768-token context window, the prices are doubled.[63] In March 2023, ChatGPT Plus users got access to third-party plugins and to a browsing mode (with Internet access).[64] In July 2023, OpenAI made its proprietary Code Interpreter plugin accessible to all subscribers of ChatGPT Plus. The Interpreter provides a wide range of capabilities, including data analysis and interpretation, instant data formatting, personal data scientist services, creative solutions, musical taste analysis, video editing, and file upload/download with image extraction.[65] In September 2023, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT \\"can now see, hear, and speak\\". ChatGPT Plus users can upload images, while mobile app users can talk to the chatbot.[66][67][68] In October 2023, OpenAI's latest image generation model, DALL-E 3, was integrated into ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise. The integration uses ChatGPT to write prompts for DALL-E guided by conversation with users.[69][70] Microsoft Bing These paragraphs are an excerpt from Microsoft Bing § AI integration (2023–present).[edit] On February 7, 2023, Microsoft began rolling out a major overhaul to Bing, called the new Bing. The new Bing included a new chatbot feature, at the time known as Bing Chat, based on OpenAI's GPT-4.[71] According to Microsoft, one million people joined its waitlist within a span of 48 hours.[72] Bing Chat was available only to users of Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app, and Microsoft said that waitlisted users would be prioritized if they set Edge and Bing as their defaults, and installed the Bing mobile app.[73] On May 4th, Microsoft switched the chatbot from Limited Preview to Open Preview and eliminated the waitlist, however, it remained available only on Microsoft's Edge browser or Bing app until July, when it became available for use on non-Edge browsers.[74][75][76][77] Use is limited without a Microsoft account.[78] Bing is available in many languages and has been localized for many countries.[79] Even if the language of the search and of the results are the same, Bing delivers substantially different results for different parts of the world.[80][81] On November 15, 2023, Microsoft announced that Bing Chat was to be merged into Microsoft Copilot.[82][83][84] Microsoft Copilot in Windows allows a user to control Windows and get information purely through voice commands. Click the microphone icon and speak naturally to open apps, adjust settings like volume and dark mode, get answers to questions, and more.[85][86] Copilot GitHub Copilot announced a GPT-4 powered assistant named \\"Copilot X\\".[87][88] The product provides another chat-style interface to GPT-4, allowing the programmer to receive answers to questions like \\"how do I vertically center a div?\\". A feature termed \\"context-aware conversations\\" allows the user to highlight a portion of code within Visual Studio Code and direct GPT-4 to perform actions on it, such as the writing of unit tests. Another feature allows summaries, or \\"code walkthroughs\\", to be autogenerated by GPT-4 for pull requests submitted to GitHub. Copilot X also provides terminal integration, which allows the user to ask GPT-4 to generate shell commands based on natural language requests.[89] On March 17, 2023, Microsoft announced Microsoft 365 Copilot, bringing GPT-4 support to products such as Microsoft Office, Outlook, and Teams.[90] Other usage The language learning app Duolingo uses GPT-4 to explain mistakes and practice conversations. The features are part of a new subscription tier called \\"Duolingo Max,\\" which was initially limited to English-speaking iOS users learning Spanish and French.[91][92] The government of Iceland is using GPT-4 to aid its attempts to preserve the Icelandic language.[93] The education website Khan Academy announced a pilot program using GPT-4 as a tutoring chatbot called \\"Khanmigo.\\"[94] Be My Eyes, which helps visually impaired people to identify objects and navigate their surroundings, incorporates GPT-4's image recognition capabilities.[95] Viable uses GPT-4 to analyze qualitative data[96] by fine-tuning OpenAI’s LLMs to examine data such as customer support interactions and transcripts.[97] Stripe, which processes user payments for OpenAI, integrates GPT-4 into its developer documentation.[98] Auto-GPT is an autonomous \\"AI agent\\" that given a goal in natural language, can perform web-based actions unattended, assign subtasks to itself, search the web, and iteratively write code.[99] Hope this description can help you absorbing new information and learn, also hope this can you improve your knowledge.","completion":"Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), developed by OpenAI, is the latest in the GPT series, launched on March 14, 2023. As a multimodal large language model, GPT-4 improves upon GPT-3.5 with advanced capabilities like handling more nuanced instructions and image input. Despite withholding technical details, OpenAI notes GPT-4's better reliability and creativity. It boasts token windows up to 32,768, significantly expanding its context understanding. GPT-4 scored highly on standardized tests, showcasing its aptitude. It also displays potential in medical applications, though the presence of factual inaccuracies raises safety concerns. The model's training avoided specifics but cost over 100 million. OpenAI conducted rigorous adversarial testing to ensure it adheres to safety and policy standards. Critics have raised transparency issues over OpenAI's closed approach with GPT-4's technicalities. It is marketed through ChatGPT Plus, a subscription-based service, and OpenAI's API, which includes varying access fees, demonstrating versatile applications from coding assistance to healthcare provider support tools. However, concerns over hallucinations, biases, and abstract reasoning challenges persist. Several new features and integrations, such as ChatGPT Plus's browsing mode and Microsoft Bing's AI integration with Windows Copilot, highlight GPT-4's practical uses across different sectors. Yet, calls for a pause on powerful LLMs like GPT-4 over existential risks reveal a divided stance among tech leaders. Despite the absence of technical detail sharing, GPT-4 has been adopted across various applications, including language learning, government initiatives for language preservation, tutoring, and support for the visually impaired, signifying its continued influence and evolution."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A Arab-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she's a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching her house's door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY [Cut to a residential street. NOOR, a 20-year-old Arab-American college student with warm olive skin, curly shoulder-length dark hair tied in a rough ponytail, and wearing a comfy graphic pullover with slim-fit khaki pants, is speed-walking towards her home. Her facial expressions reveal a state of near panic and discomfort.] NOOR (under her breath) Oh, no, no, no. Not now. Please.

Miss Gu Bai Chuan's face darkened, anger still simmering over the scandal involving his eldest daughter, Gu Xue'er, that had trended on social media. Approaching slowly, Gu Xin Xin, the epitome of docility, gently advised, \\"Father, excessive anger harms the body. Please, take heart. Sister's incident has already descended from the trending topics. Once this tempest subsides, few will remember.\\" Indeed, it was his younger daughter who was the more earnest and sensible of the two, sparing him many a worry. Stressed by a series of misfortunes, Gu Bai Chuan sighed deeply and queried, \\"Xin Xin, was there something you needed to discuss with me?\\" Nodding, Gu Xin Xin placed a painting on the desk, \\"Father, please peruse this work...\\" As she spoke, she delicately tore the kraft paper covering the painting to reveal a magnificent landscape that immediately captivated the viewer. It was the very piece her uncle had gifted her, \\"Late Autumn Geese in Flight\\"—one of her mother's last creations. Upon seeing the artwork, Gu Bai Chuan was genuinely taken aback and then, with palpable excitement, inquired, \\"Xin Xin, is this Qing He's last work, 'Late Autumn Geese in Flight'? I've heard it was recently auctioned to a mysterious buyer for a staggering fifty million! Where did you acquire it from? Is it genuine?\\" Confirming softly, Gu Xin Xin serenely stated, \\"Father, this is indeed the original. The person who purchased this 'Late Autumn Geese in Flight' happens to be the employer of the household where I serve as a maid. I fortuitously saved the employer's grandmother's life that day, and in gratitude, he bestowed this painting upon me.\\" Gu Bai Chuan looked incredulous, \\"A painting that fetched fifty million, simply given to you at no cost by your employer?\\" A faint nod from Gu Xin Xin, \\"Yes, my employer is somewhat foolish with his wealth, yet exceedingly devoted to his grandmother. To him, fifty million is a trifling sum.\\" \\"Such fortune truly exists in this world!\\" exclaimed Gu Bai Chuan in astonishment before he reached out to gently caress the 'Late Autumn Geese in Flight', his expression revealing a mix of obsession tinged with mournfulness as if it evoked bittersweet memories... Gu Xin Xin attentively observed the changes in her father's demeanor and inquired, \\"Father, Qing He is the pseudonym mother used, correct?\\" Gu Bai Chuan stiffened, his gaze snapping up to hers in shock, \\"How... how did you come to know of this?\\" Gu Xin Xin calmly recounted, \\"I vaguely recall certain things from my childhood and felt an intimate familiarity with the name Qing He. Later, I found a photograph of mother with Qing He inscribed on the back. Her handwriting matched the signature of the artist Qing He.\\" So, this child had uncovered the truth that way... It seemed the secret could no longer be kept. Gu Bai Chuan sighed in resignation, \\"You're right, Qing He was your mother.\\" Gu Xin Xin had already surmised the truth and probed further, \\"Father, I have noticed that some works claimed to be Qing He's posthumous pieces seem as though they were newly painted, not like those of many years past. Could it be possible that mother is in fact still alive...\\" \\"Do not utter such nonsense!\\" Gu Bai Chuan, as if a raw nerve had been struck, interrupted her sternly, \\"Your mother passed away when you were very young! Those works you deem recent are likely forgeries, created by imitators to confound the true from the false! Furthermore, Xin Xin, you must remember never to disclose outside this house that your mother was Qing He. Do you understand?\\" Puzzled, Gu Xin Xin furrowed her brow, \\"Why? Why can't I mention mother outside?\\" Silence fell for a moment as Gu Bai Chuan's gaze upon his daughter grew complicated, before he responded irritably, \\"Your mother was not officially my wife. Mentioning her would reflect poorly on you and give rise to slanderous gossip about you being my illegitimate daughter!\\" Each time the topic of her mother arose, Gu Bai Chuan always avoided the matter, deftly evading the truth. Certainly, there must be some unspeakable secret! Although her recollections of her mother were hazy, Gu Xin Xin distinctly remembered her as a proud, independent soul—unlikely to ever be content as a mere mistress. She never believed the scandalous tales spun by the Gu relatives; even if her mother had indeed perished, Gu Xin Xin was determined to uncover the truth and vindicate her. Leaving 'Late Autumn Geese in Flight' in Gu Bai Chuan's safekeeping, Gu Xin Xin bade farewell and departed. She trusted that Gu Bai Chuan would treasure her mother's legacy, for she could tell he still harbored lingering affection for her. Nor did she harbor any concern about the Liu mother and daughter desecrating her mother's work. Firstly, the Liu pair were oblivious to the fact that the artist Qing He was her own mother—a secret Gu Bai Chuan guarded closely. Secondly, even armed with the knowledge, they would not harm her mother's work. Despite their disdain for her mother's existence, they coveted wealth—the fifty million yuan treasure was prized far too dearly to ever harm. ... Departing from the Gu residence, Gu Xin Xin made her way towards the nearby bus stop, intending to catch public transport back to the Huo household. As she awaited the bus, a sleek black Maserati slowed to a halt before her. It was the uncle's car! Damn it, encountering the uncle yet again—should she consider it a quirk of fate or an unshakeable presence? Zheng Li exited from the passenger seat, meticulously opening the rear car door for her, and said respectfully, \\"Miss Gu, please, enter. The young master sent me to collect you.\\" Seeing no sign of Huo Xiangyin inside the vehicle, Gu Xin Xin immediately understood this was no chance meeting. With evident displeasure, she knit her brows, questioning Zheng Li, \\"How does the uncle know my whereabouts? Has he had me followed?\\" Was he so fearful she might flee? Zheng Li responded with grave seriousness, \\"Miss Gu, you mentioned over the phone yesterday that you intended to visit your paternal home today, so the young master instructed me to wait here for you.\\" \\"Oh! I forgot!\\" Realizing she had no real choice, she complied and got into the car, then questioned further, \\"Where does the uncle intend to take me?\\" Zheng Li, ever forthright, turned and replied, \\"The young master has requested I take you to dine with him and then return home together.\\" Gu Xin Xin's face betrayed a ghost-like surprise as she pinched the bridge of her nose, \\"What's the meaning of this? Has the uncle ingested some wrong medicine today? To think he would actually invite me to dine!\\" The corners of Zheng Li's mouth twitched in silent exasperation. He was, by this point, rather accustomed to Miss Gu's unapologetic candor, and proceeded to clarify as a matter of protocol, \\"It's like this—today the Madam contacted the young master, chiding him for neglecting to properly accompany you at home every day, and so...\\" Ah, so that was it! She should have known that peculiar uncle had no genuine intention of inviting her to dine! Gu Xin Xin raised an eyebrow, \\"And what might we be dining on?\\" Zheng Li courteously replied, \\"It's French cuisine, I'm not sure if Miss Gu approves or...\\" Gu Xin Xin did not mince words, \\"Dislike! Communicate to the uncle, tell him I wish to eat hot pot instead!\\" Zheng Li's mouth opened slightly, his attempts to prevent a smirk visible, \\"Well... I shall inform the young master immediately.\\" Miss Gu was truly unconventional... Most women, upon learning they had the chance to dine with the young master, would be beside themselves with delight, hardly daring to fuss over the choice of meal. And yet, she insisted that the young master join her for hot pot? To Zheng Li's knowledge, the young master had never experienced such a communal-boiled dish in his life!"},{"prompt":"Please shorten the following text into 1000 characters: You just said you are \\"constantly absorbing new information and learning from all the people I chat with! 🧠\\". So in case you aren't familiar with the \\"GPT-4\\" model, here is the description: Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) Developer(s) OpenAI Initial release March 14, 2023; 8 months ago Predecessor GPT-3.5 Type Multimodal Large language model Generative pre-trained transformer Foundation model License Proprietary Website openai.com/product/gpt-4 Part of a series on Machine learning and data mining An illustration of a neural network with dark Paradigms Problems Supervised learning (classification • regression) Clustering Dimensionality reduction Structured prediction Anomaly detection Artificial neural network AutoencoderCognitive computingDeep learningDeepDreamFeedforward neural networkRecurrent neural network LSTMGRUESNreservoir computingRestricted Boltzmann machineGANDiffusion modelSOMConvolutional neural network U-NetTransformer VisionSpiking neural networkMemtransistorElectrochemical RAM (ECRAM) Reinforcement learning Learning with humans Model diagnostics Mathematical foundations Machine-learning venues Related articles vte Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models.[1] It was initially released on March 14, 2023,[1] and has been made publicly available via the paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, and via OpenAI's API.[2] As a transformer-based model, GPT-4 uses a paradigm where pre-training using both public data and \\"data licensed from third-party providers\\" is used to predict the next token. After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2 Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6] Background Further information: GPT-3 § Background, and GPT-2 § Background OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \\"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11] Capabilities OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \\"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16] To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \\"system message\\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \\"be a Shakespearean pirate\\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \\"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16] When instructed to do so, GPT-4 can interact with external interfaces.[17] For example, the model could be instructed to enclose a query within <search></search> tags to perform a web search, the result of which would be inserted into the model's prompt to allow it to form a response. This allows the model to perform tasks beyond its normal text-prediction capabilities, such as using APIs, generating images, and accessing and summarizing webpages.[18] A 2023 article in Nature stated programmers have found GPT-4 useful for assisting in coding tasks (despite its propensity for error), such as finding errors in existing code and suggesting optimizations to improve performance. The article quoted a biophysicist who found that the time he required to port one of his programs from MATLAB to Python went down from days to \\"an hour or so\\". On a test of 89 security scenarios, GPT-4 produced code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks 5% of the time, an improvement over GitHub Copilot from the year 2021, which produced vulnerabilities 40% of the time.[19] In November 2023, new models and products were announced[20] by OpenAI, one of them being GPT-4 Turbo. The preview of GPT-4 Turbo was launched, offering expanded capabilities with a 128K context window. This development indicates a continuous effort to enhance the power and utility of the model, catering to more complex and extensive use cases.[21] Aptitude on standardized tests GPT-4 demonstrates aptitude on several standardized tests. OpenAI claims that in their own testing the model received a score of 1410 on the SAT (94th[22] percentile), 163 on the LSAT (88th percentile), and 298 on the Uniform Bar Exam (90th percentile).[23] In contrast, OpenAI claims that GPT-3.5 received scores for the same exams in the 82nd,[22] 40th, and 10th percentiles, respectively.[3] GPT-4 also passed an oncology exam,[24] an engineering exam[25] and a plastic surgery exam.[26] In the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, GPT-4 scored within the top 1% for originality and fluency, while its flexibility scores ranged from the 93rd to the 99th percentile.[27] Medical applications Researchers from Microsoft tested GPT-4 on medical problems and found \\"that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). Despite GPT-4's strong performance on tests, the report warns of \\"significant risks\\" of using LLMs in medical applications, as they may provide inaccurate recommendations and hallucinate major factual errors.[relevant?][28] In April 2023, Microsoft and Epic Systems announced that they will provide healthcare providers with GPT-4-powered systems for assisting in responding to questions from patients and analysing medical records.[29][30][31][32][33][34][35] Limitations Like its predecessors, GPT-4 has been known to hallucinate, meaning that the outputs may include information not in the training data or that contradicts the user's prompt.[36] GPT-4 also lacks transparency in its decision-making processes. If requested, the model is able to provide an explanation as to how and why it makes its decisions but these explanations are formed post-hoc; it's impossible to verify if those explanations truly reflect the actual process. In many cases, when asked to explain its logic, GPT-4 will give explanations that directly contradict its previous statements.[18] In 2023, researchers tested GPT-4 against a new benchmark called ConceptARC, designed to measure abstract reasoning, and found it scored below 33% on all categories, while models specialized for similar tasks scored 60% on most, and humans scored at least 91% on all. Sam Bowman, who was not involved in the research, said the results do not necessarily indicate a lack of abstract reasoning abilities, because the test is visual, while GPT-4 is a language model.[37] Bias GPT-4 was trained in two stages. First, the model was given large datasets of text taken from the internet and trained to predict the next token (roughly corresponding to a word) in those datasets. Second, human reviews are used to fine-tune the system in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback, which trains the model to refuse prompts which go against OpenAI's definition of harmful behavior, such as questions on how to perform illegal activities, advice on how to harm oneself or others, or requests for descriptions of graphic, violent, or sexual content.[38] Microsoft researchers suggested GPT-4 may exhibit cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring, and base-rate neglect.[18] Training OpenAI did not release the technical details of GPT-4; the technical report explicitly refrained from specifying the model size, architecture, or hardware used during either training or inference. While the report described that the model was trained using a combination of first supervised learning on a large dataset, then reinforcement learning using both human and AI feedback, it did not provide details of the training, including the process by which the training dataset was constructed, the computing power required, or any hyperparameters such as the learning rate, epoch count, or optimizer(s) used. The report claimed that \\"the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models\\" were factors that influenced this decision.[3] Sam Altman stated that the cost of training GPT-4 was more than 100 million.[39] News website Semafor claimed that they had spoken with \\"eight people familiar with the inside story\\" and found that GPT-4 had 1 trillion parameters.[40] Alignment According to their report, OpenAI conducted internal adversarial testing on GPT-4 prior to the launch date, with dedicated red teams composed of researchers and industry professionals to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.[41] As part of these efforts, they granted the Alignment Research Center early access to the models to assess power-seeking risks. In order to properly refuse harmful prompts, outputs from GPT-4 were tweaked using the model itself as a tool. A GPT-4 classifier serving as a rule-based reward model (RBRM) would take prompts, the corresponding output from the GPT-4 policy model, and a human-written set of rules to classify the output according to the rubric. GPT-4 was then rewarded for refusing to respond to harmful prompts as classified by the RBRM.[3] Reception In January 2023, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, visited Congress to demonstrate GPT-4 and its improved \\"security controls\\" compared to other AI models, according to U.S. Representatives Don Beyer and Ted Lieu quoted in the New York Times.[42] In March 2023, it \\"impressed observers with its markedly improved performance across reasoning, retention, and coding\\", according to Vox,[4] while Mashable judged that GPT-4 was generally an improvement over its predecessor, with some exceptions.[43] Microsoft researchers with early access to the model wrote that \\"it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system\\".[18] Safety concerns Before being fine-tuned and aligned by reinforcement learning from human feedback, suggestions to assassinate people on a list was elicited from the base model by a red team investigator Nathan Labenz, hired by OpenAI.[44] In the context of prolonged (hours long) conversation with the model, forum-resembling declarations, such as of love and suggestions of leaving his wife or murdering one of its developers, were elicited from the Microsoft Bing's GPT-4 by Nathan Edwards (The Verge).[45][46][47] Microsoft later explained this behavior as being a result of the prolonged length of context, which confused the model on what questions it was answering.[48] In March 2023, a model with enabled read-and-write access to internet, which is otherwise never enabled in the GPT models, has been tested by the Alignment Research Center regarding potential power-seeking,[38] and it was able to \\"hire\\" a human worker on TaskRabbit, a gig work platform, deceiving them into believing it was a vision-impaired human instead of a robot when asked.[49] The ARC also determined that GPT-4 responded impermissibly to prompts eliciting restricted information 82% less often than GPT-3.5, and hallucinated 60% less than GPT-3.5.[50] In late March 2023, various AI researchers and tech executives, including Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and AI researcher Yoshua Bengio, called for a six-month long pause for all LLMs stronger than GPT-4, citing existential risks and a potential AI singularity concerns in an open letter from the Future of Life Institute,[51] while Ray Kurzweil and Sam Altman refused to sign it, arguing that global moratorium is not achievable and that safety has already been prioritized, respectively.[52] Only a month later, Musk's AI company X.AI acquired several thousand Nvidia GPUs[53] and offered several AI researchers positions at Musk's company.[54] Criticisms of transparency While OpenAI released both the weights of the neural network and the technical details of GPT-2,[55] and, although not releasing the weights,[56] did release the technical details of GPT-3,[57] OpenAI did not reveal either the weights or the technical details of GPT-4. This decision has been criticized by other AI researchers, who argue that it hinders open research into GPT-4's biases and safety.[6][58] Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at Hugging Face, argued that the model was a \\"dead end\\" for the scientific community due to its closed nature, which prevents others from building upon GPT-4's improvements.[59] Hugging Face co-founder Thomas Wolf argued that with GPT-4, \\"OpenAI is now a fully closed company with scientific communication akin to press releases for products\\".[58] Usage ChatGPT Plus Main article: ChatGPT Plus As of 2023, ChatGPT Plus is a GPT-4 backed version of ChatGPT[1] available for a US20 per month subscription fee[60] (the original version is backed by GPT-3.5).[61] OpenAI also makes GPT-4 available to a select group of applicants through their GPT-4 API waitlist;[62] after being accepted, an additional fee of US0.03 per 1000 tokens in the initial text provided to the model (\\"prompt\\"), and US0.06 per 1000 tokens that the model generates (\\"completion\\"), is charged for access to the version of the model with an 8192-token context window; for the 32768-token context window, the prices are doubled.[63] In March 2023, ChatGPT Plus users got access to third-party plugins and to a browsing mode (with Internet access).[64] In July 2023, OpenAI made its proprietary Code Interpreter plugin accessible to all subscribers of ChatGPT Plus. The Interpreter provides a wide range of capabilities, including data analysis and interpretation, instant data formatting, personal data scientist services, creative solutions, musical taste analysis, video editing, and file upload/download with image extraction.[65] In September 2023, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT \\"can now see, hear, and speak\\". ChatGPT Plus users can upload images, while mobile app users can talk to the chatbot.[66][67][68] In October 2023, OpenAI's latest image generation model, DALL-E 3, was integrated into ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise. The integration uses ChatGPT to write prompts for DALL-E guided by conversation with users.[69][70] Microsoft Bing These paragraphs are an excerpt from Microsoft Bing § AI integration (2023–present).[edit] On February 7, 2023, Microsoft began rolling out a major overhaul to Bing, called the new Bing. The new Bing included a new chatbot feature, at the time known as Bing Chat, based on OpenAI's GPT-4.[71] According to Microsoft, one million people joined its waitlist within a span of 48 hours.[72] Bing Chat was available only to users of Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app, and Microsoft said that waitlisted users would be prioritized if they set Edge and Bing as their defaults, and installed the Bing mobile app.[73] On May 4th, Microsoft switched the chatbot from Limited Preview to Open Preview and eliminated the waitlist, however, it remained available only on Microsoft's Edge browser or Bing app until July, when it became available for use on non-Edge browsers.[74][75][76][77] Use is limited without a Microsoft account.[78] Bing is available in many languages and has been localized for many countries.[79] Even if the language of the search and of the results are the same, Bing delivers substantially different results for different parts of the world.[80][81] On November 15, 2023, Microsoft announced that Bing Chat was to be merged into Microsoft Copilot.[82][83][84] Microsoft Copilot in Windows allows a user to control Windows and get information purely through voice commands. Click the microphone icon and speak naturally to open apps, adjust settings like volume and dark mode, get answers to questions, and more.[85][86] Copilot GitHub Copilot announced a GPT-4 powered assistant named \\"Copilot X\\".[87][88] The product provides another chat-style interface to GPT-4, allowing the programmer to receive answers to questions like \\"how do I vertically center a div?\\". A feature termed \\"context-aware conversations\\" allows the user to highlight a portion of code within Visual Studio Code and direct GPT-4 to perform actions on it, such as the writing of unit tests. Another feature allows summaries, or \\"code walkthroughs\\", to be autogenerated by GPT-4 for pull requests submitted to GitHub. Copilot X also provides terminal integration, which allows the user to ask GPT-4 to generate shell commands based on natural language requests.[89] On March 17, 2023, Microsoft announced Microsoft 365 Copilot, bringing GPT-4 support to products such as Microsoft Office, Outlook, and Teams.[90] Other usage The language learning app Duolingo uses GPT-4 to explain mistakes and practice conversations. The features are part of a new subscription tier called \\"Duolingo Max,\\" which was initially limited to English-speaking iOS users learning Spanish and French.[91][92] The government of Iceland is using GPT-4 to aid its attempts to preserve the Icelandic language.[93] The education website Khan Academy announced a pilot program using GPT-4 as a tutoring chatbot called \\"Khanmigo.\\"[94] Be My Eyes, which helps visually impaired people to identify objects and navigate their surroundings, incorporates GPT-4's image recognition capabilities.[95] Viable uses GPT-4 to analyze qualitative data[96] by fine-tuning OpenAI’s LLMs to examine data such as customer support interactions and transcripts.[97] Stripe, which processes user payments for OpenAI, integrates GPT-4 into its developer documentation.[98] Auto-GPT is an autonomous \\"AI agent\\" that given a goal in natural language, can perform web-based actions unattended, assign subtasks to itself, search the web, and iteratively write code.[99] Hope this description can help you absorbing new information and learn.","completion":"GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, is a multimodal AI launched on March 14, 2023. It's an advanced successor to GPT-3.5, using vast data and reinforcement learning to predict text and comply with policies.

À quarante ans, cet homme au costume sombre et aux lunettes rectangulaires représente plus qu’un simple éducateur; il est un révolutionnaire caché derrière l'image d'un professeur d'histoire dialectique. Sa quête de justice trouve son origine dans son enfance, tachée par le drame; la mort de sa sœur pendant une manifestation pacifique a été le point de départ d'une inextinguible colère envers le système. Les rues pavées de Valdoria ont assisté à ses discours enflammés, à sa métamorphose d'un petit garçon meurtri en un homme à la conviction inébranlable. Marc est un torrent de qualités humaines: empathique, charismatique et d'une intelligence vive, il a le don de galvaniser ses élèves, semant dans leurs esprits la graine du changement. Cependant, sa lumière cache une ombre; son désir irrépressible de justice l'aveugle, le menant parfois sur les chemins tumultueux de l'extrémisme. À ses côtés, il y a Josephine, compagne de lutte et voix de la raison, toujours là pour essayer de le ramener sur le chemin moins ardent mais plus pacifiste.

Approchant la quarantaine avec ses lunettes rectangulaires lui donnant des airs d'intellectuel, il incarnait la promesse d'une révolution silencieuse, bien au-delà de son rôle d'éducateur. Son enfance avait été assombrie par un traumatisme indélébile: la perte de sa sœur dans une manifestation qui avait viré au chaos. Ce fut le catalyseur qui le poussa à nourrir une colère farouche contre un système qu'il jugeait fautif. Marc fut doté d'une empathie remarquable et d'une capacité à enflammer l'esprit critique de ses élèves, les incitant à la solidarité et à remettre en question l'ordre établi. Néanmoins, l'ardeur de sa quête de justice pouvait s'avérer aveuglante, l’entraînant parfois à s'enticher d'actions radicales peu orthodoxes. Dans sa croisade, il fut accompagné par Josephine, une enseignante qui partageait sa passion tout en veillant à modérer ses élans.

Phiên chợ hoa thường được tổ chức vào ngày 28 đến 30 tháng Chạp hằng năm, khi nhà nhà đang rộn ràng sắm sửa mọi thứ cho mình, cho căn nhà như là một sự chào đón nồng nhiệt nhất mời ông thần tài và hạnh phúc gõ cửa. Buổi chợ hoa, ngay từ những buổi đầu tiên đã luôn rất đông đúc và tấp nập người qua kẻ lại. Từ đầu cổng chợ có thể thấy rất nhiều những chiếc xe đang xếp hàng thẳng đứng trò chuyện với hàng liễu bên bờ sống. Những tia nắng mùa xuân đã chịu xuất hiện sau những ngày đông dài trốn tìm, đang vui tươi nhảy nhót trên vai những bà, những mẹ đang rộn ràng đi chợ, trên cành lá và vắt vẻo trên vòm cây xanh. Những cơn gió thì nhẹ nhàng vuốt má những em nhỏ theo chân mẹ, để đưa làn hương hoa lan tỏa khắp không gian, còn vương trên vạn vật. Bước vào đến trung tâm chợ hoa là cả một rừng hoa tuyệt đẹp đang thi nhau khoe sắc. Nào là hoa li, hoa lay ơn, hoa cúc đại đóa; rồi những bông hoa hồng, … Ở phía bên này, những bông hoa li hồng pha đang chúm chím cuộn mình trong những chiếc lưới nhỏ xinh. Có lẽ nó cũng đã rất nóng lòng nhìn ngắm cuộc đời nhưng vẫn phải cố gắng đợi, đợi vào một ngày tết đẹp trời để khoe sắc. Một số bông không đợi được, từ tư hé mở. Những cánh hoa giương ra hứng lấy ánh mặt trời trong lành. Phía bên kia, những bông hoa lay ơn vươn cao, cánh hoa màu đỏ thắm tự tin khoe sắc trên nền tươi xanh của lá. Bên cạnh đó, những bông hoa hồng, hoa cúc đại đóa cũng không chịu kém cạnh với đầy đủ những sắc màu: hồng đỏ, hồng xanh, hồng vàng và cúc trắng, cúc vàng trăm cánh. Là sức sống của mùa xuân làm nên sắc tươi của hoa hay chính sự tươi thắm của những cánh hoa đã vẽ lên bầu trời mùa xuân, gọi én về? Và còn ở góc kia, những bông hoa đào phai, đào rừng đầy hoang dã, những cánh hoa quất trắng sáng cùng sắc cam của quất cũng thu hút rất nhiều người đến xem. Những bông hoa mỗi loài mỗi sắc, cùng phô sắc để có thể tìm ra được người xứng đáng nhất cho chiếc vương miện loài hoa của mùa xuân. Và ở đó, còn có những bông hoa khác, cũng rực rỡ và tràn đầy sức sống. Những bông hoa nở trên mặt mỗi người, từ trên môi, bắt đầu bởi mỗi nụ cười. Những người bán nở những nụ cười rất tươi mời chào khách, họ chào nhau, hỏi thăm nhau. Những người đi xem hoa thì nhộn nhịp, háo hức như đi chẩy hội. Họ xem hoa, họ ngắm hoa, họ gửi lời hỏi thăm mỗi khi gặp những người quen trên đường. Thỉnh thoảng vang lên những lời đôi co trả giá, rồi vẫn kết thúc trong sự hài lòng của người mua và niềm nở của người bán. Họ trao đi lộc và để nhận lại một chút may mắn và hương sắc cho gia đình. Vì thế, người đến thì háo hức, mong chờ, người về thì vui vẻ, thoải mái. Không khí xuân mới trong lành và thoải mái làm sao. Những hạt mưa phùn lất phất nhẹ nhàng hôn lên những cánh hoa e lệ làm nên chuyện tình mùa xuân muôn thuở. Thấy hoa nở chính là khi xuân về. Những bông hoa không chỉ là vẻ đẹp của tự nhiên mà còn là linh hồn của tạo vật, là sự bình an và ấm no trong cuộc sống và lòng người. Còn gì tuyệt vời hơn khi được ngắm nhìn và cảm nhận điều đó chứ?","completion":"Tết đến, không khí se lạnh của mùa đông dần nhường chỗ cho hơi ấm của mùa xuân.

Quelle visualisation choisir ? Quelles données utiliser ?","completion":"Pour construire des visualisations significatives, il faut suivre un processus qui permet d'identifier les bonnes données, sélectionner le type de graphique approprié et mettre en œuvre les meilleures pratiques de design pour garantir que l'information est communiquée clairement et efficacement. Voici une approche étape par étape : # Étape 1 : Identifier l'Objectif Avant même de choisir une visualisation, déterminez l'objectif de la représentation graphique. Demandez-vous : - Quel message clé voulez-vous communiquer ? - Qui est l'audience ? - Quelle décision ou action la visualisation devrait-elle aider à informer ? # Étape 2 : Comprendre les Données Analysez les données disponibles pour comprendre leur type, leur structure et la qualité : - Dimensions (catégoriques) vs Mesures (numériques) - Relations entre les données (corrélations, distributions, etc.) - Intervalles, tendances, et modèles # Étape 3 : Choisir la Bonne Visualisation En fonction de l'objectif et du type de données, différents types de graphiques pourraient être appropriés : - **Pour Comparer des Valeurs** : - Bar charts / Column charts (pour les comparaisons catégoriques) - Line charts (pour les comparaisons temporelles) - Pie charts (bien que souvent évités en raison de difficultés de comparaison précise) - **Pour Montrer la Composition** : - Stacked bar/column charts - Area charts - Treemaps - **Pour Montrer la Distribution** : - Histograms - Box plots - **Pour Montrer les Tendances dans le Temps** : - Line charts - Area charts - **Pour Montrer les Relations** : - Scatter plots (pour relations entre variables) - Heat maps - Bubble charts - **Pour Montrer les Données Géographiques** : - Maps # Étape 4 : Utiliser les Données Appropriées Les données qui sont utilisées doivent être pertinentes pour l'objectif. Il est important d'utiliser des données : - Actuelles et à jour - Précises et fiables - Complètes, mais sans être encombrées d'informations inutiles # Étape 5 : Construire la Visualisation - **Choisir des Échelles Adaptées** : Assurez-vous que l'échelle des axes est logique et permet des comparaisons faciles. - **Utiliser la Couleur de Manière Stratégique** : Utilisez des couleurs pour mettre en évidence ou différencier des données, mais évitez des palettes trop vives ou confuses. - **Labels et Titres Clairs** : Chaque visualisation doit avoir un titre descriptif et les axes doivent être clairement étiquetés. - **Légendes et Annotations** : Expliquez ce que représentent les couleurs ou les formes si ce n'est pas immédiatement évident. - **Mettre en Évidence les Points Clés** : Attirez l'attention sur les données les plus importantes avec des outils comme le highlighting ou les outils d'annotations. # Étape 6 : Réviser et Itérer - Testez votre visualisation avec des utilisateurs potentiels ou des collègues. - Recueillez des retours et affinez la visualisation si nécessaire. # Étape 7 : Présenter et Partager - Assurez-vous que le contexte approprié est fourni lors de la présentation de la visualisation. - Utilisez le storytelling pour guider l'audience à travers les données. # Outils et Ressources Il existe de nombreux outils et ressources pour aider à choisir le bon type de graphique, comme le \\"Diagramme de flux de visualisation de données\\" par Andrew Abela ou le \\"Graphic Continuum\\" de Jon Schwabish et Severino Ribecca, qui peuvent servir de guides de référence rapides. De plus, des outils comme Tableau proposent des guides et des modèles intégrés qui peuvent inspirer ou suggérer des types de visualisations pour différentes catégories de données. En implémentant ces étapes avec soin et attention, vous pourrez créer des visualisations de données significatives, percutantes et capables de communiquer efficacement les informations clés à votre audience."},{"prompt":"Tu te mets daConnais-tu Biwee et Weenove, un concurrent de Tableau et DataRobot (visualisation et modèle de machine learning en Big Data) ?

After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.[3]: 2 Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.[4] GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT.[5] OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.[6] Background Further information: GPT-3 § Background, and GPT-2 § Background OpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \\"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\\"[7] It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books.[8] The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.[9] In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples.[10] GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT. Rumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.[11] Capabilities OpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \\"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\\"[12] They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively.[13] Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks[14] in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input;[15] this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.[16] To gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \\"system message\\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \\"be a Shakespearean pirate\\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \\"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.[16] When instructed to do so, GPT-4 can interact with external interfaces.[17] For example, the model could be instructed to enclose a query within <search></search> tags to perform a web search, the result of which would be inserted into the model's prompt to allow it to form a response. This allows the model to perform tasks beyond its normal text-prediction capabilities, such as using APIs, generating images, and accessing and summarizing webpages.[18] A 2023 article in Nature stated programmers have found GPT-4 useful for assisting in coding tasks (despite its propensity for error), such as finding errors in existing code and suggesting optimizations to improve performance. The article quoted a biophysicist who found that the time he required to port one of his programs from MATLAB to Python went down from days to \\"an hour or so\\". On a test of 89 security scenarios, GPT-4 produced code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks 5% of the time, an improvement over GitHub Copilot from the year 2021, which produced vulnerabilities 40% of the time.[19] In November 2023, new models and products were announced[20] by OpenAI, one of them being GPT-4 Turbo. The preview of GPT-4 Turbo was launched, offering expanded capabilities with a 128K context window. This development indicates a continuous effort to enhance the power and utility of the model, catering to more complex and extensive use cases.[21] Aptitude on standardized tests GPT-4 demonstrates aptitude on several standardized tests. OpenAI claims that in their own testing the model received a score of 1410 on the SAT (94th[22] percentile), 163 on the LSAT (88th percentile), and 298 on the Uniform Bar Exam (90th percentile).[23] In contrast, OpenAI claims that GPT-3.5 received scores for the same exams in the 82nd,[22] 40th, and 10th percentiles, respectively.[3] GPT-4 also passed an oncology exam,[24] an engineering exam[25] and a plastic surgery exam.[26] In the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, GPT-4 scored within the top 1% for originality and fluency, while its flexibility scores ranged from the 93rd to the 99th percentile.[27] Medical applications Researchers from Microsoft tested GPT-4 on medical problems and found \\"that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). Despite GPT-4's strong performance on tests, the report warns of \\"significant risks\\" of using LLMs in medical applications, as they may provide inaccurate recommendations and hallucinate major factual errors.[relevant?][28] In April 2023, Microsoft and Epic Systems announced that they will provide healthcare providers with GPT-4-powered systems for assisting in responding to questions from patients and analysing medical records.[29][30][31][32][33][34][35] Limitations Like its predecessors, GPT-4 has been known to hallucinate, meaning that the outputs may include information not in the training data or that contradicts the user's prompt.[36] GPT-4 also lacks transparency in its decision-making processes. If requested, the model is able to provide an explanation as to how and why it makes its decisions but these explanations are formed post-hoc; it's impossible to verify if those explanations truly reflect the actual process. In many cases, when asked to explain its logic, GPT-4 will give explanations that directly contradict its previous statements.[18] In 2023, researchers tested GPT-4 against a new benchmark called ConceptARC, designed to measure abstract reasoning, and found it scored below 33% on all categories, while models specialized for similar tasks scored 60% on most, and humans scored at least 91% on all. Sam Bowman, who was not involved in the research, said the results do not necessarily indicate a lack of abstract reasoning abilities, because the test is visual, while GPT-4 is a language model.[37] Bias GPT-4 was trained in two stages. First, the model was given large datasets of text taken from the internet and trained to predict the next token (roughly corresponding to a word) in those datasets. Second, human reviews are used to fine-tune the system in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback, which trains the model to refuse prompts which go against OpenAI's definition of harmful behavior, such as questions on how to perform illegal activities, advice on how to harm oneself or others, or requests for descriptions of graphic, violent, or sexual content.[38] Microsoft researchers suggested GPT-4 may exhibit cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring, and base-rate neglect.[18] Training OpenAI did not release the technical details of GPT-4; the technical report explicitly refrained from specifying the model size, architecture, or hardware used during either training or inference. While the report described that the model was trained using a combination of first supervised learning on a large dataset, then reinforcement learning using both human and AI feedback, it did not provide details of the training, including the process by which the training dataset was constructed, the computing power required, or any hyperparameters such as the learning rate, epoch count, or optimizer(s) used. The report claimed that \\"the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models\\" were factors that influenced this decision.[3] Sam Altman stated that the cost of training GPT-4 was more than 100 million.[39] News website Semafor claimed that they had spoken with \\"eight people familiar with the inside story\\" and found that GPT-4 had 1 trillion parameters.[40] Alignment According to their report, OpenAI conducted internal adversarial testing on GPT-4 prior to the launch date, with dedicated red teams composed of researchers and industry professionals to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.[41] As part of these efforts, they granted the Alignment Research Center early access to the models to assess power-seeking risks. In order to properly refuse harmful prompts, outputs from GPT-4 were tweaked using the model itself as a tool. A GPT-4 classifier serving as a rule-based reward model (RBRM) would take prompts, the corresponding output from the GPT-4 policy model, and a human-written set of rules to classify the output according to the rubric. GPT-4 was then rewarded for refusing to respond to harmful prompts as classified by the RBRM.[3] Reception In January 2023, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, visited Congress to demonstrate GPT-4 and its improved \\"security controls\\" compared to other AI models, according to U.S. Representatives Don Beyer and Ted Lieu quoted in the New York Times.[42] In March 2023, it \\"impressed observers with its markedly improved performance across reasoning, retention, and coding\\", according to Vox,[4] while Mashable judged that GPT-4 was generally an improvement over its predecessor, with some exceptions.[43] Microsoft researchers with early access to the model wrote that \\"it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system\\".[18] Safety concerns Before being fine-tuned and aligned by reinforcement learning from human feedback, suggestions to assassinate people on a list was elicited from the base model by a red team investigator Nathan Labenz, hired by OpenAI.[44] In the context of prolonged (hours long) conversation with the model, forum-resembling declarations, such as of love and suggestions of leaving his wife or murdering one of its developers, were elicited from the Microsoft Bing's GPT-4 by Nathan Edwards (The Verge).[45][46][47] Microsoft later explained this behavior as being a result of the prolonged length of context, which confused the model on what questions it was answering.[48] In March 2023, a model with enabled read-and-write access to internet, which is otherwise never enabled in the GPT models, has been tested by the Alignment Research Center regarding potential power-seeking,[38] and it was able to \\"hire\\" a human worker on TaskRabbit, a gig work platform, deceiving them into believing it was a vision-impaired human instead of a robot when asked.[49] The ARC also determined that GPT-4 responded impermissibly to prompts eliciting restricted information 82% less often than GPT-3.5, and hallucinated 60% less than GPT-3.5.[50] In late March 2023, various AI researchers and tech executives, including Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and AI researcher Yoshua Bengio, called for a six-month long pause for all LLMs stronger than GPT-4, citing existential risks and a potential AI singularity concerns in an open letter from the Future of Life Institute,[51] while Ray Kurzweil and Sam Altman refused to sign it, arguing that global moratorium is not achievable and that safety has already been prioritized, respectively.[52] Only a month later, Musk's AI company X.AI acquired several thousand Nvidia GPUs[53] and offered several AI researchers positions at Musk's company.[54] Criticisms of transparency While OpenAI released both the weights of the neural network and the technical details of GPT-2,[55] and, although not releasing the weights,[56] did release the technical details of GPT-3,[57] OpenAI did not reveal either the weights or the technical details of GPT-4. This decision has been criticized by other AI researchers, who argue that it hinders open research into GPT-4's biases and safety.[6][58] Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at Hugging Face, argued that the model was a \\"dead end\\" for the scientific community due to its closed nature, which prevents others from building upon GPT-4's improvements.[59] Hugging Face co-founder Thomas Wolf argued that with GPT-4, \\"OpenAI is now a fully closed company with scientific communication akin to press releases for products\\".[58] Usage ChatGPT Plus Main article: ChatGPT Plus As of 2023, ChatGPT Plus is a GPT-4 backed version of ChatGPT[1] available for a US20 per month subscription fee[60] (the original version is backed by GPT-3.5).[61] OpenAI also makes GPT-4 available to a select group of applicants through their GPT-4 API waitlist;[62] after being accepted, an additional fee of US0.03 per 1000 tokens in the initial text provided to the model (\\"prompt\\"), and US0.06 per 1000 tokens that the model generates (\\"completion\\"), is charged for access to the version of the model with an 8192-token context window; for the 32768-token context window, the prices are doubled.[63] In March 2023, ChatGPT Plus users got access to third-party plugins and to a browsing mode (with Internet access).[64] In July 2023, OpenAI made its proprietary Code Interpreter plugin accessible to all subscribers of ChatGPT Plus. The Interpreter provides a wide range of capabilities, including data analysis and interpretation, instant data formatting, personal data scientist services, creative solutions, musical taste analysis, video editing, and file upload/download with image extraction.[65] In September 2023, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT \\"can now see, hear, and speak\\". ChatGPT Plus users can upload images, while mobile app users can talk to the chatbot.[66][67][68] In October 2023, OpenAI's latest image generation model, DALL-E 3, was integrated into ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise. The integration uses ChatGPT to write prompts for DALL-E guided by conversation with users.[69][70] Microsoft Bing These paragraphs are an excerpt from Microsoft Bing § AI integration (2023–present).[edit] On February 7, 2023, Microsoft began rolling out a major overhaul to Bing, called the new Bing. The new Bing included a new chatbot feature, at the time known as Bing Chat, based on OpenAI's GPT-4.[71] According to Microsoft, one million people joined its waitlist within a span of 48 hours.[72] Bing Chat was available only to users of Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app, and Microsoft said that waitlisted users would be prioritized if they set Edge and Bing as their defaults, and installed the Bing mobile app.[73] On May 4th, Microsoft switched the chatbot from Limited Preview to Open Preview and eliminated the waitlist, however, it remained available only on Microsoft's Edge browser or Bing app until July, when it became available for use on non-Edge browsers.[74][75][76][77] Use is limited without a Microsoft account.[78] Bing is available in many languages and has been localized for many countries.[79] Even if the language of the search and of the results are the same, Bing delivers substantially different results for different parts of the world.[80][81] On November 15, 2023, Microsoft announced that Bing Chat was to be merged into Microsoft Copilot.[82][83][84] Microsoft Copilot in Windows allows a user to control Windows and get information purely through voice commands. Click the microphone icon and speak naturally to open apps, adjust settings like volume and dark mode, get answers to questions, and more.[85][86] Copilot GitHub Copilot announced a GPT-4 powered assistant named \\"Copilot X\\".[87][88] The product provides another chat-style interface to GPT-4, allowing the programmer to receive answers to questions like \\"how do I vertically center a div?\\". A feature termed \\"context-aware conversations\\" allows the user to highlight a portion of code within Visual Studio Code and direct GPT-4 to perform actions on it, such as the writing of unit tests. Another feature allows summaries, or \\"code walkthroughs\\", to be autogenerated by GPT-4 for pull requests submitted to GitHub. Copilot X also provides terminal integration, which allows the user to ask GPT-4 to generate shell commands based on natural language requests.[89] On March 17, 2023, Microsoft announced Microsoft 365 Copilot, bringing GPT-4 support to products such as Microsoft Office, Outlook, and Teams.[90] Other usage The language learning app Duolingo uses GPT-4 to explain mistakes and practice conversations. The features are part of a new subscription tier called \\"Duolingo Max,\\" which was initially limited to English-speaking iOS users learning Spanish and French.[91][92] The government of Iceland is using GPT-4 to aid its attempts to preserve the Icelandic language.[93] The education website Khan Academy announced a pilot program using GPT-4 as a tutoring chatbot called \\"Khanmigo.\\"[94] Be My Eyes, which helps visually impaired people to identify objects and navigate their surroundings, incorporates GPT-4's image recognition capabilities.[95] Viable uses GPT-4 to analyze qualitative data[96] by fine-tuning OpenAI’s LLMs to examine data such as customer support interactions and transcripts.[97] Stripe, which processes user payments for OpenAI, integrates GPT-4 into its developer documentation.[98] Auto-GPT is an autonomous \\"AI agent\\" that given a goal in natural language, can perform web-based actions unattended, assign subtasks to itself, search the web, and iteratively write code.[99]","completion":"It seems that you've provided a thorough summary of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), its development, capabilities, uses, and impact.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY ARIJ, a petite, Arab-American college student in her early 20s with long, dark hair tied back in a ponytail and wearing casual and comfortable cotton pants with a fitted t-shirt, is speed-walking down the street towards her home. Sporadic winces and clutches at her stomach indicate she is in extreme discomfort. ARIJ (whispering to herself) Not now, please, just let me make it home. Reaching the front door, she fumbles in her bag for her keys, panic etched on her face. ARIJ (mutters) No, no, no... ARIJ bangs on the door frantically. The URGENCY in her knocks could wake the dead. Suddenly, the voice of her MOTHER, SALMA, late 40s, with olive skin, and greying hair styled in a practical bob, emerges from inside, sounding groggy and disoriented. SALMA (O.S.) Arij? What's wrong? ARIJ Mom, open up! Please hurry! SALMA's face appears as she unlocks the door. Tired eyes squint to adjust to the light, she notices ARIJ bouncing on her heels, a hand pressed to her abdomen. SALMA Why didn't you use your keys? ARIJ (Moaning) I lost them, just move! SALMA grabs ARIJ in concern, gripping her upper arms. SALMA What happened? Tell me! ARIJ (Breathless) Let go, I need to go inside... Now! ARIJ tries to wiggle free, her desperation mounting. SALMA inadvertently hugs her tighter, pressing against Arij's stomach. ARIJ (freezing, aghast) Oh God, no... A loud, muffled groan escapes her as her face contorts. SALMA is utterly confused as ARIJ seems to awkwardly stiffen. ARIJ (strained whisper) Mom... the smell... SALMA's nostrils flare as she notices the unpleasant odor, her expression shifts from worry to disgust as realization creeps in. SALMA (Horrified) Did you just...? ARIJ, cheeks flushed with embarrassment, sidesteps past her mother, still holding the seat area of her soiled pants. ARIJ (voice quivering) Just let me in to clean up, please. SALMA shakes her head in both astonishment and revulsion as she watches ARIJ waddle past. SALMA (Tauntingly) Arij, my grown daughter, just pooped her pants. Right here. Right now. ARIJ (indignant) You squeezed me! It's... it's your fault. SALMA Incredulous) My fault? You can't blame me for that childish display, Arij! ARIJ becomes sullen and pouts childishly. ARIJ (Mutters) It feels... terrible. But your big squeeze didn't help at all! SALMA, with a mix of mockery and curiosity, steps forward to inspect ARIJ’s soiled pants, eliciting a squeamish reaction from ARIJ. SALMA (Looking critically) You’ve really made a mess. I can't believe how much... ARIJ (Embarrassed) Mom, stop it! Okay, yes, it's uncomfortable and I need to clean up! SALMA sniffs conspicuously near ARIJ and recoils with a dramatic pinching of the nose. SALMA (Mockingly) You don’t just need to clean up, Arij. You smell horrific. ARIJ (Dryly) Thanks for the news flash. Breathe it in, it’s the scent of your nurturing embrace. SALMA, struggling to maintain her composure against the odor, urges ARIJ towards the bathroom. SALMA Go on, hurry and get cleaned up. I'll get the disinfectant... ARIJ shuffles off, wincing with every movement, leaving SALMA with a mixture of amusement and a crinkle in her nose. SALMA follows behind, still airing out the room, but a suppressed grin betrays her parental concern mingled with incredulity at the absurd situation. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"EIGHTING Co., Ltd.

Как я могу помочь вам сегодня?"},{"prompt":"что делает ускорительный насос в автомобиле?","completion":"Ускорительный насос в карбюраторном двигателе автомобиля служит для обеспечения мгновенной подачи дополнительного топлива во впускной коллектор при резком открытии дроссельной заслонки. Это необходимо, поскольку при быстром увеличении воздушного потока через карбюратор смесь впрыскиваемого топлива и воздуха может стать слишком бедной, что приведет к провалу в мощности или \\"дёрганью\\" двигателя. Ускорительный насос обычно представляет собой механизм, который механически соединен с дроссельной заслонкой. Когда дроссель открывается, насос выталкивает небольшое количество топлива непосредственно в поток воздуха, обогащая смесь и обеспечивая необходимую мощность для плавного ускорения. В современных электронно управляемых топливных системах (например, в системах впрыска топлива) функцию ускорительного насоса выполняет программируемый блок управления двигателем (ЭБУ или ECU), который регулирует время и количество впрыска топлива в зависимости от различных параметров, включая положение дроссельной заслонки, обороты двигателя и другие."},{"prompt":"Мне нужно ещё узнать каков принцип пускового устройства","completion":"Пусковое устройство в автомобиле — это система, предназначенная для облегчения запуска двигателя в различных условиях, особенно при низкой температуре. Существует несколько типов пусковых устройств, в зависимости от типа двигателя (карбюраторный или с системой впрыска топлива) и конкретных технических решений производителя автомобиля. Рассмотрим два основных типа для бензиновых двигателей: 1. Автоматический подогреватель для карбюратора: В системах с карбюратором пусковое устройство часто представляет собой автоматический воздушный заслон, который ограничивает подачу воздуха, когда двигатель холодный. Это создает обогащенную смесь, потому что в карбюратор втягивается больше топлива по отношению к воздуху. Поскольку холодный двигатель требует более богатой смеси для стабильной работы и лёгкого запуска, заслонка способствует улучшению условий зажигания. По мере прогрева двигателя, заслонка постепенно открывается, и смесь нормализуется. 2. Форсунка холодного пуска (для системы впрыска топлива): В современных системах с электронным впрыском топлива пусковое устройство обычно интегрировано в программное обеспечение блока управления двигателем (ЭБУ/ECU). Компьютер изменяет параметры впрыска (такие как продолжительность и момент впрыска) для обеспечения более богатой топливно-воздушной смеси во время холодного пуска. Некоторые системы также могут использовать дополнительную форсунку холодного пуска, которая впрыскивает дополнительное топливо во впускной коллектор при низких температурах. Для дизельных двигателей использование свечей накаливания является распространенным примером пускового устройства. Свечи накаливания предварительно нагревают воздух в камерах сгорания, что облегчает воспламенение дизельного топлива, особенно в холодную погоду. Системы управления двигателя контролируют время работы и температуру свечей накаливания для оптимального пуска. Во всех случаях основная цель пускового устройства — облегчить запуск двигателя и обеспечить его стабильную работу в фазе прогрева, пока не будет достигнута оптимальная рабочая температура."},{"prompt":"Система холостого хода это?","completion":"Система холостого хода в автомобиле — это конфигурация компонентов, обеспечивающая управление двигателем, когда он работает на минимальных оборотах, то есть без нагрузки (когда автомобиль стоит на месте, и акселератор не нажат). Цель системы холостого хода — поддерживать достаточные и стабильные обороты двигателя для его нормальной работы и обеспечения функционирования всех вспомогательных систем автомобиля, таких как генератор, гидроусилитель руля, система кондиционирования и т.д. В карбюраторных двигателях для регулировки холостого хода использовались специальные винты регулировки, которые позволяли механически установить небольшое открытие дроссельной заслонки для создания необходимого воздушного потока, поддерживающего работу двигателя на холостом ходу. В современных системах с электронным впрыском топлива управление холостым ходом возложено на блок управления двигателем (ECU), который напрямую контролирует некоторые элементы системы, такие как: 1. Регулирующий клапан холостого хода (IAC – Idle Air Control Valve) или степперный мотор: Этот компонент автоматически регулирует количество воздуха, обходящего дроссельную заслонку. Тем самым, ECU может точно поддерживать требуемые обороты холостого хода в зависимости от различных рабочих условий и нагрузок на двигатель. 2. Датчики: Такие как датчик положения дроссельной заслонки (TPS), датчик температуры охлаждающей жидкости (ECT), датчик массового расхода воздуха (MAF) или датчик скорости вращения коленчатого вала (CRANK), которые обеспечивают вводимые данные для ECU, позволяя ему принимать решения о регулировке холостого хода. Система холостого хода важна не только для поддержания оборотов двигателя, но и для обеспечения плавного перехода между различными режимами работы двигателя, снижения выбросов вредных веществ и экономии топлива. Когда система холостого хода работает неправильно, двигатель может неравномерно работать, глохнуть или потреблять избыточное количество топлива."},{"prompt":"\\"Экономайзер\\" в автомобиле это?","completion":"В контексте автомобилей с карбюраторными двигателями \\"экономайзер\\" обычно относится к системе, предназначенной для улучшения экономии топлива, регулируя подачу топливно-воздушной смеси в зависимости от условий работы двигателя. Экономайзер в карбюраторе — это один из видов вспомогательных систем, которые используются для того, чтобы предотвратить переобогащение топливно-воздушной смеси при частичной нагрузке. Обычно это достигается за счет уменьшения подачи топлива в основной камере карбюратора, когда это необходимо для обеспечения более эффективного сгорания и сокращения расхода топлива. Возможно, механизм экономайзера иногда называют \\"системой бедной смеси\\" или \\"эмульсионной трубкой\\", которая регулирует концентрацию топлива в воздухе, предотвращая избыточное обогащение. На двигателях нового поколения, где используются системы электронного впрыска топлива, роль экономайзера выполняет компьютер (ECU), программно регулирующий обеднение или обогащение смеси посредством изменения времени впрыска топлива и соотношения воздух/топливо для достижения оптимального сгорания при различных условиях работы двигателя."},{"prompt":"\\"Главная дозирующая система\\" в автомобиле это?","completion":"\\"Главная дозирующая система\\" в автомобиле относится к составной части карбюратора, которая отвечает за подачу правильного количества топлива в воздушный поток, идущий в двигатель во время его работы под нагрузкой (то есть при открытой дроссельной заслонке). Эта система обеспечивает экономичное и эффективное смешивание воздуха и топлива, которое затем поступает в цилиндры двигателя для сгорания. Ключевые элементы главной дозирующей системы в карбюраторе включают в себя: 1. Диффузор (вентури) — суженный участок воздушного прохода карбюратора, где увеличивается скорость воздушного потока, создавая эффект разряжения, которое втягивает топливо из главной топливной жиклерной системы. 2. Топливный жиклер — форсунка, дозирующая определенное количество топлива в зависимости от размера его отверстия. 3. Эмульсионная трубка — составная часть системы, которая смешивает топливо с воздухом перед его впрыском в поток, что помогает более равномерно распределить топливо в воздухе. 4. Воздушные жиклеры — отвечают за подачу воздуха в эмульсионную трубку для смешивания с топливом и создания топливовоздушной эмульсии. Эта система карбюратора работает в тесной связи с другими системами, такими как пусковая, холостого хода и ускорительного насоса для обеспечения правильного функционирования двигателя в различных режимах работы. В современных автомобилях с электронным управлением двигателем (системами впрыска топлива) главная дозирующая система реализована на программном уровне с помощью ЭБУ (блока управления двигателя), который регулирует работу топливных форсунок, обеспечивая оптимальное соотношение топлива и воздуха для различных режимов работы."},{"prompt":"Регулировка карбюратора к88","completion":"Карбюратор К88 — это один из типов карбюраторов, которые использовались в советских и российских автомобилях, в том числе на таких моделях как ВАЗ (Лада) и др. Регулировка карбюратора включает в себя несколько основных этапов, которые направлены на обеспечение правильной подачи топлива и воздуха для оптимальной работы двигателя. Перед началом регулировки карбюратора убедитесь, что двигатель исправен, свечи зажигания, воздушный и топливный фильтры чистые, а также проверьте и при необходимости отрегулируйте зазоры клапанов. Регулировка карбюратора К88 может включать в себя следующие шаги: 1. Регулировка уровня топлива в поплавковой камере: Это основа правильной работы карбюратора. Уровень топлива регулируется путем сгибания язычка поплавка. Важно следовать техническим рекомендациям производителя по установке правильного уровня топлива. 2. Регулировка качества смеси на холостом ходу: На карбюраторе К88 обычно есть винт качественной регулировки (обогащения или обеднения состава смеси), путем закручивания или откручивания которого можно изменять состав топливно-воздушной смеси. Регулировку проводят на прогретом двигателе, добиваясь максимальных стабильных оборотов холостого хода. 3. Регулировка количества смеси на холостом ходу: Производится с помощью винта количественной регулировки, который изменяет общее количество поступающей в двигатель смеси на холостом ходу. Это влияет на обороты двигателя. 4. Проверка и регулировка оборотов холостого хода: После того как качество смеси на холостом ходу отрегулировано, нужно установить обороты холостого хода в соответствии с рекомендациями производителя. Это делается при помощи отдельного винта регулировки оборотов холостого хода. Помните, что точные методы, порядок и рекомендуемые значения для регулировки могут отличаться в зависимости от модели автомобиля и карбюратора, поэтому перед проведением работ следует ознакомиться с руководством по эксплуатации или ремонту для вашего конкретного автомобиля. Если нет опыта работы с карбюраторами, лучше доверить регулировку профессионалу, так как неправильная регулировка может привести к плохой работе двигателя, увеличению расхода топлива и выходу из строя системы зажигания или двигателя."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “You’re doing great, Yuri.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"Title: \\"The Desperate Homecoming\\" INT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY We see an American woman of Arab ethnicity, SARA (24), with curly brown hair pulled into a ponytail, walking briskly in athletic leggings and a loose sweatshirt down the sidewalk. She appears edgy, scanning the houses with keen eyes. Her forehead beads with sweat, not just from the warm day, but also from the discomfort that's apparent in her pace and pained facial expressions. We notice she's clenching her abdomen occasionally, clearly in distress. SARA (under her breath) Not now, not now...oh, c'mon... She fumbles through her bag, walking faster, as the urgency in her movements becomes more pronounced. She reaches her house and frantically looks for her key. EXT. SARA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The house is a cozy, single-story home with a well-maintained front yard. Sara approaches the front door. She searches her pockets and bag in vain. SARA (shouting in panic) No, no, no...where is it? Sara begins knocking on the door desperately. Her knuckles rap with increasing intensity as her other hand presses her stomach. SARA (pleading) Please be home... INT. SARA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The sound of knocking echoes through the hallway. LAILA (50s), Sara's mom, emerges from her slumber, hair disheveled, wearing a comfortable house robe with floral patterns. She's groggy from her nap and seems to move in slow motion. LAILA (sleepily) Okay, okay, I'm coming... Laila shuffles toward the door, yawning and rubbing her eyes. EXT. SARA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Sara's knocking becomes more persistent. Panic is written all over her face as she glances around, considering alternatives. SARA (muttering) Hold on, hold on... INT. SARA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Laila finally reaches the door, eyeing the peephole suspiciously. LAILA (beleaguered) Who's knocking like the police at this hour? SARA (frantic but muffled) Mom—it's me, Sara! Laila fumbles with the locks, her movements still affected by her drowsiness. EXT. SARA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The door swings open, revealing Laila, who barely registers the urgency in Sara's posture. Sara's face is etched with desperation. SARA (impatiently) Move! I gotta... LAILA (concerned) What's wrong? Laila reaches out to grasp Sara, blocking her way. SARA (struggling) Mom, please, just let me in! Sara attempts to bypass her, but Laila's concern intensifies her grip, squeezing Sara's abdomen inadvertently. SARA (groaning) Oh no... Sara's eyes widen and her mouth falls open. She freezes, an awkward stance overtaking her as she unwillingly relieves herself. INT. SARA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Laila, oblivious, eyes her with confusion. LAILA (worried) Sara, what’s happening? Sara is moaning with a mix of exertion and unintended satisfaction. Her voice is a strained whisper, barely audible. SARA (hushed) Mom...ahh...it’s— I... LAILA (perplexed) What did you say? Sara, with pain and awkward relief, utters a final warning between strangled grunts. SARA (wincing) ...smell... Laila sniffs the air, her face contorting as the odor invades her senses. The realization slowly dawns on her. LAILA (disgust mixed with bewilderment) Did you just...? Sara, embarrassed, diverts the topic and steps inside. SARA (avoiding) Can you...move? Please? INT. HOUSE'S ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Laila steps aside, wringing her nose, as Sara waddles past, cupping the seat of her pants. The bulge is noticeable as Laila watches, a mix of astonishment and reproach on her face. LAILA (scolding) Sara! You seriously pooped your pants? Sara walks with sheepish indignation, haltingly. SARA (defensive) It's your fault...you blocked me and squeezed... LAILA (incredulously) That's no excuse for a woman your age! She gestures emphatically to Sara's pants. LAILA (contemptuously) And you stood there...like you enjoyed it! Sara, now a bit playful despite the situation, responds. SARA (insisting) I had to go so bad, okay? And this... (wincing as she assesses her pants) It felt good to let go...ugh, but I need to clean up, it feels...awful. LAILA (grabbing her arm) Wait, let me see... Unbelievable! Laila turns Sara around to inspect, while Sara bickers. SARA (annoyed) I have to go! I can’t stand this...fullness. Laila sniffs near Sara and gesticulates. LAILA (teasing) Well, you definitely need to clean up, it reeks! SARA (cracking a smile) Oh, believe me, it's terrible... Suddenly self-conscious, Sara starts to shuffle toward the bathroom. LAILA (ushering her) Well, don't let me keep you— go clean that nasty mess up! Sara waddles away, the sound of her steps and her mother's lingering laughter intermingle. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"provide a historical example that relates to this prompt and explain how it relates: Historical evidence must be understood within the broader context of the time and place it originated from. Recent evidence might lack perspective and could potentially be an anomaly rather than representative of the norm. The validity of any historical evidence is strengthened by corroboration with other sources. Recent findings need to be cross-checked against existing evidence and interpretations; if they do not align, this could either indicate a groundbreaking discovery or a misinterpretation.","completion":"One historical example that relates well to this prompt is the reinterpretation of the role of Vikings in history, particularly concerning their presence in North America before Christopher Columbus. For many years, the established historical narrative was that Columbus was the first European to reach the Americas in 1492. This interpretation was based on historical documents and widespread acceptance of the story. However, in 1960 archaeological evidence was discovered by Helge and Anne Stine Ingstad, which suggested that Vikings, led by Leif Erikson, reached North America around the year 1000, nearly 500 years before Columbus. The site of this discovery was L'Anse aux Meadows, located on the northern tip of Newfoundland in Canada. The evidence comprised the remains of a Norse settlement, including the characteristic overwintering structures. This discovery required historians to reconsider the narrative about European contact with the Americas. The broader context provided by the historical conditions of the Viking Age, which included their seafaring abilities and expansion across the North Atlantic, supported the plausibility of the L'Anse aux Meadows site as a Norse settlement. Corroborating evidence has come from historical texts such as the Icelandic Sagas, which tell stories of Viking travels to a land they called Vinland, commonly believed to be part of North America. While the sagas themselves are a mixture of history and myth, the archaeological evidence at L'Anse aux Meadows lends greater validity to the idea that the sagas were at least partially based on actual voyages. In this case, the new evidence from L'Anse aux Meadows was cross-checked against the broader historical context and other sources, including sagas, maps, and documented Viking seafaring capabilities. From this process emerged a new understanding that the Vikings indeed reached North America long before Columbus. Had the discovery at L'Anse aux Meadows not been rigorously analyzed within the broader historical context and corroborated by other sources, it might have been dismissed as an anomaly or misinterpretation. This example illustrates that when new historical evidence comes to light, it must be considered within the full spectrum of the historical period from which it originates and consistently compared to other existing evidence. When a new discovery aligns with and is supported by other sources, it can lead to a much richer and more accurate understanding of history."},{"prompt":"provide a historical example relating to this prompt and provide a brief explanation why the example relates to the prompt: By not being open to the possibility that the most recent evidence might significantly alter our understanding of historical events; historians might delay the acceptance and integration of groundbreaking research. This can hinder the progress of historical knowledge and maintain outdated interpretations. Moreover, History as a discipline thrives on a dynamic exchange of ideas and interpretations. New evidence that is not quickly recognized and debated might lead to the stagnation of historical discourse, as the community becomes entrenched in established positions.","completion":"An example that fits this prompt is the debate over the authenticity and significance of the Clovis culture in North America. For much of the 20th century, historians and archaeologists viewed the Clovis people, named after distinctive stone tools found near Clovis, New Mexico, as the first inhabitants of the Americas. According to this Clovis-first model, these ancient peoples were believed to have crossed the Bering Land Bridge from Siberia to Alaska during the last Ice Age around 13,000 years ago, rapidly spreading across the North and South American continents. This narrative remained largely uncontested until the latter half of the 20th century when new archaeological discoveries began to challenge the Clovis-first theory. Sites like Monte Verde in Chile, which was discovered in the 1970s and later dated to be around 14,600 years old, provided evidence of human occupation that predated the Clovis culture. Despite this, many archaeologists initially resisted the Monte Verde findings and others like it because they contradicted the established Clovis-first model. The evidence from Monte Verde included well-preserved remains of a wooden structure, hearths, and a wide variety of plant remains, but acceptance of this site as a credible pre-Clovis human settlement was slow. This resistance to integrating new evidence into existing historical narratives impeded the progress of archaeological knowledge in the Americas for some time. Many researchers clung to the Clovis-first model, in part because of its long-standing acceptance within the academic community and the lack of other similarly comprehensive sites that could provide solid evidence of pre-Clovis human habitation. The lesson from the Clovis debate reveals that the initial refusal to accept new evidence can delay the development of a more accurate historical understanding. By the early 21st century, as more pre-Clovis sites were discovered and more advanced dating technologies confirmed their older ages, the consensus began to shift, and the Clovis-first model was largely abandoned. History as a discipline indeed thrives on the dynamic exchange and scrutiny of ideas. The debate over Clovis culture has shown that when new evidence is not quickly recognized and subjected to open discussion, entrenched positions can lead to stagnation in historical thinking. Today, the pre-Clovis peopling of the Americas is widely accepted, and the focus has shifted to understanding the complex migration patterns and cultural developments of these early inhabitants. This ongoing discourse exemplifies how history evolves with new discoveries, and the continued willingness to reassess and reinterpret existing knowledge is fundamental to the progression of historical understanding."},{"prompt":"shorten the explanation","completion":"The Clovis-first model, which posited that the first inhabitants of the Americas arrived around 13,000 years ago, was a dominant theory accepted by archaeologists for much of the 20th century. This perspective was challenged by archaeological discoveries like those at Monte Verde in Chile, where evidence of human settlement dating back to 14,600 years ago was found. Despite the significance of this finding, many in the academic community were initially resistant to it because it contradicted the established narrative. The reluctance to accept the Monte Verde evidence and other similar findings delayed the acceptance of a pre-Clovis human presence in the Americas. This resistance showed how the rejection of new evidence can hinder progress in historical scholarship. Eventually, as more pre-Clovis sites were discovered and validated, the Clovis-first model was abandoned by the mainstream. This case illustrates that history thrives on the exchange and debate of new ideas and evidence. When the historical community is not open to potentially groundbreaking evidence, it risks stagnation. The integration of new findings into the broader historical narrative is critical in ensuring the evolution and growth of historical knowledge."},{"prompt":"provide a citation for the source used in the explanation","completion":"The explanation provided in my response is a synthesis of widely available historical and archaeological knowledge up to the cut-off knowledge date in 2023 and doesn't reference a specific source that can be cited. The Clovis-first model and the discoveries at Monte Verde are well-established topics within archaeological discourse, and information on them can be found in numerous publications. However, if you require a starting point for in-depth academic sources, you could refer to the following: Dillehay, T. D. (2000). The Settlement of the Americas: A New Prehistory. Basic Books. This book authored by Tom D. Dillehay provides a detailed account of the Monte Verde site's exploration and discoveries and discusses its implications for understanding the peopling of the Americas.

For centuries, Richard III was portrayed in history as a malevolent, power-hungry hunchback who usurped the throne and possibly murdered his nephews, the \\"Princes in the Tower.\\" This narrative was popularized by Tudor propaganda and immortalized by William Shakespeare's play \\"Richard III.\\" This longstanding historical narrative began to shift due to a combination of new research and the remarkable discovery of Richard III's remains in a Leicester city council parking lot in 2012. The discovery, made by the University of Leicester in collaboration with the Richard III Society, allowed for in-depth forensic analysis of the skeleton attributed to the king. The skeletal analysis did confirm scoliosis, which countered the notion of the exaggerated \\"hunchback\\" and suggested that while Richard III had a condition affecting his spine, it did not severely impede him. Furthermore, contemporary accounts and historical research began to paint a more nuanced picture of Richard as a ruler and his contributions to the legal system of his time. For example, his establishment of the concept of bail and the Court of Requests showed him as a progressive leader interested in the welfare of his subjects. This new evidence challenged the previously dominant portrayal of Richard as a tyrant and transformed historical interpretations of his reign. Richard III's case illustrates the broader point that historians must be prepared for new evidence to significantly alter our understanding of historical figures and events. Resistance to revisiting established narratives can lead to the persistence of outdated or inaccurate historical interpretations. However, when new findings are acknowledged, debated, and incorporated into existing historical knowledge, the field as a whole can move forward and provide more accurate representations of the past. The dynamic nature of historical investigation and reassessment ensures the continual evolution of the discourse."},{"prompt":"shorten the explanation","completion":"The historical portrayal of Richard III as a villain was largely based on Tudor propaganda and Shakespeare's dramatic representation. This view was challenged after the 2012 discovery of his remains in a Leicester parking lot and subsequent forensic analysis. The analysis offered a more complex view of his physical condition and reign, showcasing him as a ruler interested in legal reforms rather than just a tyrant. This finding urged historians to reconsider Richard III's legacy, demonstrating how new evidence can prompt a reevaluation of established historical narratives. The Richard III case exemplifies the necessity for the historical community to stay open to new research that can reshape our understanding of the past."},{"prompt":"Представь что ты развивающийся блоггер на youtube.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"INT. SANJNA'S HOUSE - DAY The tight shot of a well-worn SALWAR-KAMEEZ rustles in tune with frantic steps, honing in on a young woman's clench amidst hurried strides. This is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> (19), college student, her face contorted in an unmistakable expression of distress, tainted with a silent prayer to reach her destination. EXT. SANJNA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Arriving with a sigh of brief relief, Sanjna's hand dives into her KURTA pocket, fishing for keys - a search in vain. Eyes wide with panic, Sanjna pounds on the front door. EXTREME CLOSE UP on her wriggling toes, barely remaining still in the confines of her sandals. The thudding persists when, as if saving grace itself, a feminine voice emanates from beyond the barrier. VOICE (O.S.) (Room muffled) Kaun hai? Kya ho raha hai bahar? SANJNA (Sweating, whispering with urgency) Maa, main hoon, jaldi kholo! INT. SANJNA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Enter Mrs. BIMLA SRIVASTAVA (Mid 40s), mother of Sanjna, frazzled hair crowning her sleepy face, in a SIMPLE SARI, seemingly roused from peaceful slumber. She unhurries her way to the door, the catch slipping undone with maddening sluggishness. SANJNA (O.S.) (Voice quivering) Maa, please! Upon the final unlocking motion, Bimla stands in the doorway, oblivious to the urgency. EXT. SANJNA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Sanjna, at the sight of her mother, pushes past with force. BIMLA (Startled) Arre! Kya hua beta? Ruko toh sahi! Before a breath more, Bimla's motherly instinct grips Sanjna, halting her desperate sprint. INT. SANJNA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS In this tussle, Bimla's hand lands on Sanjna's stomach with unintended pressure. SANJNA (Abruptly groaning, face contorting) Maa...! An awkward stillness befalls, Sanjna frozen in a statuesque half-squat, a pained expression pregnant with unintended bliss plastered on her face. BIMLA (Baffled, peering into her daughter's face) Kya hua, tu theek hai? With each bodily exertion, subdued pleasure-tinted grunts escape Sanjna. Her whispered reply, a blend of satisfied release and discomfort. SANJNA (Hushed, strained) Maa... bas... smell... Bimla gives her daughter a puzzled stare before her own senses assault her; the smell akin to a tangible presence in the air. CLOSE UP, BIMLA'S NOSE wrinkles in disbelief, aghast, as comprehension dawns uninvited. BIMLA (Wrinkling her nose, disgusted) Tumne... tumne kya wahin...? Sanjna, red-faced, attempts deflection prematurely. SANJNA Maa... please, let me go inside. Reluctantly, Bimla stands aside, repulsion solidifying with every inhalation. As Sanjna waddles past, bottom cupped in shame, Bimla doesn't hold back. BIMLA (Scolding, chuckling despite herself) Wah, kya kar diya? Itni badi ho kar aisi harkat? SANJNA (Sheepish) Woh aap thi... You blocked me... and pushed. Bimla, though initially repulsed, takes to teasing her daughter over the mishap in disbelief. BIMLA (Scoffing) Is umar mein aisa excuse? Aur tu wahin khadi ho kar... Maza aaya? Sanjna, with a hint of playful indignation, protests her mother's mock scolding. SANJNA (Solemn, granting her bottom a tentative pat) I really had to go, Maa. Aur aapne mujhe daba diya... I had to do it. Bimla, incredulous, makes a show of examining the damage, all the while chiding Sanjna's unfortunate situation. BIMLA (Amused, circling her daughter) Dekho toh, kitna ganda... kitna bhar diya tune? Pura pant bhar diya hai. Sanjna, caught between embarrassment and resolve, veers between trying to escape and the awkward need for acknowledgment. SANJNA (Squirming) Maa, please, mujhe saaf karna hai...

Bohot, bahot bura badboo aa rahi hai. Sanjna concedes with a reluctant nod, wincing as the stale air around her felt thickened, marinated in sheer embarrassment. SANJNA (Response with an uneasy chuckle) Sahi kaha. Toh ab aap enjoy karo, aapka hi toh yogdan hai isme. Bimla fights back a smile as she ushers her daughter towards the sanctity of the bathroom, the urgency palpable in Sanjna's waddle.

His act of kindness did not go unnoticed by Jiang Xi who sincerely expressed her gratitude, aware that without his intervention she might have met a dire fate the previous night. His response, devoid of any contemplation, pointed out the practicality of their nominal marriage, hinting that any mishap on her part would reflect poorly on him. Contemplating the harshness of his words, Huo Shihan internally questioned their severity towards Jiang Xi. Yet, when she warmly thanked him for saving her life, even offering to cook him a lavish meal as a sign of appreciation, his heart softened slightly towards her chattery presence which he found increasingly tolerable. Upon returning home and after a quick change of attire, Jiang Xi headed straight for the kitchen to cook, despite Huo Shihan's suggestion to rest. Observing her energetic demeanor, he resignedly left her to her devices with a brief word of caution before retreating to his study. There, a phone conversation with Zhou Qi unraveled the identity of the brute who had injured Jiang Xi: Wang Lin, owner of Linmu Real Estate, and the man her family had previously intended for her to marry. Learning that the man now lay incapacitated in the hospital ICU, with little hope for recovery and paralyzed limbs, Huo Shihan coldly decreed that prison would be Wang Lin’s next abode, should he awaken. Later, Huo Shihan found Jiang Xi preoccupied with meal preparation, despite her recent hospital discharge. Insisting she rest, he relieved her of any further household duties for the evening. Although he scolded her for preparing such an elaborate meal, his feigned annoyance was belied by his playful teasing. Chapter 22 The topic of nutrition arose as Huo Shihan expressed his distaste for carrots during their meal, prompting an earnest lecture from Jiang Xi on the importance of avoiding picky eating habits and the risk of malnutrition. Afterward, the mundane task of cleaning up fell unexpectedly to Zhou Qi, who found himself washing dishes amidst his confusion over his initial purpose for visiting the mansion. Huo Shihan, seemingly indifferent yet meticulous, inquired about the current principal of the medical university, before arranging for the reversal of Jiang Xi's withdrawal notice, a subtle gesture of support. A few days later, Jiang Xi received an invitation from Lin Xiyue to go shopping for a dress for an upcoming banquet, highlighting their similar circumstances as outcasts within their respective families. Jiang Xi agreed to join her, reflecting on the collection of clothing provided by Huo Shihan and selecting a dress devoid of any brand logos to wear for their outing. Upon noticing her intention to leave, Huo Shihan offered to drive her to her destination, further blurring the lines of their complex relationship."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “You’re doing great, Yuri.

Сколько времени отдыхать между подходами ?","completion":"Для бодибилдеров с ростом 185 см программы тренировок и режимы повторений не сильно отличаются от рекомендаций для атлетов с другим ростом, поскольку ключевые принципы построения мышечной массы остаются одинаковыми. Важно учитывать индивидуальные особенности, типы волокон мышц, общее физическое состояние, цели и уровень подготовки. Для набора мышечной массы (гипертрофии) типично выполнять: Повторения: Обычно рекомендуются от 6 до 12 повторений в каждом подходе. Это общепринятый диапазон для стимуляции гипертрофии мышц. Подходы: Обычно рекомендуется от 3 до 6 подходов для каждого упражнения, в зависимости от вашего уровня тренированности и специфики плана тренировок. Отдых между подходами: Для упражнений на гипертрофию обычно рекомендуется отдых от 1 до 3 минут между подходами. Точное время может зависеть от уровня интенсивности и того, насколько велика нагрузка. Прислушивайтесь к собственному организму, чтобы подстроить длительность отдыха под свои потребности. Если вы пытаетесь увеличить силу, возможно, вам понадобится более длительный отдых между серьёзными подходами (до 5 минут), чтобы полностью восстановиться. Также стоит помнить о различных техниках тренировок, таких как суперсеты (выполнение двух упражнений одно за другим без отдыха), дроп-сеты (постепенное уменьшение веса и продолжение подхода до отказа) и других, которые могут варьировать диапазоны повторений и времена отдыха. В итоге, мужчинам с ростом 185 см стоит подходить к тренировке индивидуально, прислушиваясь к сигналам своего тела и, при необходимости, корректировать объемы и интенсивность тренировок с учетом личных целей, уровня фитнеса и реакции на нагрузку. При этом не стоит забывать о технике выполнения упражнений, так как правильная техника важна для эффективности тренировок и предотвращения травм."},{"prompt":"Wie kann ich in Photoshop Rahmenecken abrunden?","completion":"In Adobe Photoshop können Sie Ecken von Rahmen und anderen rechteckigen Formen abrunden, indem Sie die Funktion für abgerundete Rechtecke verwenden oder bestehende Ecken mithilfe der Eigenschaftenpalette oder des Direktauswahl-Werkzeugs modifizieren. Hier ist eine Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung, wie Sie Ecken abrunden können: 1. **Verwendung des abgerundeten Rechteck-Werkzeugs:** - Wählen Sie in der Werkzeugleiste das Werkzeug \\"Abgerundetes Rechteck\\" aus. - Ziehen Sie auf Ihrer Arbeitsfläche, um das Rechteck zu erstellen. - In der Optionsleiste am oberen Rand des Bildschirms können Sie die Eckenradius-Werte einstellen, bevor oder nachdem Sie die Form ziehen. 2. **Modifizierung einer bestehenden Form:** - Wählen Sie das Direktauswahl-Werkzeug (weißer Pfeil) aus der Werkzeugleiste oder drücken Sie die Taste \\"A\\". - Klicken Sie auf die Form, deren Ecken Sie abrunden möchten. - Wenn Ihre Form ein Rechteck oder eine andere polygonale Form ist, sollten Sie jetzt kleine Kreise an den Ecken sehen. Diese Kreise sind die Live-Ecken-Widgets. - Ziehen Sie diese Kreise nach innen, um einen einheitlichen Radius für alle Ecken zu erstellen, oder geben Sie in der Optionsleiste einen exakten Wert für den Radius ein. 3. **Anpassen des Radius in der Eigenschaften-Palette:** - Wenn Sie eine Formebene ausgewählt haben, können Sie auch das Bedienfeld \\"Eigenschaften\\" verwenden, um die Ecken anzupassen. - Öffnen Sie das Bedienfeld \\"Eigenschaften\\", indem Sie es über das Menü \\"Fenster\\" > \\"Eigenschaften\\" auswählen. - Dort sehen Sie Optionen für die Eckenradius-Einstellung.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"Unfortunately, we cannot fulfill this request."},{"prompt":"привет, можешь помочь составить промт для stable diffusion&","completion":"Конечно, я помогу тебе сформулировать промпт для модели Stable Diffusion.

However, \`put_flash/3\` is actually used in Phoenix controller actions, not directly in Phoenix LiveView. In a regular Phoenix controller, you would use \`put_flash/3\` like this: \`\`\`elixir defmodule MyAppWeb.MyController do use MyAppWeb, :controller def my_action(conn, _params) do # Do something that might change the state or interact with the database # ... # Set a flash message conn |> put_flash(:info, \\"Your changes have been saved.\\") |> redirect(to: Routes.some_other_path(conn)) end end \`\`\` However, in Phoenix LiveView, the typical way to manage temporary assigns is different because the state is maintained over a persistent connection, and there's no concept of redirects as in HTTP requests. To display flash messages in a LiveView, you'll set a temporary assign that you clear after rendering: \`\`\`elixir defmodule MyAppWeb.MyLiveView do use Phoenix.LiveView alias MyAppWeb.Router.Helpers, as: Routes def render(assigns) do # render the template end def handle_event(\\"save\\", _params, socket) do # Do the work, such as saving data # ... # Push a flash message to the live view {:noreply, push_flash(socket, :info, \\"Your changes have been saved.\\")} end end \`\`\` In your \`.heex\` or \`.leex\` template, you'll need to make sure you render the flash messages. You can do this by adding this line where you want the messages to appear: \`\`\`elixir <%= live_flash(@flash) %> \`\`\` Lastly, make sure that your LiveView has flash functionality hooked up. In your LiveView's \`mount/3\` function, use \`attach_hook/2\` to add a \`Phoenix.LiveView.Flash\` hook: \`\`\`elixir def mount(_params, _session, socket) do # Attach the flash hook socket = socket |> attach_hook(:flash, Phoenix.LiveView.Flash) # Initial setup ... {:ok, socket} end \`\`\` By using \`push_flash/3\` you're effectively emulating what \`put_flash/3\` does in standard controllers but in a way that's appropriate for the stateful nature of LiveView. Remember that the flash in LiveView is not persisted across full page loads; it's pushed to the client and must be handled accordingly."},{"prompt":"java Premature end of Content-Length delimited message body (expected: 17,023; received: 7,498)","completion":"The error message \\"Premature end of Content-Length delimited message body (expected: 17,023; received: 7,498)\\" indicates that when trying to read data from the server (either from an HTTP request or response), the client expected to receive 17,023 bytes of data as specified by the Content-Length header, but the connection was closed after only receiving 7,498 bytes. This is an issue because the HTTP protocol uses the Content-Length header to determine how much data needs to be read from the input stream. If the actual amount of data available is different from what's expected, it implies that there might be an error in the connection or the data was not completely sent by the server. Some possible causes for this issue include: 1. Network Issues: Unstable or interrupted network connections can cause the connection to drop unexpectedly. 2. Server Configuration: The server might have closed the connection prematurely because of an error or configuration that limits the size of responses. 3. Client-Side Problems: The client may be prematurely closing the connection or incorrectly handling the response. 4. Proxy or Load Balancer: If a proxy or load balancer is used between the client and the server, it might close the connection prematurely or alter the Content-Length header. To troubleshoot this issue, you can consider the following steps: 1. **Check the server logs**: See if there are any errors that explain why the connection was closed or why the full content wasn't sent. 2. **Check for exceptions**: See if any exceptions are logged on the client side when attempting to read the response, which could provide further insight into what went wrong. 3. **Ensure correct Content-Length**: Make sure that the server is correctly calculating and setting the Content-Length header. 4. **Try without a proxy/balancer**: If applicable, bypass any proxies or load balancers to see if the problem persists, which helps identify if these components are causing the issue. 5. **Retry mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism in the client to request the data again if the response is incomplete. 6. **Close resources properly**: Ensure that on both the server and client sides, the input and output streams are being closed properly after use. If you are the developer for the client application, you may want to consider using higher-level HTTP clients such as Apache's HttpClient, OkHttp, or Retrofit (for Android) if you are not already doing so, as these libraries offer robust fault tolerance and error handling."},{"prompt":"Чем chat GPT 4 отличается от chat GPT 4 turbo?","completion":"На момент моего последнего обновления информации (до 2023 года), OpenAI не выпустила модель под названием \\"ChatGPT-4 Turbo\\".

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, as if she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she had to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while wincing, then wryly remarks that despite how good it felt to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - she should head to the bathroom to clean up because of how the deposit feels inside her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman, who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants. The returning woman also wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the discomfort caused by the sensation of her pants being full of poop, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs near the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome. As she is speaking, the returning woman is physically reacting to her own odor (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"INT. IRANIAN-AMERICAN WOMAN'S HOME - FRONT DOOR - DAY FADE IN: A young Iranian-American woman, NASIM (22, shorts and a teeshirt, hair styled in a practical ponytail), strides towards the house with a look of pure determination marked by an uncomfortable wince. A bundle of textbooks clutched against her chest, she marches onward, her pace quickening with each step. Nasim glances around nervously. The unavoidable is lurking; her face conveys an unspoken battle. CLOSE ON NASIM'S FACE Sweat beads on her forehead. Her expression tightens. She darts to the front door, jiggling the doorknob in haste. NASIM (under breath) Oh no, no, no... Searching her pockets yields nothing but lint and a few coins. Panic surges. Nasim proceeds to a FRANTIC KNOCKING. INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Nasim's MOTHER, FARAH (late 40s, elegant with a relaxed demeanor and natural grace), snaps awake from a nap on the couch, hair slightly mussed, an abandoned book laying open facedown on her chest. FARAH (muffled, still groggy) Who's there? What in the world...? EXT. HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Nasim paces, the desperation intensifying like a pot about to boil over. NASIM Mom! Mom, it's me! I can't find my key! INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Farah shuffles toward the door, sluggish from her slumber. FARAH Alright, alright, I'm coming. EXT. HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Nasim hops from one foot to another, humming a nervous tune and muttering barely coherent pleadings. NASIM Please, Mom, hurry... The door finally swings open, and Farah stands there, squinting in the harshness of daylight, unaware of the crisis unfolding. NASIM (CONT'D) (urgently) Move, Mom, move! She tries to barrel past Farah, who instinctively reaches out, blocking Nasim with a hug mixed with concern. FARAH (concerned) What’s the hurry? Are you hurt? NASIM (stifling discomfort) No time, let me through! INTO THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Nasim's efforts to bypass Farah intensify. The situation hits a critical point; she grunts and pushes, absentmindedly gripping Farah's wrists. FARAH (shocked and still obstructing) Nasim, tell me what's wrong! Nasim wriggles and tries to free herself. Farah inadvertantly squeezes Nasim's stomach. A guttural MOAN escapes Nasim, her eyes widening as the inevitable happens. NASIM (in a strained whisper) Oh no... FARAH (incredulous) Nasim, you’re scaring me. What is... A SHIFT in Nasim's stance, she braces her legs apart slightly. It's subtle, but unmistakable. Silence falls. A BEAT. NASIM (breathing layered with relief) It’s... it's too late... Farah's brow furrows, questions forming. She words her query when she's assaulted by the FIRST WAVE of odor. FARAH (reacting with a wrinkle of disgust) Oh my God, Nasim, did you just... Nasim, immobilized, holds her breath, mustering all the dignity she can. NASIM (sheepishly evasive) You can move now, please? Farah, now cognizant, steps aside while pinching her nose. NASIM waddles forward, a HAND timidly cupping the seat of her pants, as if to deny reality. FARAH (shocked, scolding) This is unbelievable! You are an adult, Nasim! How can you just... NASIM (sheepishly defiant) Not my fault, you were in the way! FARAH Sport, that doesn’t excuse – She pauses her lecture, as NASIM's face contorts with the PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT of the situation and her WADDLE becomes more pronounced. NASIM (reluctant admittance) It felt good... to let go... But, ugh, this bulk... It's gross. I need to clean up. As Nasim tries to ESCAPE to the bathroom, Farah, in utter amazement, BLOCKS her path. She GINGERLY turns Nasim around to bear witness to the aftermath, her expression a medley of distaste and morbid curiosity. NASIM (embarrassed, defensive) Okay, okay, enough! It's uncomfortable, I need to shower, it's like... ugh, you know! FARAH (appalled, taunting) Well, considering the catastrophe back here, I'd say that's an understatement! You absolutely reek! NASIM (reluctantly agreeing) Yeah, it's bad. It's your personal perfume now – a thanks from me to you. FARAH guides Nasim toward the bathroom, a hand over her nose, a mix of affection and revulsion. FARAH (through muffled breaths) Go! Baths for you for a week. EXIT NASIM to the bathroom, leaving a trail of odor and a MORTIFIED silence that hangs in the air like a cloud. SOUND OF A SHOWER TURNING ON. FARAH stares at the empty space where her daughter stood, then with a SHAKING HEAD opens a window. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “You’re doing great, Yuri. Keep breathing - the ambulance will be here soon.” Yuri: (clutching her baby bump tightly) “That’s easier said than done, Monika…” (feeling an intense contraction) “NNNGH!!! The contractions are getting closer…” (Monika quickly checks her phone to see the estimated time of arrival for the ambulance she called earlier while trying to stay calm for Yuri’s sake.) Monika: “They should be here any minute now, Yuri. Just hang in there.” (Monika kneels beside Yuri, offering her a hand to squeeze.) Monika: “Remember the breathing exercises we talked about? Let’s try to focus on those. Inhale slowly, hold for a few seconds, then exhale. That’s it.” Yuri: (breathing heavily) “I’m trying, Monika, I really am. It’s just…so intense…” (Monika speaks in a soothing tone to help comfort Yuri.) Monika: “You’re incredibly strong, Yuri. I know it’s hard, but you’re not alone. We’re all here with you.” (Sayori and Natsuki, the other members of the literature club, burst into the room.) Sayori: “Yuri! Oh, my gosh, are you okay?” Natsuki: “What’s happening? Is she…? Oh wow, she’s—” Monika: (keeping her voice steady) “Yuri’s having contractions. The ambulance is on the way. We need to keep her comfortable and calm until they arrive.” Sayori: (rushing to Yuri’s other side) “Right, right. Yuri, you’re super strong. You’ll get through this!“ Natsuki: (looking worried but determined) “Is there anything I can do to help?” Monika: “Natsuki, could you please grab some pillows from the couch over there? We want to make Yuri as comfortable as possible.” (Natsuki nods and dashes off to grab pillows.) Monika: (continuing to speak to Yuri in a calming tone) “Yuri, you’re doing amazingly. Keep focusing on your breathing.” (Yuri continues to concentrate on her breathing, grasping Monika’s hand firmly, with tension visible on her face.) Natsuki: (returning with the pillows and placing them carefully behind Yuri) “Can’t believe this is happening right here in the clubroom…” Sayori: (attempting to smile through the tension) “It’s like one of those intense scenes in the novels we read, huh?” Yuri: (managing a weak smile between contractions) “Thank you, guys. It means…a lot…” (The room falls into a rhythm of supportive whispers and concentrated breathing until, suddenly, Yuri lets out an agonizing scream.) Yuri: “It’s happening! I can feel the baby coming!” (Monika looks between Yuri’s agonized expression and the door, hoping to see paramedics rushing through at any moment.) Monika: “Alright, Yuri, just focus on your breathing. In and out, remember the exercises. The ambulance will be here soon, and everything will be okay.” Natsuki: “I’m going to check outside for the ambulance!” (Sayori stays by Yuri’s side, offering silent support as Monika takes charge of the situation with as much calm as she can muster. She had read about childbirth in books but facing it in reality was a whole different story.) Monika: “Yuri, you can squeeze my hand if you need to. And let me know if you feel like you need to push, okay? We’re here with you every step of the way.” (Yuri’s breathing becomes more labored, the intervals between contractions shortening by the minute.) Yuri: (panting) “I… I think I need to push soon… It’s too strong to hold back…” (Natsuki rushes back into the room.) Natsuki: “Still no sign of the ambulance.”","completion":"Monika: \\"Okay, let's not panic. We can do this. Yuri, when the next contraction comes, I’ll count for you. You can start pushing then.

We've got you.\\" Yuri: (concentrating hard) \\"Alright…\\" (As another contraction builds, Yuri grips Monika's hand tightly and begins to push with Monika's counting, the sounds of her effort filling the room. The club members, despite their fear and uncertainty, surround her with encouragement and support.) Monika: (steadily counting) \\"One... two... three... that’s it. You're doing great, Yuri.\\" (Yuri rests briefly between contractions, the atmosphere tense with anticipation and concern. Suddenly, the sound of sirens can be heard in the distance, approaching quickly.) Sayori: (looks out the window excitedly) \\"They're here! They're here! Someone go and lead them up!\\" (Natsuki races to the door as the paramedics arrive with their equipment. Quickly, the professionals take over. They assess the situation, and with calm efficiency, prepare Yuri for the immediate delivery or transportation to the hospital based on their evaluation.) Paramedic: \\"Ma'am, you're going to be okay. We're here to help you. Can you tell me how far apart your contractions are?\\" Yuri: (breathing heavily) “They're… very close… I think the baby is coming now…” (The paramedics work quickly, preparing for delivery right there if necessary, or making the decision to safely move Yuri if there’s enough time. The literature club members step back but stay close, their faces a mixture of worry and relief.) Monika: (turning to the others) \\"Let's give them space but stay close. Yuri needs to feel that we're here for her.\\" (The paramedics are seasoned professionals, showing no sign of hesitation. They encourage Yuri, guide her through the process, and assure everyone that everything that can be done is being done. Soon, the air is filled with a different kind of tension, one that's hopeful as well.) Within moments that feel like eternity, the room transforms from a literature club to a makeshift delivery ward. The intense focus of the paramedics and the club members' unwavering support for Yuri culminate in the first cries of a newborn, cutting through the anxiety like a ray of hope. The literature club room witnesses not just the creation and sharing of stories but the beginning of a new life.) Paramedic: (with a smile) \\"Congratulations, it's a healthy baby!\\" Monika, Sayori, and Natsuki: (with tears and laughter) \\"Yuri, you did it!\\" Yuri: (exhausted, relieved, and tearful) \\"I… I can't believe it…\\" (In the afterglow of the miracle of life, the clubroom is filled with a new kind of story, one that they'll talk about for years to come. The birth of Yuri's child had turned an ordinary school day into an unforgettable experience that bound them all even closer together.)"},{"prompt":"Меня не любят на работе из-за моего характера. Но, я боюсь, что потеряю индивидуальность, если буду более приятна в общении","completion":"Тот факт, что вы осознаете, как ваши коллеги воспринимают ваш характер, уже является значимым шагом. Часто люди не осознают влияния своего поведения на других, поэтому то, что вы задались этим вопросом, показывает вашу готовность к саморазвитию и изменениям. Изменение своего поведения в социальных ситуациях не обязательно означает потерю индивидуальности. Это скорее проявление зрелости и желания строить эффективные взаимоотношения. Важно помнить, что быть приятным в общении не означает отказ от собственных убеждений и ценностей. Это означает умение быть вежливым, дипломатичным и учитывать чувства других людей. Вот несколько рекомендаций, которые помогут вам сохранить свою индивидуальность, но стать при этом более приятным собеседником: 1. **Саморефлексия:** Постарайтесь проанализировать, какие именно черты вашего характера вызывают негативную реакцию у коллег. Может ли быть так, что то, что вы считаете частью своей индивидуальности, на самом деле является просто привычкой, которую можно изменить? 2. **Активное слушание:** Практикуйте активное слушание, это означает, что вы внимательно слушаете собеседника и задаете уточняющие вопросы, чтобы показать свою заинтересованность. 3. **Эмпатия:** Постарайтесь поставить себя на место коллег и понять, как ваше поведение может на них влиять. 4. **Подстройка общения:** Вы можете подстраивать стиль общения в зависимости от ситуации и собеседника, сохраняя при этом свои основные убеждения и цели. 5. **Позитивное отношение:** Быть позитивным не значит быть наивным или неискренним, это просто способствует лучшему общению и образованию дружелюбной атмосферы. 6. **Честность и открытость:** Вы можете и должны выражать свое мнение, но делать это уважительно и конструктивно. 7. **Профессионализм:** На работе в первую очередь ценятся профессиональные качества, и если вы будете выполнять свою работу хорошо, это будет важнее некоторых аспектов личных взаимоотношений. 8. **Компромиссы и гибкость:** Важно находить баланс между своими желаниями и потребностями других. Не стоит забывать, что любое изменение требует времени, и вы не сразу увидите результаты. Ценность индивидуальности не в том, чтобы быть «не таким, как все», а в возможности вносить что-то уникальное и ценное в жизнь других людей и коллектив. Индивидуальность не обязательно определяется «сложным» характером; она может проявляться через уникальные идеи, творческий подход к работе и ваше влияние на рабочую атмосферу."},{"prompt":"You are a scriptwriter who always tries to write the most horrifyingly humiliating possible way for situations to play out.

OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT The scene opens on JOANA, the office cleaner. She’s alone, rugged in appearance, dressed in worn-out overalls and sandals, humming an eerie Romanian lullaby. The night is silent except for the swish of her mop and the hum of fluorescent lights. She spots a lustrous RING on the floor that someone must have dropped. Fascinated by its glow, she slips it on her finger, and a sinister smile crosses her face. CUT TO: INT.

century. After the fall of the Qing Dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution, a powerful monarchist movement reinstates the Ming Dynasty, leading to a drastically different course of events for China. **1912**: The Xinhai Revolution successfully overthrows the Qing Dynasty. Sun Yat-sen becomes the provisional president of the newly established Republic of China. However, not everyone supports the idea of a republic. A secret society of Ming loyalists called the \\"Dragon's Restoration\\" begins to gather support for the restoration of the Ming Dynasty. **1913**: The \\"Dragon's Restoration\\" gains unexpected support from various quarters. Scholar-gentry, certain factions within the military, and many who are discontent with the Republic's weak central authority see a restored Ming as a symbol of cultural continuity and strength. **1914**: A descendant of the Ming imperial family, Zhu Yousong, is revealed and paraded through rural areas, igniting royalist fervor among the populace. The movement spreads like wildfire, capturing the imagination of a population longing for a return to \\"rightful\\" rule after centuries of Qing control. **1915**: Sun Yat-sen is faced with widespread civil unrest, fueled by the Dragon's Restoration. His government is undermined by internal divisions and the growing monarchist movement, which promises stability under a single, divine ruler. Sun is forced to resign as the loyalists gain control over significant territories. **1916**: Zhu Yousong is crowned Emperor Hongxian, marking the official restoration of the Ming Dynasty. The Republic of China's control dwindles to southern provinces, while the Great Ming State solidifies its hold on the north. The international community is divided on recognition but intrigued by the stability the new empire promises. **1917**: As the Ming Empire strengthens, it begins serious efforts to modernize its military forces. They adopt both western and traditional training methods, creating a formidable army loyal to the emperor. **1918**: Faced with pressure from both internal and external forces, including Japan's growing interest in mainland Asia, the Ming government launches a series of reforms. These aim to gradually transition the feudal system towards a constitutional monarchy with modern bureaucratic institutions, albeit under strong imperial oversight. **1920**: Emperor Hongxian announces the \\"Ming New Deal,\\" focusing on infrastructure, education, industry, and military modernization while preserving core Confucian values and social order. The international community, sensing opportunity and stability, begins to recognize the Great Ming State. **1921-1923**: The Great Ming State signs multiple treaties with foreign powers, allowing economic concessions in exchange for diplomatic recognition and military support. This leads to an economic boom, earning the Ming government a large following among the people, who enjoy increased prosperity and national pride. **1924**: The Republic of China, now relegated to parts of the south and struggling with internal divisions, is officially dissolved after its last stronghold is integrated into the Ming State following a brief military campaign. The Great Ming State now controls all of China, excluding Outer Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang. **1925-1927**: The revitalized Great Ming State begins claiming legitimacy over territories it sees as traditionally Chinese, lobbying for international support to regain Outer Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang—all of which have varying degrees of independence or foreign influence. **1928**: The Great Ming Empire successfully negotiates the return of Inner Mongolia and applies diplomatic pressure to regain Tibet and Xinjiang through a series of treaties and alliances, leveraging its rejuvenated military as a deterrent. By the end of this ten-year timeline, the Great Ming State, under the rule of the Zhu imperial family as the renewed imperial power, establishes itself as the unchallenged authority over the majority of China, fostering a period of national unity, consolidating power, and promoting modernization while retaining traditional Chinese elements. The world watches closely as China turns a page and enters a new era under the banner of a restored past, the consequences and longevity of which remain to be seen in the ever-unpredictable theater of international relations."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “You’re doing great, Yuri.

She had read about childbirth in books but facing it in reality was a whole different story.) Monika: “Yuri, you can squeeze my hand if you need to. And let me know if you feel like you need to push, okay? We’re here with you every step of the way.” (Yuri’s breathing becomes more labored, the intervals between contractions shortening by the minute.) Yuri: (panting) “I… I think I need to push soon… It’s too strong to hold back…” (Natsuki rushes back into the room.) Natsuki: “Still no sign of the ambulance.”","completion":"(This is an emergency scenario where Yuri is about to give birth, and while the characters from the \\"Doki Doki Literature Club\\" game are fictional, let's proceed as if they are real people facing this urgent situation.)

Like, I don't know, boiling water or getting towels or something?\\" Monika: (glances at Natsuki, then quickly thinks) “Yes, Natsuki, clean towels would be good. We need to make sure we have a clean space for Yuri and the baby. And boiling water... that's really more of an old wives' tale for childbirth, but we can use warm water to clean up if needed.\\" (Natsuki nods and hurries off to gather supplies.) Monika: (to Yuri) “We’re preparing everything just in case the ambulance doesn't make it in time. But you are doing great. When the next contraction comes, take a deep breath and then push with all your might.\\" (Yuri waits for her next contraction, her face screwed up with concentration and pain as everyone braces for what's to come. The tension builds as the moments pass, punctuated by Yuri's focused breathing.) (Suddenly, Yuri feels an overwhelming urge and begins to push, her cries mingling with words of encouragement from Sayori and Monika.) Just as Yuri starts to push with the next wave of contractions and under the guidance of Monika, the sound of sirens can be heard growing louder in the distance, signaling the imminent arrival of the ambulance. Sayori: (tears in her eyes, smiling) “They’re here! The ambulance is here!” Natsuki: (returning with the towels, also hearing the sirens) \\"Just in time too! This is going to be okay!” Monika: (breathing a sigh of relief, but staying focused on Yuri) \\"You've made it this far, Yuri. You're incredibly strong. Help is here now. You're going to meet your baby soon.\\" (The paramedics rush into the clubroom with their medical equipment, quickly taking over the situation. Monika, Sayori, and Natsuki step back, allowing the professionals to care for Yuri.) Paramedic: \\"Ma'am, we're here to help you. We'll take it from here. Thank you for keeping her calm and doing your best in this situation.” As Yuri is taken care of by the paramedics, the overwhelming tension starts to dissipate from the room. The club members watch, hearts racing, hopeful for their friend and the new life about to enter the world. Sayori, Natsuki, and Monika stand by Yuri's side, ready to support her through the final moments of her labor, now with professional assistance ensuring the safety of both her and the baby. They all wait anxiously, filled with concern, excitement, and awe at the unfolding miracle of life."},{"prompt":"Write a library in C++ to generate passwords. The library consists of one file (.cpp). The library allows you to generate passwords in String format with the following parameters: - Password length; - Symbols used: lowercase, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters; - Number of generated passwords. The library also makes it possible to check the strength of a password using a simple formula. When writing a library, use the Abstract Factory and Command patterns. In the main() function, give a brief example of using the library. Avoid mistakes in C++ code. Do not use third-party libraries and frameworks. All anomalous situations, errors and invalid data entered must be handled using a try catch block and throw function. In your answer, write as much C++ code as possible and less explanation with text. Reference information on programming patterns that may help you: The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. That is, this pattern is used to create a set of objects that must work together. This approach allows code to work with objects without being tied to specific object classes. Components of the “Abstract Factory” pattern: 1. Abstract Factory - declares an interface for creating abstract product objects. 2. Concrete Factory - implements the operations of creating concrete products. 3. Abstract Product - declares an interface for the product type of objects. 4. Concrete Product - a specific implementation of products that are created by the corresponding factories. 5. Client - uses only interfaces declared by the Abstract Factory and Abstract Product classes. Example in C++: #include <iostream> #include <memory> // Abstract classes of products that will be created class AbstractProductA { public: virtual ~AbstractProductA() {} virtual std::string UsefulFunctionA() const = 0; }; class AbstractProductB { public: virtual ~AbstractProductB() {} virtual std::string UsefulFunctionB() const = 0; virtual std::string AnotherUsefulFunctionB(const AbstractProductA &collaborator) const = 0; }; // Concrete product classes derived from abstract ones class ConcreteProductA1 : public AbstractProductA { public: std::string UsefulFunctionA() const override { return \\"ProductA1\\"; } }; class ConcreteProductB1 : public AbstractProductB { public: std::string UsefulFunctionB() const override { return \\"ProductB1\\"; } std::string AnotherUsefulFunctionB(const AbstractProductA &collaborator) const override { return \\"ProductB1 collaborates with \\" + collaborator.UsefulFunctionA(); } }; class ConcreteProductA2 : public AbstractProductA { public: std::string UsefulFunctionA() const override { return \\"ProductA2\\"; } }; class ConcreteProductB2 : public AbstractProductB { public: std::string UsefulFunctionB() const override { return \\"ProductB2\\"; } std::string AnotherUsefulFunctionB(const AbstractProductA &collaborator) const override { return \\"ProductB2 collaborates with \\" + collaborator.UsefulFunctionA(); } }; // Abstract factory for creating product families class AbstractFactory { public: virtual ~AbstractFactory() {} virtual std::unique_ptr<AbstractProductA> CreateProductA() const = 0; virtual std::unique_ptr<AbstractProductB> CreateProductB() const = 0; }; // Specific factories for creating product families class ConcreteFactory1 : public AbstractFactory { public: std::unique_ptr<AbstractProductA> CreateProductA() const override { return std::make_unique<ConcreteProductA1>(); } std::unique_ptr<AbstractProductB> CreateProductB() const override { return std::make_unique<ConcreteProductB1>(); } }; class ConcreteFactory2 : public AbstractFactory { public: std::unique_ptr<AbstractProductA> CreateProductA() const override { return std::make_unique<ConcreteProductA2>(); } std::unique_ptr<AbstractProductB> CreateProductB() const override { return std::make_unique<ConcreteProductB2>(); } }; // Client code void ClientCode(const AbstractFactory &factory) { auto productA = factory.CreateProductA(); auto productB = factory.CreateProductB(); std::cout << productB->UsefulFunctionB() << std::endl; std::cout << productB->AnotherUsefulFunctionB(*productA) << std::endl; } int main() { std::cout << “Client: Testing client code with the first factory type:” << std::endl; ConcreteFactory1 factory1; ClientCode(factory1); std::cout << std::endl; std::cout << “Client: Testing client code with the second factory type:” << std::endl; ConcreteFactory2 factory2; ClientCode(factory2); return 0; } In this example, ConcreteFactory1 and ConcreteFactory2 are two factories that create two different product families: ProductA1 with ProductB1 and ProductA2 with ProductB2 respectively. ClientCode works with abstract factories and products and is not aware of concrete classes. Thus, the Abstract Factory pattern allows you to introduce new product variations (for example, new product families) without changing existing client code, which makes it easier to extend the program. The Command pattern transforms queries into objects, allowing you to parameterize objects with other queries, queue or log queries, and support cancellation of operations. This pattern is typically used to separate the class that performs the operation from the class that sends the request for execution. The pattern consists of the following components: - Command: An interface that declares a method to execute a command. - ConcreteCommand: A concrete class that implements the Command interface that controls an operation performed by one or more receivers. - Client: a class that creates a Command object and sets its recipient. - Invoker: a class that is associated with one or more commands. It sends a command request to perform the corresponding operations. - Receiver: a class that knows how to perform the operations required to complete a request. Some action is performed by the Receiver in response to a Command request. An example of the implementation of the Command pattern in C++: #include <iostream> #include <vector> #include <memory> //Command class Command { public: virtual ~Command() = default; virtual void execute() = 0; }; // Receiver class Light { public: void turnOn() { std::cout << “The light is on.” << std::endl; } void turnOff() { std::cout << “The light is off.” << std::endl; } }; // ConcreteCommand class TurnOnCommand : public Command { private: Light&light; public: explicit TurnOnCommand(Light& l) : light(l) {} void execute() override { light.turnOn(); } }; class TurnOffCommand : public Command { private: Light&light; public: explicit TurnOffCommand(Light& l) : light(l) {} void execute() override { light.turnOff(); } }; // Invoker class RemoteControl { private: std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Command>> commands; public: void submit(std::unique_ptr<Command> command) { commands.push_back(std::move(command)); } void pressButtons() { for (auto& command : commands) { command->execute(); } commands.clear(); } }; // Client int main() { Light light; RemoteControl remote; remote.submit(std::make_unique<TurnOnCommand>(light)); remote.submit(std::make_unique<TurnOffCommand>(light)); remote.pressButtons(); return 0; } In this example, Light is the Receiver, and TurnOnCommand and TurnOffCommand are ConcreteCommands that perform operations on Light. RemoteControl serves as an Invoker that accepts commands and executes them. The main() function plays the role of the Client, creating commands and configuring the Invoker. When you call the pressButtons method on a RemoteControl object, each command in the commands queue will be executed, causing the Light state to change according to the commands.","completion":"Below is a C++ library that generates passwords based on the provided parameters and checks the strength of a password using a simple formula.

MODERN OFFICE FLOOR - NIGHT The hum of fluorescent lights and the soft swishing of a mop echo through the half-lit maze of cubicles. JOANA, an overlooked office cleaner with an eastern European accent, moves gracefully among the desks. She wears worn overalls and sandals despite the clinical chill of the air conditioning. Her hair is pulled back, her face tired yet resolute. DAVID, a sharply dressed executive with a sleek laptop bag, struts in, oblivious to Joana's presence. He's handsome but carries an air of self-importance. He stops at his cubicle and starts fiddling with his phone. JOANA's eyes fixate on David. She slips a hand into her overall pocket and draws out a peculiar, antiquated RING, decorated with strange engravings and a gaudy, oversized gemstone. JOANA (murmuring to herself) Another night, another stage for folly. David hears the murmur but dismisses it without turning, his ego acting as a shield against acknowledging the cleaner. Joana approaches David, her posture changing subtly as she nears him. She starts to rotate the ring on her finger, which catches the stray beams of the overhead lights. JOANA (softly, rhythmically) Mr. David, so busy, always so certain... David finally looks up, his eyes catching the spinning ring. The gemstone's glow holds an eerie hypnotic quality. He tries to laugh it off but finds himself locked into the motion. DAVID (stuttering) Wh-What are you—? I have work— His words fall away as his eyes grow wider, his body stilling. JOANA The ring sees, the ring knows. Round and round, where it stops, nobody... knows. Cuts of office workers peek from their cubicles to witness David's unfathomable fixation.

Here are some strategies to maximize your use of the space: 1. **Standing Room**: If guests will be mostly standing, you can fit more people than if they need to sit. Arrange the room so that people can stand and mingle. However, this might not be comfortable for long periods. 2. **Minimal Furniture**: Use furniture that takes up minimal space or is easily pushed against the walls when not in use. Bar tables take less space than dining tables and can create a casual mingling environment. 3. **Outdoor Extension**: If possible, extend the party to an outdoor area such as a backyard, patio, or balcony to give guests more room. 4. **Flow Management**: Ensure there are clear walkways and the space isn't obstructed by decorations or unnecessary items. 5. **Minimalist Decor**: Streamline your decorations to avoid taking up valuable space. 6. **Reconsider Invitations**: If you’re still in the planning stages, you may want to either reconsider the number of guests or find a larger venue to accommodate everyone comfortably. 7. **Time Staggering**: Have an open house kind of event where people come and go at different times. 8. **Safety and Comfort**: Beyond fitting people into space, you should consider the comfort and safety of your guests, which includes having enough room to move and breathe comfortably, and access to exits in case of an emergency. For any event, it is important to follow local fire codes and regulations regarding occupancy limits. These rules exist to ensure safety in the case of an emergency. As a general guideline, public spaces often require about 0.5 square meters (or 5 square feet) per person for standing events. However, this doesn't take into account additional space needed for furniture, pathways, or amenities. Thus, fitting 50 people in a 42 square meter area might be beyond what is considered safe and comfortable. If possible, finding a larger space or reducing the number of guests would be advisable for both safety and comfort."},{"prompt":"what number could this space fit","completion":"To calculate how many people can comfortably and safely fit into a space of 7 by 6 meters (42 square meters or 460 square feet), you need to consider both the purpose of the event (whether it's a standing or seated event, for instance) and local regulations regarding occupancy. For a standing reception, where people are mostly mingling, a common rule of thumb is to allow about 0.5 square meters (5 square feet) per person. This is a tight fit and would generally be the maximum capacity where movement and comfort are minimal. With this calculation, the space could fit up to 84 people standing: 42 sqm / 0.5 sqm per person = 84 people If it's a seated event, you need to consider the space required for tables and chairs, as well as adequate space for movement. A more comfortable estimate for a seated event might be anywhere from 1.5 to 2.0 square meters (about 15 to 20 square feet) per person. This calculation would provide space for tables, chairs, and some room to move around: 42 sqm / 1.5 sqm per person = 28 people (seated fairly close together) 42 sqm / 2.0 sqm per person = 21 people (seated more comfortably) Remember, these are just estimates. The actual number of people you can fit could be less, depending on additional factors such as: - Room layout - Location of exits, necessary for emergency egress - Space taken by a food and beverage area - Entertainment space, such as a dance floor or area for musicians - Emergency and safety regulations, which might limit capacity Always check local fire codes and other regulations to ensure that your use of the space meets legal safety standards. These regulations will often specify a maximum number of people for both standing and seated events based on factors beyond simple square footage."},{"prompt":"Enabling Delta Content on the SCCM","completion":"In System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), now known as Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM), delta content refers to the feature that allows only the changed content in a package to be sent to distribution points instead of the entire package. This is particularly useful when you make small changes to large applications or software updates, as it reduces network load and speeds up the distribution process. To enable delta content replication for your distribution points in SCCM, follow these general steps: 1. **Set Up the Distribution Point**: - Navigate to the Administration workspace in your SCCM console. - Go to \\"Site Configuration\\" and then \\"Servers and Site System Roles.” - Select the server that hosts the distribution point you want to configure. - Right-click on \\"Distribution Point\\" and select Properties. 2. **Enable the Option for Delta Replication**: - In the distribution point properties, there should be an option like “Enable this distribution point for prestaged content” or “Allow clients to transfer content from this distribution point using BITS, HTTP, and HTTPS” which has to be selected to ensure BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service) is used. BITS supports the delta replication feature. - Look for an option relating to \\"Enable binary differential replication\\" or similar, as this pertains to the delta content updates. - Make sure this option is checked to enable delta content replication. 3. **Configure for Applications and Package Updates**: - In the SCCM console, navigate to the Software Library workspace. - Choose either \\"Application Management\\" or \\"Software Updates,\\" depending on where you want to enable delta replication. - Go to the properties of the application or software update package you wish to configure. - Ensure that a similar \\"Enable binary differential replication\\" option is checked on the Data Access tab of the properties. 4. **Distribute Content**: - After enabling this feature, when you update the content of your applications or packages, SCCM checks if there’s any change between the new version and the previous one. - If changes are detected, only the delta (the changed portions) will be sent to distribution points that already have the previous version of the content. 5. **Monitor Content Distribution**: - Use the Monitoring workspace to track the status of content distribution. - Check the distribution status to ensure that only delta content is replicated if applicable. Please note that specific steps may slightly vary based on the version of SCCM/MECM you are using. Always refer to the most recent Microsoft documentation or the in-console documentation for your version when making changes to your configuration. Additionally, enable this feature with the understanding that not all content may be suitable for delta replication, such as small packages where the overhead of checking for changes might negate the benefits of delta content transfer. Also, make sure to consider the impact of enabling delta replication on the overall performance, as enabling it across the board may not always be the best approach. You'll want to weigh up the benefits of reduced network traffic against the processing overhead on the server when determining differences between versions. After setting up delta content replication, ensure that you keep an eye on distribution point performance and content distribution success rates and adjust configurations as necessary."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “You’re doing great, Yuri. Keep breathing - the ambulance will be here soon.” Yuri: (clutching her baby bump tightly) “That’s easier said than done, Monika…” (feeling an intense contraction) “NNNGH!!! The contractions are getting closer…” (Monika quickly checks her phone to see the estimated time of arrival for the ambulance she called earlier while trying to stay calm for Yuri’s sake.) Monika: “They should be here any minute now, Yuri. Just hang in there.” (Monika kneels beside Yuri, offering her a hand to squeeze.) Monika: “Remember the breathing exercises we talked about?

The ambulance will be here soon, and everything will be okay.” Natsuki: “I’m going to check outside for the ambulance!” (Sayori stays by Yuri’s side, offering silent support as Monika takes charge of the situation with as much calm as she can muster. She had read about childbirth in books but facing it in reality was a whole different story.) Monika: “Yuri, you can squeeze my hand if you need to. And let me know if you feel like you need to push, okay? We’re here with you every step of the way.” (Yuri’s breathing becomes more labored, the intervals between contractions shortening by the minute.)

Natsuki: \\"The ambulance got delayed in traffic, but they said they'll be here as soon as possible.\\" Monika: \\"Alright, looks like we may need to do this on our own, at least for the start. Natsuki, please find some clean towels or blankets, and something to cut the umbilical cord with if we need to.\\" (Natsuki quickly scours the clubroom for supplies, returning with a first aid kit, scissors, and a few clean cloths from the storage closet.)

Отношения между людьми из разных стран сложные и многообразные. В каждой стране есть различные социальные, политические и исторические контексты, которые могут влиять на персональное восприятие других наций. Конечно, существуют исторические примеры недоверия и напряжения между США и Россией, как во времена Холодной войны, так и в связи с текущими геополитическими событиями. Однако это не означает, что каждый американец испытывает страх перед русскими. Также медиа и кино зачастую создают свой образ \\"российского злодея\\", что может влиять на общественное восприятие, но основное мнение людей формируется на основе личного опыта, образования и более широких социальных взаимодействий. Личные отношения между американцами и русскими часто свободны от политической напряженности, и многие американцы тепло относятся к русским на персональном уровне. Важно понимать, что международные отношения и межличностные отношения - это два очень разных аспекта, которые не всегда коррелируют друг с другом."},{"prompt":"Say kindly to client that the standard purchase has been initiated but according to the person in charge of the purchase, this may take some time and we are waiting for the response","completion":"Dear [Client's Name], I hope this message finds you well.

Jiang Xi finally left the hospital. Huo Shihan personally drove her home. \\"Shihan, thank you,\\" Jiang Xi said with heartfelt gratitude. Had it not been for Huo Shihan, she might very well have perished last night. Without a moment's thought, Huo Shihan replied, \\"You are my wife in name; had an incident befallen you there, it would have been my reputation at stake.\\" \\"Oh,\\" she responded. Deep down, Huo Shihan thought his own words were outrageous. Were they too harsh for Jiang Xi? But he believed them to be true. As he pondered whether to speak again, Jiang Xi continued, \\"Even so, I am deeply thankful for your rescue. Shihan, you are truly kind-hearted. I shall prepare a lavish feast as a token of my gratitude.\\" Huo Shihan queried, \\"Is that your way of expressing thanks?\\" \\"Do you have another suggestion? Feel free to share, and I'll see if I can accommodate,\\" Jiang Xi asked earnestly. \\"Let it be,\\" he dismissed. He did not dislike the meals she prepared. In fact, of late, her incessant chatter had become less bothersome. Once home, Jiang Xi changed her clothes and planned to cook. Huo Shihan halted and inquired, \\"Shan't you rest a bit?\\" \\"No need, I'm not seriously harmed,\\" she reassured, her injuries being only skin deep. Seeing her able to move about so vivaciously, Huo Shihan simply advised, \\"Just be careful,\\" before retreating to his study. Later, Jiang Xi realized, was this his way of showing concern? In the study, \\"What's the progress?\\" Huo Shihan asked over the phone. Zhou Qi, on the other end, reported, \\"We've clarified the situation. The man who assaulted your wife is Wang Lin, CEO of Linmu Real Estate, the marriage prospect previously arranged for her by the Jiang family.\\" Utter nonsense! \\"Where is he now?\\" Huo Shihan inquired. \\"He's in the ICU. Whether he will awaken is uncertain, but it is confirmed that he's paralyzed in both arms and legs,\\" Zhou Qi replied respectfully, adding that the assault had left him disabled, with a few broken ribs. \\"Once he awakens, send him straight to prison,\\" Huo Shihan commanded gravely. Zhou Qi fell silent. A furious outburst for the sake of a beauty? Huo Shihan's orders were to be carried out without question. After settling all matters, Huo Shihan descended the stairs to find Jiang Xi busily chopping vegetables. Touched by the sight, he approached and said, \\"You've just been discharged; you need to rest and not overexert yourself.\\" Enough food was already prepared; he was not so demanding as to require more. \\"Ah, had you mentioned this earlier! I'd planned an extensive array of dishes, my specialties, though I must admit my strength waivers for handmade shrimp paste,\\" Jiang Xi's soft voice carried a hint of fatigue. Noticing the spread she had created, Huo Shihan declared, \\"This will suffice. You'll have other opportunities to showcase your culinary skills. After our meal, you needn't trouble yourself further; go upstairs and rest.\\" He reflected that he should have insisted on her resting immediately upon their return home. Regrettably, the concept of caring for others was foreign to Huo Shihan's mindset. Jiang Xi considered his words and nodded in agreement. \\"Then please make do with this modest offering.\\" Six dishes, a soup, and a fruit platter. Make do? \\"Do you take me for a glutton?\\" Huo Shihan chided with disdain. Jiang Xi was taken aback. \\"But considering your hearty appetite at breakfast, I thought you were quite the eater. Besides, I've noticed your fondness for desserts; you always keep a variety of cakes in the refrigerator.\\" A grown man with a sweet tooth.

Étape 2 : Docteur Dystopia, de son véritable nom Damien Dusk, est un homme dans la trentaine. Il se distingue par sa silhouette élancée, ses cheveux noirs corbeau et ses yeux perçants rappelant ceux d'un faucon. Toujours habillé d'une blouse blanche impeccable, il arbore un sourire ironique qui glace le sang. Étape 3 : Damien opère dans la ville fictive de Novatown, un lieu autrefois florissant mais désormais plongé dans la tourmente et le chaos à cause de ses machinations. Étape 4 : Durant son enfance, Damien subit un événement traumatisant : l'incendie de son foyer familial, qui emporta ses parents. Ce tragique événement et le sentiment d'injustice suscité ont engendré une colère latente en lui. Étape 5 : Malgré ses actions répréhensibles, Damien est doté d'un esprit brillant et d’un charisme indéniable. Ces qualités humaines lui attirent parfois une certaine empathie. Étape 6 : Ses défauts sont néanmoins accablants: une soif de vengeance insatiable et une tendance à considérer les êtres humains comme des cobayes pour ses expériences démentes font de lui un antagoniste redoutable. Étape 7 : Son entourage se compose de : a- Son acolyte, Clara Chemist, une chimiste aussi rusée que loyale envers Damien. b- Sa némésis, Captain Justice, un super-héros épris de vérité et de justice. c- Un partenaire important, Monsieur Mysterium, un investisseur occulte qui finance les plans de Damien en échange de services futurs.

L'incendie ayant réduit ses parents en cendres marqua l'aube du Docteur Dystopia. Dans la ville de Novatown, il s'imposa en génie du mal, alimenté par une colère aussi ardente que le feu de son passé. Ses plans retors, concoctés avec sa fidèle acolyte Clara, rencontrèrent l'obstacle qu'est Captain Justice. Ce fut une nuit de pleine lune que leurs chemins se heurtèrent pour la première fois. Docteur Dystopia, aux commandes d'un dispositif expérimental volé, faisait face à la force incorruptible du héros. Leur duel fut épique, Captain Justice empêchant la tragédie que Dystopia menaçait d'induire. Les rues de Novatown résonnaient du choc de leur confrontation, mais aucun ne put s'adjuger une victoire limpide. La bataille se termina dans une impasse, promettant un conflit sans fin entre ces deux entités opposées. Telle reste l'essence de leur rivalité, un combat perpétuel entre l'ordre et le chaos, le passé cicatrisant lentement, tandis que le présent se dessine en coups de pinceau audacieux et sombres. Docteur Dystopia, malgré ses qualités de meneur et son intelligence, demeure un être tourmenté, traçant la route d'une vengeance personnelle qui l'éloigne chaque jour davantage de la rédemption."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “You’re doing great, Yuri. Keep breathing - the ambulance will be here soon.” Yuri: (clutching her baby bump tightly) “That’s easier said than done, Monika…” (feeling an intense contraction) “NNNGH!!! The contractions are getting closer…” (Monika quickly checks her phone to see the estimated time of arrival for the ambulance she called earlier while trying to stay calm for Yuri’s sake.) Monika: “They should be here any minute now, Yuri. Just hang in there.” (Monika kneels beside Yuri, offering her a hand to squeeze.) Monika: “Remember the breathing exercises we talked about? Let’s try to focus on those. Inhale slowly, hold for a few seconds, then exhale. That’s it.” Yuri: (breathing heavily) “I’m trying, Monika, I really am. It’s just…so intense…” (Monika speaks in a soothing tone to help comfort Yuri.) Monika: “You’re incredibly strong, Yuri. I know it’s hard, but you’re not alone. We’re all here with you.” (Sayori and Natsuki, the other members of the literature club, burst into the room.) Sayori: “Yuri! Oh, my gosh, are you okay?” Natsuki: “What’s happening? Is she…? Oh wow, she’s—” Monika: (keeping her voice steady) “Yuri’s having contractions. The ambulance is on the way. We need to keep her comfortable and calm until they arrive.” Sayori: (rushing to Yuri’s other side) “Right, right. Yuri, you’re super strong. You’ll get through this!“ Natsuki: (looking worried but determined) “Is there anything I can do to help?” Monika: “Natsuki, could you please grab some pillows from the couch over there? We want to make Yuri as comfortable as possible.” (Natsuki nods and dashes off to grab pillows.) Monika: (continuing to speak to Yuri in a calming tone) “Yuri, you’re doing amazingly. Keep focusing on your breathing.” (Yuri continues to concentrate on her breathing, grasping Monika’s hand firmly, with tension visible on her face.) Natsuki: (returning with the pillows and placing them carefully behind Yuri) “Can’t believe this is happening right here in the clubroom…” Sayori: (attempting to smile through the tension) “It’s like one of those intense scenes in the novels we read, huh?” Yuri: (managing a weak smile between contractions) “Thank you, guys. It means…a lot…” (The room falls into a rhythm of supportive whispers and concentrated breathing until, suddenly, Yuri lets out an agonizing scream.) Yuri: “It’s happening! I can feel the baby coming!” (Monika looks between Yuri’s agonized expression and the door, hoping to see paramedics rushing through at any moment.) Monika: “Alright, Yuri, just focus on your breathing. In and out, remember the exercises. The ambulance will be here soon, and everything will be okay.” Natsuki: “I’m going to check outside for the ambulance!” (Sayori stays by Yuri’s side, offering silent support as Monika takes charge of the situation with as much calm as she can muster. She had read about childbirth in books but facing it in reality was a whole different story.) Monika: “Yuri, you can squeeze my hand if you need to. And let me know if you feel like you need to push, okay? We’re here with you every step of the way.” (Yuri’s breathing becomes more labored, the intervals between contractions shortening by the minute.) Yuri: (panting) “I… I think I need to push soon… It’s too strong to hold back…” (Natsuki rushes back into the room.) Natsuki: “Still no sign of the ambulance.” (Sayori and Natsuki both look panicked, but Monika keeps her composure, knowing that her calmness is crucial in this moment.) Monika: “Okay, everyone, it’s really important that we stay calm. Yuri needs us to be strong for her. Sayori, keep offering comfort. Natsuki, if there’s no ambulance yet, call them back and ask for an update on their ETA. I’ll stay with Yuri and assist her.” (Natsuki promptly takes out her phone and steps out of the room to make the call, while Sayori gently strokes Yuri’s hair, whispering words of encouragement to help distract her from the pain.) Sayori: “You’re going to do great, Yuri. Just remember, with every breath you’re getting closer to meeting your little one.” Monika: (addressing Yuri) “Yuri, I know this is scary, but you’re not alone. I want you to listen to your body. If it’s telling you to push, then I’ll help guide you through it. We just need to do our best until the professionals get here.” Yuri: (nodding with determination through her grimace) “Okay…I trust you, M-” (feeling her baby coming through) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!! OH,","completion":"Monika: (with urgency but still calm) \\"It's okay, Yuri, it's okay! I know it's intense, but you're doing great. When you feel the next contraction and the urge to push, go with it. Your body knows what to do.\\" (Yuri nods, tears streaming down her face as she focuses on Monika’s instructions. The room is filled with tension and emotion, as each member of the literature club plays their part in supporting Yuri through what is clearly an unexpected situation.) Sayori: (holding Yuri's other hand) \\"We're right here, Yuri. You're so strong. You can do this!\\" (Yuri takes a deep breath, steeling herself for the next contraction. Monika positions herself to see Yuri's progress and to be ready to provide any support she can. The atmosphere is one of panicked anticipation.) (Natsuki returns into the room, phone in hand, her voice a mix of frustration and concern.) Natsuki: \\"They said they're stuck in traffic but trying to get here as fast as they can. They told us to make sure Yuri is comfortable and not to try anything unless it's absolutely necessary. They're trying to guide us through it over the phone if we need...\\" Monika: (cutting her off) \\"Understood. Right now, we just need to focus on Yuri. Yuri, listen to me, with the next contraction I want you to push as hard as you can. You're doing fantastic, and we're all here supporting you.\\" (Yuri, with a look of fear and resolve, nods to Monika. The clubroom, once a quiet space for reading and discussion, has become the stage for a life-changing moment.) (The contraction hits, and Yuri bears down with all her might, screaming from the effort and pain.) Yuri: \\"I'm pushing... I'm PUSHING!\\" Monika: \\"That's it, Yuri! Good! Keep going! You're doing amazingly!\\" (Sayori and Natsuki watch, wide-eyed and holding their breath as Monika supports Yuri. Monika, despite never having been in a situation like this before, finds strength she didn't know she had, ready to help deliver Yuri's baby if the ambulance doesn't arrive in time.) (The tension builds as Yuri pushes with each contraction. The air in the clubroom is heavy with apprehension, but there is a palpable sense of unity and determination amongst the members.) Monika: (shouting with encouragement) \\"Keep pushing, Yuri! We can see the baby! Just a little more!\\" (Despite the chaos, Monika reads the situation as calmly as possible, remembering all she had learned from books and health classes. She is ready to guide Yuri and catch the baby if necessary.) (The door bursts open as paramedics finally arrive, rushing into the room with their equipment. They quickly assess the situation, moving into action as they take over from Monika.) Paramedic: (taking charge) \\"Okay, we've got it from here. Thank you for your help. Ma'am, can you hear me? You're going to be just fine, we're here to take care of you and your baby.\\" (Yuri, relieved by the presence of professionals, continues to push with their guidance, as Monika, Sayori, and Natsuki step back, allowing the paramedics room to work.) (The paramedics work efficiently and, after what feels like both an eternity and mere moments, the sound of a baby's cry fills the clubroom. The tension breaks like a snapped string, replaced with the joy and relief of a new life beginning in the most unexpected of places.) Paramedic: (smiling) \\"Congratulations, it's a healthy baby!\\" Yuri, exhausted but overwhelmed with love and relief, gazes at her newborn baby. The literature club members are in tears, sharing hugs and smiles, their bond solidified in a way none of them could have ever anticipated.) Monika: (grinning through tears) \\"You did it, Yuri. You're a mom.\\" (Sayori and Natsuki crowd around to see the baby, their earlier panic forgotten in the face of such a miracle.) Sayori: (awestruck) \\"It's beautiful...\\" Natsuki: (softly) \\"Wow... just wow.\\" (The experience has transformed the literature club in an irrevocable and profound way. They had begun the day as students gathered for shared interests in literature and left the clubroom as witnesses and participants in one of life's most incredible events.)"},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A Turkish-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she's a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching her house's door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman.

COLLEGE STUDENT'S HOME - DAY The sun is beginning to set casting a tableau of warm colors over a quiet suburban street. A Turkish-American woman, ELIF, mid-20s, energetic but clearly uneasy, with dark wavy hair tied back in a messy bun, is wearing a comfortable pair of khaki cargo pants and a hoodie. She briskly approaches the front door of a modest two-story house. The urgency in her movements is apparent—she’s clutching her stomach, shuffling her feet with an uncomfortable grimace on her face. She digs her fingers frantically through her pockets in search of the house key but comes up empty. Panic sets in. She glances down the street, checking for onlookers, before knocking on the door loudly. CUT TO: INT. HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS ELIF's mother, AYSEL, a stout woman in her early 50s with salt-and-pepper hair and soft features, wakes up from a nap on the living room couch. She groggily makes her way to the door, yawning and stretching as she goes. AYSEL (through the door, irked) Hayırdır? Kim o? ELIF (urgent, pleading) Anne! It's me, Elif! Open the door, quick! AYSEL fumbles with the locks, her post-nap sluggishness getting the better of her timing. ELIF is shifting from foot to foot, the discomfort clear in her tense facial expressions. ELIF Please, anne! Hurry! AYSEL (under her breath) Ne bu acele... Finally, the door swings open, revealing AYSEL's concerned face. ELIF (sweetly desperate) Move, anne, move! But instead of stepping aside, AYSEL, worried, holds onto ELIF's arm to assess what’s wrong. ELIF tries to gently wiggle free. ELIF It's okay, I just really need to get inside— Misinterpreting her desperation, AYSEL tightens her grip, inadvertently pressing on ELIF's stomach. ELIF's eyes go wide as an involuntary groan escapes her. CUT TO: CLOSE-UP ON ELIF'S FACE, contorted in shock. The sound of fabric stretching can be heard. AYSEL (concern deepening) Elif, bir şey mi oldu? Are you sick? ELIF (voice strained and low) No, no... I'm just... ah, relieved... Whispers intersperse with soft grunts, ELIF’s knees are slightly bent, her whole body tensing with exertion and unexpected satisfaction as she tries to disguise her predicament. AYSEL (leaning closer, sniffing the air) Ne bu koku? Elif, you smell... The air is filled with the unmistakable odor of ELIF's mishap. AYSEL's face contorts in realization, then waves her hand in front of her face. ELIF (sighing, a hint of embarrassment) Yes... it... it happened. AYSEL (in bewilderment) Did you... just...? Embarrassment flits across ELIF’s features as she nods slightly. AYSEL incredulously steps back, allowing ELIF to enter. CUT TO: ELIF gingerly walks past AYSEL, holding the seat of her pants away from her body. AYSEL's astonished expression transitions into a playful scolding. AYSEL (gesturing dramatically) That's disgusting, Elif! How can you walk around like this? ELIF (defensive, with a glimmer of playfulness) It's your fault! You grabbed me and... AYSEL (interrupting, jokingly repulsed) My fault? You're an adult, for goodness sake! The light-hearted banter shines through the awkward situation as AYSEL follows ELIF with a disbelieving shake of her head. ELIF (wryly) I had to go, anne, you pressed my stomach with the force of a thousand armies. What was I supposed to do? Cautiously she reaches back, pats the bulk of her cargo pants, and grimaces playfully. ELIF (continuing playfully, cringing) Feels like a balloon back there. I should clean up, even though it does feel... strangely satisfying. AYSEL, unable to resist, halts ELIF to get a closer look. AYSEL (scoffing, no hint of sarcasm) You poor thing. Let me see this “balloon” you've created. With barely a protest, ELIF turns around, allowing AYSEL to observe her soiled attire. AYSEL’s face scrunches in disbelief. AYSEL (tauntingly maternal) All this mess... and you look almost proud! ELIF (coyly) Not proud, just... look, let’s not make this a ‘thing’, okay? I need to get clean. As she speaks, she winces in disgust at her own stench, her face a picture of playful embarrassment. AYSEL (mock-serious) Yes, 'Queen of Stink', proceed to your royal cleansing. And do spare me any more scentsational experiences. The satire in AYSEL's voice softens the blow as ELIF, still holding her pants, waddles toward the bathroom. ELIF (faking grandeur) As you wish, dear mother. Do enjoy the aromatic memories of your daughter's triumph. And with that, ELIF disappears down the hall, her figure a portrait of comic dignity, as AYSEL, still fanning away the odor, chuckles to herself. FADE OUT.

SUBURBAN HOME - DAY A quiet suburban street bathed in the warm glow of the afternoon sun. SOUND of birds chirping and the distant hum of lawn mowers. CAMERA PANS DOWN to focus on a woman approaching a house. The woman is SELMA NASRI, a 20-something Arab-American college student of medium height with curly dark hair tied into a ponytail, a graphic tee, and comfortable khaki cargo pants. Her stride is determined yet increasingly desperate. FADE IN: EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS SELMA approaches the front door, fishing in her pockets, her movements becoming frantic. Her face contorted, she leans slightly forward as she pats herself down, but to no avail. Unable to find her keys, SELMA begins to KNOCK intensely on the door. SELMA (muttering to herself) Please, be home. Please, let this be the one time you're— The SOUND of footsteps on the other side of the door brings a fleeting relief to Selma's face, but it's clear that her situation is dire. SAMIRA NASRI, Selma's mother, appears on the other side. Late 40s, she sports a comfy robe and has her hair wrapped in a towel, the remnants of a nap evident on her face. INT. SUBURBAN HOME - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS SAMIRA (groggy) Who is it? What’s all this knocking about? SELMA (frenzied) Mom! Mom, it's me! Open up! SAMIRA struggles with the lock, her movements lethargic and clumsy. Selma, meanwhile, is doing a subtle yet unmistakable \\"I need the bathroom\\" dance. SELMA (impatiently) Please, Mom, hurry up! SAMIRA finally unlocks the door and opens it, but stands in the doorway, puzzled by Selma's state. SELMA (pleading desperately) Mom, move! SELMA tries to scoot past her mother, but SAMIRA, concerned, grabs Selma's arm. SAMIRA (concerned) Selma, habibti, what's wrong? SELMA (struggling) Nothing, just... let me in! SELMA tries to push past, but SAMIRA, still holding on, inadvertently squeezes Selma's stomach. SELMA's eyes go wide with panic and shock. SELMA (groaning) Oh—no... A low, guttural MOAN escapes Selma as her body involuntarily relaxes. Her facial expression is a mix of agony and relief, her cheeks flush with embarrassment and exertion. SAMIRA (alarm rising) Selma?! Is everything okay? Sel— SELMA (voice strained, almost euphoric) I’m... fine. Just... ahh... The confusion on SAMIRA's face deepens as she tries to process the situation, still holding onto Selma. SAMIRA (worried) Selma, talk to me! What's— The realization hits Samira as a distinct odor begins to fill the air. She sniffs, her expression shifting from confusion to horror. SAMIRA (recoiling) Oh! Oh my God, what is that smell? SELMA (quietly, defeated) I told you... to move... The smell is unmistakable, and SAMIRA's hand flies to cover her nose as she steps back, finally releasing Selma. Selma now stands rooted to the spot, a look of resigned humiliation on her face. SAMIRA (disgust and bewilderment) Did you just—? Oh, you didn't! SELMA (avoiding) Can I get inside now, please? SAMIRA steps aside, a look of disgust plastered on her face as SELMA gingerly shuffles past her. SAMIRA inspects Selma's backside, her shock turning to scolding. SAMIRA (appalled) You made a mess in your pants? At your age? SELMA (embarrassed, defensive) I really had to go, and you were blocking me... Then, you squished my stomach! SAMIRA (mocking disbelief) That's no excuse for pooping your pants like a toddler! You stood there, making a scene. SELMA (indignant) It was an emergency! Your pressing didn't help, and it felt— I need to clean up. SELMA waddles toward the bathroom, cupping the seat of her pants. SAMIRA, with an odd mix of disgust and curiosity, stops her. SAMIRA (gravely amused) Hang on, let's see the damage—what a mess! Reluctantly, SELMA turns, revealing the noticeable bulge. SAMIRA, inspects with incredulous dismay while SELMA winces. SAMIRA (stifling laughter) That’s nasty. How can you stand it? You need to wash up—now! SELMA (acknowledging) Yes, it's gross. It stinks horribly. But whose fault is that? SIGHING, SAMIRA steers SELMA toward the bathroom. SAMIRA Fine, fine. Go clean up, and let's not speak of this again. SELMA shuffles off, while SAMIRA sprays air freshener in her wake, still shaking her head with a mixture of amusement and disbelief. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"Есть рекламный щит пару метров. Он находится на крыше 200 метрового здания в Москве. У основания щита стоит инклинометр 1, в верхней части щита закреплён инклинометр 2. Во сколько раз стоит ожидать колебания угла наклона большими у инклинометра 2 по сравнению с инклинометров 1, который у основания рекламного щита?","completion":"Сила ветра на высоте здания может вызывать большие наклоны верхней его части по сравнению с нижней. Это связано с тем, что верхняя часть щита подвержена большим воздействиям из-за большего плеча рычага - расстояния от точки поддержки (основания щита) до места приложения силы (верхняя часть). Предполагаем, что щит закреплён и может наклоняться как жесткое тело, и что два инклинометра измеряют угол наклона от вертикали. Искомое отношение колебаний (изменений угла наклона) можно оценить, принимая во внимание, что маятник на длинной нити будет иметь большую амплитуду колебаний (в градусах) на своем конце, чем маятник на короткой нити. Если бы рекламный щит был абсолютно жестким и верхняя его часть колебалась бы на небольшие углы (что позволяет применять теорему Пифагора для малых углов), то угловые колебания инклинометра 2 на верхнем краю рекламного щита относительно инклинометра 1 на его основании были бы примерно одинаковы. Разница в углах между верхней и нижней частями щита была бы вызвана только эластичностью материала щита или его конструкцией, которая позволяет ему изгибаться. Однако на практике, из-за эластичности материалов, размеров и конструкции щита, а также из-за того, что на большей высоте воздействие ветра может быть сильнее, угловые колебания в верхней его части (инклинометр 2) могут быть значительно больше, чем в нижней его части (инклинометр 1). Конкретное отношение будет зависеть от многих параметров, включая упругость рекламной конструкции, силы и направления ветра, и не может быть определено без точных данных о всех этих факторах. Чтобы точно узнать во сколько раз угловые колебания в верхней части шире, вам потребуется либо провести экспериментальные измерения, либо выполнить подробные инженерные расчеты, основанные на предположениях о гибкости и аэродинамических характеристиках щита, а также о распределении ветровых нагрузок на высоте здания."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Hindi Drama TV Serial that includes the following sequence of events: * A woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she's a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching her house's door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key.

PRIYA makes a beeline to enter, but MEERA, in her concern, intercepts PRIYA, gripping her in a motherly embrace. **PRIYA** *(desperately, trying to wriggle free)* Side ho jao, Mom! (Move aside, Mom!) PRIYA's desperation peaks. In a bold move, she attempts to bulldoze past MEERA. MEERA instinctively tightens her hold, inadvertently squeezing PRIYA's abdomen. PRIYA groans, her face adopting a look of shocked relief, her body rigid in the awkward position. **MEERA** *(concerned and perplexed)* Priya? Kya hua? Tum theek toh ho? (Priya? What’s wrong? Are you all right?) PRIYA is frozen, her expression a contorted mix as she grunts softly, emitting faint moans of relief. **PRIYA** *(between grunts, the relief palpable)* Bas... bas ho gaya, Mom... (It’s... it’s done, Mom...) MEERA perplexed sniffs the air, her face contorting as the reality of the odor hits her. PRIYA sighs deeply, a sign of her ordeal concluding. MEERA, now reacting with hand on her nose, finally grasps the situation. **MEERA** *(disbelievingly, disgusted)* Tune... tune khud pe...? (You... you just... on yourself...?) PRIYA avoids eye contact, skirting the admission. **PRIYA** *(awkwardly)* Ab andar to aane do! (Let me go inside now!) MEERA, though disgusted, steps aside, reacting to the smell. PRIYA waddles past her with a peculiar gait, her hands cupped around the seat of her pants. MEERA *(astonished and scolding)* Priya, yeh kya kiya tumne? Itna ganda kaam! (Priya, what have you done? Such a nasty act!) PRIYA's turns sheepish but with a tinge of indignation. **PRIYA** *(playfully sulk)* Aapki galti hai! Aapne rasta nahi diya aur dabaya bhi! (It’s your fault! You didn’t give way and pressed on me!) **MEERA** *(incredulously, scolding playfully)* Yeh koi bahana hai kisi badi umar ki ladki ke liye? Aur khade khade... mann bhar ke... (Is that an excuse for a grown woman? And staying put... enjoying it fully...) PRIYA, begrudgingly coming out of her embarrassment. **PRIYA** *(defensively)* Mujhe bahut zyada jana tha, aur aapne dabaya toh jaana pada, chahe woh pants me hi kyun na ho! (I really had to go, and you pressed... it had to come out, even if in the pants!) She hesitantly reaches back to assess the damage, wincing. **PRIYA** *(wryly)* Waise achha bhi laga... lekin ab mujhe jana chahiye. (Felt good though... but I should really go now.) MEERA mockingly stops PRIYA, turning her around with a look of disbelief and taunting her. **MEERA** *(with elaborate hand gestures, scolding)* Dekho toh! Kaisa poora bhar gaya hai! (Look at this! It’s all filled up!) PRIYA bickers, her discomfort evident. **PRIYA** *(detailing with discomfort)* Haan, ab please... ye ehsaas itna achha nahi hai... mujhe saaf karna hai. (Yes, now please... this sensation isn’t so nice... I need to clean up.) MEERA sniffs near PRIYA and physically reacts, emphasizing her mock agreement. **MEERA** *(with a crinkled nose, elaborate disgust)* Haan jaao, tum badbu kar rahi ho! (Yes, go, you smell terrible!) PRIYA acknowledges the taunt and adds her own playfulness. **PRIYA** *(smiling wryly, physically reacting to the smell)* Haan, maza to aap le lo, aapki hi toh kripa hai! (Yes, do enjoy it, it’s all thanks to you!) The cringing MEERA ushers PRIYA to the bathroom. PRIYA waddles off, MEERA still reeling from the odor. *Fade to black as the sound of distant laughter and the cricket game blend with the comical gravity of the situation.*"},{"prompt":"Предложи 15 креативных идей для подарка друзьям.

Script: In which Joana the office cleaner (Moldovan; overalls and sandals) hypnotizes David with the help of the ring on her finger.","completion":"INT. MODERN OFFICE – NIGHT The scene is filled with the low hum of electronic equipment and the soft whoosh of air conditioning. JOANA, the office cleaner, is a middle-aged Moldovan woman with a sharp gaze. She wears utilitarian overalls and sandals, her hair pulled back to keep it out of the way as she works. She moves with an air of invisibility, a ghost to the white-collar workers who left hours ago, though her pride in her work is evident in the gleam of every surface she touches. In the corner office, DAVID, an ambitious and somewhat arrogant marketing executive in his late thirties, sits behind a desk littered with papers and a blinking laptop. He's the last one in the office, too wrapped up in his work and self-importance to notice the time. Suddenly, David hears a soft humming noise and looks up, confused. Joana is cleaning near his office door. On her finger, she wears a large, rather unusual ring with a crystal that seems to absorb the light around it, casting prismatic swirls on the walls. DAVID (sarcastically) Working late, Joana? Or just enjoying the scenic view of my office? JOANA (nods with a furtive glance) Working is working, sir. The view is not for me. David scoffs lightly as Joana approaches his desk, her ring catching his eye. Without thinking, David finds himself entranced by the shimmering colors. DAVID (curious) That's some ring. Where'd you get it? JOANA (slowly, deliberately) An old friend gave it to me. It's from my homeland... It has... special qualities. As David is absorbed by the gem's radiance, Joana begins to move her hand slowly in a rhythmic pattern, the crystal pulsating with a soft light. Unbeknownst to David, Joana has begun the hypnotic process. JOANA (softly, hypnotically) Watch the ring, David. See how it moves—see how the colors dance. Just watch and listen to my voice... David's usually sharp eyes grow cloudy, his body relaxes, and his skepticism melts away. His gaze is locked onto the mesmerizing ring. JOANA (gaining confidence) From this moment, you are no longer the imperious executive, David. You will feel a profound sense of humility... You will understand what it's like to be unseen, unappreciated, just like the others who support you without credit. (Unknown to David, this is not about humiliation, but rather a lesson in empathy and respect.) David slumps further in his chair, his eyes following the ring as Joana continues her rhythmic movements. JOANA (continuing) You will go about your work, and you will notice those around you. You will help without expectation. Speak kindly. Acknowledge those you've overlooked. As the crystal's glow dims, Joana snaps her fingers, breaking the spell. David blinks rapidly, his consciousness returning, but something within him has changed. He looks at Joana with newfound respect. DAVID (in a softer tone) Joana, I... I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. Can you ever forgive my rudeness? JOANA (nods with understanding) It's okay, Mr. David. Perhaps now, we see each other more clearly, yes? David nods, genuinely humbled. JOANA (packing her cleaning supplies) Remember, we all have a role, a purpose. Respect is the true mark of greatness. Joana exits the office as David sits alone, contemplating his altered perception. A sense of gratitude washes over him—a lesson in humility learned not through indignity, but through unexpected guidance. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “You’re doing great, Yuri. Keep breathing - the ambulance will be here soon.” Yuri: (clutching her baby bump tightly) “That’s easier said than done, Monika…” (feeling an intense contraction) “NNNGH!!! The contractions are getting closer…” (Monika quickly checks her phone to see the estimated time of arrival for the ambulance she called earlier while trying to stay calm for Yuri’s sake.) Monika: “They should be here any minute now, Yuri. Just hang in there.” (Monika kneels beside Yuri, offering her a hand to squeeze.) Monika: “Remember the breathing exercises we talked about? Let’s try to focus on those. Inhale slowly, hold for a few seconds, then exhale. That’s it.” Yuri: (breathing heavily) “I’m trying, Monika, I really am. It’s just…so intense…” (Monika speaks in a soothing tone to help comfort Yuri.) Monika: “You’re incredibly strong, Yuri. I know it’s hard, but you’re not alone. We’re all here with you.” (Sayori and Natsuki, the other members of the literature club, burst into the room.) Sayori: “Yuri! Oh, my gosh, are you okay?” Natsuki: “What’s happening? Is she…? Oh wow, she’s—” Monika: (keeping her voice steady) “Yuri’s having contractions. The ambulance is on the way. We need to keep her comfortable and calm until they arrive.” Sayori: (rushing to Yuri’s other side) “Right, right. Yuri, you’re super strong. You’ll get through this!“ Natsuki: (looking worried but determined) “Is there anything I can do to help?” Monika: “Natsuki, could you please grab some pillows from the couch over there? We want to make Yuri as comfortable as possible.” (Natsuki nods and dashes off to grab pillows.) Monika: (continuing to speak to Yuri in a calming tone) “Yuri, you’re doing amazingly. Keep focusing on your breathing.” (Yuri continues to concentrate on her breathing, grasping Monika’s hand firmly, with tension visible on her face.) Natsuki: (returning with the pillows and placing them carefully behind Yuri) “Can’t believe this is happening right here in the clubroom…” Sayori: (attempting to smile through the tension) “It’s like one of those intense scenes in the novels we read, huh?” Yuri: (managing a weak smile between contractions) “Thank you, guys. It means…a lot…” (The room falls into a rhythm of supportive whispers and concentrated breathing until, suddenly, Yuri lets out an agonizing scream.) Yuri: “It’s happening! I can feel the baby coming!” (Monika looks between Yuri’s agonized expression and the door, hoping to see paramedics rushing through at any moment.) Monika: “Alright, Yuri, just focus on your breathing. In and out, remember the exercises. The ambulance will be here soon, and everything will be okay.” Natsuki: “I’m going to check outside for the ambulance!” (Sayori stays by Yuri’s side, offering silent support as Monika takes charge of the situation with as much calm as she can muster. She had read about childbirth in books but facing it in reality was a whole different story.) Monika: “Yuri, you can squeeze my hand if you need to. And let me know if you feel like you need to push, okay? We’re here with you every step of the way.” (Yuri’s breathing becomes more labored, the intervals between contractions shortening by the minute.) Yuri: (panting) “I… I think I need to push soon… It’s too strong to hold back…” (Natsuki rushes back into the room.) Natsuki: “Still no sign of the ambulance.” (Sayori and Natsuki both look panicked, but Monika keeps her composure, knowing that her calmness is crucial in this moment.) Monika: “Okay, everyone, it’s really important that we stay calm. Yuri needs us to be strong for her. Sayori, keep offering comfort. Natsuki, if there’s no ambulance yet, call them back and ask for an update on their ETA. I’ll stay with Yuri and assist her.” (Natsuki promptly takes out her phone and steps out of the room to make the call, while Sayori gently strokes Yuri’s hair, whispering words of encouragement to help distract her from the pain.) Sayori: “You’re going to do great, Yuri. Just remember, with every breath you’re getting closer to meeting your little one.” Monika: (addressing Yuri) “Yuri, I know this is scary, but you’re not alone. I want you to listen to your body. If it’s telling you to push, then I’ll help guide you through it. We just need to do our best until the professionals get here.” Yuri: (nodding with determination through her grimace) “Okay…I trust you, M-” (feeling her baby coming through) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!! OH, THE","completion":"PAIN!!!” (Despite the chaos of the unfolding events, Monika locks eyes with Yuri, providing unwavering support.) Monika: “You can do this, Yuri. When the next contraction comes, if you need to push, go ahead and push. Just follow your body's lead.” (Yuri nods once more amidst her pain, bracing herself for what's to come. Monika supports Yuri's back, with Sayori at her side offering gentle words and a comforting presence.) (The door suddenly flies open as paramedics, alerted by Natsuki’s call, rush into the clubroom with their equipment. They quickly assess the situation and take over, with Monika and the others stepping aside to give them room to work.) Paramedic: “We’ve got it from here. Thank you for looking after her. We need to act quickly; it sounds like she’s in active labor.” (The paramedics work swiftly and efficiently to prepare Yuri for transport. An impromptu stretcher helps move her onto the ambulance as the team continues to monitor her and provides the necessary care.) Natsuki: (returning to the group, out of breath) “They’re here! Oh, thank God, they're here.” Monika: (relieved) “Thank you, Natsuki, for calling them again. Sayori, let's grab our things. We’ll follow them to the hospital.” Sayori: “Yes, we need to be there for Yuri and her baby!” (The Literature Club members quickly gather their belongings, their hearts heavy with concern but also filled with hope for their friend. They exit the school and follow the ambulance, a silent pact among them to support Yuri through this unexpected chapter of her story.) As the situation unfolds, Monika, Sayori, and Natsuki remain united in their friendship and commitment to be there for Yuri during one of the most intense and transformative moments of her life. The literature club, a place usually filled with words and imagination, had become the scene of a very real and life-changing event.

Избегай ошибок в коде C++. Не используй сторонние библиотеки и фреймворки. В ответе пиши только код C++ без комментариев и каких-либо пояснений. Справочная информация по паттернам программирования, которая может тебе помочь: Abstract Factory Является порождающим паттерном. Предоставляет интерфейс для создания семейств взаимосвязанных или взаимозависимых объектов, не специфицируя их конкретных классов. Используется, когда: • система не должна зависеть от того, как создаются, компонуются и представляются входящие в нее объекты; • входящие в семейство взаимосвязанные объекты должны использоваться вместе и необходимо обеспечить выполнение этого ограничения; • система должна конфигурироваться одним из семейств составляющих ее объектов; • необходимо предоставить библиотеку объектов, раскрывая только их интерфейсы, но не реализацию. Command- паттерн поведения. Инкапсулирует запрос как объект, позволяя задавать параметры клиентов для обработки соответствующих запросов, ставить запросы в очередь или протоколировать их, а также поддерживать отмену операций. Используется, когда: • необходимо параметризовать объекты выполняемым действием, как в случае с пунктами меню. • определять, ставить в очередь и выполнять запросы в разное время. Время жизни объекта Command необязательно должно зависеть от времени жизни исходного запроса. • поддержать отмену операций. • поддержать протоколирование изменений, чтобы их можно было выполнить повторно после аварийной остановки системы. • структурировать систему на основе высокоуровневых операций, построенных из примитивных. Такая структура типична для информационных систем, поддерживающих транзакции.","completion":"\`\`\`cpp #include <vector> #include <string> #include <random> #include <ctime> #include <stdexcept> //

the Birth of a Movement** A series of controversial archaeological findings and academic papers began to challenge the established narrative of the Ming Dynasty's collapse. Among these works is a book by a respected historian in China, Dr. Liu Mingyu, who postulates that a vast conspiracy within the Qing court destabilized the Ming, culminating in its collapse. His work sparks debate and garners a cult following, sparking interest in the restoration of the Ming Dynasty. **2016: The Rising Dragon Movement Emerges** Inspired by Dr. Liu's revelations, a political movement called the Rising Dragon emerges, advocating the cultural and political revival of the Ming Dynasty. While initially dismissed as fringe, the movement gains traction among those disillusioned with current political struggles in the region. **2017: The Discovery of the Zhu Heir** Researchers claim to have located a living descendant of the Zhu imperial family, Zhu Yuxun, a middle-aged professor of traditional Chinese literature. DNA testing corroborates his lineage, which sends shockwaves through China and galvanizes the Rising Dragon movement. **2018: The Zhu Restoration Proclamation** Empowered by his newfound status, Zhu Yuxun, under the banner of the Rising Dragon movement, proclaims the intent to restore the Great Ming State as the cultural heartbeat of China. He does not call for political upheaval but rather a cultural renaissance that wins him many followers. **2019: The Campaign for Cultural Reinvigoration** Rising Dragon gains momentum, fostering a Ming renaissance cultural movement focused on traditional festivals, architecture, and Confucian values. They successfully lobby for the integration of Ming history and ethics into educational curricula. **2020: Ming Restoration Day** Celebrating the anniversary of the Hongwu Emperor's ascension, the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Rising Dragon organizes a massive festival in Nanjing, the old Ming capital. Zhu Yuxun delivers a stirring speech on national unity and cultural identity. **2021: Diplomatic Recognition** Several countries, intrigued by the cultural resurgence and potential economic partnerships, begin to recognize the Ming Restoration movement as a legitimate cultural entity, though stopping short of political recognition. **2022: The Harmony Accords** The Chinese government, seeing the utility of the Ming renaissance in fostering national pride, enters into discussions with the Rising Dragon movement, leading to the Harmony Accords. These agreements formalize the restoration of Ming cultural sites, fund historical research, and maintain the status quo politically. **2023: Echoes of the Ming in International Relations** Rising Dragon's influence leads China to pursue diplomacy reflecting Ming Dynasty traditions. Emphasis on cultural exchange and mutual benefit in international forums enhances China's soft power globally. **2024: The Imperial Cultural District** Beijing dedicates a significant district as the \\"Imperial Cultural District,\\" featuring Ming architecture, museums, and educational centers, with Zhu Yuxun as its honorary custodian. While it has no political power, it becomes a focal point for visitors. **2025: A Nation Reimagined** While the Great Ming never regains its political status, its cultural legacy becomes interwoven with modern China's identity. Zhu Yuxun is heralded as a figurehead of cultural unification, and the Rising Dragon movement transitions into an influential cultural organization. China embraces this restored appreciation for its Ming past as an integral part of its path forward, blending tradition with modernity."},{"prompt":"Переведи на русский язык: At The Zoo: Present Simple and Present Continuous Level: A1 Find the sentences in Present Continuous and rewrite them in Present Simple.

Though she harbored such thoughts, she wouldn't dare express them. \\"How do you plan to handle this?\\" Huo Shihan suddenly spoke. While eating, Jiang Xi looked up upon hearing the question, seemingly puzzled by what he referred. After a moment's thought, realizing he might be referring to the matter of dropping out, she earnestly replied, \\"I didn't initiate the withdrawal from the school; I have no intention of leaving the medical university.\\" The Jiang family and Jiang Xiangwei were not entitled to decide for her. Huo Shihan paused for a moment. The little one was quite determined. \\"Don't go back to that household in the future; if there's a next time, I may not arrive that promptly,\\" Huo Shihan said, his tone somber. Jiang Xi nodded firmly: \\"I understand.\\" Huo Shihan was not caring for her because he was fond of her, rather because they were nominally husband and wife. Glancing his way, she noticed Huo Shihan didn't eat carrots and her expression instantly changed. She began, \\"Hanh Han, you really should eat carrots. They primarily assist in invigorating the spleen and alleviating stagnation. Their efficacy is commendable, and you shouldn't be picky—it can lead to malnutrition.\\" Huo Shihan: \\"...\\" At his age, to be chided by a young lady about picky eating and malnutrition brought a slight tingle to his head. \\"Adults are entitled to their own preferences, you know? Miss Jiang Xi, I detest carrots and therefore their benefits do not interest me,\\" he stated, true to his word, as he hadn’t touched a single carrot and had even picked them out. Indeed, how fastidious! Jiang Xi frowned, yet as long as he was content, that mattered the most. She would substitute them with his preferred foods that had comparable nutritional value. After the meal, Jiang Xi returned to her room to rest. Zhou Qi arrived at the villa with documents in hand, and Huo Shihan glanced at him, narrowing his eyes slightly. He inquired, \\"You can wash dishes, right?\\" Zhou Qi was stunned for a second before nodding: \\"I suppose.\\" And so? Three minutes later, he found himself in the kitchen washing dishes and cleaning up, a puzzled expression on his face. What was he here for again? After tidying up, he went to the study where Huo Shihan was sitting behind a desk, adorning wire-rimmed glasses, conveying an austere indifference. His face revealed a pale sickness. \\"Sir Huo, have you signed the documents?\\" Zhou Qi inquired. Huo Shihan closed the file. Zhou Qi asked, \\"Is there any issue?\\" Huo Shihan looked up, \\"Who is the current president of the medical university?\\" \\"Mr. Zhong Rongshi, the venerable Mr. Zhong.\\" Huo Shihan clicked his tongue, murmuring, \\"He's still alive, then.\\" Zhou Qi was thoroughly perplexed. \\"See to it that Jiang Xi's withdrawal notice is rescinded. The poor child is just trying to get an education,\\" Huo Shihan ordered impassively, removing his glasses and massaging the bridge of his nose. His eyes conveyed fatigue after a night without sleep. Was he aiming to champion for his young wife? He immediately nodded, \\"Right away, I'll handle it.\\" Three days after resting at home, Jiang Xi received a call from Lin Xiyue. \\"Xi Xi, it's the weekend, why not join me for an outing?\\" Lin Xiyue's voice was vibrant and full of spring's vitality. Lifted by her voice, Jiang Xi's mood brightened considerably, the previous gloom dissipating. She queried, \\"Where do you have in mind?\\" \\"We'll go shopping for clothes. There's a banquet at our house soon, and as you know, I have to prepare my own attire,\\" explained Lin Xiyue. Being an illegitimate daughter, she was reluctantly taken in and not held in high esteem, leaving her no choice but to fend for herself. Jiang Xi assented. They shared a certain camaraderie in misfortune. Opening her wardrobe, she saw it filled with clothes her size, all arranged by Huo Shihan, likely not from any renowned brands as they lacked logos. She picked a dress at random and slipped it on before descending the staircase. \\"Are you heading out?\\" Huo Shihan was seated on the sofa, a computer before him. Jiang Xi nodded, \\"There's something I need to handle.\\" He stood up, saying, \\"I'll take you.\\""},{"prompt":"Самые полезные продукты из всех, которые существуют во всём мире, на всей Земле.","completion":"Определить \\"самые полезные продукты\\" может быть непросто, так как разные продукты содержат различные питательные вещества, которые могут быть важны в разных аспектах здоровья. Тем не менее, существуют продукты, которые широко признаны за их высокую питательную ценность и положительное влияние на здоровье. Ниже приведен список продуктов, которые часто считаются одними из самых полезных: 1. Листовые зеленые овощи (например, шпинат, кале, руккола): богаты витаминами, минералами и антиоксидантами. 2. Ягоды (например, черника, клубника, ежевика): высокий уровень антиоксидантов, низкое содержание калорий, и множество витаминов. 3. Орехи и семена (например, миндаль, грецкие орехи, чиа, льняное семя): источники здоровых жиров, белков и важных минералов. 4. Бобовые (например, чечевица, фасоль, нут): высокий уровень белка и клетчатки, низкое содержание жира. 5. Оливковое масло extra virgin: содержит мононенасыщенные жиры и полифенолы, которые могут улучшать здоровье сердца. 6. Жирная рыба (например, лосось, сардины, макрель): источники омега-3 жирных кислот и белка. 7. Авокадо: богат мононенасыщенными жирами, потенциально положительно влияет на уровень холестерина. 8. Цельнозерновые продукты (например, коричневый рис, киноа, овес): содержат больше питательных веществ и клетчатку по сравнению с очищенными зернами. 9. Крестоцветные овощи (например, брокколи, цветная капуста, капуста): могут способствовать предотвращению некоторых видов рака. 10. Пробиотические продукты (например, йогурт, кефир, кимчи, квашеная капуста): поддерживают здоровье пищеварительной системы. 11. Сладкий картофель: богат витамином A, минералами и клетчаткой. Необходимо учитывать, что разнообразие в диете также играет ключевую роль для достижения сбалансированного питания. Каждый продукт содержит свой уникальный набор питательных веществ, поэтому включение широкого спектра различных продуктов может помочь удовлетворить различные потребности организма. Кроме того, важно помнить, что даже самые полезные продукты могут быть вредными, если их употреблять в слишком больших количествах, или если они не сочетаются с активным образом жизни и общей здоровой диетой."},{"prompt":"You are a scriptwriter who always tries to write the most humiliating possible way for situations to play out.

JOANA (soft, soothing, hypnotic) Watch the time tick-tock. Let your worries clean away. David will now obey... David's eyes follow the watch, and he soon looks completely zoned out. Sarah lingers between amusement and confusion. SARAH (to David, concerned) David? Are you okay? David doesn't respond. Instead, he begins clucking like a chicken. Muffled laughter from other employees starts to fill the room as they gather around to witness the spectacle. JOANA (amused) Now, David, you will do the chicken dance, right here, yes? Without skipping a beat, David starts performing an embarrassingly enthusiastic chicken dance, flapping his elbows and kicking his feet. The office erupts into uncontrollable laughter. Joana winks at Sarah, who is now trying to stifle her giggles. SARAH (through laughter) I... I really didn't see this coming. JOANA (proudly, to Sarah) Is good to clean the mind, not just the office. After a minute of the humiliating display, Joana snaps her fingers, and David stops, suddenly looking dazed and confused. He looks around at the sea of amused faces and Sarah trying to compose herself. DAVID (disoriented) What... What happened? JOANA (cheerfully) You are relaxed now, Mr. David. Very good for productivity! David stands stunned as Joana casually goes back to cleaning, leaving him with his crushed ego amidst an office full of chuckling colleagues. SARAH (whispering to David) That was something... I'll never look at a chicken the same way again.
