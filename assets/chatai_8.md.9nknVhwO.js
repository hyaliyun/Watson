Since c = 2^{0.3} (or c = sqrt[10]{2^3}), and 2^3 is greater than 1, it is obvious that 2^{0.3} > 1, which implies c > 1. For d = 0.3^2, we look at 0.3, a positive number less than 1.

Therefore, this method cannot conclusively identify a rhombus. - **Option B:** Measuring if the two diagonals are equal. In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily equal; instead, they bisect each other at right angles.

Given that y_1^2 = 2x_1, the equation of the directrix for the parabola y^2 = 2x is x = -frac{1}{2}. From the definition of a parabola, the distance from point A to the focus is equal to its distance to the directrix. With |AF| = a + frac{1}{2} > 2, we conclude that a > frac{3}{2}. The distance d from point A to the axis of symmetry is y_1. Since the ratio of the distance from point A to focus F to the distance to the axis of symmetry is 9:4, we have frac{x_1 + frac{1}{2}}{y_1} = frac{9}{4}. Solving for x_1 and y_1, we get x_1 = frac{73 + 9sqrt{65}}{16}, quad y_1 = frac{9 + sqrt{65}}{4}.

This makes it easier to check if ( N ) is divisible by 111. 2. **Repetition of 111**: - If ( N ) can be grouped in a way that forms repeated segments of '111', then every three digits of ( N ) should sum to a form of ( 111 ). - The number ( N ) indeed forms such segments since it consists entirely of 1s being repeated 1998 times. - Note that ( 1998 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), so ( N ) can be viewed as ( 666 ) repetitions of the sequence ‘111’. 3. **Relating to Multiples of 37**: - Notice that ( 111 = 37 times 3 ). - Since ( 111 ) is divisible by ( 37 ), any multiple of ( 111 ) is also guaranteed to be divisible by ( 37 ). 4. **Final Verification**: - Given that ( N ) is essentially ( 666 ) repetitions of ( 111 ), it becomes clear that ( N ) is a multiple of ( 111 ). - Since ( 111 ) can be written as ( 37 times 3 ), the divisibility of ( N ) by ( 37 ) follows directly because each segment ‘111’ is a product of ( 37 ). # Conclusion: The number ( underbrace{111ldots11}_{1998 text{ ones}} ) indeed divides by ( 37 ).

Find the ratio of the area of triangle PBC to the area of triangle ABC.","completion":"Given PA + PB + PC = BC, we can infer certain relationships about the position of point P relative to triangle ABC. The point P must be located inside triangle ABC because the sum of its distances to the three vertices is equal to the length of one side of the triangle. Let's denote the areas of triangle PBC, triangle PCA, and triangle PAB as S_{PBC}, S_{PCA}, and S_{PAB}, respectively, and the area of triangle ABC as S_{ABC}. The interesting fact here is that the ratio of the areas of two triangles sharing the same height is the same as the ratio of their bases. We know that triangles triangle PBC, triangle PCA, and triangle PAB share the same heights with triangle ABC when projected onto BC, AC, and AB, respectively. Now let's look at the bases. The bases of these triangles are the distances PA, PB, and PC, respectively, and the sum of these bases is equal to BC. From here, we can establish a proportion. We have the following three proportions: frac{S_{PBC}}{S_{ABC}} = frac{PA}{BC}, quad frac{S_{PCA}}{S_{ABC}} = frac{PB}{BC}, quad frac{S_{PAB}}{S_{ABC}} = frac{PC}{BC}. Adding these proportions together, we get: frac{S_{PBC} + S_{PCA} + S_{PAB}}{S_{ABC}} = frac{PA + PB + PC}{BC} = 1. Since S_{PBC} + S_{PCA} + S_{PAB} = S_{ABC}, it means: frac{S_{PBC}}{S_{ABC}} = frac{PA}{BC}. However, we are not given PA directly. But we know: PA = BC - PB - PC. Since we are dealing with areas, and because PB + PC cannot be larger than BC for point P inside the triangle, PA must be a positive value less than BC. This means the ratio of areas we are interested in must be a proper fraction. Now, let's examine the condition: PA + PB + PC = BC. Since the sum of the lengths from P to the vertices is equal to BC, it follows that PA = BC - PB - PC. Let the lengths PA, PB, and PC be proportional to the coefficients x, y, and z respectively, such that: x + y + z = 1, and we have: PA = xBC, PB = yBC, PC = zBC, where x + y + z = 1. The areas will be proportionally the same: S_{PBC} = xS_{ABC}, S_{PCA} = yS_{ABC}, S_{PAB} = zS_{ABC}, and: S_{ABC} = S_{PBC} + S_{PCA} + S_{PAB} = xS_{ABC} + yS_{ABC} + zS_{ABC}. Simplifying this, we get: S_{ABC} = (x + y + z)S_{ABC}, which reiterates that x + y + z = 1. The ratio of the area of triangle PBC to the area of triangle ABC is thus x, which is the coefficient of BC in PA when PA = xBC. Therefore, since PA + PB + PC = BC, we get x = 1 - y - z. So the final ratio of the areas is: frac{S_{PBC}}{S_{ABC}} = boxed{1 - y - z}."},{"prompt":"30 lemons are required to make 40 gallons of lemonade.

This is a linear (and thus homogeneous of degree 1) polynomial that satisfies the condition ( f(x, y) = 1 ). 5. **Inductive Step:** - Suppose that for a set ( S = { (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ldots, (a_m, b_m) } ), there exists a homogeneous polynomial ( g(x, y) ) of degree (N) such that ( g(a_i, b_i) = 1 ) for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, m ). - We need to prove that this property holds when we add another point ((a_{m+1}, b_{m+1})) to ( S ). 6. **Addition of ((a_{m+1}, b_{m+1})):** - By Bézout's lemma, there exist integers ( A ) and ( B ) such that ( A a_{m+1} + B b_{m+1} = 1 ). - Construct the polynomial [ h(x, y) = prod_{i=1}^{m} (a_i y - b_i x). ] This polynomial is zero at each point ((a_i, b_i)), for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, m ). 7. **Constructing the New Polynomial:** - Consider the polynomial [ f(x, y) = g(x, y)^K - C cdot (A x + B y)^{K cdot deg(g) - m} h(x, y), ] where ( K geq m ) and ( C ) are integers to be determined. 8. **Ensuring Correct Values:** - To ensure that ( f(x, y) = 1 ) for all ( (a_i, b_i) in S ) and ((a_{m+1}, b_{m+1})), we must choose ( C ) and ( K ) such that: [ f(a_{m+1}, b_{m+1}) = g(a_{m+1}, b_{m+1})^K - C cdot h(a_{m+1}, b_{m+1}). ] 9. **Coprimality Argument:** - We claim that ( g(a_{m+1}, b_{m+1}) ) and ( M = h(a_{m+1}, b_{m+1}) ) are relatively prime. - If a prime ( p ) were to divide both, it would imply ( p mid b_{m+1} ) and ( p mid a_{m+1} ), contradicting their coprimality. 10. **Choosing ( K ) and ( C ):** - If ( M neq 0 ), by the Euler-Fermat theorem, there exists some ( K ) such that [ g(a_{m+1}, b_{m+1})^{varphi(|M|)} equiv 1 pmod{M}. ] - We can thus choose ( K = mvarphi(|M|) ) and an appropriate ( C ) to ensure ( f(a_{m+1}, b_{m+1}) = 1 ). - If ( M = 0 ), it directly implies ( g(a_{m+1}, b_{m+1}) = pm 1 ), and we can choose ( K = 2 ) and ( C = 0 ). 11. **Conclusion:** - By induction, we have constructed the desired polynomial ( f(x, y) ) that satisfies ( f(a_i, b_i) = 1 ) for all points in the extended set ( S ).

Then ( f(k) = 2018 ). - Since ( 2018 ) is even, ( k ) must be even, and ( f(k) = frac{k}{2} + frac{k}{g(k)} = 2018 ). 6. **Solving for ( k ):** - Let ( k = 2m ) where ( m ) is an integer. - Then ( g(k) = g(2m) = g(m) ) if ( m ) is odd. - We need ( frac{2m}{2} + frac{2m}{g(2m)} = 2018 ). - Simplifying, ( m + frac{2m}{g(2m)} = 2018 ). - Since ( g(2m) = g(m) ), we have ( m + frac{2m}{g(m)} = 2018 ). 7. **Finding ( m ):** - If ( m ) is odd, ( g(m) = m ). - Then ( m + 2 = 2018 ), so ( m = 2016 ). - Therefore, ( k = 2m = 2 times 2016 = 4032 ). 8. **Sequence Verification:** - We need to verify the sequence leading to ( 2018 ). - Starting from ( x_1 = 1 ), we need to check if ( x_n = 2018 ) for ( n ) such that ( x_{n-1} = 4032 ).

Any prime factor ( p ) must divide at least two of these integers because otherwise, the product in one subset would have more factors of ( p ) than the other subset, making it impossible for the products to be equal. 3. **Analyze the primes**: - Since there are six consecutive integers, at least one of them must be divisible by 2. - Similarly, one must be divisible by 3 and one must be divisible by 5. 4. **Prime Factor Considerations**: - Among ( n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, ) and ( n+5 ), they cover a complete residue class modulo 5.

Case 2.1: For some ( a_i, a_j in A ) other than ( c ), there exists an ( a in A ) (( a neq c, a_i, a_j )) such that ( a mid ca_i ) and ( a mid ca_j ). - Then ( a mid c cdot gcd(a_i, a_j) ) and since ( c < a ), there's a prime ( p mid a ) that ( p mid gcd(a_i, a_j) ), which is a contradiction.

Investigate the case of equality.","completion":"To show that the angle bisector from one side of a triangle is always shorter than the median from the same side, we consider a triangle ABC. Here's the step-by-step proof: 1. **Triangle Configuration and Assumptions**: Assume triangle ABC with angles beta = widehat{B} and gamma = widehat{C}. For simplicity, we assume that the triangle is acute-angled (the argument for the obtuse angle is similar and left as an exercise). Without loss of generality, let AB leq AC. Consequently, we have beta geq gamma as AB is opposite gamma, and AC is opposite beta. 2. **Notations**: - Let AD be the altitude from vertex A to side BC. - Let AE be the internal angle bisector from A. - Let AF be the median from A to the midpoint F of BC. 3. **Goal**: - We aim to show AE leq AF. It will be sufficient to show that points D, E, and F are ordered along the line segment BC. 4. **Key Properties**: - **Median Property**: Since F is the midpoint of BC, we have: [ frac{BF}{CF} = 1 ] - **Angle Bisector Theorem**: The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments created by intersection of the bisector with the opposite side is equal to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle: [ frac{BE}{CE} = frac{AB}{AC} leq 1 ] Since AB leq AC. - **Law of Sines and Cosines**: Using the Law of Sines in triangle ABD and ACD, we get the ratio of the segments formed by the altitude AD: [ frac{BD}{CD} = frac{AB cos beta}{AC cos gamma} = frac{AB}{AC} cdot frac{cos beta}{cos gamma} ] Also, since beta geq gamma, we have cos beta leq cos gamma. Therefore: [ frac{cos beta}{cos gamma} leq 1 quad Rightarrow quad frac{BD}{CD} leq frac{AB}{AC} leq 1 ] 5. **Comparing Ratios**: - From the above properties, we conclude: [ frac{BD}{CD} leq frac{BE}{CE} leq frac{BF}{CF} ] - Since the points B, D, E, and F all lie on the segment BC, their order corresponds to the lengths of the segments they create. 6. **Conclusion**: - As the ratios frac{BD}{CD} leq frac{BE}{CE} leq 1, it follows that D lies between B and E, and E lies between D and F, confirming the order on the line BC: D to E to F. - Thus, AD < AE < AF. Hence, the angle bisector AE is always shorter than the median AF. The equality holds when the triangle is isosceles at A (i.e., AB = AC).

We start by making use of the trigonometric identity sin^2 x = left(sin xright)^2 and write the function as: f(x) = 2(sin x)^2 - 6sin x + 2. Next, we aim to express it as a perfect square. We achieve this by completing the square for the quadratic expression in sin x: f(x) = 2 left[ (sin x)^2 - 3sin x right] + 2. To complete the square, we add and subtract left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 inside the square brackets: f(x) = 2 left[ (sin x)^2 - 3sin x + left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 right] - 2 left( frac{3}{2} right)^2 + 2. Simplifying, we have: f(x) = 2 left( sin x - frac{3}{2} right)^2 - frac{9}{2} + 2. Further simplification gives us: f(x) = 2 left( sin x - frac{3}{2} right)^2 - frac{5}{2}. Now, knowing that the sine function takes values in the interval [-1, 1], we can determine the maximum and minimum values of f(x) by evaluating it at the extreme values of sin x: - For sin x = -1 (the minimum value of sin x), we substitute into f(x) and obtain the maximum value for f(x): f(x_{text{max}}) = 2 left( -1 - frac{3}{2} right)^2 - frac{5}{2} = 2 left( frac{-5}{2} right)^2 - frac{5}{2} = frac{50}{4} - frac{5}{2} = 10. - For sin x = 1 (the maximum value of sin x), we substitute into f(x) and obtain the minimum value for f(x): f(x_{text{min}}) = 2 left( 1 - frac{3}{2} right)^2 - frac{5}{2} = 2 left( frac{-1}{2} right)^2 - frac{5}{2} = frac{2}{4} - frac{5}{2} = -2.

We will test each hint being correct systematically and check for consistency: Step 1: Assume Hint 1 is correct. - Hint 1 states: The correct answer is A or B. - Hint 2 must be incorrect: The correct answer cannot be C or D. This means both C and D are incorrect. - Hint 3 must be incorrect: The correct answer cannot be B.

This implies that the center is relatively close to the origin. 6. **Prove that the origin ((0, 0)) lies inside the circle:** To show that the origin lies inside the circle, we need to prove that the distance from the origin to the center ((a, b)) is less than (c).

Let's break down the steps for a detailed solution. 1. **Cube and Its Diagonals:** A cube has 12 edges and 6 faces, each face being a square. A body diagonal of a cube is a line segment that runs between two opposite vertices of the cube. A cube has four such body diagonals. A body diagonal can be seen as passing through the center of the cube. 2. **Plane Through the Center:** Consider a plane that passes through the center of the cube. Since the plane is perpendicular to one of the body diagonals, this plane will intersect other diagonals in a specific way that results in unique cross-sectional shapes. 3. **Symmetry:** Due to the symmetrical properties of the cube, the intersection of the cube with a plane passing through its center and perpendicular to a diagonal involves cutting the cube in such a way that the plane forms a regular polygon. 4. **Determination of Polygon:** When the intersecting plane is perpendicular to the cube’s diagonal and passes through its center, it intersects each of the faces of the cube. Since the plane is equidistant from the vertices it intersects, the shape must have a sort of regularity due to the symmetry of the cube's structure. 5. **Hexagonal Intersection:** The intersection plane will cut through six of the edges of the cube. These cuts are symmetrically distributed around the central axis, maintaining equal edge lengths and angles, forming a regular hexagon.

This condition is satisfied if the distance between the centers of the two circles is equal to the difference in their radii: [ R - r = 2.5 - 2 = 0.5 text{ units} ] 5. **Legs Distance from Center**: Since the desired circle touches ( AC ) and ( BC ), the center ( O ) of this circle is 2 units away from these legs. Therefore, it must be located 2 units from both ( AC ) and ( BC ) along the line perpendicular to the hypotenuse. 6. **Conclusion**: Thus, the radius ( r ) of the desired circle is 2 units, satisfying all conditions.

The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = (x+1)e^x. Since e^x > 0 for all x, and x+1 > 1 for x > 0, it follows that f'(x) > 0 for all x > 0. This means f(x) is monotonically increasing on its domain. Given e^x = xy(2ln x + ln y), we can rewrite this as xe^x = x^2yln(x^2y). This implies f(x) = f(ln(x^2y)). Since f(x) is monotonically increasing, the only way this equation can hold is if x = ln(x^2y), leading to x^2y = e^x. Simplifying, we find xy = frac{e^x}{x}.

We will analyze the possible configurations that satisfy this condition. Step 1: Understanding the Cube's Faces and Edges A cube has 6 faces and 12 edges. Each face shares an edge with four other faces. The problem requires that the sum of the labels on the edges of each face equals 2. This means each face must have exactly two edges labeled 1 and two edges labeled 0. Step 2: Counting Valid Labelings We need to count the number of ways to label the edges such that each face has two edges labeled 1. Consider one face of the cube: - There are binom{4}{2} = 6 ways to choose two edges out of four to label them with 1 (and the remaining two with 0). However, this count for one face does not directly translate to the entire cube because we must ensure that the adjacent faces also meet the labeling requirement. Step 3: Analyzing Adjacent Faces Each edge of the cube is shared by two faces. When an edge is labeled 1 for one face, it is also labeled 1 for the adjacent face sharing that edge. Thus, the labeling of one face affects the labeling of its adjacent faces. Step 4: Constructing a Valid Configuration To find a configuration that works for the entire cube, consider labeling the edges of one face and then extending this labeling consistently to adjacent faces. We must ensure that no face ends up with more than two edges labeled 1 or fewer than two. Step 5: Using Symmetry and Graph Theory The problem can be approached using graph theory by considering each face as a vertex and each shared edge as an edge in a graph. Each vertex (face) must be connected to four other vertices (faces) with exactly two edges labeled 1. This forms a bipartite graph where each part has three vertices, and each vertex in one part is connected to each vertex in the other part by exactly two edges. Step 6: Counting the Number of Valid Graphs The number of ways to label the edges of the cube such that each face has exactly two edges labeled 1 can be calculated by considering the symmetries and constraints of the cube. Each labeling corresponds to a unique bipartite graph as described. Conclusion After constructing the bipartite graph and ensuring all constraints are met, we find that there are 20 distinct ways to label the cube's edges such that each face has exactly two edges labeled 1. This includes considering all symmetries and rotations of the cube.

We aim to show that they can end up on adjacent cells after making at most two jumps in total. 2. **Same Line Argument:** - Consider the cells on this same line. By the problem statement, some cells are red and some are white. - Consequently, there are adjacent cells on this line where one is red and the other is white. - Therefore, the grasshopper can jump to the red cell, whereas the flea can jump to the white cell (assuming they were not on these cells already). - Since these two cells are adjacent, the grasshopper and flea will be positioned next to each other.

This happens when ( angle AOM = 180^circ ). 4. **Equilateral Triangle**: - To ensure that ( AB ), ( BC ), and ( CA ) are all equal, the triangle must be equilateral. - In an equilateral triangle, all internal angles are ( 60^circ ), and none of the sides are diameters of the circle. 5. **Higher Order Polygons**: - Consider any four-sided or higher polygon. Dividing it into triangles, at least one triangle would have a larger sum of the squares of the sides than a corresponding line through ( O ). - Similar logic extends to ( n )-gons with ( n > 4 ), ensuring maximality is not achieved as effectively as in a triangle. **Conclusion**: Hence, the unique optimal inscribed polygon for maximizing the sum of the squares of its sides is the equilateral triangle.

Since angle EDF = 30^{circ}, or frac{pi}{6} radians, and triangle DEF is a right triangle, DE = sqrt{3}x. 3. **Applying the sine rule in triangle BDE:** Using the sine rule, we get frac{DE}{sinfrac{pi}{3}} = frac{BD}{sin(alpha + frac{pi}{3})}, leading to BD = frac{sin(alpha + frac{pi}{3})}{sinfrac{pi}{3}} cdot sqrt{3}x. 4. **Calculating DF and applying the sine rule in triangle ADF:** In triangle ADF, DF = 2x.

The maximum value of this expression is frac{2sqrt{21}}{3} when alpha + varphi = frac{pi}{2}. 8. **Finding the minimum value of frac{S_{triangle DEF}}{S_{triangle ABC}}:** Given the maximum value of the denominator, the minimum value of frac{S_{triangle DEF}}{S_{triangle ABC}} is boxed{frac{3}{14}}."},{"prompt":"From the 6 finalists, 1 first prize, 2 second prizes, and 3 third prizes are to be awarded.

Prove that there exists a natural number n < b^2 such that the number a^n + n is divisible by b{} .","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to prove that for any natural number ( a ) and ( b > 1 ), there exists a natural number ( n < b^2 ) such that ( a^n + n ) is divisible by ( b ). In other words, we need to show that there exists ( n ) such that: [ a^n + n equiv 0 pmod{b} ] 2. **Using Euler's Theorem:** Euler's theorem states that if ( a ) and ( b ) are coprime, then: [ a^{varphi(b)} equiv 1 pmod{b} ] where ( varphi ) is the Euler's totient function. This theorem will help us in finding a suitable ( n ). 3. **Considering the Congruence:** We need to find ( n ) such that: [ a^n + n equiv 0 pmod{b} ] This can be rewritten as: [ a^n equiv -n pmod{b} ] 4. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle:** Consider the set of numbers ( {a^0, a^1, a^2, ldots, a^{b^2-1}} ) modulo ( b ). Since there are ( b^2 ) numbers and only ( b ) possible remainders when divided by ( b ), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one pair of numbers ( a^i ) and ( a^j ) (with ( i neq j )) that are congruent modulo ( b ). 5. **Finding the Suitable ( n ):** Let ( a^i equiv a^j pmod{b} ) for some ( i neq j ). Without loss of generality, assume ( i < j ). Then: [ a^i (a^{j-i} - 1) equiv 0 pmod{b} ] Since ( a ) and ( b ) are coprime, ( a^i ) is not divisible by ( b ), so: [ a^{j-i} equiv 1 pmod{b} ] Let ( k = j - i ). Then ( k ) is a multiple of the order of ( a ) modulo ( b ), which divides ( varphi(b) ). Hence, ( k leq varphi(b) ). 6. **Constructing ( n ):** We can choose ( n = k ) such that: [ a^k equiv 1 pmod{b} ] and: [ a^k + k equiv 1 + k pmod{b} ] We need ( 1 + k equiv 0 pmod{b} ), so ( k equiv -1 pmod{b} ). Since ( k leq varphi(b) ), we can find such ( k ) within the range ( 1 leq k < b ). 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, there exists a natural number ( n < b^2 ) such that ( a^n + n ) is divisible by ( b ).

Let the position vectors of the 2020 grasshoppers be {mathbf{a}_1, mathbf{a}_2, ldots, mathbf{a}_{2020}}. 3. **Symmetry Observation:** When Kolya jumps over a grasshopper at position mathbf{a}_i, he lands at a point symmetric to his starting point with respect to mathbf{a}_i. Therefore, if Kolya moves from point mathbf{p} to point mathbf{q} by jumping over the grasshopper at mathbf{a}_i, then mathbf{q} can be expressed as: mathbf{q} = 2mathbf{a}_i - mathbf{p}. 4. **Final Position Vector Calculation:** Since Kolya performs 2020 jumps in some order, let's consider mathbf{p} and mathbf{q} in terms of addition of vectors. After jumping over all grasshoppers, Kolya's final position is: mathbf{F} = 2(mathbf{a}_1 + mathbf{a}_2 + ldots + mathbf{a}_{1010}) - 2(mathbf{a}_{1011} + ldots + mathbf{a}_{2020}), assuming he starts from (0,0). This forms a linear combination of the position vectors of the grasshoppers. 5. **Distinct Sum Combinations:** Each combination of the grasshoppers' positions sum_{i=1}^{2020} c_i mathbf{a}_i where c_i is either 1 (included in one group) or -1 (included in another group) represents a different finish point. Since we need to split 2020 terms into two groups of 1010, the number of distinct ways to choose such groups is given by the binomial coefficient binom{2020}{1010}. 6. **Estimating binom{2020}{1010}:** Using properties of binomial coefficients: binom{2020}{1010} = frac{2020!}{1010! cdot 1010!}, which represents the largest number of distinct sum combinations under the arrangement rules given. # Conclusion: Thus, the maximum number N is given by the binomial coefficient binom{2020}{1010}, which represents the number of distinct permutations of the set of grasshoppers divided into two equal parts.

For simplicity, let's say we use black and white colors. 2. **Movement of the Knight:** If the knight moves from a square ((x, y)) to ((x + p, y + q)) or ((x + q, y + p)), observe the parity of both (p) and (q): - If (p) and (q) have opposite parities (one is odd and the other is even), the knight will always move from a black square to a white square and vice versa. - If (p) and (q) have the same parity (both are either odd or even), the knight will always move between squares of the same color. 3. **Implication of Parity:** For the knight to be able to reach any other square regardless of the starting position, (p) and (q) must have opposite parities. This ensures that the knight can move to both black and white squares. 4. **Linear Combinations Argument:** Consider an integer coordinate system where the current position of the knight is at ((x, y)). The position after any number of moves will be of the form: [ (x + kp + hq, y + mp + nq), quad k, h, m, n in mathbf{Z} ] Thus, the movement of the knight in the coordinate system forms linear combinations of (p) and (q). 5. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Requirement:** If (gcd(p, q) = d > 1), the coordinates (x) and (y) after any move will be multiples of (d). This means the knight is restricted to squares whose coordinates are multiples of (d), hence cannot reach every square. 6. **Mutual Primality:** To ensure the knight can reach any possible square, (p) and (q) must be coprime, i.e., (gcd(p, q) = 1). 7. **Combining Both Conditions:** To meet the requirements of the problem, both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously: - (p) and (q) must have opposite parities: (p+q) must be odd. - (p) and (q) must be coprime: (gcd(p, q) = 1). 8. **Confirmation:** We need to show that if (p) and (q) meet these conditions, the knight can indeed reach any square. Given (gcd(p, q) = 1), solutions exist for any integers (a, b) in: [ up + vq = 1 quad text{for some} quad u, v in mathbf{Z} ] Multiplying both sides by 2, we have: [ 2up + 2vq = 2 ] This implies the knight can move from ((x, y)) to ((x pm 2k, y pm 2h)) for any integers (k, h).

Suppose ( r ) is a common divisor of ( p ) and ( q ): [ p = 5^m - 1, quad q = 1 + 5^m + 5^{2m} + 5^{3m} + 5^{4m} ] - Since the differences ( q - (5^m - 1 + 5^{2m} - 1 + 5^{3m} - 1 + 5^{4m} - 1) = 5 ) are also divisible by any common divisor, we conclude that ( r ) must divide 5. - Thus ( r = 1 ) because ( 5^m - 1 ) is not divisible by 5. 5. **Checking Constraints for Prime Divisors**: - We now prove that ( p ) can be a power of two only if ( m = 1 ). - If ( m > 1 ), considering even and odd ( m ): - For ( m = 2k ): [ p = (5^k - 1)(5^k + 1) ] This product is of two adjacent even numbers, and thus ( p ) cannot be a power of 2. - For ( m = 2k + 1 ): [ p = 5^m - 5 + 4 = 5 cdot (5^k - 1)(5^k + 1) + 4 ] This expression is not divisible by 8, and thus ( p ) cannot be a power of 2 as its factor. 6. **Consolidating ( x ) and verifying ( m = 1 )**: - When ( m = 1 ): [ x = 5^5 - 1 = 3124 ] - Check the prime factors: [ 3124 = 2^2 times 11 times 71 ] - Confirm this meets the requirement of having exactly three distinct prime factors where one is 11. **Conclusion**: The value of ( x ) is: [ boxed{3124} ]"},{"prompt":"A trader sells 75 meters of cloth for Rs. 4950 at the profit of Rs. 15 per meter of cloth.

The area calculation using these distances and angles is given by: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left( left| c cot alpha right| cdot left| a cot beta right| cdot sin widehat{B} + left| a cot beta right| cdot left| b cot gamma right| cdot sin widehat{C} + left| b cot gamma right| cdot left| c cot alpha right| cdot sin widehat{A} right) ] 5. **Simplifying the Expression:** This expression can be rewritten using the area (S_{ABC}) of the original triangle (ABC): [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} S_{ABC} left( cot alpha cdot cot beta + cot beta cdot cot gamma + cot gamma cdot cot alpha right) ] 6. **Verifying the Coefficients Sum to 1:** We need to show that the coefficients inside the parentheses sum to 1. From trigonometric identities and the fact that (alpha + beta + gamma = 2pi), we have: [ cot alpha cdot cot beta + cot beta cdot cot gamma + cot gamma cdot cot alpha = 1 ] 7. **Conclusion:** Hence, the area of the triangle formed by the orthocenters of triangles (ADB), (BDC), and (CDA) is: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} S_{ABC} cdot 1 = frac{1}{2} S_{ABC} = S_{ABC} ] This shows that the area of the triangle formed by the orthocenters is equal to the area of triangle (ABC), proving that the triangles are equal in area.

What is the maximum possible radius of these circles?","completion":"Let's determine the maximum radius of circles that can be inscribed on the surface of a unit sphere without overlapping when 6 such circles are drawn. 1. **Assumption and Objective**: We assume that the maximum radius of each circle that can be inscribed on the surface without overlapping is ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ). Our goal is to show both that 6 circles of this radius can fit on the sphere’s surface, and that if the radius is larger than ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), 5 circles would already overlap. 2. **Considering a Cube within the Sphere**: Consider a cube inscribed in a unit sphere (Figure 1). Each of the cube's faces intersects the sphere, forming a circle at the intersection, which corresponds to the incircle of each face of the cube. 3. **Geometry of the Cube**: The midpoints of the edges of the cube lie on the surface of the sphere because of the cube's symmetry. The diagonal across two opposite midpoints on the same face of the cube determines a right triangle with the sphere’s center, where: [ text{Legs} = text{radius of the sphere} = 1 ] Thus, the hypotenuse (which is the diameter of the inscribed circle on the face) is: [ sqrt{2} ] Therefore, the radius of the circle formed by the intersection (which is half the diameter) is: [ frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] 4. **Feasibility of 6 Circles**: Thus, 6 circles, each with a radius of ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), can be inscribed on the sphere's surface in such a way that they do not overlap, as they will coincide with the circles formed at the cube’s faces. 5. **Analyzing Larger Radii**: Suppose we attempt to place 5 such circles of a radius greater than ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) on a unit sphere without overlapping. Each such placement ensures that the circle centers are distinct points on the sphere's surface. The maximum possible distance (great circle distance) between any two points (centers of circles) on the unit sphere must be assessed. 6. **Surface Geodesics and Distances**: Considering points ( A, B, C, D, ) and ( E ) on the sphere, we draw three mutually perpendicular great circles through ( A ) and ( B ), dividing the sphere's surface into 8 spherical triangles, each with angles of ( frac{pi}{2} ), having side lengths ( frac{pi}{2} ) on the surface (Figure 2). 7. **Proving Minimum Distance**: Using spherical geometry, we state the theorem that any geodesic triangle’s maximum side’s length is the maximum distance between any two points within that triangle. Here, the diameter ( frac{pi}{2} ) is the maximum side length: [ text{If any two points } P text{ and } Q text{ are within a spherical triangle, the distance } PQ leq frac{pi}{2}. ] 8. **Implications on Circle Radii**: If 5 points fall on the 8 spherical triangles, at least one triangle (section) will contain at least 2 points. Consequently, the maximum geodesic distance between any two points will be bounded by ( frac{pi}{2} ). Thus, circles formed with radii exceeding ( frac{frac{pi}{2}}{2} = frac{pi}{4} approx 0.785 ) will start overlapping. 9. **Conclusion**: Hence, it is indeed possible to position exactly 6 circles with a radius of ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) on a unit sphere without overlap. Any larger radius will cause the circles to overlap even with fewer placements. [ boxed{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let (ABC) be a triangle and (D) be the midpoint of (BC).

If we prove this, then by repeatedly applying this result, we can show the generalized result for any segment. 1. **Consider the given five-digit number:** [ N = 10^4 a + 10^3 b + 10^2 c + 10 d + e ] where (a, b, c, d, e) are digits (possible values are 0-9).

Hence, (Delta x^n) has a leading term reduction: [ Delta x^n = x^n - (x^n - n x^{n-1} + cdots + (-1)^n) ] 6. **Iterate the difference operator**: Repeated application of (Delta) gives: [ Delta^n x^n = n! ] Every iteration reduces the polynomial's degree by one, and after (n) iterations, only the constant term remains which corresponds to (n!). 7. **Connection to the given sum**: Note that the expression (sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i binom{n}{i} (x-i)^n) is exactly (Delta^n (x^n)). 8. **Result**: Therefore, (Delta^n x^n = n!).

For each set of 3 items out of 5, there are: [ binom{5}{3} = 10 ] ways to choose the items. 3. **Count the Permutations That Satisfy the Condition**: For any chosen triplet ( (A, B, C) ), there are ( 3! = 6 ) permutations of the triplet.

Point (M) lies on the diameter (AB) but is not the center (O). (P) and (Q) are arbitrary points on the circumference of (S) such that (PM) and (QM) form equal angles with the diameter (AB). 2. **Inscribed Quadrilateral Formation**: We need to show that the quadrilateral (PQOM) is cyclic, meaning there exists a circle passing through points (P), (Q), (O), and (M). 3. **Equal Angle Criterion**: To be a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles of the quadrilateral must sum up to (180^circ). We need to show this relationship holds for angles involving (M), (O), (P), and (Q). 4. **Utilize Thales' Theorem**: Recall Thales' theorem states that if (A) and (B) are endpoints of a diameter and (P) is any other point on the circle, then (angle APB) is a right angle ((90^circ)). In this context, (M) lies on the diameter (AB). Since (P) and (Q) are points on the circumference, angles (angle AMP) and (angle AMQ) share this property but are not necessarily right angles.

Since the base of the logarithm is frac{1}{2}, which is less than 1, the logarithm function is defined only when its argument is positive. Thus, we need to find the values of x for which x^2 - 2x - 3 > 0. Factoring the quadratic x^2 - 2x - 3, we have (x + 1)(x - 3) > 0. Solving this inequality, we find the domain of f(x) to be (-infty, -1) cup (3, +infty). **Step 2: Monotonicity of inner and outer functions** Next, we analyze the monotonicity of the inner function t = x^2 - 2x - 3 and the outer function y = log_{frac{1}{2}} t. The inner function t = x^2 - 2x - 3 is a quadratic function. Its leading coefficient is positive, so it is decreasing on the interval (-infty, -1) and increasing on the interval (3, +infty). The outer function y = log_{frac{1}{2}} t is a logarithmic function with a base less than 1, so it is a decreasing function. **Step 3: Monotonicity of the composite function** Now, we use the rule that the composite function is increasing if the inner and outer functions have opposite monotonicity and decreasing if they have the same monotonicity. Since the inner function t = x^2 - 2x - 3 is decreasing on the interval (-infty, -1) and the outer function y = log_{frac{1}{2}} t is decreasing, their composite function f(x) = log_{frac{1}{2}}(x^2 - 2x - 3) is increasing on the interval (-infty, -1).

Let's analyze each case: when n is odd and when n is even. 1. **Case when ( n ) is odd**: Let n geq 3 be an odd natural number. We first show that no two diagonals can intersect at right angles. Given that the regular n-gon is inscribed in a circle, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem (Peripheriesatz) and symmetry, the angle between any two non-adjacent sides from any vertex is (frac{180^circ}{n}). Suppose we have a right triangle formed by two vertices and a diagonal intersection point inside the polygon. In such a case, for integers ( a ) and ( b ), we must have: [ (a + b) cdot frac{180^circ}{n} = 90^circ ] Thus, [ n = 2(a + b) ] Since ( n ) is odd, the above equation cannot hold. Therefore, there can be no right-angle intersections between diagonals if ( n ) is odd. **Lemma 0.1**: In a (not necessarily regular) convex n-gon, at most n-3 diagonals can be drawn such that no two diagonals intersect inside the polygon. **Proof by strong induction**: - Base case: For ( n = 3 ), this is obviously true. - Inductive step: Assume the lemma holds for all ( k leq n-1 ). Now consider a convex n-gon. Drawing one diagonal divides the n-gon into two smaller polygons: an a-gon and a b-gon where ( a + b = n+2 ) and ( a, b < n ). Any additional diagonal that connects a vertex of the a-gon with a vertex of the b-gon would intersect the initial diagonal. Thus, we can consider the two polygons separately. By the induction hypothesis, the number of additional diagonals in each polygon is at most (a-3) + (b-3) = n-4. Including the initial diagonal, we get at most n-3 diagonals. Therefore, the maximum number of diagonals that can be drawn in an odd n-gon without any intersections is n-3. This is always possible by drawing all diagonals from one vertex to all other vertices. 2. **Case when ( n ) is even**: If we need more than n-3 lines, we require an intersection point. Consider two \\"start diagonals\\" that intersect at right angles, dividing the n-gon into four sectors. An additional diagonal can be formed either: (a) with two points from the same sector, or (b) with two points from adjacent sectors. Any such diagonal would intersect one of the initial diagonals at right angles, thus being parallel to the other. Two opposing sectors cannot be connected without intersecting the two initial diagonals and not at right angles. Thus, in a valid partition (one where the diagonals form a grid inside the polygon), these parts cannot be cut any further. Consider a valid partition along with the initial right-angle diagonals. This setup divides the n-gon into k sections with (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k) vertices each. Each section forms a convex (a_i + 2)-gon in which no two diagonals intersect at right angles. This is supported by the fact that any right-angle intersection within one of these sections would make one section cover more than half the circumference, which is impossible. According to Lemma 0.1, within each section, the maximum number of diagonals is (a_i - 1), plus one edge which is a side of the (a_i + 2)-gon but not of the n-gon. Thus, each section has at most a_i diagonals. Additionally, each point in the grid structure can be part of at most two diagonals, except the outermost points in each grid direction (contributing only once). Counting all diagonals gives us: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} a_i + left(n - sum_{i=1}^{k} a_i - 2 right) = n - 2 ] Hence, the maximum number of diagonals that can be drawn in an even ( n )-gon, ensuring intersections occur at right angles, is n-2: [ boxed{n-2} ]"},{"prompt":"w many twodigit positive integers have at least one 5 as a digit?","completion":"1. **Count integers with 5 in the tens place:** Numbers from 50 to 59 are valid, which gives us 10 integers (50, 51, 52, ..., 59). 2. **Count integers with 5 in the units place:** This includes numbers ending in 5 for every ten from 15 up to 95.

The total cost of purchasing these T-shirts is 6000 yuan, with type A costing 45 yuan each and type B costing 60 yuan each, leading to the equation 45x + 60y = 6000. Solving this system of equations: - From the first equation, we have y = 120 - x. - Substituting y in the second equation gives us 45x + 60(120 - x) = 6000. - Simplifying, we get 45x + 7200 - 60x = 6000. - This simplifies further to -15x = -1200, and solving for x gives us x = 80. - Substituting x = 80 back into y = 120 - x, we find y = 40. Therefore, the quantities purchased are x = 80 for type A and y = 40 for type B. The profit made from selling all the T-shirts is calculated as follows: - Profit from type A T-shirts: (66 - 45) times 80 = 21 times 80 = 1680 yuan. - Profit from type B T-shirts: (90 - 60) times 40 = 30 times 40 = 1200 yuan. - Total profit: 1680 + 1200 = 2880 yuan. Therefore, the total profit made after selling all the T-shirts is boxed{2880} yuan.

The condition given is 150 - m leqslant 2m, which simplifies to m geqslant 50. The profit W can be calculated as follows: - For type A T-shirts, the profit per piece is (66 - 45 - 5) = 16 yuan. - For type B T-shirts, the profit per piece is (90 - 60 - 10) = 20 yuan. - Therefore, W = 16m + 20(150 - m) = 16m + 3000 - 20m = -4m + 3000 for 150 geqslant m geqslant 50. # ② Comparison of Profits: The profit from the second purchase, W = -4m + 3000, is a linear function that decreases as m increases, since the coefficient of m is negative. To find the maximum profit, we set m = 50 (the minimum value of m that satisfies the given condition), which gives us: - W_{max} = -4 times 50 + 3000 = -200 + 3000 = 2800 yuan. Since the maximum profit from the second purchase, 2800 yuan, is less than the profit from the first purchase, 2880 yuan, it is concluded that the profit from the second purchase cannot exceed the profit from the first purchase. Therefore, the maximum profit from the second purchase is boxed{2800} yuan, which confirms that the profit from the second purchase cannot exceed the profit from the first purchase."},{"prompt":"The graph shows the total distance Sam drove from 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. How many miles per hour is the car's average speed for the period from 6 a.m. to 12 p.m.?

Given the constraints, the minimum n that can accommodate all conditions without contradiction is when there are days with both sunny mornings and afternoons, rainy mornings with sunny afternoons, and rainy mornings (leading to a total greater than the sum of unique mornings and afternoons). - Therefore, the correct answer, considering the logical distribution of sunny and rainy periods to minimize overlap and meet all conditions, is boxed{text{B}}"},{"prompt":"Determine all real values of x for which [frac{1}{sqrt{x} + sqrt{x 2}} + frac{1}{sqrt{x} + sqrt{x + 2}} = frac{1}{4}.]","completion":"To determine all real values of ( x ) for which [ frac{1}{sqrt{x} + sqrt{x - 2}} + frac{1}{sqrt{x} + sqrt{x + 2}} = frac{1}{4}, ] we will follow these steps: 1. **Combine the fractions:** [ frac{1}{sqrt{x} + sqrt{x - 2}} + frac{1}{sqrt{x} + sqrt{x + 2}} = frac{1}{4} ] Let ( a = sqrt{x} ), ( b = sqrt{x - 2} ), and ( c = sqrt{x + 2} ).

Each of these equilateral triangles is then further bisected to yield 12 smaller congruent triangles. - These triangles created by bisecting the equilateral triangles have angles of 30^circ, 60^circ, and 90^circ. 2. **Formation of Right Triangles**: - We aim to form right-angled triangles using these small 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangles. A 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle has sides in the ratio 1 : sqrt{3} : 2. 3. **Example Formations**: - Motojmoj can create right triangles using different combinations of these 12 triangles. Here are four possible constructions: - **Using 1 triangle**: This is a single 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle on its own. - **Using 3 triangles**: For example, arranging three 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangles along their short sides can form a larger triangle whose angles remain 30^circ, 60^circ, and 90^circ. - **Using 4 triangles**: Mojmír can arrange four small triangles to form a larger triangle that maintains the right angle at the vertices of two combined triangles. - **Using 9 triangles**: By strategically placing 9 small triangles, we can form a much larger right-angled triangle by ensuring the sides align properly to maintain the right angle. 4. **Diagrams**: - The following images show how the individual triangles can be combined to form different right-angled triangles. | Using 1 Triangle | Using 3 Triangles | Using 4 Triangles | |------------------|-------------------|-------------------| | ![1-triangle](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_d9ed5968656390921398g-4.jpg?height=100&width=100&top_left_y=194&top_left_x=867) | ![3-triangles](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_d9ed5968656390921398g-4.jpg?height=100&width=100&top_left_y=728&top_left_x=450) | ![4-triangles](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_d9ed5968656390921398g-4.jpg?height=100&width=100&top_left_y=2214&top_left_x=867) | 5. **Justification**: - Each constructed triangle is valid because they all utilize 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangles. The longest side of these triangles is equal to the side of the original hexagon, and the shortest side is half the length of the hexagon's side. 6. **Alternative Division and Attempted Constructions**: - Another possible division of the hexagon into 12 congruent parts: - Splitting the regular hexagon into 12 triangles differently can result in congruent triangles, each with angles 120^circ, approximately 40.9^circ, and approximately 19.1^circ. - However, these cannot form a right triangle. 7. **Other Polygonal Divisions**: - A hexagon can also be divided into 12 equal parts that are non-triangular. Forming right triangles from these divisions is more complex and may not always be feasible.

Now we can set up an equation to find the number of yellow marbles: Y (yellow) + Y/2 (green) + 15 (red) + 15 (blue) = 60 (total marbles) Combining like terms, we get: Y + Y/2 = 60 - 15 - 15 Y + Y/2 = 30 Multiplying every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get: 2Y + Y = 60 3Y = 60 Dividing both sides by 3, we find: Y = 60 / 3 Y = 20 So, there are boxed{20} yellow marbles in the bag."},{"prompt":"f the real and imaginary parts of both frac{z}{20} and frac{20}{z} are between 0 and 1 (exclusive), find the area of the figure formed by the corresponding points of such complex numbers z.","completion":": Given frac{z}{20} and frac{20}{z}, we need to determine the area of the region formed by the complex number z such that both the real and imaginary parts of frac{z}{20} and frac{20}{z} lie between 0 and 1.

The largest perfect square less than or equal to 200 is 14^2 = 196. Thus, there are 14 perfect squares between 1 and 200. Next, identify the perfect cubes. The largest perfect cube within 200 is 5^3 = 125 because 6^3 = 216 > 200. Hence, there are 5 perfect cubes between 1 and 200. For a number to be both a perfect square and a perfect cube, it must be a perfect sixth power. The largest sixth power smaller than 200 is 2^6 = 64. There is only 1 sixth power (not multiple sixths powers less than or equal to 200), namely 2^6 = 64. The count of numbers which are perfect squares or perfect cubes equals the number of perfect squares (14) plus the number of perfect cubes (5) subtract the double-counted sixth power (1), yielding 14 + 5 - 1 = 18.

Without loss of generality, let: [ x = 2m + 1, quad y = 2n + 1, quad z = 2k ] where (m, n, k) are integers. We then have: [ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (2m+1)^2 + (2n+1)^2 + (2k)^2 ] 3.

Let ( mathrm{B} ) be the set of locks. Define a function ( f: A rightarrow mathrm{B} ) that maps each possible combination of three guards to a lock that these three guards do not have a key to. 3. Each lock must correspond to a unique combination of three guards to ensure that no subset of three guards can open the lock, and at least four guards are needed to open it. Thus, the function ( f ) is well-defined and each value (lock) is taken not more than once. 4. This ensures the total number of locks must be at least (10) since we have exactly 10 unique combination triples of guards. 5. Next, we need to show that it is possible for exactly (10) locks to meet the requirements. 6. Number the 10 locks from 1 to 10 and distribute the keys to each guard as follows: - (a: {1, 2, 3, 4}) - (b: {4, 5, 6, 7}) - (c: {1, 5, 8, 9}) - (d: {2, 6, 8, 10}) - (e: {3, 7, 9, 10}) 7. Check that this configuration meets all conditions: - Each guard has exactly (4) keys. - Any three guards do not have the key to at least one unique lock. For example: - (f(a, b, c) = 10) - (f(a, b, d) = 9) - ( text{and so on} ) - Therefore, all combinations of three guards lack a key to a unique lock, so no combination of three guards can open all locks. 8. Lastly, we verify that the minimal number of keys assigned to the guards is in total (4 times 5 = 20). This can be cross-verified by counting the total unique locks for the given distribution. Thus, the minimal number of locks needed is indeed (10): [ boxed{10} ]"},{"prompt":"3x x is not less than 10 x is greater than 5 Find the correct value for x.","completion":"1. **Analyze the first statement:** - The statement is \\"3x\\". - Simplify this to say that x > 35.

Find the intersection point: - Solve arccos x = arctan x. - Substituting typical values like 0 and 1 into arccos and arctan doesn't give easy answers, so this equation requires numerical or graphical methods to find the exact intersection point. - Suppose the intersection happens at x = c. 3.

Notice that we can rearrange and complete the square on the left hand side: [ m^2 + 18m + c = (m+9)^2 - 81 + c ] For ( m^2 + 18m + c ) to be a perfect square, ( (m+9)^2 - 81 + c ) must be a perfect square.

By definition, for every integer ( m ), both of the following must be perfect squares: [ m^2 + 18m + c = k^2 ] [ m^2 + 18m + c' = k'^2 ] Subtracting these two equations: [ k^2 - k'^2 = (m^2 + 18m + c) - (m^2 + 18m + c') = c - c' ] From the difference of squares: [ (k - k')(k + k') = c - c' ] Since ( c ) and ( c' ) are both constant, ( c - c' ) is some fixed non-zero constant integer. The important observation here is that ( (k - k')(k + k') = c - c' ) should be valid for all integers ( m ). However, the values of ( k ) and ( k' ) grow arbitrarily large as ( m ) varies, and thus, their differences ( (k - k') ) and sums ( (k + k') ) vary widely. The differences between successive perfect squares are the sequence of odd numbers: [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ldots ] As those differences grow without bound, eventually these differences will all exceed ( |c - c'| ). At this point, no pair of perfect squares can maintain a fixed difference ( c - c' ).

The mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers in the set. The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. If there is an even number of numbers, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. The set h has 6 numbers, so the median will be the average of the 3rd and 4th numbers when they are arranged in order. Let's arrange the numbers in ascending order, assuming x is less than 18 (we will check if x is greater than 18 later): If x < 18, the ordered set is {1, x, 18, 20, 29, 33}.

We need to show that there exists a subset ( M_k subseteq X ) with at least ( lfloor log_2 n rfloor + 1 ) elements that contains no subset in ( F_k ). 2. **Subset of ( k-1 ) elements:** Consider a subset of ( X ) with ( k-1 ) elements. This subset can be a subset of at most one ( k )-element subset in ( F_k ). This is because if it were a subset of two different ( k )-element subsets in ( F_k ), those two subsets would share ( k-1 ) elements, which contradicts the condition that any two subsets in ( F_k ) have at most ( k-2 ) elements in common. 3. **Bounding the size of ( F_k ):** Each ( k )-element subset in ( F_k ) has exactly ( k ) subsets of size ( k-1 ). Therefore, the total number of ( k-1 ) element subsets in ( X ) is at most ( k times |F_k| ). Since there are ( binom{n}{k-1} ) such subsets in ( X ), we have: [ k times |F_k| leq binom{n}{k-1} ] Thus, [ |F_k| leq frac{1}{k} binom{n}{k-1} ] 4. **Choosing ( t = lfloor log_2 n rfloor + 1 ):** Let ( t = lfloor log_2 n rfloor + 1 ).

Since it takes 30 minutes to fill the tank when B is used for the first half of the time and then A and B together for the other half, we can say that B is used for 15 minutes and then A and B together for the next 15 minutes. In the first 15 minutes, pipe B fills ( frac{15}{40} ) of the tank. The rate at which A and B together fill the tank is ( frac{1}{t} + frac{1}{40} ) of the tank per minute. In the next 15 minutes, A and B together fill the remaining part of the tank, which is ( 1 - frac{15}{40} = frac{25}{40} = frac{5}{8} ) of the tank. So, we have the equation: ( left( frac{1}{t} + frac{1}{40} right) times 15 = frac{5}{8} ) Now, let's solve for ( t ): ( frac{15}{t} + frac{15}{40} = frac{5}{8} ) ( frac{15}{t} + frac{3}{8} = frac{5}{8} ) ( frac{15}{t} = frac{5}{8} - frac{3}{8} ) ( frac{15}{t} = frac{2}{8} ) ( frac{15}{t} = frac{1}{4} ) ( t = 15 times 4 ) ( t = 60 ) So, it takes pipe A boxed{60} minutes to fill the tank alone."},{"prompt":"an isosceles triangle, one of the angles opposite an equal side is 50^{circ}.

This includes having pathways for movement from any parked position. 5. **Illustrative Explanation**: - Based on our exploration, positioning 28 cars can be achieved as depicted in Figure 4. - Arrange cars such that alternating rows or columns are left empty or partially filled to guarantee pathway availability. 6. **Conclusion**: - The optimal arrangement allows 28 cars to be parked following the principle that any car can exit irrespective of others being parked.

Solving: [ 1 + x^2 y^4 + x^4 y^2 = 3 x^2 y^2 ] For (x = 1) and (y = 1): [ 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ] The equation is satisfied, hence: [ P(1, 1) = 4 + 1^2 cdot 1^4 + 1^4 cdot 1^2 - 3 cdot 1^2 cdot 1^2 = 4 + 1 + 1 - 3 = 3 ] Therefore, the minimum value of (P(x, y)) is: [ boxed{3} ] 2. **Proving that the Polynomial Cannot be Represented as a Sum of Squares**: a) Assume the contrary, that it is possible to express (P(x, y)) as a sum of squares: [ P(x, y) = g_1^2(x, y) + g_2^2(x, y) + ldots + g_n^2(x, y) ] where (g_i(x, y)) are polynomials. b) Consider (P(x, 0)) and (P(0, y)): [ P(x, 0) = 4 ] [ P(0, y) = 4 ] c) For (P(x, 0) = 4) and (P(0, y) = 4), the polynomials (g_i(x, y)) cannot contain terms of the forms (ax^k) or (by^k), i.e., they cannot have terms involving (x) or (y) individually; it implies that (g_i(x, y)) can only consist of terms (c), constants. d) However, since (P(x, y)) contains the term (-3x^2 y^2) with a negative coefficient, and no sum of squares is capable of generating a negative term as a result, the expression is not possible.

For the two-point questions: There are 30 questions worth 2 points each, so the total points from these questions is: 30 questions * 2 points/question = 60 points For the four-point questions: There are 10 questions worth 4 points each, so the total points from these questions is: 10 questions * 4 points/question = 40 points Now, we add the points from both types of questions together to get the total points for the test: 60 points (from two-point questions) + 40 points (from four-point questions) = 100 points Therefore, the test is worth a total of boxed{100} points."},{"prompt":"There are four propositions as follows: 1. If proposition P: forall x in mathbb{R}, sin x leq 1, then neg P: forall x in mathbb{R}, sin x > 1; 2. There exist alpha, beta in mathbb{R} such that sin(alpha + beta) = sin alpha + sin beta; 3. If {a_n} is a geometric sequence; A: m+n=p+q (m, n, p, q in mathbb{N}^*) B: a_m cdot a_n = a_p cdot a_q, then A is a necessary and sufficient condition for B; 4. Let p, q be simple propositions, if p ∨ q is a false proposition, then neg p land neg q is a true proposition. Among these, the numbers of the true propositions are.","completion":"To solve this, we need to understand the relationship between universal and existential propositions for 1, use special angles to judge for 2, utilize the properties of geometric sequences to transform and then judge for 3, and use the relationship of propositions containing logical connectors to judge for 4. If proposition P: forall x in mathbb{R}, sin x leq 1, then neg P: exists x in mathbb{R}, sin x > 1, so 1 is incorrect; Assuming beta = 0, alpha in mathbb{R}, it is obvious that sin(alpha + beta) = sin alpha + sin beta holds, so 2 is correct; Since {a_n} is a geometric sequence, let the first term be a and the common ratio be b, from a_m cdot a_n = a_p cdot a_q we get ab^{m-1} cdot ab^{n-1} = ab^{p-1} cdot ab^{q-1} If b = 1, then m, n, p, q can be any real numbers, if b neq 1, then m+n=p+q, hence A is a sufficient but not necessary condition for B, so 3 is incorrect; By judging compound propositions, it is known that 4 is correct, so the numbers of the true propositions are 2 and 4. Therefore, the answer is boxed{2, 4}."},{"prompt":"Given that the central angle of a sector is dfrac{2pi}{3} and its radius is 3, then the area of the sector is ______.","completion":"**Analysis** This question tests the calculation of the area of a sector. Remembering the formula for the area of a sector is key to solving this problem. **Solution** Given that the central angle of the sector is 120^{circ} and its radius is 3, therefore S_{text{sector}}= dfrac{120}{360} times pi times 3^{2} = 3pi. Therefore, the answer is boxed{3pi}."},{"prompt":"f 12 machines can finish a job in 40 days, then how many more machines would be needed to finish the job in onefourth less time?","completion":"Let's first find out how many machine-days are needed to complete the job. If 12 machines can finish the job in 40 days, then the total number of machine-days required to finish the job is: 12 machines * 40 days = 480 machine-days Now, we want to finish the job in one-fourth less time than 40 days. One-fourth of 40 days is: 1/4 * 40 days = 10 days So, the new time frame to finish the job is 40 days - 10 days = 30 days. We still need 480 machine-days to complete the job, but now we want to do it in 30 days. To find out how many machines are needed to accomplish this, we divide the total machine-days by the number of days: 480 machine-days / 30 days = 16 machines Therefore, 16 machines are needed to finish the job in 30 days. Since we originally had 12 machines, the number of additional machines needed is: 16 machines - 12 machines = 4 machines So, boxed{4} more machines would be needed to finish the job in one-fourth less time."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},M=["disabled"],I={key:0},W={key:1};function L(n,e,h,m,o,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(i(!0),a(y,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(i(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",z,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
