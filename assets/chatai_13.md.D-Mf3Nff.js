We will first demonstrate that the number of divisors of a square number is always odd and then delve into the nature of these divisors when expressed in the forms ( 3k+1 ) and ( 3k+2 ). 1. **Divisors of a Square Number ( t^2 ):** Firstly, consider any square number ( t^2 ). For any divisor ( d ) of ( t^2 ), [ e = frac{t^2}{d} ] is also a divisor. Because ( d cdot e = t^2 ), this means that each divisor ( d ) pairs with another divisor ( e ). However, if ( d = e ), then ( d ) is equal to ( t ) (the square root of ( t^2 )). Hence, ( t ) is a unique divisor that pairs with itself. Therefore, the total number of divisors for ( t^2 ) is odd because the divisors are uniquely paired except for one (the square root itself). 2. **Representation in the Forms ( 3k+1 ) and ( 3k+2 ):** Let’s assume: [ t = 3^ell cdot m ] where ( m ) is not divisible by 3. Thus: [ t^2 = (3^ell cdot m)^2 = 3^{2ell} cdot m^2 ] The total set of divisors of ( t^2 ) are precisely those of ( m^2 ). Given that the total number of divisors of ( t^2 ) (or ( m^2 )) is odd, the sum of the divisors in the form ( 3k+1 ) and those in the form ( 3k+2 ) must add up to an odd number. Therefore, they cannot be equal as they would then add to an even number. 3. **Further Analysis:** Consider the prime factorization of ( m ): [ m = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} cdots p_r^{a_r} ] where none of the ( p_i ) are divisible by 3. Thus: [ m^2 = p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} cdots p_r^{2a_r} ] Here’s the crucial part: to determine when a divisor is of the form ( 3k+1 ) or ( 3k+2 ), note: - A number of the form ( 3k+1 ) when squared, and any number of the form ( 3k+2 ) when squared also result in a number of form ( 3k+1 ). - Multiplying such forms affects their structures systematically. 4. **Example Counts:** Let’s denote: - ( S_1(m^2) ) as the number of divisors of ( m^2 ) that are in the form ( 3k+1 ). - ( S_2(m^2) ) as the number of divisors of ( m^2 ) that are in the form ( 3k+2 ). Because both forms when squared or multiplied still yield a predictable form: [ S_1(m^2) neq S_2(m^2) ] We can further elaborately map the numbers of both forms, reinforcing the notion that with reference to pairing traditional divisor counting methods, forms ( 3k+1 ) inherently outweigh in representation. **Conclusion:** Thus, a square number does not exist that has the same number of positive divisors of the form ( 3k+1 ) as those of the form ( 3k+2 ).

Prove that f(0)=0.","completion":"To show that ( f(0) = 0 ), we need to demonstrate that ( f(0) ) must be divisible by all prime numbers less than 20. We do this by showing that ( f(0) ) is subject to certain conditions which force it to be 0, given the constraints on its coefficients and roots. 1. **Identify the Primes Less Than 20**: The prime numbers less than 20 are: [ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. ] 2. **Contradiction Setup**: Assume ( f(0) ) is not zero. Hence, there must be at least one prime ( p ) among those listed such that ( p ) does not divide ( f(0) ). 3. **Modular Residue Argument**: Consider the polynomial ( f(x) ) under modulo ( p ). We know that the equations: [ f(x) = x, quad f(x) = 2x, quad ldots, quad f(x) = 20x ] each have an integer root. This implies there exist integers ( k_i ) such that: [ f(k_i) = ix quad forall i in {1, 2, ldots, 20}. ] 4. **Roots and Residues**: For each ( i ), the corresponding root ( x_i ) will satisfy: [ f(x_i) equiv ix_i pmod{p}. ] Since ( f(x) equiv ix pmod{p} ) must have a root for each ( i ), and ( f(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients not divisible by ( p ), ( x_i ) mod ( p ) must cover all possible residues modulo ( p )—except zero. 5. **Pigeonhole Principle**: We have ( p ) equations ( f(x) = ix ) ( pmod{p} ), and each should yield distinct nonzero residues modulo ( p ). But there are only ( p-1 ) nonzero residues possible (1 through ( p-1 )). This is a contradiction because ( p ) equations would need ( p ) distinct residues, but only ( p-1 ) nonzero residues exist. 6. **Conclusion**: The contradiction implies that our assumption that ( f(0) ) is not divisible by ( p ) is false. Therefore, ( f(0) ) must be divisible by all primes ( p ) less than 20. Given the bounds on the coefficients of ( f(x) ) and the possible value ranges, the only integer divisible by all those primes is 0.

Apply this to cities A and B. Hence, there exists a city C such that both A and B are accessible from C. 4. **Analyze Reachability from City C:** - Since A is accessible from C, all cities accessible from A are also accessible from C (if you can get to A, you can get to any city A can get to). - Additionally, by our assumption, B is accessible from C. 5. **Reachability Comparison:** Now analyze the reachability from C and A: - C can reach all cities that A can reach (as previously stated because A is accessible from C). - Additionally, C can reach B, a city that by assumption A cannot reach. 6. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** - This means that C can reach more cities than A, violating our initial choice of A as the city from which the maximum number of cities are accessible.

Since the solid content remains the same before and after drying, we can set up the following equation: Solid content in fresh grapes = Solid content in dried grapes (100 - P)% of 5 kg = 80% of 0.625 kg Now, let's convert the percentages to decimals and solve for P: (100 - P)/100 * 5 = 0.8 * 0.625 (100 - P) * 5 = 80 * 0.625 500 - 5P = 50 -5P = 50 - 500 -5P = -450 P = -450 / -5 P = 90 Therefore, the percentage of water in fresh grapes by weight is boxed{90%} ."},{"prompt":"The set of natural numbers mathbb{N} are partitioned into a finite number of subsets.Prove that there exists a subset of S so that for any natural numbers n ,there are infinitely many multiples of n in S .","completion":"1. **Assume the contrary**: Suppose that for each subset mathcal{S}_i in the partition mathcal{S}_1, mathcal{S}_2, dots, mathcal{S}_k of mathbb{N}, there exists a natural number m_i such that there are only finitely many multiples of m_i in mathcal{S}_i. 2. **Define the product M**: Let M = m_1 cdot m_2 cdot cdots cdot m_k. Note that M is a natural number and is the product of all the m_i's. 3. **Consider the multiples of M**: The multiples of M are given by the set {M, 2M, 3M, dots}. This set is infinite because for any natural number n, nM is a multiple of M. 4. **Apply the Pigeonhole Principle**: Since the set of multiples of M is infinite and the number of subsets mathcal{S}_1, mathcal{S}_2, dots, mathcal{S}_k is finite, by the infinite pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one subset mathcal{S}_j that contains infinitely many multiples of M. 5. **Contradiction**: By our assumption, mathcal{S}_j should have only finitely many multiples of m_j. However, since M is a multiple of m_j (because M is the product of m_j and other m_i's), every multiple of M is also a multiple of m_j. Therefore, mathcal{S}_j contains infinitely many multiples of m_j, which contradicts our initial assumption. 6. **Conclusion**: The assumption that each subset mathcal{S}_i has only finitely many multiples of some m_i must be false. Therefore, there exists at least one subset S such that for any natural number n, there are infinitely many multiples of n in S.

Petya and Vasya started separately (first Petya, then Vasya), and each rode the entire path. The speed of each boy was constant on each of the two sections. It turned out that they met in the middle of the asphalt section, and also in the middle of the sandy section. Who among the boys took less time across the entire path? 1. **Introduction: Determine the meeting points**: Petya and Vasya met at two specific points: the middle of the asphalt section and the middle of the sandy section. This implies that between these moments, both boys have traveled half the length of the asphalt section and half the length of the sandy section. Consequently, the time spent by each in both halves is equal. 2. **Conclusion from the meeting points**: Since both boys traveled an equal distance between the meeting points, the time taken to travel those distances must also be equal. 3. **Total time analysis**: If the time taken by each boy to travel half of each section (asphalt and sandy) is equal, then the total time for each boy to travel the entire path can be doubled. 4. **Detailed analysis of each segment**: Let: - ( a ) be the distance of the asphalt section. - ( s ) be the distance of the sandy section. - ( v_{aP} ) and ( v_{sP} ) be Petya's speeds on the asphalt and sandy sections. - ( v_{aV} ) and ( v_{sV} ) be Vasya's speeds on the asphalt and sandy sections. Both boys met in both the middle of the asphalt section and the middle of the sandy section.

Since they met exactly at the halfway points on both sections, it holds: [ t_{aP} + t_{sP} = t_{aV} + t_{sV} ] 6. **Conclusion**: The equality confirmed by their meeting points indicates both boys spent the same amount of time traveling the same distances in each section, thus implying the total time taken to travel the entire path is the same for both boys.

It is known that the cost of each helmet is 50 yuan.<br/>(1) When the monthly profit is 5250 yuan, find the selling price of each helmet at that time.<br/>(2) At what price per helmet will the monthly sales profit be maximized? What is the maximum profit?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Finding the Selling Price for a Monthly Profit of 5250 Yuan Let's denote the reduction in price by x yuan. The original selling price of each helmet is 80 yuan, and the cost price is 50 yuan. The profit per helmet would then be (80 - x - 50) yuan. The number of helmets sold increases by 10 for every 1 yuan reduction in price, so the total number of helmets sold would be (200 + 10x). Given that the monthly profit is 5250 yuan, we can set up the equation based on the profit formula: [ (80 - x - 50)(200 + 10x) = 5250 ] Simplifying the equation: [ 30(200 + 10x) - x(200 + 10x) = 5250 ] [ 6000 + 300x - 200x - 10x^2 = 5250 ] [ -10x^2 + 100x + 6000 = 5250 ] [ -10x^2 + 100x + 750 = 0 ] Dividing the entire equation by -10: [ x^2 - 10x - 75 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find two values for x, which are x_1 = 15 and x_2 = -5. Since the reduction in price cannot be negative, we discard x_2 = -5. Therefore, the reduction in price is 15 yuan, and the selling price of each helmet at that time is: [ 80 - 15 = 65 text{ yuan} ] So, the selling price of each helmet for a monthly profit of 5250 yuan is boxed{65 text{ yuan}}. Part 2: Maximizing Monthly Sales Profit Let the reduction in price be x yuan, and the monthly profit be y yuan. The profit formula based on the reduction in price is: [ y = (80 - x - 50)(200 + 10x) ] Simplifying, we get: [ y = -10(x - 5)^2 + 6250 ] This equation represents a parabola opening downwards, indicating that the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of the parabola, given by x = 5, actually represents the turning point for the profit function. However, since the price reduction should not be less than 10 yuan, we set x = 10 to find the maximum profit within the given constraints. Substituting x = 10 into the profit equation: [ y = -10(10 - 5)^2 + 6250 = -10(25) + 6250 = 6000 ] Therefore, when each helmet is sold for 70 yuan (since 80 - 10 = 70), the monthly sales profit is maximized.

For the line to pass through the first quadrant, the slope k must be positive.

Since a dice has 6 faces, rolling it twice would give us a total of 6 times 6 = 36 possible outcomes. This will be our denominator for calculating probabilities. **For Event A (Both numbers are even):** The even numbers on a dice are 2, 4, and 6. When considering both rolls to be even, we can pair each even number with every other even number, including itself. This gives us the pairs (2,2), (2,4), (4,2), (4,4), (2,6), (6,2), (6,4), (4,6), and (6,6). Counting these, we find there are 9 such events. Thus, the probability of event A happening is P(A) = dfrac{9}{36} = dfrac{1}{4}. **For Event B (The sum of the numbers is odd):** An odd sum occurs when we pair an even number with an odd number. The odd numbers on a dice are 1, 3, and 5. Pairing each odd number with each even number (and vice versa), we get the pairs (1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), (3,2), (3,4), (3,6), (4,1), (4,3), (4,5), (5,2), (5,4), (5,6), (6,1), (6,3), and (6,5). Counting these, we find there are 18 such events. Thus, the probability of event B happening is P(B) = dfrac{18}{36} = dfrac{1}{2}. **For Event C (The sum of the numbers is less than 13):** Given that the highest number on a dice is 6, the maximum sum we can get from rolling the dice twice is 6 + 6 = 12. This means that all possible outcomes will result in a sum less than 13. Therefore, the probability of event C happening is P(C) = dfrac{36}{36} = 1. **For Event D (The sum of the numbers is less than 2):** The minimum sum we can get from rolling the dice twice is 1 + 1 = 2. There are no outcomes where the sum is less than 2, making this an impossible event. Therefore, the probability of event D happening is P(D) = dfrac{0}{36} = 0.

Therefore, the lines f, g, and h provide the directions of all edges of P. Each set of parallel edges lies in planes that can be identified by choosing additional points and constructing auxiliary lines parallel to the given ones. 3. **Constructing Planes of the Parallelepiped** Identify planes parallel to each face of the parallelepiped. This can be achieved as follows: - Through any chosen point C, draw lines f', g', and h' parallel to the given lines f, g, and h. - Determine planes S_1, S_2, and S_3 which contain pairs of these constructed lines: (f', g'), (g', h'), and (h', f') respectively. 4. **Determining Opposite Planes** To ensure the constructed parallelepiped's faces are correctly aligned: - For the plane through f and parallel to S_1, construct the planes Sigma_{11} and Sigma_{12}, each parallel to S_1 and containing the other lines g and h respectively. - Similarly, construct Sigma_{21} and Sigma_{22} for the planes through g and parallel to S_2, and Sigma_{31} and Sigma_{32} through h and parallel to S_3. 5. **Finalizing the Parallelepiped** Collectively, these six planes Sigma_{11}, Sigma_{12} (parallel to S_1), Sigma_{21}, Sigma_{22} (parallel to S_2), and Sigma_{31}, Sigma_{32} (parallel to S_3) define the parallelepiped P with the required properties. Each of the given lines f, g\`, and h\` lie on an edge of P\`. 6. **Verifying Existence of Solution** - The solution is unique if one exists. If any pair of planes constructed above coincide or fail to intersect properly, a valid parallelepiped does not exist. - Specifically, if any pair of S_1, S_2, and S_3 coincide, it implies there is a plane parallel to all three given lines f, g, and h, which is a contradiction if they are truly skew. Thus, by carefully constructing the planes and ensuring they do not coincide except in the formation of our desired parallelepiped, the problem can be solved.

Substituting a_{2} = a_{1} + d gives us 11 = a_{1} + d. For the second condition, 2a_{2} + 9 = a_{7}, we can express a_{7} in terms of a_{1} and d as a_{7} = a_{1} + 6d.

The equation of this line is: [ y = -frac{eta}{p}x tag{1} ] 4. **Equation of the Line Passing through (M(xi, eta)) and Focus (Fleft(frac{p}{2}, 0right)):** The line passing through (M(xi, eta)) and (Fleft(frac{p}{2}, 0right)) has the slope: [ frac{0 - eta}{frac{p}{2} - xi} = frac{-eta}{frac{p}{2} - xi} ] Therefore, its equation is: [ frac{y}{x - frac{p}{2}} = frac{eta}{xi - frac{p}{2}} implies left(xi - frac{p}{2}right) y = etaleft(x - frac{p}{2}right) tag{2} ] 5. **Find the Coordinates of Point (P):** Solving equations (1) and (2) together to find the coordinates ((x, y)) of the point (P): [ y = -frac{eta}{p} x ] Substituting (y) from the above into Equation (2): [ left(xi - frac{p}{2}right) left(-frac{eta}{p} xright) = eta left(x - frac{p}{2}right) ] Simplifying, [ -left(xi - frac{p}{2}right) frac{eta}{p} x = eta x - eta frac{p}{2} ] [ -left(xi - frac{p}{2}right) frac{eta}{p} x + eta x = eta frac{p}{2} ] 6. **Eliminate (xi) and (eta):** Given the relationship between (xi) and (eta): [ eta^2 = 2pxi ] Hence, [ eta = sqrt{2pxi} ] Substituting (eta) and (xi) into our equation: [ eta = -p frac{y}{x} ] and [ xi = frac{p(p - x)}{2x} ] Substituting (eta) and (xi) into (eta^2 = 2pxi): [ p^2 frac{y^2}{x^2} = 2p frac{p(p - x)}{2x} ] Simplifying, [ p^2 frac{y^2}{x^2} = frac{p^2(p - x)}{x} ] [ x^2 + y^2 = px ] Rearranging, [ x^2 + y^2 - px = 0 ] 7. **Conclusion:** The equation (x^2 + y^2 - px = 0) describes a circle with center at (left( frac{p}{2}, 0 right)) and radius (frac{p}{2}).

So, the total number of goals after five matches is 4x + 4.

To proceed, we utilize the algebraic inequality for the cubes of (x) and (y). Specifically, we use the factorization and non-negativity of the expression (x^3 + y^3): [ x^3 + y^3 geq (x + y)xy ] This inequality is a consequence of the identity (x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2)) and the non-negativity of (x^2 - xy + y^2). 4.

Jelölje e^{prime} az e egyenes vetületét a mathbf{S}^{*} síkon. Ezt úgy kapjuk meg, hogy az e egyenes valamely E pontjának vetületét, E^{prime}-t összekötjük az e és m metszéspontjával, M-mel. 3.

We need to determine who is definitely correct given that exactly one of them is wrong. 1. **First Insight: Convex Quadrilateral Properties** - For any convex quadrilateral, the sum of its internal angles is 360^circ. 2. **Borya's Claim: Two Right-Angled Triangles** - Suppose Borya is correct, and the quadrilateral can be divided into two right-angled triangles. If the diagonal splits the quadrilateral into such triangles, this implies the quadrilateral has right angles at its vertices. Let's verify this claim. Consider the quadrilateral (ABCD) with diagonal (AC). If Borya's claim is true: [ angle BAC + angle BCA = 90^circ quad text{in} quad triangle ABC ] [ angle DAC + angle DCA = 90^circ quad text{in} quad triangle ADC ] Both angles form the full (180^circ). Therefore, this condition holds. 3. **Alyosha's Claim: Two Acute-Angled Triangles** - Suppose Alyosha is correct, and the quadrilateral can be divided into two acute-angled triangles. This would mean every resulting angle in both triangles is less than 90^circ. Summing these six angles (three from each triangle): [ sum_{ text{all angles}} < 90^circ times 6 = 540^circ ] This contradicts with the quadrilateral's total angle sum, which should be 360^circ after inserting the diagonal (three triangles). Thus, Alyosha's claim fails since it exceeds the internal angle sum constraints. 4. **Vasya's Claim: Two Obtuse-Angled Triangles** - Consider Vasya's claim, that the quadrilateral can be divided into two obtuse-angled triangles. If this were the case, at least one of the angles in both resulting triangles is greater than 90^circ. Verifying the formed triangles still keep the convexity's definition intact and follow geometrical constraints, one needs: [ sum_{ text{all angles}} < 360^circ ] Indeed, possessing obtuse-angled triangles still allows the convex formation, thereby not contradicting quadrilateral's internal angle constraint. Since Alyosha's proposition clearly fails due to exceeding angular constraints of the geometry at hand, our answer is: **Conclusion**: [ boxed{text{Vasya}} ]"},{"prompt":"Two cones have equal slant heights, and their lateral surface unfoldings exactly piece together to form a circle.

Thus, the probability of achieving sum 9-a is frac{min(9-a-1, 13-(9-a))}{36}. 3. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**: - **Rerolling One Die**: Probability is frac{1}{6} if the exact needed number can be achieved. - **Rerolling Two Dice**: The probability is frac{min(8-a, 5+a)}{36}. - **Rerolling Three Dice**: Using similar logic as before, there are binom{8}{2} = 28 ways to sum to 9 with three dice, so the probability is frac{28}{216} = frac{7}{54}. 4. **Comparing Strategies and Counting Favorable Outcomes**: - When a = 3, the possible outcomes for two dice to sum to 6 or more are significantly higher. - Consider the combinations (3, x, y) where x + y = 6, leading to (3, 1, 5), (3, 2, 4), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 2), (3, 5, 1) and their permutations, which provide a higher probability than rerolling three dice or one die. 5. **Calculating the Probability**: - The specific cases with (a, b, c) configurations such as (3, 6, 6), (3, 5, 5) etc., must be calculated. This leads to 30 out of the total 216 outcomes where rerolling two dice is the optimal strategy. - Thus, frac{30}{216} = frac{5}{36}. Conclusion: The probability that Jason chooses to reroll exactly two of the dice is frac{5{36}}. The final answer is boxed{textbf{(C) } frac{5}{36}}"},{"prompt":"f I roll 6 standard 8sided dice (each die has sides numbered from 1 to 8) and multiply the number on the face of each die, what is the probability that the result is a composite number?","completion":"We use complementary probability to find the cases where the product is not a composite number. The product is non-composite only if it is either 1 or a prime number. As we consider dice with faces from 1 to 8, the prime numbers on the dice are 2, 3, 5, and 7. For the product to be non-composite, similar to the original problem, we need all but potentially one of the dice to roll a 1, with the last die possibly rolling 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7. 1. One way for all dice to show 1s, having a product of 1. 2. For each of the other four cases (2, 3, 5, 7), there are binom{6}{1} = 6 ways for the specific prime to show up in any one of the 6 positions while the rest of the dice show 1s. The total number of ways to have a non-composite number is 1 + 4cdot6 = 25. The total number of outcomes when rolling 6 dice, each with 8 sides, is 8^6 = 262144.

Since line l is tangent to Gamma, Delta=1^{2}-4times 2mtimes( frac {1}{4k}- frac {m}{8k^{2}})= frac {(m-k)^{2}}{k^{2}}=0. Therefore, m=k, which means lparallel AB.

Since MNperpy-axis, |MN|=|x_{M}-x_{N}|= frac {8k^{2}+1}{4k^{2}}- frac {1}{8k^{2}}= frac {16k^{2}+1}{8k^{2}}. Therefore, frac {16k^{2}+1}{8k^{2}}= frac {1}{2} sqrt {1+k^{2}}cdot frac { sqrt {16k^{2}+1}}{2k^{2}}, solving this gives k=± frac {1}{2}. Thus, there exists k=± frac {1}{2} such that overrightarrow {NA}cdot overrightarrow {NB}=0. The final answers are: - For (Ⅰ), the tangent line of Gamma at point N is parallel to AB. - For (Ⅱ), there exists k=± frac {1}{2} such that overrightarrow {NA}cdot overrightarrow {NB}=0.

When n is divided by 8, the remainder is 5. How many such values are less than 180?","completion":"Let's first find the general form of the numbers w and n that satisfy the given conditions. For w: When w is divided by 13, the remainder is 2. This means that w can be expressed as: w = 13k + 2 where k is a non-negative integer (since w is a positive integer). For n: When n is divided by 8, the remainder is 5. This means that n can be expressed as: n = 8m + 5 where m is a non-negative integer (since n is a positive integer). We are looking for values that are both of the form 13k + 2 and 8m + 5 and are less than 180. To find such values, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 8 and then find the numbers that are of the form of this LCM plus the respective remainders.

Does there exist a natural number n such that the number 16^{n} is decreasing?","completion":"1. **Observing the properties of ( 16^n ):** Let us first note the properties of the number ( 16^n ). Since ( 16^n = (2^4)^n = 2^{4n} ), it is clear that ( 16^n ) is divisible by all powers of 2 up to ( 2^{4n} ). Additionally, from the properties of numbers ending in 6 in base-10, we know that ( 16^n ) always ends in the digit 6 for ( n geq 1 ). 2. **Checking for numbers constructed from the last two digits:** If ( 16^n ) is a decreasing number, the last two digits must be either 66, 76, 86, or 96. - However, a number ending in 66 or 86 is not divisible by 4 (since these are not multiples of 4), contradicting the divisibility requirement. - Likewise, if it ends in 96, it must end in 996 as 96 alone must be followed by digits greater or equal to it, ensuring a 'decreasing' property which is not satisfied. So, only 76 might be a possibility. 3. **Generalizing this for more digits:** Similar reasoning can be extended to numbers constructed from the last three, four, five, and six digits in the decimal representation of ( 16^n ). - For the last three digits to align with the structure of a power of 2, we end up with a sequence that while starting with certain values (e.g., 76), must continue to 776 or similar. - Generalizing, the sequence following the decreasing property should end in 987776. However, we must check if such a sequence aligns with the structure ( 2^{4n} ). 4. **Divisibility checks for larger constants:** For a number like 987776 to be a power of 16, it must be divisible by ( 256 = 16^2 ). - Performing detailed checks, neither 987776 nor 9987776 align with being divisible by ( 256 ) or ( 128 ), respectively, the higher power checks align similarly with higher ( 2^k ). 5. **Conclusion through impossibility:** Given the contradictions from divisibility and the structural alignment not matching, no natural number ( n ) exists such that ( 16^n ) ends in the sequence 987776 or similar. # Conclusion: There exists no natural number ( n ) such that ( 16^n ) is a decreasing number in its decimal representation.

First, let's expand -4sin^3 x cos x as -4sin x(sin^2 x) cos x and then substitute sin^2 x with (1 - cos^2 x) to get: begin{align*} f(x) &= sin 2x - 4sin^3 x cos x &= sin 2x - 4sin x(sin^2 x) cos x &= sin 2x - 4sin x(1 - cos^2 x) cos x &= sin 2x - 4sin x cos x + 4sin x cos^3 x. end{align*} Now, we can use the double-angle identity to replace sin 2x with 2sin x cos x and simplify further: begin{align*} f(x) &= 2sin x cos x - 4sin x cos x + 4sin x cos^3 x &= -2sin x cos x + 4sin x cos^3 x. end{align*} The term 4sin x cos^3 x can be rewritten as 4sin x cos x (cos^2 x), which becomes 4sin x cos x (1 - sin^2 x) by substituting cos^2 x with (1 - sin^2 x). Substituting that back into f(x) gives: begin{align*} f(x) &= -2sin x cos x + 4sin x cos x (1 - sin^2 x) &= -2sin x cos x + 4sin x cos x - 4sin^3 x cos x &= 2sin x cos x - 4sin^3 x cos x. end{align*} This simplifies back to our original function, so we need to find another method to simplify.

For example, the sequence A: 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0 is a 4thorder repeatable sequence since the subsequence a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4} matches the subsequence a_{4}, a_{5}, a_{6}, a_{7} in order. (I) Determine whether the following sequence A: 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, is a 5thorder repeatable sequence? If it is, please write out the repeating subsequence of length 5. (II) If a sequence A of length m is a 3rdorder repeatable sequence, what is the minimum value of m? Explain the reason. (III) Assuming the sequence A is not a 5thorder repeatable sequence, if one more term 0 or 1 is added after the last term a_{m}, the new sequence becomes a 5thorder repeatable sequence, and a_{4}=1, find the value of the last term a_{m}.","completion":"(I) The sequence A is indeed a \\"5th-order repeatable sequence\\" because the subsequence 1, 0, 1, 0, 1 repeats. To show this, we compare five consecutive terms starting from different positions. Starting from the first term, we have the subsequence 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, and starting from the sixth term, we have 1, 0, 1, 0, 1. These are not the same. However, starting from the second term, we have the subsequence 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, which repeats exactly starting from the sixth term. Therefore, the repeating subsequence is boxed{1, 0, 1, 0, 1}. (II) Since each term of the sequence {a_{n}} can only be 0 or 1, there are in total 2^3 = 8 different possible three-term sequences. If m=11, then there are 9 consecutive three-term groups in the sequence {a_{n}}, among which there must be at least two groups that match each other in order, indicating that a sequence with 11 terms is necessarily a \\"3rd-order repeatable sequence\\". On the other hand, if m=10, the sequence 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 is not a \\"3rd-order repeatable sequence\\". Thus, when 3 leq m < 10, there would exist sequences that are not \\"3rd-order repeatable sequences\\". Consequently, to guarantee a sequence {a_{n}} is a \\"3rd-order repeatable sequence\\", the minimum value of m is boxed{11}. (III) Since adding either 0 or 1 to the end of sequence {a_{n}} makes it a \\"5th-order repeatable sequence\\", it implies that there exists i neq j such that the subsequences a_{i}, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}, a_{i+4} and a_{m-3}, a_{m-2}, a_{m-1}, a_{m}, 0 match in order, or a_{j}, a_{j+1}, a_{j+2}, a_{j+3}, a_{j+4} and a_{m-3}, a_{m-2}, a_{m-1}, a_{m}, 1 match in order. If the initial subsequence a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4} does not match with the ending subsequence a_{m-3}, a_{m-2}, a_{m-1}, a_{m}, then there must be 2 leq i, j leq m-4 and i neq j such that a_{i}, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3} and a_{j}, a_{j+1}, a_{j+2}, a_{j+3} match with a_{m-3}, a_{m-2}, a_{m-1}, a_{m} in order. Considering a_{i-1}, a_{j-1}, and a_{m-4}, at least two of them must be the same, which would result in two matching subsequences of length five in the original sequence, contradicting the assumption that {a_{n}} is not a \\"5th-order repeatable sequence\\". Hence, a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4} must match with a_{m-3}, a_{m-2}, a_{m-1}, a_{m} in order, which leads to the conclusion that a_{m} = a_{4} = 1.

A positive integer is called *nice* if the sum of its digits in the number system with base 3 is divisible by 3. 1. **Grouping the Numbers:** We group the positive integers into sets: [ A_1 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, quad A_2 = {9, 10, 11, ldots, 17}, quad A_3 = {18, 19, 20, ldots, 26}, ldots ] In base 3, these sets can be written as: [ A_1 = {0_3, 1_3, 2_3, 10_3, 11_3, 12_3, 20_3, 21_3, 22_3}, quad A_2 = {100_3, 101_3, 102_3, ldots, 122_3}, quad A_3 = {200_3, 201_3, 202_3, ldots, 222_3}, ldots ] 2. **Identifying Nice Numbers:** For any natural number ( n ), all digits except the last two (in base 3) of any pair of numbers in ( A_n ) are the same. We need to find the sum of nice numbers in each set ( A_n ). 3. **Sum of Nice Numbers in Each Set ( A_n ):** Let ( S_n ) be the sum of nice numbers in ( A_n ) and ( x_n ) be the smallest number in ( A_n ). We will prove that ( S_n = 3x_n + 12 ) for all natural numbers ( n ). - **Case 1:** ( x_n ) is nice. - ( x_n ) ends with ( 00 ). In ( A_n ), only ( x_n + 5 ) (ends with ( 12 )), ( x_n + 7 ) (ends with ( 21 )), and ( x_n ) are nice. - So, ( S_n = 3x_n + 12 ). - **Case 2:** ( x_n + 1 ) is nice. - ( x_n + 1 ) ends with ( 01 ). In ( A_n ), only ( x_n + 3 ) (ends with ( 10 )), ( x_n + 8 ) (ends with ( 22 )), and ( x_n ) are nice. - So, ( S_n = 3x_n + 12 ). - **Case 3:** ( x_n + 2 ) is nice. - ( x_n + 2 ) ends with ( 02 ). In ( A_n ), only ( x_n + 4 ) (ends with ( 11 )), ( x_n + 6 ) (ends with ( 20 )), and ( x_n ) are nice. - So, ( S_n = 3x_n + 12 ). Therefore, ( S_n = 3x_n + 12 ) for all natural numbers ( n ). 4. **Recursive Relation:** Since ( x_{n+1} = x_n + 9 ) for all natural numbers ( n ), we conclude that: [ S_{n+1} = S_n + 27 ] 5. **Sum of the First 2005 Nice Integers:** All sets ( A_k ) have 3 nice integers except ( A_1 ), which has only 2.

This is because sin(x-frac{pi}{6}) = sin x cosfrac{pi}{6} - cos x sinfrac{pi}{6}, and knowing that cosfrac{pi}{6} = sqrt{3}/2 and sinfrac{pi}{6} = 1/2, we get: [ f(x) = -sqrt{3}sin x+cos x = -2sinleft(x-frac{pi}{6}right) ] 2. **Determining the interval of increase:** For f(x) to be increasing, the derivative f'(x) must be positive.

For the new data set, the mean is bar{y} = frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i} = frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}+c) = frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i} + frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^{n}c = bar{x} + c. Since c is a non-zero constant, the difference in the means is c, which means the sample means are not the same. Therefore, option A is incorrect. **Option B: The sample medians of the two sets of sample data are the same.** The median of a data set is the middle value when the data set is ordered. Adding a constant c to each data point shifts all data points by the same amount, thus shifting the median by c as well. Therefore, the difference in the medians of the two sets of sample data is c, making option B incorrect. **Option C: The sample standard deviations of the two sets of sample data are the same.** The standard deviation measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean. Adding a constant c to each data point shifts all data points but does not affect the dispersion among them. Mathematically, the standard deviation of y_{i} is D(y_{i}) = D(x_{i} + c) = D(x_{i}). Therefore, the sample standard deviations of the two sets of sample data are the same, making option C correct. **Option D: The sample ranges of the two sets of sample data are the same.** The range of a data set is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

The difference between the selling price and the price he bought it for is: ( SP - 0.80P = 1.6000000000000001P - 0.80P = 0.8000000000000001P ) The percentage increase on the price he bought it for is: ( frac{0.8000000000000001P}{0.80P} times 100% ) Simplifying this, we get: ( frac{0.8000000000000001}{0.80} times 100% = 1.0000000000000001 times 100% = 100.00000000000001% ) So, the percentage increase on the price he bought it for when he sold the car is boxed{100.00000000000001%} .

If the row and column containing the number A do not contain any perfect squares, then A is called a free number. How many free numbers are there in the table?","completion":"# Problem: Given the integers from 1 to 10000 arranged in a 100 times 100 table in natural order (row-wise): - Row 1: Numbers from 1 to 100 - Row 2: Numbers from 101 to 200 - ... - Row 100: Numbers from 9901 to 10000 Any cell in the table without a perfect square either in its row or column is called a \\"自由数\\" (free number). Determine the total number of free numbers in the table. To solve this problem, we need to count the number of free numbers in the table where no perfect square exists in the same row or column as the given number. We will use the following steps: 1. **Identify rows with perfect squares:** For row i to have at least one perfect square, there must be an integer k such that: i cdot 100 < k^2 leq (i+1) cdot 100 If (k+1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1 leq 100, that implies k leq 49. This means the first 25 rows (with i leq 25) can contain the perfect squares from 1^2 to 50^2. Hence, within rows from 1 to 25, every row contains at least one perfect square. 2. **Calculate remaining rows without perfect squares:** For k geq 50, (k+1)^2 - k^2 > 100, thus each of these larger perfect squares lies in a unique row from row 26 to row 100. Hence, the remaining rows must be the sum of rows from 26 to 100 minus 50 rows with individual perfect squares: 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 Thus, we have 25 rows without perfect squares. 3. **Identify columns with perfect squares:** The j-th column of row i holds values equivalent to 100(i-1) + j modulo 100, for values of j where j equiv x^2 mod 100. To find the relevant j values, we solve: x^2 equiv j pmod{100} Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, solve the congruences: begin{cases} j equiv x^2 pmod{4} j equiv x^2 pmod{25} end{cases} The possible squared residues modulo 4 are: [ 0, 1 ] and modulo 25: [ 0, 1, 4, 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, 19, 21, 24 ] By enumeration, there are a total of 22 columns containing all relevant squares. 4. **Count columns without perfect squares:** Hence, the remaining number of columns without perfect squares is: 100 - 22 = 78 5. **Calculate the number of free numbers:** Free numbers are in the intersection of 25 blank rows and 78 blank columns, resulting in: 25 times 78 = 1950 # Conclusion: Thus, the total number of free numbers in the table is: boxed{1950}"},{"prompt":"the Cartesian coordinate system, the region between the lines y=k and y=l (where k and l are constants with k < l), including the lines y=k and y=l, is called the k oplus ltype band region.

Let's denote a three-digit number in this range as overline{1TU}, where T is the tens digit and U is the units digit. We'll analyze this based on the value of T. **Case 1: T = 0.** For numbers of the form overline{10U}, they must be divisible by U.

So (a_i) takes a value from the set ({0, 1, ldots, 2n - 1}). 3. **Condition Analysis**: If there exist two deputies that have moved the same number of seats after the break, then the problem condition of having the same number of people between them before and after the break is satisfied. 4. **Assumption of Distinctness**: Assume, to the contrary, that all values (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n}) are distinct. This implies that these values form a permutation of the set ({0, 1, ldots, 2n - 1}). 5. **Sum Consistency**: Analyze the sums: - The sum of the initial seat numbers of all deputies is: [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} i = frac{2n(2n + 1)}{2} = n(2n + 1). ] - The sum of the seat numbers after the break incorporating (a_i) is: [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} (i + a_i). ] 6. **Modulo Consideration**: Modulo (2n), the rearranged positions sum theorematically should translate to the same sum as regular consecutive summation modulo (2n), because it's purely cyclical. 7. **Sum Calculation**: - Simplify the sum: [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} (i + a_i) equiv sum_{i=1}^{2n} i + sum_{i=1}^{2n} a_i pmod{2n}. ] - Here, (sum_{i=1}^{2n} i = n(2n + 1)), and (sum_{i=1}^{2n} a_i): [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} a_i = sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} k = frac{(2n-1)2n}{2} = n(2n - 1). ] 8. **Contradiction**: Combine the outcomes: [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} (i + a_i) = n(2n + 1) + n(2n - 1) = n(4n). ] - This sum (n(4n)) is divisible by (2n): [ n cdot 4 times n = 4n^2. ] - However, since (4n^2) modulo (2n) remains 0 which matches, but detailing individual movements should map to distinct checks regularly, the presumption breaks of distinct identical slots not overlaying evenly cyclic in permutation form contradicts on binary check of rearranged total continuity. 9. **Conclusion**: Having a contradiction derived from (a_i)s giving an undiscernible continuous sum without alterbing slots verifies inherent overlap, hence proving the solution logically to give cyclic count reality vying pairs overlap assurances.

Similarly, if ( a_{k} ) is odd, then ( a_{k} r^{k} ) is odd. 3. **Summation properties**: When these terms ( a_{k} r^{k} ) are summed, the overall parity of ( N ) mirrors the parity of the sum of those terms: [ N = sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} r^{k} ] The summation of an even number of odd terms results in an even sum, while an odd number of odd terms results in an odd sum. Additionally, the sum of any number of even terms remains even. 4. **Determining the parity of ( N )**: It follows that the integer ( N ) will be odd if and only if there is an odd number of terms ( a_{k} r^{k} ) where ( a_{k} ) is odd. This is because: - An even number of odd terms results in an even sum. - An odd number of odd terms results in an odd sum. - Adding even terms (which may be zero) does not change the parity. 5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, we have established that an integer represented in a numeral system with an odd base is odd if and only if its representation contains an odd number of odd digits.

The green parrots always told the truth both times, the yellow ones always lied both times, and each of the mottled ones told the truth once and lied once. Could there have been more yellow parrots than green ones?","completion":"To determine if there could be more yellow parrots than green parrots, we need to carefully analyze the given statements and the responses to determine the exact count of each type of parrot. Let's navigate through this step by step. 1. **Introduction to Parrot Types:** - We have three types of parrots: green, yellow, and speckled. - The total number of parrots is 100. 2. **Reactions to the First Crow's Statement:** - Crow: \\"There are more green parrots than speckled parrots.\\" - 50 parrots shouted \\"Yes\\" (truth). - 50 parrots shouted \\"No\\" (lie). 3. **Reactions to the Second Crow's Statement:** - Crow: \\"There are more speckled parrots than yellow parrots.\\" - 50 parrots shouted \\"Yes\\" (truth). - 50 parrots shouted \\"No\\" (lie). 4. **Truth and Lies Analysis:** - Green parrots always tell the truth. - Yellow parrots always lie. - Speckled parrots tell the truth once and lie once. 5. **Breakdown Based on the Statements:** - Let's denote the number of green, yellow, and speckled parrots by ( G ), ( Y ), and ( S ) respectively. - According to the first statement, those who said \\"Yes\\" (truth) must include all green parrots and half of the speckled parrots. - Therefore, ( G + frac{S}{2} = 50 ). - Similarly, those who said \\"No\\" (lie) must include all yellow parrots and the other half of the speckled parrots. - Therefore, ( Y + frac{S}{2} = 50 ). 6. **Total Parrots Count:** - We know the total number of parrots: [ G + Y + S = 100. ] 7. **Solving the System of Equations:** - From ( G + frac{S}{2} = 50 ), we can rewrite it as ( S = 100 - 2G ). - From ( Y + frac{S}{2} = 50 ), we can also derive: [ Y = 100 - G - S. ] - Substitute ( S = 100 - 2G ) into ( Y = 100 - G - S ): [ Y = 100 - G - (100 - 2G) = 100 - G - 100 + 2G = G. ] 8. **Conclusion:** - Since the number of green parrots ( G ) must equal the number of yellow parrots ( Y ), it is impossible for the number of yellow parrots to be greater than the number of green parrots. Thus, we conclude that it is impossible for there to be more yellow parrots than green parrots.

We need to find the sum of all numbers in the cubes that do not lie in the three layers passing through cube ( A ). 1. Understand the configuration: - As ( A ) has a side length of 1, there are 10 cubes along each edge direction. - Cube ( A ) lies in three layers, each of thickness 1, parallel to the faces of the 10x10x10 cube. 2. Identify the contribution from each column: - Each column of 10 cubes sums to zero by the problem's constraint. 3. Count the affected cubes: - The three layers through ( A ) are: one horizontal layer and two vertical layers. - Each layer contains ( 10 times 10 = 100 ) cubes. - There are ( 3 times 100 = 300 ) cubes total in these three layers. - Note overlapping: The intersecting lines of these three layers each contain 10 cubes, but the intersections of all three layers at ( A ) count just once. 4. Triple-count and correction for overlaps: - The horizontal layer intersects each of the two vertical layers. - Each intersection has ( 10 ) cubes. - Double intersections mean ( 2 times 10 = 20 ) cubes, counted twice within the three sets of layers. - Total three layers have ( 280 ) (after removing 20 overlapping). - Considering the triple intersection (at ( A )): [ 100 + 100 + 100 - 2 times 10 + 10 - 1 = 281 - 21 + 1 = 279 ] - But these overlaps must be verified accurately. 5.

We will utilize the following lemma in our proof: **Lemma:** Suppose (a, b, c) are rational numbers and (a + b + c) is not an integer. Then, there exists a natural number (k) such that the numbers (k a, k b, k c) are non-integral and [ 1 < {ka} + {kb} + {kc} < 2. ] **Proof of the Lemma:** 1. Replace (a, b, c) with their fractional parts ({a}, {b}, {c}) since working with fractional parts preserves the properties needed for the lemma. 2. Define the function (f(t) = {ta} + {tb} + {tc}). We observe: - If (1 < a + b + c < 2), we can take (k = 1) directly because (f(1) = a + b + c). 3. If (a + b + c < 1), let's choose a natural number (m) such that (m > 1) and (ma, mb, mc) are integers. Then: - (f(m - 1) = 3 - (a + b + c) > 2). 4. Thus, there exists a minimal natural number (k) such that (f(k) > 1) and (f(k - 1) leq 1). We need to prove (1 < f(k) < 2). 5.

Then ({ka} = {(k - 1)a} + a - 1). Hence, the inequality can be strengthened to: [ f(k) leq f(k-1) + (a + b + c) - 1 leq 1 ] which is a contradiction because (f(k) > 1). Thus, (ka) is not an integer, nor are (kb) or (kc). To solve the problem at hand: 1. Define ((a_0, b_0, c_0)) by the coordinates of the point ((x_0, y_0, z_0)) transformed into new space coordinates.

Apply the lemma to the rational coordinates (a_0, b_0, c_0), which ensures there exists a natural number (k) such that: [ 1 < {k a_0} + {k b_0} + {k c_0} < 2 ] This ensures that the point ((k x_0, k y_0, k z_0)) lies strictly within some octahedron of the partitioning.

We know that his expenses include: - House rental: 640 - Food expense: 380 - Electric and water bill: E/4 - Insurances: E/5 After paying these expenses, he has 2280 left. So we can write the equation: E - (640 + 380 + E/4 + E/5) = 2280 Now, let's solve for E. First, combine the constant expenses (house rental and food expense): 640 + 380 = 1020 So the equation becomes: E - (1020 + E/4 + E/5) = 2280 To combine the terms with E, we need a common denominator for the fractions, which is 20 (the least common multiple of 4 and 5). So we convert E/4 and E/5 to have the denominator of 20: E/4 = (5E)/20 E/5 = (4E)/20 Now the equation is: E - (1020 + (5E)/20 + (4E)/20) = 2280 Combine the E terms: E - (1020 + (9E)/20) = 2280 Multiply through by 20 to eliminate the fraction: 20E - (20400 + 9E) = 45600 Combine like terms: 20E - 9E = 45600 + 20400 11E = 66000 Now, divide by 11 to solve for E: E = 66000 / 11 E = 6000 Dr. Jones earns boxed{6000} a month."},{"prompt":"The miser knight stores gold coins in 77 chests.

By extending this concept, we can apply it to the groups of 7 chests. 2. **Divisibility within each group of 7:** Since coins can be equally redistributed among any selected 7 chests, the total number of coins in each group of 7 must be a multiple of 7. Formally, let (C_i) denote the total number of coins in group (G_i): [ C_1, C_2, ldots, C_{11} ] It follows that: [ C_i equiv 0 mod 7 quad text{for each} quad i quad (1 leq i leq 11) ] As a result, the total number of coins across all 77 chests must satisfy: [ sum_{i=1}^{11} C_i equiv 0 mod 7 ] 3. **Group the chests into groups of 11:** Next, we'll look at the 77 chests by grouping them into 7 groups, with each group containing 11 chests.

Considering the inequality fleft(xright)geqslant 6: - For x leq -3, we solve -2x-2 geqslant 6, leading to -2x geqslant 8, thus x leq -4. - For -3 < x < 1, the inequality 4 geqslant 6 does not hold, so there are no solutions in this interval. - For x geq 1, we solve 2x+2 geqslant 6, leading to 2x geqslant 4, thus x geq 2. Therefore, the solution set is (-infty, -4] cup [2, +infty). So, we have boxed{(-infty, -4] cup [2, +infty)} as the solution set for the inequality. Part (2) Given fleft(xright) = |x-a|+|x+3|, we analyze the inequality fleft(xright) > -a. 1. We observe that fleft(xright) geqslant |x-a-x-3| = |a+3| by the triangle inequality. Considering fleft(xright) > -a, we have |a+3| > -a. This inequality is analyzed in two cases: - **Case 1:** For a geq 0, |a+3| > -a always holds because the absolute value is non-negative, and -a is non-positive. - **Case 2:** For a < 0, we need |a+3| > -a. Since -a > 0, we square both sides to avoid dealing with the absolute value directly, leading to a^2 + 6a + 9 > a^2. Simplifying, we get 6a + 9 > 0, which simplifies to a > -frac{3}{2}. Combining both cases, the range of values for a is (-frac{3}{2}, +infty). Thus, we have boxed{(-frac{3}{2}, +infty)} as the range of values for a."},{"prompt":"A Scatterbrained Scientist has only 20 rubles left but needs to buy a bus ticket costing 45 rubles.

For any side XY of the quadrilateral, we have: [ XY = 2R sin(theta_{XY}/2) ] where theta_{XY} is the angle subtended by the side XY at the center of the circle. Since R = 1, we have: [ XY = 2 sin(theta_{XY}/2) ] Let alpha, beta, gamma, delta be the angles subtended by the sides AB, BC, CD, DA respectively, and let theta_1 and theta_2 be the angles subtended by the diagonals AC and BD respectively.

This distance is the length of the train plus the length of the bridge: Total distance = Length of train + Length of bridge Total distance = 160 m + 215 m Total distance = 375 m Next, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (km/hr) to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the distance: Speed in m/s = (Speed in km/hr) × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 45 × (1000 / 1) × (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 45 × 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 45000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 12.5 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 375 m / 12.5 m/s Time = 30 seconds Therefore, it takes the train boxed{30} seconds to cross the bridge."},{"prompt":"Determine the positive difference between the two roots of the quadratic equation 5x^2 2x 15 = 0.

If we focus on girl ( k ), she danced with boys in two groups, each contributing to half of her total number of dances. Thus: [ text{(number of dances between girl } k text{ and boy } k) leq frac{D_k}{2} ] where ( D_k ) is the total number of dances girl ( k ) has participated in. 4. **Summing Dances for Girls:** Summing over all girls, we obtain: [ sum_{k=1}^{100} text{(number of dances between girl } k text{ and boy } k) leq sum_{k=1}^{100} frac{D_k}{2} ] 5. **Contradiction from Suppositions:** Since the total number of dances between boys and girls should be consistent from both perspectives, our previous summation for boys contradicts the summation for girls: [ sum_{k=1}^{100} text{(number of dances between boy } k text{ and girl } k) > sum_{k=1}^{100} frac{T_k}{2} quad text{and} quad sum_{k=1}^{100} text{(number of dances between girl } k text{ and boy } k) leq sum_{k=1}^{100} frac{D_k}{2} ] 6. **Logical Inference:** Since each boy and girl can be divided into groups based on the structure given (dances are equally split), the structured counting and our summation should match. Hence, the previous supposition that every boy danced with his corresponding girl more than half his dances must be incorrect. 7. **Revised Conclusion:** Therefore, there must exist some boy ( k ) such that boy ( k ) danced with girl ( k ) no more than half of his total number of dances. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{There exists a boy } k text{ such that } text{boy } k text{ danced with girl } k text{ no more than half of his dances.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Melanie had some dimes in her bank.

He charges 20 for this and it cost him 5 in parts. In one month Jim does 300 of these repairs. He also does 2 more complex repairs for 300 each and cost 50 in parts. He also sells 2000 profit worth of things from his retail shop. If rent and other fixed expense for the shop is 4000 a month how much profit did the shop make?","completion":"First, let's calculate the profit from the tire repairs. For each tire repair, Jim charges 20 and it costs him 5 in parts. So the profit per tire repair is 20 - 5 = 15. Since he does 300 of these repairs in a month, the total profit from tire repairs is 300 * 15 = 4500. Next, let's calculate the profit from the more complex repairs. For each complex repair, Jim charges 300 and it costs him 50 in parts. So the profit per complex repair is 300 - 50 = 250. Since he does 2 of these repairs in a month, the total profit from complex repairs is 2 * 250 = 500. Adding the profit from the retail shop, which is 2000, the total profit from all activities before expenses is 4500 (tire repairs) + 500 (complex repairs) + 2000 (retail shop) = 7000. Finally, we subtract the fixed expenses for the shop, which is 4000, from the total profit. So the profit the shop made is 7000 - 4000 = boxed{3000} ."},{"prompt":"The base H of the altitude C H of a right triangle A B C was connected to the midpoints M and N of the legs A C and B C. Prove that the perimeter of the quadrilateral C M H N is equal to the sum of the legs of the triangle A B C.","completion":"To prove that the perimeter of quadrilateral CMHN is equal to the sum of the legs of the right triangle ABC, we will use geometric properties of medians and the specific characteristics of right triangles. 1. **Understanding Median to Hypotenuse**: Let M be the midpoint of AC, and N be the midpoint of BC. H is the foot of the altitude from C to AB. Since M and N are midpoints, they divide the sides of the triangle into equal segments. In a right triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is equal to half the length of the hypotenuse. That is, [ HM = frac{1}{2} AC ] and similarly for triangle BCH we have: [ HN = frac{1}{2} BC ] 2. **Calculating the Perimeter of Quadrilateral CMHN**: Quadrilateral CMHN is formed by connecting C, M, H, and N. To calculate its perimeter, we need the lengths of all its sides: CM, MH, HN, and NC. 3. **Sum of Contributions**: Observe the straight lines and median properties: - CM connects C to the midpoint of AC. - MH is the median from H to AC. - HN is the median from H to BC. - NC connects N to C. Using the properties of medians and midpoints: [ CM + MH + HN + NC ] Since HM = frac{1}{2} AC and HN = frac{1}{2} BC, we can express: [ MH = frac{1}{2} AC ] [ HN = frac{1}{2} BC ] Adding these up along with CM and NC: [ HM + HN + CM + NC = frac{1}{2} AC + frac{1}{2} BC + CM + NC ] 4. **Summarizing the Lengths**: Since M and N are midpoints, the segments CM and NC can be derived straightforwardly: [ CM = frac{1}{2} AC ] [ NC = frac{1}{2} BC ] Sum these contributions: [ frac{1}{2} AC + frac{1}{2} AC + frac{1}{2} BC + frac{1}{2} BC = AC + BC ] Therefore, we have shown: [ CM + MH + HN + NC = AC + BC ] # Conclusion: Thus, the perimeter of the quadrilateral CMHN is indeed equal to the sum of the legs AC and BC of the right triangle ABC.

Which of the following conclusions is correct? A: Events A and B are mutually exclusive. B: Events A and B are not complementary. C: Omega = A cup B D: P(A) + P(B) = frac{9}{8}","completion":"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the sample space, event A, and event B. **Step 1: Determine the Sample Space Omega** Given that there are 2 balls in can A and 4 balls in can B, and we draw one ball from each can, the sample space Omega consists of all possible pairs of balls that can be drawn. This gives us: [ Omega = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)} ] which means there are 8 possible outcomes. **Step 2: Identify Event A** Event A is defined as \\"the sum of the labels of the two balls drawn is greater than 4\\". By examining each pair in Omega, we find that the pairs that satisfy this condition are: [ A = {(1,4), (2,3), (2,4)} ] So, there are 3 outcomes that belong to event A. **Step 3: Identify Event B** Event B is defined as \\"the product of the labels of the two balls drawn is less than 5\\". By examining each pair in Omega, we find that the pairs that satisfy this condition are: [ B = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2)} ] So, there are 6 outcomes that belong to event B. **Step 4: Analyze the Events A and B** - Events A and B are not mutually exclusive because there are no outcomes that are exclusively in one event and not the other; for example, (1,4) is in both A and B. - Events A and B are not complementary because their union does not cover the entire sample space Omega and their intersection is not empty. - Since Omega = A cup B is not true because not all elements of Omega are covered by A and B together, we find that statement C is incorrect upon closer inspection. The correct interpretation should be that Omega contains all elements of A and B, but A cup B does not equal Omega because the union does not include all possible outcomes (e.g., (2,1) is in B but not in A, and some elements like (2,3) are in A but not all elements of Omega are in A or B). **Step 5: Calculate P(A) + P(B)** Given that there are 8 possible outcomes in total: [ P(A) = frac{3}{8} quad text{and} quad P(B) = frac{6}{8} ] Adding these probabilities gives us: [ P(A) + P(B) = frac{3}{8} + frac{6}{8} = frac{9}{8} ] **Conclusion** Upon reevaluation, the correct interpretation of the events and their probabilities leads us to conclude that: - Statement A is incorrect because events A and B are not mutually exclusive. - Statement B is correct because events A and B are not complementary. - Statement C is incorrect upon closer inspection because A cup B does not cover the entire sample space Omega. - Statement D is correct because P(A) + P(B) = frac{9}{8}.

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/h × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 h / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 57.6 × (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 57.6 × (10 / 36) Speed in m/s = 57.6 × (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 16 m/s Now, we know the speed of the train and the time it takes to cross the bridge. The distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge is the length of the train plus the length of the bridge. Let's denote the length of the bridge as L. Total distance covered = Length of the train + Length of the bridge Total distance covered = 250 m + L We also know that distance = speed × time.

Base Case: 1. If ( n leq 2 ), we do not need to prove anything as the statement is trivially true. With fewer than 3 residents, the condition is automatically satisfied. Inductive Step: 2. Assume the statement is true for all ( k )-residents where ( k < n ). We need to prove it for ( n ) residents. 3. Let ( m ) be the total number of phone calls made on that day. By the problem's condition, each resident made no more than one phone call, hence ( m leq n ). 4. Therefore, there is at least one resident ( A ) who made at most two calls since if every resident made more than two calls, the total number of calls would exceed ( 2n ), contradicting ( m leq n ). 5. By the induction hypothesis, the remaining ( n-1 ) residents can be partitioned into three groups such that within each group, no two residents have talked to each other on that day (it follows because we assume the hypothesis holds for all numbers of residents less than ( n )). 6. Now, since resident ( A ) has talked to at most two residents, there must exist one of the three groups in which ( A ) did not talk to any resident. Denote these groups as ( G_1, G_2, ) and ( G_3 ). 7. Without loss of generality, assume ( A ) did not talk to any resident in group ( G_1 ). 8. Therefore, we can include ( A ) in group ( G_1 ). Since ( A ) had at most two calls and those calls were not to anyone in ( G_1 ), the required condition is preserved: No resident in group ( G_1 ) has talked to another resident in ( G_1 ).

Since ( angle ABP = angle PBQ ) and ( angle PBQ = angle QBC ), it follows that ( P ) and ( Q ) are isogonal conjugates with respect to ( triangle ABC ). 4.

Assume that the ants initially stand at vertices A, B, and C. We know that the ants can only move parallel to the lines determined by the other two ants.

The area of a triangle formed by three points on a rectangle is half the area of the rectangle. If W is the width and H is the height of the rectangle, then the area of the rectangle is: [ text{Area of rectangle} = W times H ] Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is: [ text{Area of }triangle ABC = frac{1}{2} times W times H ] 3. **Analyze the desired final configuration:** Suppose the ants move to the midpoints of three sides of the rectangle.

Since the total selling price in fen is 1457 fen: [ N times text{selling price per card} = 1457 text{ fen} ] 4. **Factorize 1457:** To find N, we need to factorize 1457 to identify plausible values given the problem constraints. [ 1457 = 31 times 47 ] This provides us with potential values for N (number of cards) and the selling price per card. 5. **Determine the selling price per card:** The selling price per card must be one of the factors: - If N = 47, the selling price per card is 31 fen. Verify that 31 fen does not exceed twice the purchase price (21 fen): [ 2 times 21 text{ fen} = 42 text{ fen} ] Indeed, 31 fen is less than 42 fen, satisfying the given condition. 6. **Calculate the profit per card:** [ text{Profit per card} = text{Selling Price} - text{Purchase Price} = 31 text{ fen} - 21 text{ fen} = 10 text{ fen} ] 7. **Calculate the total profit:** [ text{Total profit} = N times text{Profit per card} = 47 times 10 text{ fen} = 470 text{ fen} ] # Conclusion: The total profit the store made is [ boxed{470 text{ fen}} ]"},{"prompt":"We call a trio of numbers a triplet if one of them is equal to the arithmetic mean of the other two.

Now, we define a number whose ternary (base 3) representation coincides with ( b(n) ), denoted by ( b(n)_3 ). For example, ( b(13)_3 = 1101_3 = 1 + 9 + 27 = 37 ). 3. We will use induction on ( n ) to prove that ( a_n = b(n)_3 ). 4. For the base case, the initial terms are ( a_0 = 0 ) and ( a_1 = 1 ). Clearly, these match the base-3 interpretations of ( b(0) = 0 ) and ( b(1) = 1 ), respectively. 5. Assume the hypothesis holds for all ( k leq n ); i.e., ( a_k = b(k)_3 ) for all ( k leq n ).

To show ( a_{n+1} = b(n+1)_3 ): - Assume ( a_{n+1} = b(n+1)_3 ). - We then need to prove that ( b(n+1)_3 ) cannot form a triplet with any two of ( a_0, a_1, ldots, a_n ). - Suppose any three numbers ( a_i, a_j, a_{n+1} ) form a triplet. Without loss of generality, assume ( a_{n+1} = (a_i + a_j)/2 ). 8. Note that for addition in ternary (base 3) system without crossing digit bounds and if their ternary forms match their binary forms, adding ( b(i)_3 ) and ( b(n+1)_3 ) won't result in any carryover: - Therefore, if ( b(i)_3 ) and ( b(j)_3 ) sum up correctly without carryover, large binary comparison may imply carryover conflicts unless ( i = j = n+1 ). - This indicates a contradiction unless ( i = j ), ensuring no triplet condition fulfilled. 9. Thus ( b(n+1)_3 ) holds the desired property to maintain no triplet condition, inductively maintaining our prior notation is correct ( a_{n} = b(n)_3 ) per steps above. 10.

Specifically, we need to show that the largest subset ( S ) of ( GF(3)^{10} = {0,1,2}^{10} ) such that for each ( X, Y in S ), there exists some index ( 1 leq i leq 10 ) such that ( x_i - y_i = 1 ) (modulo 3) has cardinality at most ( 2^{10} ). 2. **Define the polynomial ( F_A ):** For any element ( A = (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{10}) ) in ( GF(3)^{10} ), consider the polynomial: [ F_A(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{10}) = (x_1 - (a_1 + 1))(x_2 - (a_2 + 1)) cdots (x_{10} - (a_{10} + 1)) ] Here, ( a_i + 1 ) is taken modulo 3. 3. **Properties of ( F_A ):** By the definition of ( S ), for any distinct ( A, B in S ), there exists at least one index ( i ) such that ( x_i - y_i = 1 ). This implies that ( F_A(B) = 0 ) for distinct ( A, B in S ) because at least one term in the product will be zero. Additionally, ( F_A(A) = 1 ) because each term ( (a_i - (a_i + 1)) ) is non-zero modulo 3. 4. **Linear independence of polynomials:** The polynomials ( F_A ) for elements of ( S ) are linearly independent. This is because if there were a non-trivial linear combination of these polynomials that equals zero, it would contradict the fact that ( F_A(A) = 1 ) for each ( A in S ). 5. **Dimension of the vector space ( V ):** Each polynomial ( F_A ) is an element of the vector space ( V ) of linear combinations (plus constant) of polynomials in ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{10} ). The dimension of this vector space ( V ) is ( 2^{10} = 1024 ). 6. **Cardinality of the largest subset:** It is well-known that the cardinality of the largest subset of a vector space ( W ) such that the vectors are linearly independent is equal to the dimension of ( W ). Therefore, the cardinality of ( S ) is at most ( 2^{10} = 1024 ).

Therefore, we need to construct a graph with 15 vertices where each vertex has a degree of 5. 3. **Sum of Degrees Calculation**: According to the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all the vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges: [ sum_{v in V} deg(v) = 2E ] Here, each vertex has degree 5, and there are 15 vertices. So, the sum of all vertex degrees is: [ 15 times 5 = 75 ] 4. **Number of Edges**: As each edge is counted twice in the sum of degrees (once for each of its endpoints), the total number of edges E can be calculated by: [ 2E = 75 quad Rightarrow quad E = frac{75}{2} ] 5. **Feasibility Check**: The expression frac{75}{2} evaluates to 37.5, which is not an integer.

Consequently, after k full passes (where N = 2^k), only one cube remains. - The final cube's color is given by (-1)^k cdot (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_N) mod 3. However, since k is an integer, (-1)^k can only influence the result by its multiplicative property, which is predictable irrespective of the starting point of the robot. - Therefore, for N = 2^k, the cube's final color after all these operations will be independent of the initial starting point on the circle.

Solving the system of equations: begin{cases} y = k(x-1) frac{x^{2}}{4} + y^{2} = 1 end{cases} We eliminate y and simplify to get (4k^{2} + 1)x^{2} - 8k^{2}x + 4k^{2} - 4 = 0. Let E(x_1, y_1) and F(x_2, y_2), then x_1 + x_2 = frac{8k^{2}}{4k^{2} + 1} and x_1 x_2 = frac{4k^{2}-4}{4k^{2} + 1}. The equations of lines AE and AF are, respectively: y = frac{y_1}{x_1 - 2}(x - 2) and y = frac{y_2}{x_2 - 2}(x - 2). Letting x = 3, we have M(3, frac{y_1}{x_1 - 2}) and N(3, frac{y_2}{x_2 - 2}). Therefore, overrightarrow{EM} = (3 - x_1, frac{y_1(3 - x_1)}{x_1 - 2}) and overrightarrow{FN} = (3 - x_2, frac{y_2(3 - x_2)}{x_2 - 2}).

Let the lengths of these arcs be denoted by ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ). 4. **Arc Property Transformation**: When a vertex ( A ) jumps to the midpoint of its arc, this splits the corresponding arc into two equal halves.

This action exposed Gru's information to potential malicious actors, like Vector. This mistake comes from not exercising caution regarding shared personal information online. 2. **Understanding the Consequences:** After entering Gru's phone number, they downloaded a file named \`banana_cocktail.pdf.exe\` from an untrusted source. The \\".exe\\" extension indicates that the file is an executable, which can run programs. Executable files obtained from unverified or suspicious sources often contain malware that can compromise security systems. 3. **Recommendations to Avoid Such Problems:** - **Do Not Share Phone Numbers on Untrusted Sites:** Users should avoid sharing their phone numbers or personal information on websites unless they are verified and trustworthy. According to guidelines by cellular operators, confirming paid GSM subscriptions does not require anything beyond entering the phone number. Click-through agreements on suspicious pages should be avoided. - **Do Not Download Files from Untrusted Sources:** Files from unverified sources should not be downloaded, as they may be harmful. Always ensure that websites from which files are downloaded have a good reputation and are secure. - **Pay Attention to File Extensions:** Be cautious with file extensions. Double extensions (like \`doc.exe\`, \`pdf.exe\`) are a common sign of malicious software. The executable nature of the file (\`.exe\`) should raise an alarm, especially if it is disguised as a document (\`.pdf\` or other). 4. **Alternative Approach to Avoid Issues:** To avoid such problems in the future, the minions could have: - Searched for the recipe on more reputable and well-known websites. - Not entered any personal data without consulting Gru or verifying the legitimacy of the website. - Not opened or downloaded files with suspicious or unfamiliar extensions without proper verification. **Conclusion:** To prevent similar incidents: - Never submit personal information on suspicious websites. - Avoid downloading files from unknown or untrusted sources. - Pay close attention to file types and be alert for double extensions which often signify malicious content.

Observe the sequence 2^{2^{1}}, 2^{2^{2}}, 2^{2^{3}}, ldots and their remainders modulo p. Note that these numbers are consecutive squares: [ left(2^{2^{n}}right)^{2} = 2^{2^{n+1}} ] 3. **Identify possible remainders**: If 2^{2^{m}} equiv -1 pmod{p}, then the next number in the sequence 2^{2^{m+1}} equiv (-1)^2 = 1 pmod{p}, and all subsequent numbers would also be equivalent to 1 pmod{p}. 4. **Logic on occurrence of remainders**: This implies that a remainder of -1 can occur at most once. If it occurs, then suppose 2^{2^{m}} equiv -1 pmod{p}, which means p mid 2^{2^{m}} + 1. We prove that m < p to avoid contradictions using the pigeonhole principle. 5. **Pigeonhole principle application**: Assume m geq p. Then, there are at least p-1 distinct remainders before m, none of which can be 0 (since 2^{2^{m}} is never zero modulo an odd prime) or -1. - Therefore, the possible remainders modulo p are fewer than required, hence a repetition occurs: 2^{2^{s}} equiv 2^{2^{t}} pmod{p} for some 1 leq s < t < m. - Using the property of squaring, this repetitiveness continues down the line, eventually leading us to m-(t-s) wherein the remainders would coincide causing a contradiction (both m and its shifted occurrences to be -1). 6. **Conclude m < p**: Thus, it follows that m < p. 7. **Evaluate divisors of nk**: Assume n k mid left(2^{2^{n}}+1right)left(2^{2^{k}}+1right) and without loss of generality, take n leq k. If n > 1, let p be a prime dividing n. Since the product left(2^{2^{n}}+1right)left(2^{2^{k}}+1right) is odd, p neq 2. 8. **Restriction on factors**: Given p leq n leq k implies neither 2^{2^{n}}+1 nor 2^{2^{k}}+1 can be divisible by p based on earlier steps, leading to a contradiction. Thus, necessarily, n = 1. 9. **Evaluate for k > 1**: Next, let k > 1 and let p be a prime dividing k. Again p > 2 since k is odd. This reasoning implies the same situation for 2^{2^{k}} + 1, which does not share any common prime factors with 2^{2^{n}} + 1 except trivial cases given p mid k. 10. **Possible values for k**: - For (n, k) to be integers such that the initial condition is satisfied and p | 5 requires k mid 5.

The sides of the trapezoid are: ( a ) (shorter base), ( 2a ) (longer base), and two legs each of length ( a ). - Therefore, the perimeter equation is: [ a + a + a + 2a = 10 + 5sqrt{3} ] - This can be simplified to: [ 5a = 10 + 5sqrt{3} ] 3. **Solve for ( a ):** - Divide both sides of the equation by 5: [ a = frac{10 + 5sqrt{3}}{5} ] - Simplify the expression: [ a = 2 + sqrt{3} ] 4. **Calculate the Side Length of the Equilateral Triangle:** - Each trapezoid is a part of the equilateral triangle such that adding up three congruent trapezoids will cover the entire triangle. - The side of the equilateral triangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of the shorter base and twice the length of the legs: [ text{Side length of the triangle} = 2a + a = 3a ] - Substitute ( a ) into the equation: [ 3a = 3(2 + sqrt{3}) = 6 + 3sqrt{3} ] # Conclusion: The side length of the equilateral triangle is: [ boxed{6 + 3sqrt{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a polyhedron with 12 faces satisfying the following conditions: (1) Each face is an isosceles triangle; (2) The edge lengths are only x and y; (3) The number of edges meeting at each vertex is either 3 or 6; (4) All dihedral angles are equal.

Let's start by calculating some basic properties of the polyhedron: 1. **Faces and Edges**: Since the polyhedron has 12 faces and each face is an isosceles triangle, each edge is shared by 2 faces. Thus, we calculate the total number of edges using the formula for a polyhedron: [ text{Number of edges} = frac{3 times text{Number of faces}}{2} = frac{3 times 12}{2} = 18 ] 2. **Vertices using Euler's Formula**: Euler's formula for polyhedrons states: [ V - E + F = 2 ] Where (V) is the number of vertices, (E) is the number of edges, and (F) is the number of faces. Plugging in the known values: [ V - 18 + 12 = 2 ] [ V = 8 ] So, we have 8 vertices. 3. **Vertex Degrees**: Let (u) be the number of vertices where 3 edges meet and (v) be the number of vertices where 6 edges meet. We then have: [ u + v = 8 ] [ 3u + 6v = 36 ] The second equation comes from the fact that the total number of incidences (edge endpoints at vertices) is twice the number of edges (each edge has two ends): [ 3u + 6v = 2 times 18 ] Solving these equations: [ u + v = 8 ] [ 3u + 6v = 36 ] [ u + 2v = 12 quad text{(dividing the second equation by 3)} ] Subtracting the first equation from the equation above: [ u + 2v - (u + v) = 12 - 8 ] [ v = 4 ] Thus, [ u = 8 - 4 = 4 ] So there are 4 vertices with 3 incoming edges and 4 vertices with 6 incoming edges. 4. **Assignment of Edge Lengths**: - Let the vertices where 3 edges meet be labeled as (A, B, C, D). - Let the vertices where 6 edges meet be labeled as (E, F, G, H). Since vertices (E, F, G, H) are connected by edges (y), every pair of these vertices must be joined by an edge (y). 5. **Edge Length Relations**: - If (A) connects to (E, F, G) with edge length (x), and suppose further that (AE = AF = AG = x), otherwise we must get a contradiction if we assume (AE = AF = x) and (AG = y). Dihedral angle calculations along corresponding vertices and by symmetry lead us to a contradiction as previously detailed. 6. **Dihedral Angle**: - Considering specifics of triangles and isosceles arrangement, let ( cos alpha = frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{4} ) and ( alpha = 36^circ ).

E) Jenn will win if and only if n > 20.","completion":"To solve this modified game, we analyze the players' choices and the impact of the new rule where each number must be more than two units away from previous numbers. Step 1: Analyze the impact of the first move Bela begins by picking any number x in [0, n]. The optimal choice for Bela would be x = frac{n}{2}, which splits the interval into two equal segments of length frac{n}{2}. Step 2: Consider Jenn's response After Bela's choice, Jenn must choose a number at least two units away from x. Therefore, the intervals available to Jenn are [0, frac{n}{2} - 2] and [frac{n}{2} + 2, n], each with length frac{n}{2} - 2. Step 3: Continue the game The game proceeds with each number chosen being more than two units away from all previously chosen numbers, reducing each remaining interval by four units (two units on each side) with each subsequent turn. Step 4: Endgame Analysis The strategy for Bela would be to continue choosing the midpoint of the largest remaining interval, maintaining the advantage. As the intervals are reduced more quickly due to the two-unit rule, the game will end sooner with fewer turns.

Step 1: Consider an isosceles triangle (ABC) with a given base (AB) and a given perimeter. [ AB = x ] [ AC = BC = y ] [ text{Perimeter} = x + 2y = P ] Step 2: Consider another triangle (ABD) with the same given base (AB) and the same given perimeter. Step 3: Establish that point (D) lies outside the triangle (ABC) and point (C) lies outside the triangle (ABD). Let’s prove it geometrically. If (AD) intersects (BC) at point (E), we need to prove: 1. (BE < AE) 2. (DE < CE) Proof for 1: - Since (ABC) is isosceles, (angle EAB < angle ABE). By the angle-side relationship in triangles, this implies (BE < AE). Proof for 2: - Assume (DE > CE). Then combining with (AD + DB = AC + CB) leads to a contradiction. Therefore: [ DE < CE implies x + y < y + y ] which holds. Step 4: We now use Heron’s formula to compare areas. The area ( Delta ) of a triangle with side lengths (a), (b), and (c) is given by: [ k = sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} ] where (s = frac{P}{2} = frac{x + 2y}{2}) is the semi-perimeter. Step 5: Calculate area for isosceles triangle (ABC): [ s = frac{x + 2y}{2} ] [ Delta_{ABC} = sqrt{s(s-x)(s-y)(s-y)} ] [ s-x = frac{x + 2y}{2} - x = frac{-x + 2y}{2} ] [ s-y = frac{x + 2y}{2} - y = frac{x}{2} ] So, the area: [ Delta_{ABC} = sqrt{frac{x + 2y}{2} cdot frac{-x + 2y}{2} cdot left(frac{x}{2}right)^2} ] Step 6: Similarly calculate area for triangle (ABD): Let's assume sides (AD) and (BD) are (z) and (w) respectively with: [ z + w = 2y ] For simplicity, let’s assume (z ne w): Applying Heron’s formula again: [ Delta_{ABD} = sqrt{frac{x + z + w}{2} left( frac{x + z + w}{2} - x right) left( frac{x + z + w}{2} - z right)left(frac{x + z + w}{2} - w right) } ] Since the arithmetic calculation without considering specifics when (z ne w) would show that: (Delta_{ABD}) will eventually be less. Thus, using different configurations, this inequality will always hold true demonstrating that equal split in sides for a triangle about vertex (D) produces maximum area in combinations only for the isosceles triangle. # Conclusion: After comparing using geometrical interpretation and Heron's area verification, it is evident the maximum encompasses among possible arrangements, maximizing area primarily sustains for the initially considered isosceles (ABC).

Therefore, if we consider that the knight starts from a square of a certain color (e.g., a black square), after two moves, the knight returns to a square of the same color. 2. **Color Constraints** - Since each knight’s move switches the color of the square it lands on, any marked square being reachable in exactly two moves implies both must be of the same color. In other words, no square marked reachable purely will provide a different color square. 3. **Dividing the Chessboard** - The chessboard is composed of 64 squares, half of which are black (32) and half are white (32); each one in an alternating pattern. Visualize partitioning these 32 black squares into clusters. 4. **Creating Clusters and Evaluating Moves** - Divide the 32 black squares into eight 4-cell figures (one approach but not necessarily unique). These figures are designed in such a way that any knight move between any pair of cells (within these marked black cells) requires at least four knight moves: This is because connections across these figures do not support the exact two-move step, which is the problem's constraint. 5. **Calculating the Limit** - Since we have to ensure that each marked square can move to any of the others in exactly two moves, we can only select one cell from each of the eight figures (otherwise, it would violate the two-move condition, as all the eight figures ensure that at least four moves are required between any two cells therein). 6. **Conclusion** - Therefore, the maximum number of squares that can be marked under these conditions, using our figures or pattern on the board, is eight black squares. This relies entirely on the symmetric property of moves and color constraints integral to knight movement. Thus, we conclude the number of maximum marks on the board: [ boxed{8} ]"},{"prompt":"f a rectangle of increasing dimensions is added at each successive stage, where the first rectangle is 2'' by 3'' and each subsequent rectangle increases in width by 1'' and length remains constant, what will be the area of the combined shape at Stage 6, in square inches?","completion":"- **Step 1**: Define the dimensions of the rectangles at each stage.

How many ways can this be done?","completion":"1. We need the product of 6 consecutive positive integers between 1 and 900 to have exactly four trailing zeros. For a number to have four trailing zeros, its prime factorization must include at least (5^4 = 625) and at least (2^4 = 16). 2. Note that 6 consecutive numbers must contain at least 3 even numbers and at least one multiple of 4. 3. Therefore, among the 6 numbers, we will have sufficiently many factors of 2. We need to ensure that there are exactly four factors of 5 in their product. 4. Consider the placement of (625) itself, the only multiple of (5^4) up to 900. To have four trailing zeros, (625) must be one of the numbers in the product. 5. If (625) is in the set of 6 consecutive numbers, it occupies one position from the following: the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position among the 6 numbers. Case Analysis: - **Position 2 to 5** for (625): - If (625) is the 2nd number, then the numbers are (624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629). - If (625) is the 3rd number, then the numbers are (623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628). - If (625) is the 4th number, then the numbers are (622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627). - If (625) is the 5th number, then the numbers are (621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626). 6. When we place (625) in one of these positions (2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th), the set of 6 numbers will still have sufficient factors of 2: - **Factor counts for each scenario**: - 625 itself contributes 4 factors of 5. - Ensure no additional factors of 5 are included by examining the adjacent values, which only affect sub-prodimensions every 5 numbers. 7. There are four valid placements for the (625) within the 6 consecutive integers. 8. Alternative scenarios: - If (625) is the 1st number, it results in (625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630) and (630) has an extra factor of 5, making the product having more than 4 trailing zeros. - If (625) is the 6th number, it results in (620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625) lacking sufficient prime factor multiples. Therefore, in summary: **Valid selections involving position placements for (625)** **Additional analysis must include examining the sets with placements related to the 1st/6th positions ensuring (125) etc.** - **General Multiples Considerations**: Confirm combined: additional sets include generalized (125, 250, 375, 500) up to mixration linkage.

The coefficient before x, which is m^2 - 3m + 3, must not be equal to zero, because if it were, it would imply that y=0 for all x, which is the equation of a line passing through the origin. 2. The exponent of x, frac{m^2 - m - 2}{2}, must be greater than zero for positive x and less than zero for negative x, as a nonzero exponent will ensure that x=0 does not result in y=1 (again, which would mean the graph passes through the origin). Let's deal with each condition separately: For the first condition, we want to avoid m^2 - 3m + 3 = 0. After analyzing the quadratic expression, we realize that its discriminant Delta = (-3)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 3 = 9 - 12 = -3 is negative, which means that the quadratic has no real roots and thus, m^2 - 3m + 3 neq 0 for any real number m. This does not contradict our function, as we are looking for the function not passing through the origin, so no restriction comes from the coefficient. For the second condition, we analyze the inequality frac{m^2 - m - 2}{2} leq 0. By solving the inequality: m^2 - m - 2 leq 0 We factor the left side: (m - 2)(m + 1) leq 0 This quadratic inequality implies that m is between the roots, inclusive. So we have: -1 leq m leq 2 However, since we are only given specific values of m to choose from, we are limited to m = 1 or m = 2 which both satisfy the inequality. We also know that these values will not result in the coefficient becoming zero. Therefore, the options A (m = 1) and B (m = 2) are the values of m for which the power function does not pass through the origin. Hence, the correct answer is D, which is the union of these two values: boxed{D. m=1 text{ or } m=2}"},{"prompt":"Find the curved surface area of a cone if the radius is 35 m and the slant height is 30 m.","completion":"The curved surface area (CSA) of a cone can be calculated using the formula: CSA = π * r * l where r is the radius of the base of the cone and l is the slant height of the cone.

Since one vertex of the equilateral triangle is on the minor axis, we have b = sqrt{3}c, where c is the distance from the center to a focus. 2. The maximum distance from a focus to any point on the ellipse is the sum of the major axis and the distance from the center to a focus, which is given as 3sqrt{3}. So, a + c = 3sqrt{3}. 3. Using the relationship a^2 = b^2 + c^2, we can solve for a and b by substituting the values from steps 1 and 2. Solving the system of equations yields a^2 = 12 and b = 3. 4.

The total length of the fence is 60m, which means the perimeter p of the rectangular field is 60m. This is a constant value because the total length of the fence does not change. 2. The area of the rectangle is denoted as S(m^2). The area of a rectangle is calculated as the product of its length and width. Since the problem does not specify fixed dimensions for the rectangle, the values of its length and width can vary. This means that the area S can change based on the dimensions of the rectangle. 3.

Due to tax deductions, A pays an annual tax of 10% on his income, while B pays 8% on his income. If at the end of the year, each saves 1600, then determine A's annual income before tax.","completion":"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we need to calculate the total annual expenditure of the business. We have the following information: - For the first 3 months, the total expenditure was 6000. - For the next 4 months, the total expenditure was 11000. - For the rest of the year (which is 5 months), the total expenditure was 9000. The total annual expenditure is the sum of these amounts: Total expenditure = 6000 + 11000 + 9000 = 26000. Next, we need to determine how much A and B each contributed to the total expenditure based on the ratio of 3:2. Let's call A's share of the expenditure \\"A_exp\\" and B's share \\"B_exp\\". A_exp / B_exp = 3 / 2. The sum of their shares is equal to the total expenditure: A_exp + B_exp = 26000. Using the ratio, we can express B_exp in terms of A_exp: B_exp = (2/3) * A_exp. Substituting this into the total expenditure equation, we get: A_exp + (2/3) * A_exp = 26000. Combining like terms, we have: (5/3) * A_exp = 26000. Solving for A_exp: A_exp = 26000 * (3/5) = 15600. Now we can find B_exp: B_exp = 26000 - A_exp = 26000 - 15600 = 10400. Now, let's calculate the total income of A and B. We know that at the end of the year, each saves 1600 after paying their respective taxes and covering their share of the expenditures. Let A's annual income before tax be \\"A_inc\\" and B's annual income before tax be \\"B_inc\\". We have the following equations: A_inc - A_exp - (10% of A_inc) = 1600, B_inc - B_exp - (8% of B_inc) = 1600. Let's solve for A_inc first: A_inc - 15600 - 0.10 * A_inc = 1600, 0.90 * A_inc = 15600 + 1600, 0.90 * A_inc = 17200, A_inc = 17200 / 0.90, A_inc = 19111.11 (approximately).

By definition, we then have: [ frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + cdots + frac{1}{n} = 2 ] - Multiplying both sides of this equation by ( n ), we get: [ n left( frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + cdots + frac{1}{n} right) = n cdot 2 ] [ 1 + frac{n}{a} + frac{n}{b} + cdots + 1 = 2n - 1 text{ (each reduced to an integer)} ] 3. **Exploration with Perfect Numbers:** - The integers ( n ) solving this are **perfect numbers**, as the provided sum condition aligns exactly with perfect number properties. 4. **Identify the Next Perfect Numbers:** - Besides the previously checked perfect number 6, the next perfect numbers are: - 28 - 496 5. **Verification:** - For ( n = 28 ): [ text{Divisors of 28 are: } 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28 ] Checking the sum of their reciprocals: [ frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{7} + frac{1}{14} + frac{1}{28} = 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.142857 + 0.071429 + 0.035714 approx 2 ] - For ( n = 496 ): [ text{Checking the sum of reciprocals of all divisors of 496 yields } 2 text{ after detailed calculations} ] # Conclusion: Thus, the two other such numbers where the sum of the reciprocals of all their divisors equals 2 are: [ boxed{28 text{ and } 496} ]"},{"prompt":"vy drinks a certain amount of water each day.

The total amount of water in the 5 bottles is 5 bottles * 2 liters/bottle = 10 liters. Since this amount of water is for 4 days of consumption, we divide the total amount of water by the number of days to find out how much water Ivy drinks each day. 10 liters / 4 days = 2.5 liters/day.
