D: If left(a,bright) is on the graph, then left(a,bright) is also on the graph.","completion":"Given the inverse proportion function y = -frac{6}{x}, let's analyze the given options step by step: 1. **Analyzing Option A:** - The function y = -frac{6}{x} implies that as x increases, y becomes less negative (or increases if x is negative), but this is not a straightforward increase as in linear functions. The rate of change of y with respect to x depends on the value of x. Specifically, for positive x, as x increases, y moves towards 0 from the negative side, and for negative x, as x increases (towards 0), y decreases (becomes more negative). Therefore, statement A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the behavior of y as x increases. [ text{So, option A is incorrect.} ] 2. **Analyzing Option B:** - Since k = -6 < 0, the graph of the function will be located in the quadrants where x and y have opposite signs. These are the second quadrant (where x < 0, y > 0) and the fourth quadrant (where x > 0, y < 0). This is because the negative value of k flips the graph across the origin compared to a positive k. [ text{So, option B is incorrect.} ] 3. **Analyzing Option C:** - When -2 < x < 0, y = -frac{6}{x} results in y > 3 because dividing a negative by a negative gives a positive, and the magnitude is greater than 3 due to the absolute value of x being less than 2. However, when x > 0, y becomes negative because a negative divided by a positive is negative, and thus y < 0. This means that the statement \\"When x > -2, y > 3\\" does not hold true for all x > -2. [ text{So, option C is incorrect.} ] 4. **Analyzing Option D:** - The graph of y = -frac{6}{x} is symmetric about the origin. This means if a point left(-a, bright) is on the graph, reflecting it over both axes will result in the point left(a, -bright), which will also lie on the graph. This property is a characteristic of functions that are odd, and since our function is of the form y = k/x with k < 0, it satisfies this condition.

When m leq 0, f'(x) > 0 is always true for x in (0, +infty). Therefore, f(x) is increasing on the interval (0, +infty). When m > 0, we have: f'(x) = frac{4}{x} - 2mx = frac{4 - 2mx^2}{x} = frac{-2m(x + sqrt{frac{2}{m}})(x - sqrt{frac{2}{m}})}{x} text{ for } (x > 0). If f'(x) > 0, then 0 < x < sqrt{frac{2}{m}}. If f'(x) < 0, then x > sqrt{frac{2}{m}}. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on the interval left(0, sqrt{frac{2}{m}}right) and decreasing on the interval left(sqrt{frac{2}{m}}, +inftyright). (2) Method one: From the problem, we know that 4ln x - mx^2 + 1 leq 0 holds true for x in [1, e]. This implies m geq frac{4ln x + 1}{x^2} for x in [1, e]. Let g(x) = frac{4ln x + 1}{x^2} where x in [1, e]. Thus, g'(x) = frac{2(1 - 4ln x)}{x^3}. If g'(x) > 0, then 1 < x < e^{frac{1}{4}}. If g'(x) < 0, then e^{frac{1}{4}} < x < e. Hence, g(x) is increasing on (1, e^{frac{1}{4}}) and decreasing on (e^{frac{1}{4}}, e). Therefore, max{g(x)}=gleft(e^{frac{1}{4}}right)= frac{4ln e^{frac{1}{4}}+1}{(e^{frac{1}{4}})^2} = frac{2sqrt{e}}{e}. Thus, m geq frac{2sqrt{e}}{e}. Method two: In order for f(x) leq 0 to always hold, it is sufficient to have f(x)_{max} leq 0. (a) When m leq 0, f(x) is increasing on [1, e], so the maximum occurs at the endpoint f(e) = 4 - me^2 + 1 leq 0. That is, m geq frac{5}{e^2}, which contradicts m leq 0. Thus, this case is invalid. (b) When m > 0, if 1 < sqrt{frac{2}{m}} < e, which means frac{2}{e^2} < m < 2, f(x) is increasing on [1, sqrt{frac{2}{m}}] and decreasing on [sqrt{frac{2}{m}}, e]. Hence, the maximum value is f(sqrt{frac{2}{m}}) = 4lnsqrt{frac{2}{m}}-1 leq 0, which gives us sqrt{frac{2}{m}} leq e^{frac{1}{4}}. Solving, we get m geq frac{2sqrt{e}}{e}, and because frac{2}{e^2} < m < 2, the range of m is frac{2sqrt{e}}{e} leq m < 2.

Case Analysis: Since x+y+z=30 is even, x, y, and z can be all even, or two of them odd and one even. **Case 1**: All even. - gcd(x,y), gcd(y,z), and gcd(z,x) are at least 2. - A simple example where all gcd values are 4 gives gcd(x,y)+gcd(y,z)+gcd(z,x) = 4+4+4 = 12. - Possible values satisfying x+y+z=30 could be (x, y, z) = (10, 10, 10). - Calculate x^2+y^2+z^2 = 10^2+10^2+10^2 = 100+100+100 = 300. **Case 2**: Two odd and one even. - Assume x and y are odd, and z is even. - Now, gcd(x,y) is odd, and gcd(y,z) and gcd(z,x) are even. - Example: gcd(x,y) = 1, gcd(y,z) = 5, gcd(z,x) = 6. - Possible scenario: x=9, y=11, z=10. - Calculate x^2+y^2+z^2 = 9^2 + 11^2 + 10^2 = 81 + 121 + 100 = 302.

The total area covered by these 9 crosses is: [ 9 times 5 = 45 text{ square units} ] 4. Additionally, we include eight half-rectangles of 1 times 2: [ text{Each half-rectangle has an area of } 1 text{ unit} ] Hence, the total area of eight such half-rectangles is: [ 8 times 1 = 8 text{ square units} ] 5.

Since the period of the function is 4, we can find the value of f(2015) by taking advantage of this periodicity. The period indicates that f(x + 4k) = f(x) for any integer k. Therefore, we can write: f(2015) = f(2015 - 4 times 503) = f(3) Considering the function's odd property, we get: f(3) = -f(-3) Since -3 differs from 1 by a multiple of the function's period (4), we have f(-3) = f(-3 + 4) = f(1).

So, {3}^{log_{3}2} = 2. 2. **Negative Exponent and Fraction Power**: For the term {(-frac{3}{2})}^{-2} times {(3frac{3}{8})}^{frac{2}{3}}, we first convert the mixed number into an improper fraction, which results in 3frac{3}{8} = frac{27}{8}. Next, we apply the negative exponent rule and fractional exponent rule. The negative exponent {(-frac{3}{2})}^{-2} becomes {(frac{2}{3})}^2 because the negative sign in the exponent means reciprocal, and squaring both the numerator and denominator gives us frac{4}{9}. Then, simplifying {(3frac{3}{8})}^{frac{2}{3}} or, equivalently, {(frac{27}{8})}^{frac{2}{3}} gives us the cube root of frac{27}{8} squared, which is the same as {(frac{3}{2})}^2 due to the fractional exponent properties. Thus, the entire expression simplifies to {(frac{2}{3})}^2 times {(frac{3}{2})}^2 = frac{4}{9} times frac{9}{4} = 1. 3. **Logarithmic Addition**: Next, we have logfrac{5}{2}+2log2. According to logarithm properties, 2log2 can be simplified to log2^2 = log4. Then, adding logfrac{5}{2} + log4 is equivalent to log(frac{5}{2} times 4) because of the logarithm product rule. This further simplifies to log(5 times 2) = log10. 4. **Putting It All Together**: Combining all parts, we get 2 - 1 + log10. Since log10 = 1 in base 10, the equation simplifies to 2 - 1 + 1. 5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the final answer to the equation is 2 - 1 + 1 = 2.

So we can write: [ n = 34m + r ] where ( m ) is some integer. Now, when the order of division is reversed, we first divide ( n ) by 34 and then the result by 12. The sum of the remainders in this case is 10. Let's find the remainder when ( n ) is divided by 34: [ n mod 34 = (12k + 56) mod 34 ] Since 56 is greater than 34, we can subtract 34 from 56 to find the remainder: [ 56 - 34 = 22 ] So, when ( n ) is divided by 34, the remainder is 22. Now, let's find the remainder when ( n ) is divided by 12: [ n mod 12 = (34m + r) mod 12 ] We don't know ( m ) or ( r ), but we know that the sum of the remainders is 10: [ 22 + r mod 12 = 10 ] Since ( r ) is a remainder, it must be less than 12.

Thus for any sufficiently large term index ( k ), we observe: [ a_{n} < a_{k} < a_{n} + 1998 ] If ( a_{k} < a_{n} ), since each term in the sequence appears at least once, there must be some ( j, j+1 geq n ) such that: [ a_j < a_n < a_{j+1} ] Given ( frac{|a_j - a_{j+1}|}{|j - j+1|} < 1998 ), we get: [ |a_{n} - a_j| < 1998 ] This is due to the bounded difference condition: [ |j - n| < 1998 times 999 ] Thus: [ i leq j < n + 2 cdot 10^6 ] Therefore, if ( i > n ) and ( a_i < a_n ), it must be that ( i - n < 2 cdot 10^6 ). Consequently, if ( i < n + 2 cdot 10^6 ), then ( a_i < a_n ). Step 3: Bound the Sequence We now use the lemma to provide an upper bound for ( a_n ): - Since every natural number appears in the sequence, we look at the number of terms within the interval ([1, a_n]). From the proven lemma, any number not greater than ( n ) should fit within ( a_n ). The count of such terms can include those located at indices from: [ n-2 cdot 10^6 text{ to } n+2 cdot 10^6 ] Thus, [ a_n < n + 2 cdot 10^6 ] Similarly, using the lower bound argument for sufficiently large values, [ a_n > n - 2 cdot 10^6 ] Therefore: [ |a_n - n| < 2 cdot 10^6 ] Conclusion: We have shown that: [ |a_n - n| < 2 cdot 10^6 ] Thus, the required condition ( |a_n - n| < 2000000 ) is satisfied for all natural numbers ( n ).

Moreover, f(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval [{-pi,-frac{pi}{2}}]. To determine which statements are correct, we analyze the given conditions step by step. 1. **Monotonically Increasing Interval**: Given that f(x) is monotonically increasing on [{-pi,-frac{pi}{2}}], we can infer the period T of the function. Since the function is increasing in this interval, we have: [ frac{T}{2} geqslant -frac{pi}{2} + pi implies T geqslant pi ] This is derived from the understanding that the increasing interval must be at least half the period of the function. 2. **Axis and Center of Symmetry**: Given x=-pi as the axis of symmetry and ({frac{pi}{2},0}) as a center of symmetry, we deduce: [ frac{T}{4} = frac{pi}{2} + pi = frac{3pi}{2} quad text{or} quad frac{3T}{4} = frac{pi}{2} + pi = frac{3pi}{2} ] Solving these equations for T gives us two possible periods: T=6pi or T=2pi. 3. **Determining omega and phi**: - For T=6pi, we find omega as follows: [ T = 6pi = frac{2pi}{omega} implies omega = frac{1}{3} ] Substituting omega = frac{1}{3} into f(x) and using the center of symmetry condition f(frac{pi}{2})=0, we get: [ 2sinleft(frac{1}{3}cdotfrac{pi}{2}+phiright)=0 implies frac{pi}{6}+phi = kpi, quad kin mathbb{Z} ] This leads to phi = -frac{pi}{6}, which contradicts option B.

She has 4 more angelfish than half the number of goldfish. Half the number of goldfish is 8 / 2 = 4. So, she has 4 + 4 = 8 angelfish. 3. She has twice as many guppies as the difference between the number of angelfish and goldfish. The difference between the number of angelfish and goldfish is 8 - 8 = 0. Twice that difference is 2 * 0 = 0 guppies. 4. She has 3 fewer tetras than the square root of the number of goldfish. The square root of the number of goldfish (8) is √8 ≈ 2.83. Since we're likely dealing with whole fish, we'll round down to 2. So, she has 2 - 3 = -1 tetras, but since she can't have a negative number of fish, we'll assume this means she has 0 tetras. 5.

Represent this area in square miles as a simplified fraction p/q, where p and q are relatively prime integers, and find p + q.","completion":"Let's set the origin O (0, 0) as the intersection of the roads, which will be X and Y axes. If the vehicle travels a distance x on the road in time t, we have t = frac{x}{60} hours, because the speed on the road is 60 miles per hour. The vehicle can travel off-road for t = frac{1}{6} - frac{x}{60} hours (10 minutes equals frac{1}{6} hour). Thus, the distance d it can cover off-road is (d = 18 left(frac{1}{6} - frac{x}{60}right) = 3 - frac{3x}{10}) miles. This distance forms a circle centered at any point (x,0) along the x-axis that the vehicle turns off-road. Thus, for each x, there's a circle with radius 3-frac{3x}{10} centered at (x,0). Sketching the geometric region: Initially, where x = 0, the radius of the circle is 3 miles. At x = 10 (where 10 minutes of driving exclusively on the road takes it to the full time), the radius of the off-road circle becomes 0 miles, marking the end of this region along the road. Similarly, analyze other quadrants due to symmetry. The bounding lines for when the vehicle starts off-road travel at radius 3 and ends at 0 form equations that need to be calculated. These tangential lines determine the area accessible.

The equation rho^2 + 2rhocostheta - 3 = 0 can be translated to Cartesian coordinates as (rhocostheta)^2 + (rhosintheta)^2 + 2rhocostheta - 3 = 0, leading us to x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 3 = 0. Completing the square for the x terms, we get (x + 1)^2 + y^2 = 4, which is the equation of a circle with center at (-1, 0) and a radius of 2. Next, we convert the equation of the line in polar coordinates, rhocostheta + rhosintheta - 7 = 0, to Cartesian coordinates. Simplifying it gives us x + y - 7 = 0. To find the maximum distance from any point on the circle to the line, we must first find the distance from the circle's center to the line. Using the formula frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} for the distance from the point (x_0, y_0) to the line ax + by + c = 0, we have: text{Distance} = frac{|(-1) + (0) - 7|}{sqrt{2^2}} = frac{|-8|}{sqrt{2^2}} = frac{8}{2} = 4sqrt{2}. The maximum distance from a point on the circle to the line is the sum of the circle's radius and the distance from the center to the line: text{Max distance} = 4sqrt{2} + 2. Hence, the maximum distance from the moving point on the circle to the line is boxed{4sqrt{2} + 2}. This solution incorporates the methods of converting polar coordinate equations into Cartesian coordinate equations and applying the formula for the distance from a point to a line.

Now, we simplify each part using the properties of exponents: - left(frac{1}{4}right)^{-frac{1}{2}} simplifies to 2 because taking the square root is the inverse of squaring, and frac{1}{2} in the exponent means a square root. Therefore, frac{1}{sqrt{4}} = frac{1}{2}, and the negative exponent flips it to 2. - left({3}^{-3}right)^{-frac{1}{3}} simplifies to 3 because the exponents -3 and -frac{1}{3} cancel each other out (multiplying them gives 1), resulting in 3^1 = 3. - ({5}^{4})^{frac{1}{4}} simplifies to 5 because raising to the 4th power and then taking the 4th root cancel each other out, leaving 5^1 = 5. 3.

We have two critical points from the factors: x = frac{1}{2} and x = 1.

Depending on the value of m, we have different cases for frac{1}{m}: - If frac{1}{m} > 1, which translates to 0 < m < 1, x must be between 1 and frac{1}{m} to make the product negative. - If frac{1}{m} = 1, which is when m = 1, there are no x values that satisfy the inequality since the factors never change signs at the same time. - If frac{1}{m} < 1, which means m > 1, x must be between frac{1}{m} and 1 to make the product negative.

Since they meet in the middle, the total distance between their homes is divided into two parts: 15 km (Maxwell's part) and 25 km (Brad's part), because the total distance is 40 km. Now we can find Brad's speed using the distance he covered and the time: [ text{Distance (Brad)} = text{Speed (Brad)} times text{Time} ] [ 25 text{ km} = v times 5 text{ hours} ] Now we can solve for ( v ): [ v = frac{25 text{ km}}{5 text{ hours}} ] [ v = 5 text{ km/h} ] So, Brad's running speed is boxed{5} km/h."},{"prompt":"4 people, A, B, C, and D, decided to put a down payment on a car for 3500 dollars.

We know that: [ A_c = 0.35X ] [ B_c = 0.25Y ] [ C_c = 0.20Z ] The total contribution from A, B, and C should be less than or equal to 3500, so: [ A_c + B_c + C_c leq 3500 ] Substituting the contributions in terms of X, Y, and Z, we get: [ 0.35X + 0.25Y + 0.20Z leq 3500 ] Now, we need to find the values of X, Y, and Z that satisfy this inequality. Since there are infinite solutions to this inequality, we need to set some constraints to find a specific solution. One way to do this is to assume specific values for two of the variables and solve for the third. For example, let's assume that Person A earns 2000 per month (X = 2000) and Person B earns 3000 per month (Y = 3000). We can then solve for Z: [ 0.35(2000) + 0.25(3000) + 0.20Z leq 3500 ] [ 700 + 750 + 0.20Z leq 3500 ] [ 1450 + 0.20Z leq 3500 ] [ 0.20Z leq 3500 - 1450 ] [ 0.20Z leq 2050 ] [ Z leq 2050 / 0.20 ] [ Z leq 10250 ] So, if Person A earns 2000 per month and Person B earns 3000 per month, Person C can earn up to 10250 per month for their combined contributions to be less than or equal to 3500. Person D will contribute the remaining amount, which would be: [ 3500 - (0.35(2000) + 0.25(3000) + 0.20(10250)) ] [ 3500 - (700 + 750 + 2050) ] [ 3500 - 3500 ] [ 0 ] In this specific case, if Person C contributes the maximum amount they can, Person D would not need to contribute anything. However, if we want Person D to contribute something, we would need to choose a smaller value for Z. Remember, this is just one set of possible values for X, Y, and Z.

Step 1: Understanding the divisor structure 1. **Prime factorization**: Since ( a ) has 107 divisors, we can represent ( a ) in the form of its prime factorization. For a number ( a ) expressed as ( a = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} dots p_k^{e_k} ), the total number of divisors ( d(a) ) can be given by the formula: [ d(a) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) dots (e_k + 1) ] Given ( d(a) = 107 ), which is a prime number, ( 107 ) must be the divisor count of a number which implies that ( 107 ) has to be in the form: [ a = p^{106} ] where ( p ) is a prime number and ( 106 + 1 = 107 ). Step 2: Sum of divisors 1. **Formula for sum of divisors**: The sum of the divisors of ( a ) where ( a = p^{106} ) can be written as: [ sigma(a) = 1 + p + p^2 + dots + p^{106} ] 2. **Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series**: The sum of a geometric series ( 1 + x + x^2 + dots + x^n ) is given by: [ frac{x^{n+1} - 1}{x - 1} ] Thus, substituting ( x = p ) and ( n = 106 ): [ sigma(a) = frac{p^{107} - 1}{p - 1} ] Step 3: Product of divisors 1. **Formula for the product of divisors**: The product of the divisors of a number ( a ) with ( d(a) ) divisors is given by: [ a^{d(a) / 2} ] Since ( d(a) = 107 ), we have: [ Pi(a) = a^{107/2} ] 2. **Substitute ( a ) with ( p^{106} )**: [ Pi(a) = (p^{106})^{107/2} = p^{106 times 107 / 2} = p^{11321} ] Conclusion: 1.

We know the total height of all 6 siblings is 435 inches, so we can subtract the total height of the four siblings we know from this to find the combined height of Eliza and her remaining sibling: 435 (total height) - 267 (height of four siblings) = 168 inches. Now, we are told that one of Eliza's siblings is H + 4 inches taller than her. Let's call this sibling's height S. So we have: S = H + 4. The combined height of Eliza and this sibling is 168 inches, so we can write the equation: H (Eliza's height) + S (sibling's height) = 168. Substituting S with H + 4, we get: H + (H + 4) = 168.

We'll extend segment (LM) beyond point (M) to a point (T) such that (MT = 2). The aim here is to show that triangles (BLK) and (TMK) are congruent by the side-angle-side (SAS) theorem. First, we note that angle (angle KLM = angle KML = angle KBL) because both points are part of the isosceles triangle (KLM), thus they are adjacent to equal angles of triangle (KLM). 3.

First Solution: We will demonstrate that a geometric sequence can satisfy the required condition. Let's seek a sequence of the form a_n = a_1 cdot q^{n-1} where a_1 > 0 and q > 0. According to the given recurrence relation, for n geqq 1, we have: [ a_{n+2} = a_n - a_{n+1} ] Substituting the terms of the geometric sequence, we get: [ a_1 cdot q^{n+1} = a_1 cdot q^{n-1} - a_1 cdot q^n ] By dividing both sides by a_1 cdot q^{n-1}, provided a_1 neq 0 and q^{n-1} neq 0: [ q^2 = 1 - q ] To solve for q, we rearrange this equation: [ q^2 + q - 1 = 0 ] Using the quadratic formula q = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} with a=1, b=1, and c=-1, we get: [ q = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-1)}}{2 cdot 1} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{5}}{2} ] Since q > 0, we take the positive root: [ q = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} ] If a_1 > 0 is arbitrary, then the sequence defined by [ a_n = a_1 left( frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} right)^{n-1} ] has all positive terms. Since our steps are reversible, it follows that the sequence satisfies the given recurrence relation. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{a_n = a_1 left( frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} right)^{n-1}} ] Second Solution: We now prove that the problem does not have any other solutions, i.e., if a sequence of positive terms a_n satisfies the given condition, then the sequence must be geometric. Let's examine the sequence’s adjacent ratios, b_n = frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}. Since b_n > 0, from the recurrence relation we have: [ a_{n+2} = a_n - a_{n+1} ] [ b_{n+1} = frac{a_{n+2}}{a_{n+1}} = frac{a_n - a_{n+1}}{a_{n+1}} = frac{1}{b_n} - 1 ] Given b_{n+1} > 0: [ frac{1}{b_n} - 1 > 0 ] [ frac{1}{b_n} > 1 ] [ b_n < 1 ] We also have: [ 0 < b_n < 1 ] For b_{n+1} = frac{1}{b_n} - 1, we ensure: [ 0 < frac{1}{b_n} - 1 < 1 ] [ frac{1}{2} < b_n < 1 ] Iteratively refining the bounds: [ frac{1}{2} < b_n < frac{2}{3} ] To generalize this process, let: [ 0 leq u_k < b_n < v_k leq 1 ] We obtain: [ u_{k+1} = frac{1 + u_k}{2 + u_k} < b_n < frac{1 + v_k}{2 + v_k} = v_{k+1} ] Given f(x) = frac{1+x}{2+x}, and the fixed point of f(x) as the solution of f(x)=x, which is x_0 = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2}, the bounds u_k and v_k converge to x_0.

The 2nd layer around the center contains 6 coins. 5. The 3rd layer contains 12 coins (6 more than the previous layer). 6. The 4th layer contains 18 coins (6 more than the previous layer). 7.

It is given that the product of the numbers in each row is negative. We need to prove that there exists at least one column where the product of the numbers in that column is also negative. 2. **Understanding the negative product condition:** For the product of the numbers in a row to be negative, there must be an odd number of negative numbers in that row (since the product of an odd number of negative numbers is negative). Furthermore, there are no zeros in the table. 3. **Counting Negatives in the Table:** Let’s denote a_{ij} as the element in the i-th row and j-th column of the table. Because the product of the numbers in each row is negative, each row must contain an odd number of negative elements. 4. **Summing Negative Numbers Over All Rows:** Since there are 1999 rows and each row contains an odd number of negative numbers, the total count of negative numbers in the entire table must be odd. This is derived from the fact that the sum of 1999 odd numbers is itself odd: [ text{Total count of negatives} = sum_{i=1}^{1999} text{odd number of negatives in row } i ] Given that the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is always odd, the total number of negative elements ( N_{text{total negative}} ) must be odd. 5. **Assessing Column-wise Distribution:** Since the total number of negative numbers in the table is odd and each column has 1999 elements, we infer that there must be at least one column where the count of negative numbers is odd (to match the overall odd count without any remainder). 6. **Proof by Existence of Odd Negative Count in Columns:** Now, among the 2001 columns, there must be at least one column with an odd number of negative numbers. If every column had an even number of negative numbers, their sum would be even.

We will proceed through the following parts as planned in the reference solution: 1. **Lemma:** - **Statement:** Let (a, b,) and (c) be some natural numbers, and suppose the quadratic trinomial ( ax^2 + bx + c ) has integer roots. Then, (b) and (c) must be divisible by (a). - **Proof:** By Vieta’s formulas for the roots ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) of the quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ): [ frac{b}{a} = -(x_1 + x_2) quad text{and} quad frac{c}{a} = x_1 x_2. ] Since ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) are integers, both ( frac{b}{a} ) and ( frac{c}{a} ) must be integers.

Let's assume that it is impossible to rotate the table such that at least two committee members find themselves in front of their own name cards. Here's the detailed step-by-step reasoning: 1. **Numbering the Members and Cards**: - Number the members of the committee from 1 to 11. - Assume that initially no member is seated in front of their own name card. 2. **Define Possible Rotations**: - There are 10 possible non-trivial rotations of the table (from 1 to 10 positions). A rotation by 0 positions would leave everyone in the same place, which is not considered here since it does not help in solving the problem. 3. **Counting the Pairs**: - Let (r, k) be a pair where ( r ) is one of the 10 possible rotations, and ( k ) is an integer from 1 to 11 indicating a specific member. - Define the condition that in a given rotation ( r ), the member at position ( k ) ends up in front of their own name card. That is, in each rotation ( r ), the member ( k ) after rotation ( r ) sits at position ((k + r) mod 11). 4. **Assumption Derived Condition**: - Under the assumption that no rotation results in at least two members sitting in front of their own name cards, each rotation can result in at most one member being in front of their own name card. 5. **Double Counting Argument**: - Hence, there are at most 10 such pairs (r, k) where a member ( k ) is in front of their name card after rotation ( r ) (since there are 10 rotations, each with at most one ‘correct’ member). 6. **Contradiction via Counting**: - However, focus on k. For any fixed member ( k ), there is exactly one rotation ( r ) that will place them in front of their name card (given each member’s name card is somewhere around the table and the rotational symmetry). - Thus, if we fix ( k ), we should count exactly 11 pairs (r, k). This means we find all 11 members correctly placed by counting over all possible ( k ). Therefore, counting in this second manner (each member correct in one of the rotations) contradicts counting based on the assumption that each rotation can only result in one correct member. 7. **Conclusion**: - This contradiction implies that the initial assumption is false. - Therefore, it must be possible to rotate the table such that at least two members end up in front of their own name cards.

We examine two cases: - If \`B_1 B_2\` is red, then the triangle \`A_2 B_1 B_2\` consists entirely of red edges, which contradicts the given condition that no triangle formed by connections to \`A\` and \`B\` can have all edges of the same color. - If \`B_1 B_2\` is blue, then the triangles \`A_1 B_1 B_2\` would, by extension, have \`A_1 B_1\` and \`A_1 B_2\` both blue, leading to a blue triangle \`A_1 B_1 B_2\`, which again produces a contradiction. 4. **Proof Completion:** Since both cases result in a contradiction, the assumption that not all edges of the pentagon \`A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5\` are the same color must be false. Therefore, all edges of the pentagonal bases must be the same color. Consequently, by applying similar logic to the lower pentagon \`B_1 B_2 B_3 B_4 B_5\`, we can likewise conclude that all its edges must also be the same color.

This is the permutation of 5 items taken 4 at a time, so A^4_5 = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2. 3. To place four out of the five balls into one box, we first select four balls from the five, which is C^4_5. There’s only one way to put these four balls into one box as they are considered indistinguishable with respect to the box, yielding C^4_5 times C^1_4 ways.

In this case, the angle between the tangents at the point of intersection is (0^circ). - Let the radii of the two circles be (R) and (r), and let the distance between their centers be (c). - For internal tangency, the distance between the centers equals the difference of their radii: [ c = R - r ] - Thus, the intersection angle under internal tangency is (0^circ).

Let Delta = a^2 - 4. (i) When Delta = a^2 - 4 le 0, i.e., -2 le a le 2, it follows that x^2 + ax + 1 ge 0 is always true for x > 0. Hence, f'(x) = frac{x^2 + ax + 1}{x} ge 0 is always true for x > 0. Under these conditions, f(x) does not have any extreme points. (ii) When Delta = a^2 - 4 > 0, i.e., a < -2 or a > 2: - For a < -2, let the equation x^2 + ax + 1 = 0 have two distinct real roots, x_1 and x_2, with x_1 < x_2. Then x_1 + x_2 = -a > 0 and x_1 x_2 = 1 > 0. Therefore, x_2 > x_1 > 0. It follows that f'(x) > 0 for x < x_1 or x > x_2; and f'(x) < 0 for x_{1} < x < x_{2}. Thus, x_1 and x_2 are two extreme points for f(x). - For a > 2, let the equation x^2 + ax + 1 = 0 have two distinct real roots, x_1 and x_2. Then x_1 + x_2 = -a < 0 and x_1 x_2 = 1 > 0. Therefore, both x_1 and x_2 are less than zero. This means that f(x) > 0 for x > 0, and thus, f(x) does not have any extreme points. To sum up, when a < -2, f(x) has two extreme points. When a ge -2, f(x) has no extreme points. Method 2: From the given function, we find f'(x) = 1 + x + frac{1}{x} + a. Since x > 0, it follows that f'(x) in [a + 2, +infty). - When a + 2 ge 0, i.e., a in [-2, +infty), then f'(x) ge 0 for all x > 0 is always true, and f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty) with no extreme points. - When a + 2 < 0, i.e., a in (-infty, -2), the equation x^2 + ax + 1 = 0 has two distinct positive solutions, x_1 and x_2, and f'(x) = frac{(x - x_1)(x - x_2)}{x} (for x > 0). Without loss of generality, assume 0 < x_1 < x_2. Then for x in (0, x_1), f'(x) > 0, and f(x) is increasing. For x in (x_1, x_2), f'(x) < 0, and f(x) is decreasing. For x in (x_2, +infty), f'(x) > 0, and f(x) is increasing again. Therefore, x_1 and x_2 are respectively the local maximum and minimum points of f(x), so f(x) has two extreme points. In conclusion, when a in [-2, +infty), f(x) has no extreme points; when a in (-infty, -2), f(x) has two extreme points. (2) The inequality f(x) le g(x) is equivalent to e^x - ln x + x^2 ge ax.

Then the derivative of phi(x) is phi'(x) = frac{e^x(x - 1) + ln x + (x + 1)(x - 1)}{x^2}. Since x > 0, for x in (0, 1), phi'(x) < 0 and phi(x) is decreasing. For x in (1, +infty), phi'(x) > 0 and phi(x) is increasing. Hence, phi(x) ge phi(1) = e + 1.

We'll call a segment the set of cards placed between two identical cards, and the length of such a segment is the number of other cards placed between them. 1. **Sum of Distances Calculation:** We calculate the sum of the lengths of all the segments in two different ways. **First Method:** - Directly adding the required distances between identical cards: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + 9 = sum_{k=0}^{9} k = frac{9 cdot (9+1)}{2} = 45 text{ (This is an odd number)} ] **Second Method:** - By pairs of distances where each pair ( (a, b) ) contributes a distance between identical cards with digits ( a ) and ( b ): Suppose we find a card ( a ) and in that segment, there's exactly one other card ( b ), then considering both cards ( a ) and ( b ), we'll again see a segment of length contributed by these two appearances. Notice this forms a pairing process that contributes an even number: either 0 (if adjacent) or an even number (as each interaction is considered twice). - Given each pair's segment contributes either 0 or an even number to this count: [ text{Each segment contributes 0 or an even number, hence the total length of all segments must be even.} ] 2. **Contradiction:** - On one side, we have the sum of the lengths as (45) (which we have computed and is odd). - From the second computation, the total sum must be even. Since an odd number cannot equal an even number, this is a contradiction. # Conclusion: The assumption that we can place the cards as described leads to a contradiction, thus it is impossible to arrange the cards in the required manner.

From the given information, the foci of the ellipse frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a > b > 0) are on the x-axis, and e=frac{c}{a}=frac{1}{2}, so a=2c. Let the radius of the incircle of triangle F_{1}PF_{2} be r. The area of triangle F_{1}PF_{2} is given by S=frac{1}{2}r(|PF_{1}|+|PF_{2}|+|F_{1}F_{2}|)=frac{1}{2}r(2a+2c). When S is at its maximum, r is also at its maximum. This occurs when point P is at either the upper or lower vertex of the ellipse, and the incircle achieves its maximum area. Since πr^{2}=frac{π}{3}, we find that r=frac{sqrt{3}}{3}.

To convert km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s Relative speed in m/s = 88 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed in m/s = 88 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed in m/s = 88 * (10 / 36) Relative speed in m/s = 880 / 36 Relative speed in m/s = 24.44 m/s (approximately) Now that we have the relative speed in m/s, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the man using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance the train needs to cover to pass the man is equal to the length of the train, which is 110 m.

Also, ( text{ord}_p(a) ) must divide ( p-1 ) because ( p ) is a prime. Therefore, ( text{ord}_p(a) ) divides ( gcd(b, p-1) = d ). 3. **Congruence relation:** Since ( text{ord}_p(a) ) divides ( d ), we have ( a^d equiv 1 pmod{p} ). 4. **Applying Lifting The Exponent (LTE) lemma:** Given that ( p ) is an odd prime and ( gcd(a, p) = 1 ), we can apply the LTE lemma.

An edge exists between two distinct vertices (m) and (n) if and only if (p) divides (left(m^{2} - n + 1right)left(n^{2} - m + 1right)). 2. **Simplifying the Edge Condition:** We define a function (f: mathbb{Z} / pmathbb{Z} to mathbb{Z} / pmathbb{Z}) which maps (x) to (x^2 + 1). Therefore, (m) and (n) are connected if and only if (m = f(n)) or (n = f(m)). We can then draw each edge in the form ((m, f(m))).

We then rotate the arena so that point ( A_3 ) aligns with the line segment ( A_1 A_2 ). - Continue this process for each subsequent segment ( A_{i-1} A_i ). 3. **Geometric Transformations**: - Under these transformations, the center of the circle ( O ) moves successively to points ( O_1 = O ), ( O_2 ), ( ldots ), ( O_{n-1} ). - Similarly, points ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) transform to points ( A'_1, A'_2, ldots, A'_n ) lying on a straight line. 4. **Angle and Distance Relations**: - Let ( alpha_{i-1} ) be the angle of turn (or rotation) the lion makes at point ( A_i ). - The geometry gives us ( angle O_{i-1} A_i' O_i = alpha_{i-1} ) and the distances ( A_i' O_{i-1} = A_i' O_i leq 10 ) meters (since the radius of the circle is 10 meters). - Consequently, the distance ( O_i O_{i-1} leq 10 alpha_{i-1} ) (since distance along the arc contributed by turning by angle ( alpha_{i-1} ) resides within the distance of its chordal projection limited by radius 10). 5. **Summation Over Path**: - Summing along the path, we have: [ 30,000 = A_1' A_n' leq A_1' O_1 + O_1 O_2 + ldots + O_{n-2} O_{n-1} + O_{n-1} A_n'. ] 6. **Inequality and Conclusion**: - Each ( O_i O_{i-1} leq 10 alpha_{i-1} ), leading to: [ 30,000 leq 10 + 10 (alpha_1 + alpha_2 + ldots + alpha_{n-2}) + 10. ] - Simplifying, it results in: [ 30,000 leq 20 + 10 (alpha_1 + alpha_2 + ldots + alpha_{n-2}), ] - Rearranging, [ 29,980 leq 10 (alpha_1 + alpha_2 + ldots + alpha_{n-2}). ] - Therefore, [ alpha_1 + alpha_2 + ldots + alpha_{n-2} geq 2,998. ] # Conclusion: The sum of all turning angles must be at least 2,998 radians: [ boxed{2998} ]"},{"prompt":"Let's call a natural number interesting if the sum of its digits is a prime number.

Therefore, among these five numbers, the maximum count of \\"interesting\\" numbers is 4. 7. **Validation and final decision**: - From the explanation and example provided, the maximum number of \\"interesting\\" numbers that can be found among any group of five consecutive natural numbers is 4 because: - All five numbers can't be simultaneously \\"interesting\\" due to the nature of consecutive digits sums.

Applying the AM-GM inequality to (frac{a}{b}) and (frac{b}{a}), we get: [ frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{a} geq 2 sqrt{frac{a}{b} cdot frac{b}{a}} = 2 ] 4. Hence, [ frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{a} + 2 geq 2 + 2 = 4 ] 5. Next, we consider the expression (frac{b}{a} + frac{c}{a} + 2). Again, we apply the AM-GM inequality: [ frac{b}{a} + frac{c}{a} geq 2 sqrt{frac{b}{a} cdot frac{c}{a}} ] 6. Since (a + b + c = 1), then (b + c = 1 - a). Rewriting the above expression, [ frac{b + c}{a} = frac{1-a}{a} ] 7. Therefore, [ frac{b}{a} + frac{c}{a} geq 2 sqrt{frac{b}{a} cdot frac{c}{a}} = 2 sqrt{frac{bc}{a^2}} ] 8. Adding 2, we get: [ frac{b}{a} + frac{c}{a} + 2 geq 2 sqrt{2 cdot sqrt{frac{(1-a)}{a}}} ] 9. Similar arguments apply to the other pairs of terms.

What is the radius of the base of the first cylinder?","completion":"Let's denote the radius of the base of the first cylinder as r1 and the radius of the second cylinder as r2. We know that r2 is 20 cm. The number of rounds a rope can make around a cylinder is inversely proportional to the circumference of the cylinder. The circumference of a cylinder is given by the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the base of the cylinder. For the first cylinder, the rope makes 70 rounds, so the total length of the rope is 70 times the circumference of the first cylinder: L = 70 * (2πr1) For the second cylinder, the rope makes 49 rounds, so the total length of the rope is 49 times the circumference of the second cylinder: L = 49 * (2πr2) Since the total length of the rope is the same in both cases, we can set the two equations equal to each other: 70 * (2πr1) = 49 * (2πr2) Now we can solve for r1: r1 = (49 * (2πr2)) / (70 * (2π)) We can cancel out the 2π from both sides: r1 = (49 * r2) / 70 Now we can plug in the value of r2, which is 20 cm: r1 = (49 * 20) / 70 Now we can simplify: r1 = (49 / 70) * 20 r1 = (7 * 7 / 7 * 10) * 20 r1 = (7 / 10) * 20 r1 = 14 cm So the radius of the base of the first cylinder is boxed{14} cm."},{"prompt":"have a huge bedsheet of 1 meter long.

Since it takes you 5 minutes to cut each piece and it will take you a total of 245 minutes to cut the entire bed-sheet, we can calculate the number of pieces by dividing the total time by the time it takes to cut each piece: Number of pieces = Total time / Time per piece Number of pieces = 245 minutes / 5 minutes per piece Number of pieces = 49 pieces Now that we know you will cut 49 pieces from the 1-meter long bed-sheet, we can calculate the length of each piece. Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, the total length of the bed-sheet in centimeters is 100 cm.

The period of the sine function is 2pi. If the function f(x) reaches a minimum at x=frac{pi}{4}, it implies that the phase shift phi aligns the minimum of the resulting sine function with this point. Thus, we can conveniently choose f(x) to be in the form of f(x)=sinleft(x-frac{3pi}{4}right) for a minimum to occur at x=frac{pi}{4}, without loss of generality. Now, let's find the form of y = fleft(frac{3pi}{4}-xright): begin{align*} y &= sinleft(left(frac{3pi}{4}-xright) - frac{3pi}{4}right) &= sin(-x) &= -sin(x). end{align*} The function - sin(x) is an odd function and is symmetric about the origin. However, y = fleft(frac{3pi}{4}-xright) is the reflection of sin(x) over the vertical line x = frac{3pi}{4}, so the symmetry point for the graph of y is shifted right by frac{3pi}{2} - frac{3pi}{4} = frac{3pi}{4} compared to the symmetry point of the sine function.

Additionally, color the points that divide the arcs (which end at red points and are either 1 or 2 units long) black. 2. **Counting Black Points**: Since there are k red-red arcs of length 1 unit (no black points between them), k red-black arcs of length 2 units (1 black point between), and k red-black arcs of length 3 units (2 black points between), the total number of black points is: [ k cdot 0 + k cdot 1 + k cdot 2 = k + 2k = 3k ] 3. **Defining the Polygon**: The combination of red and black points forms a regular polygon with 6k vertices because there are 3k red points and 3k black points. 4. **Assumption and its Implication**: Assume that no diameter of the circle has both ends in red. This means every diameter must have one red and one black endpoint. Consequently, on the opposite side of each red vertex in the hexagon, there must be a black vertex, and vice versa. 5. **Segmentation of Polygon Sides**: Divide the sides of the 6k-gon into two categories: - E sides: Sides with endpoints of the same color. - K sides: Sides with endpoints of different colors. Each pair of opposite sides (=diameters) of the polygon should fall into the same category, i.e., E sides are opposite E sides, and K sides are opposite K sides. 6. **Counting E and K Sides in Initial Division**: All arcs of length 1 unit are E sides (so there are k such E sides). Additionally, in each arc of 3 units, the middle section is also an E side, totaling k more E sides. Consequently, the total number of E sides is: [ E = k + k = 2k ] The remaining sides are K sides: [ K = 6k - 2k = 4k ] 7. **Parity Argument**: Let A be a red point, and consider the diameter through A, ending at point B. By our initial assumption, B must be black. Count the K sides from A to B, and again from B to A (completing the circle). Since K sides are opposite each other, and their total count is consistent when halved: [ text{Number of } K text{ sides from } A text{ to } B = frac{4k}{2} = 2k ] 8. **Contradiction**: Traveling the 2k K sides from A to B implies crossing the color boundary 2k (even) times.

The areas of the squares on CA , CB , and AB are a^2 , b^2 , and c^2 respectively. 3. **Height from Right Angle:** Drop a perpendicular height CD from point C to hypotenuse AB . Extend this height to intersect the square on hypotenuse AB at a point such that the intersection splits the square into two rectangles. 4. **Rectangle Area Calculation:** Note that CD divides the square on AB along its diagonal. 5. **Exploring the Area Relationship:** The height from the right angle ( CD ) meets the hypotenuse AB and is the geometric mean of the segments of the hypotenuse it creates, due to similar triangles.

Therefore, whatever function we choose, it must start from just above 2 and extend to infinity as x increases or decreases. 2. **Condition ②: When xin (-infty, +infty), f'(x) > 0.** This condition tells us that the derivative of f(x), which represents the slope of the function, is always positive. This means f(x) is a monotonically increasing function across its entire domain. Given these conditions, we need a function that starts just above 2 and increases forever. An exponential function naturally fits this description because it is always increasing (for a positive base) and can be shifted vertically to adjust its starting point. Considering an exponential function y = 2^x, we note that it is indeed monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}, and its range is (0, +infty). However, to meet our specific range requirement of (2, +infty), we need to shift this function upwards by 2 units. This adjustment ensures that the minimum value of the function is just above 2. Therefore, we define f(x) = 2^x + 2. This function starts at 3 when x=0 and increases without bound as x increases, perfectly fitting our range requirement. To confirm that f(x) is always increasing, we differentiate it: [f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(2^x + 2) = 2^x ln(2).] Since 2^x is always positive for all real x and ln(2) is a positive constant, f'(x) > 0 for all x in mathbb{R}.

We need to show that this number can be factored in at least two different ways, implying that its factorization is not unique, which means it cannot be the product of two primes. 2. **First Factorization**: We can factor ( 2^{4n+2}+1 ) in the following manner: [ 2^{4n+2} + 1 = { left(2^2right) }^{2n+1} + 1 = left(2^2 + 1right)left( (2^2)^{2n} - (2^2)^{2n-2} + ldots - (2^2) + 1 right) ] Let's break down this expression: [ = (4+1)left( 4^{2n} - 4^{2n-1} + 4^{2n-2} - ldots - 4 + 1 right) ] Hence, the first factorization is: [ = 5 left( 4^{2n} - 4^{2n-1} + 4^{2n-2} - ldots - 4 + 1 right) ] 3. **Second Factorization**: Additionally, ( 2^{4n+2}+1 ) can be rewritten and factored using quadratic forms: [ 2^{4n+2}+1 = (2^{2n+1})^2 + 1 ] This can be expressed as: [ = left((2^{2n+1} + 2^{n+1} + 1) left(2^{2n+1} - 2^{n+1} + 1 right)right) ] Thus, the second factorization is: [ = left(2^{2n+1} + 2^{n+1} + 1right)left(2^{2n+1} - 2^{n+1} + 1right) ] 4. **Conclusion**: Since the number ( 2^{4n+2}+1 ) can be factored in two different ways, it indicates that the number has more complex divisors and is not purely the product of two prime numbers for ( n geq 2 ).

Hence, ( Phi ) also fixes ( Gamma, Omega_A, Omega_C ) and the tangency points of the last two circles with ( Gamma ). Hence, ( C_1, A_1 ) are fixed under this inversion and we conclude that ( X equiv overline{C_1C_1} cap overline{A_1A_1} ) and ( A_1, C_1 in gamma_X ). Similarly, defining ( gamma_Y ), we get that ( Y equiv overline{B_1B_1} cap overline{D_1D_1} ) and ( B_1, D_1 in gamma_Y ). 7. **Final Concurrency**: Now we finish off by showing that ( P, I, K ) lie on the radical axis of ( {gamma_X, gamma_Y} ). Note that ( P, I ) are centers of two circles, namely ( Gamma ) and ( gamma ) which are orthogonal to both ( gamma_X ) and ( gamma_Y ). So ( overline{PI} ) is the radical axis of ( {gamma_X, gamma_Y} ). Lastly, note that [ operatorname{Pow}_{K,gamma_X} = KA_1 cdot KC_1 = KB_1 cdot KD_1 = operatorname{Pow}_{K,gamma_Y} ] So ( K in overline{PI} ). We are done.

We draw perpendiculars from the vertices of the parallelogram to the line (e). We need to prove that the sum of the longest and shortest perpendicular distances is equal to the sum of the other two distances. 1. **Vertices and Perpendicular Distances**: - Let the perpendicular distances from the vertices (A, B, C, D) of the parallelogram to the line (e) be denoted as (A A_1), (B B_1), (C C_1), and (D D_1) respectively. - According to the diagram, distance (A A_1) is the shortest, and distance (C C_1) is the longest. 2. **Diagonal Midpoint and Trapezoids**: - Let (O) be the midpoint of the parallelogram. (O) divides diagonal (AC) into two equal parts. - Consider the trapezoid (A A_1 C C_1). The midpoint (O) lies at the middle of the line segment (A A_1) and (C C_1), thus the middle line through (O) perpendicular to (e) is denoted as (O O_1). 3. **Middle Line in Trapezoid**: - The length of the middle line in the trapezoid (O O_1) is half the sum of the bases (A A_1) and (C C_1): [ 2 O O_1 = A A_1 + C C_1 ] 4. **Another Trapezoid**: - Similarly, consider the trapezoid formed by distances (B B_1) and (D D_1).

We are given that after allowing a discount of 14% on the marked price, the gain is 34.375%. First, let's find the selling price (SP) after the discount is applied. The discount is 14% of the marked price, so the selling price will be 86% of the marked price (since 100% - 14% = 86%). SP = 86% of MP SP = 0.86 * MP We are also given that the gain is 34.375%. Gain is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price, and the gain percentage is the gain divided by the cost price, multiplied by 100. Gain = SP - CP Gain Percent = (Gain / CP) * 100 We know the gain percent is 34.375%, so we can write: 34.375% = ((SP - CP) / CP) * 100 Now, let's substitute SP with 0.86 * MP in the above equation: 34.375% = ((0.86 * MP - CP) / CP) * 100 To find CP as a percentage of MP, we need to express CP in terms of MP. Let's denote CP as x% of MP, so CP = x/100 * MP. Now, we can rewrite the equation as: 34.375% = ((0.86 * MP - x/100 * MP) / (x/100 * MP)) * 100 Simplify the equation: 34.375 = (0.86 * MP - x/100 * MP) / (x/100 * MP) * 100 34.375 = (0.86 - x/100) / (x/100) * 100 34.375 = (86 - x) / x * 100 Now, we have a simple equation to solve for x: 34.375x = 8600 - 100x Combine like terms: 34.375x + 100x = 8600 134.375x = 8600 Now, divide both sides by 134.375 to solve for x: x = 8600 / 134.375 x ≈ 63.999 (approximately 64) Therefore, the cost price is approximately boxed{64%} of the marked price."},{"prompt":"yes does some loads of laundry a week using a detergent pod for each load.

We know that ( x ) has exactly three different prime divisors, one of which is 31.

Next, considering triangle EBC, applying the Pythagorean theorem: - EC = sqrt{EB^2 + BC^2} = sqrt{30^2 + 60^2} = sqrt{900 + 3600} = sqrt{4500} = 30sqrt{5}. Since E lies directly above CD, H is directly below E on CD. Thus, EH is the vertical distance from E to CD: - EH = ED - CD = 40 - 60 = -20. However, getting a negative distance signifies a mistake in assuming E was placed relative to D (misinterpretation of the location of E). Given that E should be within the bounds of a rectangle: - ED should be recalculated considering E is inside the rectangle, hence ED should be the horizontal distance from E to side CD. If E is directly above H, EH is simply the vertical distance from E to CD. Redoing the calculation of EH correctly: - EH is the vertical distance from E to line CD, which is the y-coordinate of E if C is at origin (0, 0). Knowing EB and BC, and using the Pythagorean Theorem in EBC, we solve for EC and EH directly. EH = EC - BC = 30sqrt{5} - 60. Since 30sqrt{5} approx 67.08: - EH = 67.08 - 60 = 7.08.

Now we can set up the equation: (23.88663967611336/100) * 13x = (108 * 17) - (108 * 13) Let's solve for x: 0.2388663967611336 * 13x = 1836 - 1404 3.10526315789474x = 432 x = 432 / 3.10526315789474 x ≈ 139.1304 Since the number of bowls must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number.

It turns out that among the numbers given, all whole numbers from 0 to 10 inclusive appeared. Prove that there is at least one pair of students in the class with the same first name and last name.","completion":"1. We start by analyzing the problem statement, which states that there are 33 students in a class, each naming the number of classmates with the same first name and the number of classmates with the same last name (including relatives). The problem asks us to prove that there are at least two students with identical first names and last names. 2. Since each student named every number from 0 to 10 for the count of people with the same first name or same last name, we can deduce the possible groupings. Essentially, each student belongs to a unique group based on their first name and a unique group based on their last name. 3. Let us denote the groups as follows: - Group (A_i), where (i) indicates the count of students with identical last names (including the student itself). - Group (B_i), where (i) indicates the count of students with identical first names (including the student itself). According to the problem, the numbers given by the students are from 0 to 10, inclusive. 4. Given that there are 33 students in total, and each student belongs to two distinct groups (one for first name and one for last name), the groups must cover all students exactly twice (since each count is obtained considering both first and last names separately). 5. Now, since there are 11 different counts (0 through 10) for both first name and last name, we need to understand how these are distributed among the students: - Group sizes can range from 1 student (unique name/last name) up to 11 students (maximum count considered). 6. Since the counts 0 through 10 are included for both names and last names, there is a total of 11 distinct groups for names and 11 distinct groups for last names: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 11 = frac{11 cdot 12}{2} = 66 ] Each count represents a group size, and thus counting both groups together should yield (2 cdot 33 = 66). 7. At this point, we have established that there cannot be more than 11 groups each for first names and last names, based on the numbers 0 through 10. We consider the largest group, which must be of size 11. 8. If we take a specific group, say of 11 students having the same last name, remaining groups based on first names must fit into the remaining 22 positions (since 33 - 11 = 22). But, there cannot be more than 10 groups remaining among first names, as they are all covered by the provided counts. 9. By the pigeonhole principle, since there are 11 first name groups and 11 last name groups and only 33 positions, at least two students must share both an identical first name and last name. Therefore, within any groups of size 11, there exists overlap with another group of size less than or equal to 10. 10. Consequently, within the group of 11 for either first or last names, there must be at least one pair of students sharing both the same first name and the same last name. # Conclusion: Hence, we have proved that there are at least two students in the class who have the same first name and the same last name. Thus, (boxed{text{There exist at least two students with the same first name and last name}}.)"},{"prompt":"Let ( m ) and ( n ) be positive integers.

Let's break down the solution step by step. 1. **Understanding the given information**: We have two pieces of information: - S_{3}=3, which means a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}=3. - S_{8}-S_{5}=-96, which translates to a_{6}+a_{7}+a_{8}=-96. 2. **Relating S_{8}-S_{5} to the common ratio q**: - Since a_{6}+a_{7}+a_{8}=-96, and these terms are part of a geometric sequence, we can express them in terms of a_{1} and q: a_{6}+a_{7}+a_{8}=q^{5}(a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}). - Substituting the given values, we get q^{5}(a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3})=-96 and since a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}=3, it simplifies to q^{5}(3)=-96. - Therefore, q^{5}=-32. 3. **Solving for q**: - From q^{5}=-32, we find q=-2 by taking the fifth root of both sides. 4. **Finding a_{1}**: - Given a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}=3 and knowing a_{n}=a_{1}q^{n-1}, we substitute q=-2 into the equation: a_{1}-2a_{1}+4a_{1}=3. - Simplifying, we get 3a_{1}=3, which gives a_{1}=1. 5. **Calculating S_{6}**: - The formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is S_{n}=frac{{a}_{1}(1-{q}^{n})}{1-q}. - Substituting a_{1}=1, q=-2, and n=6 into the formula, we get S_{6}=frac{1(1-(-2)^{6})}{1-(-2)}=frac{1-64}{3}=-21.

Hence, we have: A = z_1 + w_1 e^{it} B = z_2 + w_2 e^{it} 2. **Complex Representation of Point C**: Given the condition (AB = BC = CA), we need to determine the position of point ( C ). We can express the position of ( C ) as: C = (z_1 + w_1 e^{it}) + left( (z_2 + w_2 e^{it}) - (z_1 + w_1 e^{it}) right) e^{ipi/3} Simplifying this, we get: C = z_1 + w_1 e^{it} + (z_2 - z_1 + (w_2 - w_1)e^{it}) e^{ipi/3} Factorizing terms involving ( e^{it} ): C = z_1 (1 - e^{ipi/3}) + z_2 e^{ipi/3} + e^{i(pi/3 + t)}(w_2 - w_1 + w_1 e^{-ipi/3}) This shows that (C) maintains a form constrained by the combined motion of (A) and (B). 3. **Circle Motion Interpretation**: There exist two potential circles for (C), depending on which side of (AB) it is positioned.

This intersecting point assures the conditions of Ptolemy’s equality for (CP). 6. **Uniqueness of Maximum Condition**: By verification, the locus such that (BP = 1.5AP) leads to a unique circular intersection proving the arc to be singular and unique satisfying this condition.

The player who cannot make a move according to the rules loses. We need to analyze who has a winning strategy under different initial conditions. We'll consider each specific case separately and then extend the solution to the general case. Case a) Each player has 2 peas: 1. If the first player gives 1 pea to the second player, then the second player has 3 peas and the first player has 1 pea. 2. The second player must give the first player either 2 or 3 peas. - If the second player gives 2 peas, the first player gets 3 peas, thus can only give the second player 3 peas, eventually losing. - If the second player gives 1 pea, the first player cannot give 1 again since it has been given already. Thus, the second player wins regardless of what the first player initially does. Case b) Each player has 3 peas: 1. If the first player gives 1 pea to the second player, then the second player has 4 peas, and the first player has 2. 2. The second player must give back a number that hasn't been given yet. - If the second player gives 1 pea, the first player then has 3 peas and can only give 2 or 3 peas which causes him to eventually lose. - If the second player gives 2 peas, this strategy persists leaving the first player with moves that lead to loss. Therefore, the second player again wins. Case c) Each player has 10 peas: The method remains consistent for larger numbers. The first player will always end up losing if the second player follows the strategy of always selecting the minimal allowable move which leads to effective control over the game. General Case: Each player has N peas: The second player can always ensure a win by following a specific strategy. Here are steps elaborated: 1. Assume the second player starts by (conditionally) giving 0 peas (think of it as skipping their first imaginary move). 2. The second player follows the strategy of giving the smallest possible number of any peas at each turn. 3. This ensures that move by move, the first player is forced to eventually be in a position where they have to give more peas than received due to the increasing number of possibilities on pawn moves becoming constrained. Let us analyze it more formally: - Let x be the number given by player 1. Player 2 will give the closely numbers such y but never x as it leads halves possible numbers back in players one possession. This causes player's one doubles moves giving back more pees every other turn less. As such, with each turn, player 1 is progressively losing advantage in the game pawns and reducing strategically every last possible given turn peas. Thus, in the general case, the second player always has a winning strategy by maintaining this approach, ensuring the strategy keeps one side control at versions initially moved.

Prove that not all roots of x^3P(x)+1 are real.","completion":"1. Let ( P(x) ) be a polynomial with real coefficients. We need to prove that not all roots of ( x^3P(x) + 1 = 0 ) are real. 2. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that all roots of ( x^3P(x) + 1 = 0 ) are real. Let these roots be ( r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n ). 3. Consider the polynomial ( Q(x) = x^3P(x) + 1 ). Since ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial with real coefficients, its roots must satisfy the polynomial equation: [ x^3P(x) + 1 = 0 implies x^3P(x) = -1 ] 4. Let ( r ) be a root of ( Q(x) ). Then: [ r^3P(r) = -1 ] 5. Since ( r ) is real, ( r^3 ) is also real. Therefore, ( P(r) ) must be real. Hence, ( r^3P(r) ) is real, and since it equals (-1), it must be negative. 6. Now, consider the polynomial ( x^3P(x) ). The degree of ( x^3P(x) ) is ( 3 + deg(P(x)) ). Let ( deg(P(x)) = m ). Then the degree of ( x^3P(x) ) is ( 3 + m ). 7. The polynomial ( x^3P(x) + 1 ) has degree ( 3 + m ). By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, it has ( 3 + m ) roots (counting multiplicities). 8. If all roots of ( x^3P(x) + 1 = 0 ) are real, then there are ( 3 + m ) real roots. 9. Consider the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of ( x^3P(x) + 1 = 0 ). By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of a polynomial ( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0 ) is given by: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{r_i} = -frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} ] 10. For the polynomial ( x^3P(x) + 1 ), the coefficient of ( x^{3+m} ) is the leading coefficient of ( P(x) ), and the constant term is 1. Therefore: [ sum_{i=1}^{3+m} frac{1}{r_i} = -frac{0}{text{leading coefficient of } P(x)} = 0 ] 11. However, if all ( r_i ) are real, then ( sum_{i=1}^{3+m} frac{1}{r_i} = 0 ) implies that the sum of the reciprocals of the roots is zero. This is impossible because the roots ( r_i ) must satisfy ( r_i^3P(r_i) = -1 ), and thus their reciprocals cannot sum to zero. 12. Therefore, our assumption that all roots of ( x^3P(x) + 1 = 0 ) are real must be incorrect. Hence, not all roots of ( x^3P(x) + 1 = 0 ) are real.

Let's denote the number of nuts in a pile as 3^k, where ( k ) is a non-negative integer. 3. In order to understand how these piles can be combined, we need to represent 2021 in base 3 (ternary system): [ 2021_{10} = 2 cdot 3^{6} + 2 cdot 3^{5} + 2 cdot 3^{3} + 2 cdot 3^{2} + 3^1 + 2 cdot 3^0 ] 4. The decomposition means we have: [ 2021 = 2 cdot 729 + 2 cdot 243 + 2 cdot 27 + 2 cdot 9 + 3 + 2 cdot 1 ] 5. This results in initially having piles: 2 piles of 3^6, 2 piles of 3^5, 2 piles of 3^3, 2 piles of 3^2, 1 pile of 3^1, and 2 piles of 3^0. 6. Since each move reduces the total number of piles by 2 (from combining 3 piles into one), we calculate the total number of moves as follows: [ text{Number of moves} = frac{2021 - 1}{2} = 1010 ] This is because every move makes the number of piles decrease by 2 until only one pile is left. 7. Therefore, since there are an odd number of moves (1010), Petya, who goes first, will make the last move. Hence, Petya wins with correct play. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Petya}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given an ellipse frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1 (a>b>0) with foci F_1(c,0) and F_2(c,0) (c>0), a line passing through the point Eleft( frac {a^{2}}{c},0right) intersects the ellipse at points A and B, with F_1Aparallel F_2B and |F_1A|=2|F_2B|.

Therefore, the equation of the ellipse becomes 2x^{2}+3y^{2}=6c^{2}. Let the equation of line AB be y=kleft(x- frac {a^{2}}{c}right), that is, y=k(x-3c). Let the coordinates of points A and B be A(x_{1},y_{1}) and B(x_{2},y_{2}), respectively.

From the first piece of information, we can write the following equation based on the rental costs: 14C + 15K = 288 (Equation 1) From the second piece of information, we can express the relationship between the number of canoes and kayaks as: C = (3/2)K (Equation 2) Now we can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1 to solve for K: 14(3/2)K + 15K = 288 21K + 15K = 288 36K = 288 K = 288 / 36 K = 8 Now that we know there were 8 kayaks rented out, we can find out how many canoes were rented out using Equation 2: C = (3/2)K C = (3/2) * 8 C = 12 So, there were 12 canoes rented out.

For any rectangular hyperbola ( xy = c ), if ( c > 0 ), the hyperbola is oriented with its asymptotes coordinately aligned with the lines ( y = x ) and ( y = -x ). 1. **Identifying the center**: The center of the hyperbola is at ( (0, 0) ). 2. **Finding vertices**: The vertices are found along the lines which are bisectors of the angles between the asymptotes. Hence, for ( xy = 4 ), the vertices occur when ( x = y ) or ( x = -y ). Solving for ( x = y ), we substitute to get ( x^2 = 4 implies x = pm 2 ).

Since the cost increases by 5 for each subsequent refill, the costs for the four fill-ups will be: 1st fill-up: 45 2nd fill-up: 45 + 5 = 50 3rd fill-up: 50 + 5 = 55 4th fill-up: 55 + 5 = 60 Now, let's add up these costs to find the total fuel cost: Total fuel cost = 45 + 50 + 55 + 60 = 210 Next, let's calculate the total cost of food.

Given the expression (frac{a b^{2}}{a + b}) is an integer prime number and (a neq b), we want to find the pair ((a, b)). 2. Assume the greatest common divisor of (a) and (b) is (d). So, let (a = du) and (b = dv) where (u) and (v) are positive integers such that ((u, v) = 1). 3. Let (p) be the prime number. Thus, we have: [ p = frac{(du) (dv)^2}{du + dv} ] 4. Simplify the above expression: [ p = frac{d^3 u v^2}{d (u + v)} = frac{d^2 u v^2}{u + v} ] 5. Since ((u + v, u) = (u + v, v) = (u, v) = 1), so (u + v) is coprime with (u) and (v). Hence, (u v^2 mid p). 6. Since (p) is a prime number, we conclude that (uv^2) must equal 1 or (p). Therefore, (v = 1) because if (v geq 2), (uv^2) would exceed 1. Thus: [ u = 1 , text{or} , p ] 7.

A's investment: Rs. 27000 B's investment: Rs. 72000 C's investment: Rs. 81000 The ratio of their investments is A:B:C = 27000:72000:81000. To simplify the ratio, we can divide each investment by the greatest common divisor of the three amounts. In this case, the greatest common divisor is 9000. So, the simplified ratio is: A:B:C = 27000/9000 : 72000/9000 : 81000/9000 A:B:C = 3:8:9 Now, we know that C's share of the profit is Rs. 36000, which corresponds to the '9' parts in the ratio. The total profit is divided into 3 + 8 + 9 = 20 parts.

The discriminant (Delta) of the polynomial (x^2 + px + q + 1) must be a perfect square for the roots to be integers. The discriminant is given by: [ Delta = p^2 - 4(q + 1) ] Substituting (p = -(a + b)) and (q = ab - 1), we get: [ Delta = (-(a + b))^2 - 4((ab - 1) + 1) = (a + b)^2 - 4ab ] Simplifying, we have: [ Delta = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - 4ab = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2 ] Therefore, (Delta = (a - b)^2), which is indeed a perfect square. 4.

Moving the vertices (A, B,) and (C) along the planes towards or away from (D) does not change the angles we want to investigate. 2. **Equilateral Triangles**: Each triangular face ((ADB, BDC, CDA)) will be isosceles with (DA = DB = DC = d).

We will call two vertices of this polygon non-friendly if the bisectors of the angles at these vertices are perpendicular. Prove that for any vertex, the number of vertices non-friendly to it is even. 1. **Setup**: Arrange the polygon so that its sides are either horizontal or vertical. Let the number of vertical sides be (k). Since every two adjacent sides are perpendicular, the number of horizontal sides is also (k). Thus, the polygon has (2k) sides and vertices. 2. **Vertex Classification**: Each vertex of the polygon can be classified into one of four types based on its orientation: - Type ( Gamma ): Upper-left corner - Type ( urcorner ): Upper-right corner - Type ( mathrm{L} ): Lower-left corner - Type ( lrcorner ): Lower-right corner 3. **Example Vertex Consideration**: Assume without loss of generality that vertex ( A ) is of type ( urcorner ) (type 2). The vertices non-friendly with ( A ) are those vertices where the angle bisectors are perpendicular to the bisector of ( A ), i.e., vertices of type ( Gamma ) (type 1) and ( lrcorner ) (type 4). 4. **Counting Vertices**: Consider any horizontal side. The left end of this side can only be of type ( Gamma ) (type 1) or ( mathrm{L} ) (type 3). There are exactly ( k ) left ends of horizontal sides, implying the total number of type 1 and type 3 vertices combined is ( k ). - Let the number of vertices of type 1 be ( x ), then the number of vertices of type 3 is ( k - x ). Similarly, considering the lower ends of vertical sides: - The lower ends of vertical sides are vertices of type ( mathrm{L} ) (type 3) or ( lrcorner ) (type 4). By the same argument, the total number of type 3 and type 4 vertices is ( k ). - The number of vertices of type 4 is ( k - (k - x) = x ). 5. **Non-Friendly Vertices Count**: Since both type 1 and type 4 vertices each appear ( x ) times: - The total number of vertices that are non-friendly with ( A ), which are of types 1 and 4 combined, is ( 2x ), an even number. 6. **Generalization**: This argument holds for any vertex ( A ), as it is based on the properties of the polygon's structure rather than any specific vertex. **Conclusion**: The number of vertices non-friendly with any given vertex is always even.

The resulting figure will be a trapezoid with bases (b - frac{2xb}{h}) and (b - frac{xb}{h}), and height (x).

To find the maximum area of the trapezoid, we need to maximize the quadratic expression in the numerator: [ frac{2x}{h} - frac{3x^2}{h^2} ] This is a quadratic function in (x), and its maximum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic function (ax^2 + bx + c) is given by (x = -frac{b}{2a}). Here, (a = -frac{3}{h^2}) and (b = frac{2}{h}), so: [ x = -frac{frac{2}{h}}{2 cdot -frac{3}{h^2}} = frac{h}{3} ] 7.

Note that the perimeter of triangle ( DCE ) is given as 60, which means: [ ED + DC + CE = 60 ] 3. Since ( E ) is the point where the extensions of (AD) and (BC) intersect, we can use the tangency properties: [ EM = EK ] Thus, by combining and simplifying the sum of these tangents: [ EM + EK = ED + DC + CE = 60 ] Since ( EM = EK ), it follows that: [ 2EM = 60 implies EM = 30 ] 4.

Each day, one road is made one-way by the Ministry of Transport. - The strategy is to ensure a cycle (loop) of cities with a length of at least 400 roads is formed within these 500 days. 5. **Creating a Large Cycle**: - A closed cycle means a sequence of roads forming a loop where you can travel around without breaks in a single direction. - Over 500 days, the Ministry of Transport will set 500 one-way roads. - To ensure a large cycle, out of these 500 roads, allocate 400 to form a loop that interlinks several cities. 6. **Handling Remaining Cities**: - Say there are about 1591 remaining roads (since (1991 - 400 = 1591)). - The strategy would involve ensuring no more than 300 unconnected paths lead to cities (covered in the reference as \\"no more than 15 cities left unconnected by the 300 unconnected paths”). 7. **Next 30 Days Execution**: - After establishing the primary loop, during the next 30 days, consider connecting the remaining cities that weren't part of the primary loop. - This happens by selecting each of these cities and linking them to the established cycle using two-way connections to ensure both inflow and outflow per city. 8. **Ensuring New Cities Join the Cycle**: - For any remaining cities, use the following rule for the daily connection: - Each day, connect one road from a city, which currently has the lowest number of uncovered roads to the main cycle. - This ensures a gradual but definite integration of all cities into the main cycle or reconciles with one-way connections. 9. **Ensuring Comprehensive Connectivity**: - By following the above strategy, eventually, all cities will be connected into a single network with directed paths ensuring travel between any two cities. - With this systematic approach, over time all cities ensure two-way or one-way directional roads either to or within the formed cycle. # Conclusion: By consistently applying the above strategy, it can be ensured that every city will be connected in such a way that one can travel from any city to any other city, considering the one-way road direction constraints. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Márcia is at a store buying a recorder that she wanted for a long time.

The old price, when the digits are reversed, is represented by ( ba ), which is: [ 10b + a ] Given that the new price includes a 20% increase on the old price, we can write the relationship as: [ 10a + b = 1.2(10b + a) ] Let us expand and simplify the equation: [ 10a + b = 12b + 1.2a ] Combining like terms to isolate ( a ) and ( b ) gives: [ 10a - 1.2a = 12b - b ] [ 8.8a = 11b ] Now, solve for ( b ): [ b = frac{8.8a}{11} ] [ b = frac{8.8}{11} times a ] [ b = frac{4}{5} times a ] Since ( a ) and ( b ) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we need ( frac{4}{5} times a ) to be an integer.

What is the minimum length of ( AB + BC + CD )?","completion":"Given: - Points (A) and (C) are on the ray (OM). - Points (B) and (D) are on the ray (ON). - (OA = 6) and (OD = 16). - (angle N O M = 20^{circ}). We need to find the minimum length of (AB + BC + CD). 1. **Reflecting the Rays:** Reflect the ray (ON) about the ray (OM) to get the ray (OP). Let the image of point (B) under this reflection be point (E). 2. **Further Reflections:** Reflect the ray (OM) about the ray (OP) to get the ray (OQ). Let the image of point (A) under this reflection be point (F). 3. **Distance Measurements:** Since (OP) is the reflected ray, we have: [ OE = OB ] Similarly, [ OF = OA = 6 ] 4. **Angle Calculations:** The angle (angle N O M = 20^{circ}). Hence, when reflecting twice: [ angle FOD = 3 times 20^{circ} = 60^{circ} ] 5. **Reflection Properties:** According to the properties of reflection: [ FE = EB ] [ EC = BC ] Hence the total folded path (AB + BC + CD) becomes: [ FE + EC + CD ] 6. **Minimum Folded Path:** By the triangle inequality: [ FE + EC + CD geq FD ] 7. **Using Cosine Rule:** In (triangle FOD), using the law of cosines: [ FD^2 = OF^2 + OD^2 - 2 cdot OF cdot OD cdot cos(60^circ) ] Plugging in the values: [ FD^2 = 6^2 + 16^2 - 2 cdot 6 cdot 16 cdot frac{1}{2} ] [ FD^2 = 36 + 256 - 96 ] [ FD^2 = 196 ] Hence, [ FD = sqrt{196} = 14 ] 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the minimum length of (AB + BC + CD) is (boxed{14})."},{"prompt":"What is the mass percentage of Ca in Calcium hydroxide?","completion":"Calcium hydroxide is a chemical compound with the formula Ca(OH)2. To find the mass percentage of calcium (Ca) in calcium hydroxide, we need to calculate the molar mass of the compound and the molar mass of calcium, and then find the ratio of the two. The molar mass of calcium (Ca) is approximately 40.08 g/mol. The molar mass of hydroxide (OH) is the sum of the molar mass of oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H). Oxygen has a molar mass of approximately 16.00 g/mol, and hydrogen has a molar mass of approximately 1.01 g/mol. Therefore, the molar mass of hydroxide (OH) is 16.00 g/mol + 1.01 g/mol = 17.01 g/mol. Since there are two hydroxide ions in calcium hydroxide, we multiply the molar mass of hydroxide by 2: 2 * 17.01 g/mol = 34.02 g/mol. Now, we can calculate the molar mass of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) by adding the molar mass of calcium to the molar mass of the two hydroxide ions: 40.08 g/mol (Ca) + 34.02 g/mol (2OH) = 74.10 g/mol (Ca(OH)2). To find the mass percentage of calcium in calcium hydroxide, we divide the molar mass of calcium by the molar mass of calcium hydroxide and multiply by 100%: (40.08 g/mol Ca / 74.10 g/mol Ca(OH)2) * 100% ≈ 54.09%. Therefore, the mass percentage of calcium in calcium hydroxide is approximately boxed{54.09%} ."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},N={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],I={key:0},z={key:1};function W(n,e,h,m,o,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(y,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",N,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
