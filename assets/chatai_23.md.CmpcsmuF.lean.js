This process involves rearranging and grouping terms: [ a^{2} - 6a + b^{2} - 8b + c^{2} - 10c + 50 = 0 ] Adding and subtracting the necessary squares (i.e., (3)^2, (4)^2, and (5)^2) inside the equation gives us: [ (a^{2} - 6a + 9) + (b^{2} - 8b + 16) + (c^{2} - 10c + 25) = 0 ] This simplifies to: [ left(a-3right)^{2}+left(b-4right)^{2}+left(c-5right)^{2}=0 ] Given that a square of a real number is always non-negative, and the sum of these squares equals zero, each term must be zero.

In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circumcircle. Therefore, the radius R of the circumcircle is half the length of the hypotenuse: [ R = frac{1}{2}c = frac{1}{2} times 5 = 2.5 ] Thus, the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ABC is 2.5.

Then there must be at least one positive integer, say ( a ), and the product of all other integers (excluding ( a )) is positive. This contradicts the condition given in the problem. 2. **Non-even Number of Negative Numbers:** The contradiction implies that the set must contain an odd number of negative numbers.

Determine the maximum number of elements of a *happy* family.","completion":"To determine the maximum number of elements in a *happy* family of intervals, we need to understand the constraints given by the problem. Specifically, for any two intervals ( I_1 = [i_1, j_1] ) and ( I_2 = [i_2, j_2] ) in the family (wp), if ( I_1 subset I_2 ), then ( i_1 = i_2 ) or ( j_1 = j_2 ). 1. **Associate intervals with sums:** - Consider the sum ( i + j ) for each interval ([i, j]). - If two intervals ([i_1, j_1]) and ([i_2, j_2]) are such that ( i_1 + j_1 = i_2 + j_2 ), then they cannot be nested unless ( i_1 = i_2 ) or ( j_1 = j_2 ). This is because if ( i_1 < i_2 ) and ( j_1 > j_2 ), then ( [i_1, j_1] ) cannot be a subset of ([i_2, j_2]) and vice versa. 2. **Pigeonhole Principle:** - By the pigeonhole principle, if we have more intervals than the number of possible sums, some intervals must share the same sum. - The number of possible sums ( i + j ) ranges from ( 1 ) to ( 2n-1 ) (since ( 0 le i < j le n )). - Therefore, the maximum number of intervals that can be included in a *happy* family without violating the nesting condition is related to the number of distinct sums. 3. **Catalan Numbers:** - The problem can be mapped to a combinatorial structure counted by Catalan numbers. Specifically, the number of ways to arrange non-crossing partitions or nested intervals is given by the Catalan number ( C_n ). - The ( n )-th Catalan number ( C_n ) is given by: [ C_n = frac{1}{n+1} binom{2n}{n} ] - This number counts the maximum number of non-crossing partitions of a set of ( n ) elements, which corresponds to the maximum number of intervals in a *happy* family. 4. **Conclusion:** - The maximum number of elements in a *happy* family of intervals (wp) is given by the ( n )-th Catalan number ( C_n ).

Divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits must be divisible by 3. 2. Divisibility by 5: The last digit must be either 0 or 5. Given the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, we can calculate the sum of all digits: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, any combination of these digits without repetition will also be divisible by 3. Now, for the number to be divisible by 5, the last digit must be either 0 or 5. We have two cases to consider: Case 1: The last digit is 0. If the last digit is 0, we have the following 4 digits left to arrange: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Since the sum of all digits is divisible by 3, any arrangement of these 4 digits will maintain the divisibility by 3. We can arrange these 4 digits in 4!

For each vertex (v) of (P), there is exactly one \\"most clockwise\\" good triangle and one \\"most counterclockwise\\" good triangle. These may be the same triangle, but they count as different triples since (varepsilon) is different.

The new number can be represented as ( overline{AA} = A cdot (10^n + 1) ), where ( n ) is the number of digits in ( A ), because the first ( A ) shifts ( n ) places to the left due to multiplying by ( 10^n ) and the second ( A ) just adds to this. Assume this number is a perfect square, say ( overline{AA} = B^2 ). 3. Decompose ( 10^n + 1 ) into its prime factors. If any of the prime factors in this decomposition occurs exactly once, it implies that ( B^2 ) must also be divisible by ( 10^n + 1 ). If ( B^2 ) is divisible by ( 10^n + 1 ), ( B ) itself must be divisible by ( 10^n + 1 ). 4. As a result, ( B ) can be written as ( B = k(10^n + 1) ) for some integer ( k ). Therefore, [ B^2 = k^2 (10^n + 1)^2. ] 5. Let's rewrite ( A cdot (10^n + 1) = (k cdot (10^n + 1))^2 ), which implies: [ A = k^2 cdot (10^n + 1). ] 6. Notice that for such ( A ) to exist, every prime factor of ( 10^n + 1 ) must appear in pairs, i.e., ( 10^n + 1 ) must be of the form ( M^2 cdot N ) where ( M ) has more than one digit. 7. Prove this by contradiction: If ( A < 10^n + 1 ), it indicates that at least one prime factor of ( 10^n + 1 ) must appear more than once in its factorization. 8. To verify this construction feasibly for ( n = 11 ): [ 10^{11} + 1 = 100000000001. ] 9. Factorizing ( 100000000001 ) implicates: [ 100000000001 = 11 times 9090909091, ] where ( 11 ) occurs more than once in the factorization. 10. Construct ( A ): [ A = 4^2 times 826446281 = 13223140496, ] and validate appending: [ 1322314049613223140496 = (4 cdot 11 cdot 826446281)^2. ] # Conclusion: Thus, a natural number ( A ) exists such that appending ( A ) to itself results in a perfect square number.

From the information given, we know that the car salesman's total earnings in January were 1800, which includes his base salary and the commission from the cars he sold. The commission per car is 200. So, the equation for January's earnings is: B + 200C = 1800 In February, he needs to sell 13 cars to double his January earnings. Doubling 1800 gives us 3600.

Using the sine function for 60°, we have: sin(60°) = frac{r}{R - r} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} Solving for R, the sector's radius, we get: R = frac{2r}{sqrt{3}} + r Now, we can calculate the area of the sector: text{Area of the sector} = frac{120°}{360°} cdot pi R^2 = frac{pi R^2}{3} And for the area of the inscribed circle: text{Area of the inscribed circle} = pi r^2 Substituting the expression for R into the area of the sector and simplifying, we get: text{Area of the sector} = frac{pi}{3} left( frac{2r}{sqrt{3}} + r right)^2 = pi r^2 left( frac{4}{3} + 2sqrt{3} + 1 right) Now we can find the ratio of the area of the sector to the area of the inscribed circle: text{Ratio} = frac{text{Area of the sector}}{text{Area of the inscribed circle}} = frac{left( frac{4}{3} + 2sqrt{3} + 1 right) pi r^2}{pi r^2} = frac{7 + 4sqrt{3}}{9} Therefore, the ratio of the area of the sector to the area of its inscribed circle is boxed{frac{7 + 4sqrt{3}}{9}}."},{"prompt":"Around the outside of a 6 by 6 square, construct four semicircles with the four sides of the square as their diameters.

The remainder when x + 17 is divided by 41 is 22. What is the remainder when x is divided by 82?","completion":"Let's denote the remainder when x is divided by 82 as R. So we can write: x = 82k + R, where k is some integer. Now, when x + 17 is divided by 41, the remainder is 22. We can write this as: x + 17 = 41m + 22, where m is some integer. Since 82 is a multiple of 41 (82 = 2 * 41), we can see that if x is a multiple of 82 plus some remainder R, then x is also a multiple of 41 plus the same remainder R when divided by 41. So, when x + 17 is divided by 41 and the remainder is 22, it means that the remainder R when x is divided by 41 is 22 - 17 = 5. Now, we need to find the remainder when x is divided by 82. Since we know that the remainder when x is divided by 41 is 5, we can say that: x = 41n + 5, where n is some integer. But we also know that x is a multiple of 82 plus some remainder R. Since 41 is exactly half of 82, the remainder R when x is divided by 82 can be either the same as when divided by 41 (which is 5) or it can be 41 + 5 = 46, because adding 41 to the remainder when divided by 41 would still give us a number that when divided by 82 has the same remainder as when divided by 41. To determine which one it is, we need to check the condition given for x + 17. If we add 17 to x and the remainder when divided by 41 is 22, then we need to check which of our two options for R (5 or 46) would satisfy this condition. If R = 5: x = 82k + 5 x + 17 = 82k + 22 When we divide x + 17 by 41, we get a remainder of 22, which matches the condition given.

Out of these remaining decorations, 3/10 are hung using thumbtacks, so the number of decorations hung with thumbtacks is (3/10)(3/8)D = (9/80)D. The remaining decorations are hung using sticky strips, and we know that he uses 20 sticky strips. Therefore, the number of decorations hung with sticky strips is equal to the number of sticky strips used, which is 20. So, the number of decorations hung with sticky strips is (1 - (5/8 + 9/80))D. To find this fraction, we need a common denominator, which would be 80 in this case: (1 - (50/80 + 9/80))D = (1 - (59/80))D = (21/80)D. Now we know that (21/80)D = 20 (since 20 sticky strips are used for the remaining decorations). To find D, we solve for D: D = 20 / (21/80) D = 20 * (80/21) D = 1600 / 21 D ≈ 76.19 Since the number of decorations must be a whole number, we round D to the nearest whole number, which is 76.

We need to form a sequence where each pair of consecutive numbers differ by 3 or 5. 2. One way to accomplish this is to rotate through a specific pattern.

Similarly, the cost of the master bathroom towel sets with the discount becomes 50.00 - (50.00 * 0.20) = 50.00 - 10.00 = 40.00 each.

Since the distance d is less than the radius of the circle r = 3, the line l intersects the circle.

Therefore: [ S' = S. ] 6. **Equalities in Distances**: If the sum of the pairwise distances does not change and no individual distance decreases after rearranging, every pairwise distance must remain the same. For if even one distance increased, it would contradict the invariance of the sum. 7. **Final Conclusion**: Since no pairwise distance decreases and the total sum of the distances remains unchanged, it follows that all pairwise distances must remain unchanged. Therefore, the rearrangement of tokens does not affect any individual distance between any two tokens.

At this time, the distance d from the center O(0, 0) to line EF is d = frac{|-2m - tn|}{sqrt{(n + 2)^2 + (m - t)^2}} Since m^2 + 2n^2 = 4, t = frac{2n}{m}, So d = frac{|2m + tn|}{sqrt{(n + 2)^2 + (m - t)^2}} = frac{|2m + (frac{2n}{m}) times n|}{sqrt{m^2 + n^2 + 4n - 2m times (frac{2n}{m}) + 4 + (frac{2n}{m})^2}} = frac{|frac{2m^2 + 2n^2}{m}|}{sqrt{m^2 + n^2 + frac{4n^2}{m^2} + 4}} = frac{|frac{m^2 + 4}{m}|}{sqrt{frac{m^4 + 8m^2 + 16}{2m^2}}} = sqrt{2}, thus, the line EF is tangent to the circle x^2 + y^2 = 2. In conclusion, the line EF is tangent to the circle x^2 + y^2 = 2. boxed{text{Tangent}}"},{"prompt":"What is the least number of moves it takes a knight to get from one corner of an ntimes n chessboard, where nge 4 , to the diagonally opposite corner?","completion":"1. **Define the problem and notation:** Let ( f(n) ) be the minimum number of moves required for a knight to travel from one corner of an ( n times n ) chessboard to the diagonally opposite corner. We need to find ( f(n) ) for ( n geq 4 ). 2. **Base cases:** - For ( n = 4 ): \`\`\` X... .... .X.. ...X \`\`\` The knight can move from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner in 2 moves. Hence, ( f(4) leq 2 ). - For ( n = 5 ): \`\`\` X.... ..... .X.X. ..... ..X.X \`\`\` The knight can move from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner in 4 moves.

Hence, ( f(6) leq 4 ). 3. **General case:** - By performing two moves as in the ( n = 4 ) board, we can reduce the problem from ( n times n ) to ( (n-3) times (n-3) ). Therefore, we have: [ f(n) = 2 + f(n-3) ] - By induction, we can solve the recursion to obtain: [ f(n) leq 2 leftlfloor frac{n+1}{3} rightrfloor ] In other words, if ( n = 3k-1 ) or ( 3k ) or ( 3k+1 ) for some integer ( k ), then ( f(n) leq 2k ). 4. **Lower bound:** - Suppose the bottom-right corner is ((0,0)), the bottom-left corner is ((n,0)), and the top-left corner is ((n-1,n-1)). Let the value of a square ((x,y)) be ( x+y ). - Note that a knight can decrease the value of the square it's standing on by at most 3. Initially, the knight has a value of ( 2n-2 ) and it needs to decrease the value to 0. Therefore, the knight needs at least: [ frac{2n-2}{3} text{ moves} ] - Also, the knight always changes the parity of its value. Initially, it's even and at the end, it's also even, so the knight needs to take an even number of moves. 5. **Conclusion:** - Hence, ( f(n) ) must be at least the least even integer greater than or equal to ( frac{2n-2}{3} ), or in other words: [ f(n) geq 2 leftlceil frac{n-1}{3} rightrceil ] - Note that since ( n ) is an integer, we have: [ leftlceil frac{n-1}{3} rightrceil = leftlfloor frac{n+1}{3} rightrfloor ] (use ( x = lfloor x rfloor + {x} ), ( lceil x rceil = -lfloor -x rfloor ), and ( left{ frac{n}{3} right} leq frac{2}{3} ) if ( n ) is an integer; the proof is left to the reader). 6. **Final result:** - Therefore, we have: [ f(n) geq 2 leftlfloor frac{n+1}{3} rightrfloor ] - Combining the upper and lower bounds, we conclude: [ f(n) = 2 leftlfloor frac{n+1}{3} rightrfloor ] The final answer is ( boxed{ f(n) = 2 leftlfloor frac{n+1}{3} rightrfloor } )"},{"prompt":"Compute without using a calculator: 10! 9!.","completion":"10! - 9! = 10 times 9! - 9!

To determine the heaviest among 5 stones, we require 4 weighings (since each weighing eliminates 1 stone). # Conclusion: Therefore, the total weighings required are: [ 16 text{(first round)} + 8 text{(second round)} + 4 text{(third round)} + 2 text{(fourth round)} + 1 text{(final heaviest)} + 4 text{( candidates for second heaviest)} = 35 ] Hence, we can determine the two heaviest stones with 35 weighings in total.

Since the eccentricity (e = dfrac{c}{a} = dfrac{1}{2}), we find (a = 2). Next, we calculate (b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 3). Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is (boxed{dfrac{x^{2}}{4} + dfrac{y^{2}}{3} = 1}).

Solution. **Step 1:** Reflect the pyramid over the plane of the square ABCD. Since the reflection preserves distances and angles, and the points of the square face map to themselves under this reflection, denote the reflected vertex of M as M'. **Step 2:** Connect M' to points A, B, C, and D, forming the reflected pyramid. **Step 3:** Since the pyramid is regular, all its edge lengths are equal, and the line MM' passes through the center of the base. Thus, quadrilaterals MAMC and MBMD are rhombuses. This means that MC is parallel to M'A, and MB is parallel to M'D. Hence, the planes BMC and DA'M are parallel. **Step 4:** For a point P in the plane, let the feet of the perpendiculars from P to the planes BMC and AMD be T_1 and T_2, respectively. Reflect T_1 over the plane of the base square to get T_1'. **Step 5:** Due to the reflection property, PT_1 = PT_1', and since T_1' lies on the plane BM'C, the line PT_1' is perpendicular to this plane, and hence parallel to PT_2. This implies TP_2 + PT_1 = T_2T_1', which is the distance between the planes D^MA and BM'C.

Solution. **Step 1:** Reduce the problem to a known planar theorem which states that the sum of the distances from a point P on the base of an isosceles triangle to its equal sides is independent of the location of P and equals the height of the triangle. **Step 2:** Let A_1, B_1, C_1, and D_1 be the midpoints of sides AB, BC, CA, and DA, respectively. This makes A_1C_1 and B_1D_1 the bisectors of the square sides. **Step 3:** Let the projections of P onto these bisectors be P_1 and P_2, respectively. Since PP_1 is parallel to AB and CD, it is also parallel to the planes MAB and MCD. **Step 4:** Measure these two distances in plane MA_1C_1. Their sum equals the height pulled from A_1 in this isosceles triangle MA_1C_1. **Step 5:** Similarly, the sum of the distances from P to the planes MAD and MBC will equal the height pulled from D_1 in isosceles triangle MB_1D_1. **Step 6:** Since the pyramid is regular, the isosceles triangles MA_1C_1 and MB_1D_1 have equal heights, confirming the sums of the distances are equal. **Conclusion:** The assertion of the task has been demonstrated.

Given that the largest circle has a radius of six meters, we can deduce the relationship between the diameters of the smaller circles and the diameter of the largest circle.

Select some number, say ( M ), of elements from the population and mark them. Then return them to the main population and assume they are well mixed with the unmarked elements.

We shall proceed step by step. --- Part (a): **Step 1:** We are tasked with proving that the probability mathrm{P}_{N, M; n}{X=m} of finding m marked elements in a randomly chosen sample of n elements from a population N can be expressed using the hypergeometric distribution. The hypergeometric distribution, in this context, indicates a situation where we draw a sample without replacement. **Step 2:** First, count the total number of ways to choose n elements from an entire population of size N: C_{N}^{n} = binom{N}{n} = frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}. **Step 3:** Next, recognize that we need to calculate the number of favorable ways to get m marked elements out of those marked M elements and n-m unmarked elements out of the remaining N-M. The number of ways to choose m marked elements from M marked ones is: C_{M}^{m} = binom{M}{m} = frac{M!}{m!(M-m)!}. **Step 4:** The number of ways to select the remaining n-m elements from the unmarked ones (which are N-M in total) is: C_{N-M}^{n-m} = binom{N-M}{n-m} = frac{(N-M)!}{(n-m)!(N-M-(n-m))!}. **Step 5:** According to the definition of the hypergeometric distribution, the probability mathrm{P}_{N, M; n}{X=m} is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes: mathrm{P}_{N, M; n}{X=m} = frac{C_{M}^{m} C_{N-M}^{n-m}}{C_{N}^{n}}. Thus, confirming the provided formula for the hypergeometric probability distribution: mathrm{P}_{N, M; n}{X=m} = frac{binom{M}{m} binom{N-M}{n-m}}{binom{N}{n}}. --- Part (b): **Step 1:** We need to determine the value of N that maximizes the probability mathrm{P}_{N, M; n}{X=m}. Let's define: F(N) = mathrm{P}_{N, M; n}{X=m} = frac{C_{M}^{m} C_{N-M}^{n-m}}{C_{N}^{n}}. **Step 2:** To find the maximum of F(N), consider the ratio: frac{F(N+1)}{F(N)}. **Step 3:** Calculate this ratio explicitly. Recall and use the definitions of combinations: binom{a}{b} = frac{a!}{b!(a-b)!}. Combining these, we get: frac{F(N+1)}{F(N)} = frac{binom{N+1}{n} cdot binom{N-M+1}{n-m}}{binom{N}{n} cdot binom{N-M}{n-m}} = frac{(N+1)!(n!(N-n)!)((N-M+1)!(M!(N-M-n+m)!))}{(N!(n!(N-n)!)((N-M)!((n-m)!(N-M-(n-m))!))}. **Step 4:** Simplify the ratio: frac{F(N+1)}{F(N)} = frac{(N+1-n)(N-M+n-m+1)}{(N+1)(N-M)} = frac{(N-n+1)(N-M+n-m+1)}{(N+1)(N-M)}. **Step 5:** Set up the inequality to find when this ratio is less than or equal to 1: frac{F(N+1)}{F(N)} leq 1. **Step 6:** Solve the inequality: frac{(N-n+1)(N-M+n-m+1)}{(N+1)(N-M+n-m+1)} leq 1 implies N ge frac{M n}{m} - 1.

Since the ratio of the time it takes printer X to the time it takes printers Y and Z together is 2.25, we can write: [ T_X = 2.25 times frac{1}{left(frac{1}{T_Y} + frac{1}{T_Z}right)} ] Substituting the known values for ( T_X ) and ( T_Y ), we get: [ 15 = 2.25 times frac{1}{left(frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{T_Z}right)} ] Solving for ( frac{1}{T_Z} ), we get: [ frac{1}{left(frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{T_Z}right)} = frac{15}{2.25} ] [ frac{1}{left(frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{T_Z}right)} = frac{15 times 4}{9} ] [ frac{1}{left(frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{T_Z}right)} = frac{60}{9} ] [ frac{1}{left(frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{T_Z}right)} = frac{20}{3} ] Now, we take the reciprocal of both sides: [ frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{T_Z} = frac{3}{20} ] [ frac{1}{T_Z} = frac{3}{20} - frac{1}{10} ] [ frac{1}{T_Z} = frac{3}{20} - frac{2}{20} ] [ frac{1}{T_Z} = frac{1}{20} ] So, ( T_Z = 20 ) hours. Therefore, it takes printer Z boxed{20} hours to do the job alone."},{"prompt":"Given the equation frac{{mx}}{{x8}}=frac{{4m+x}}{{x8}} has a positive integer solution for x, find the value of the positive integer m.","completion":"Given the equation frac{{mx}}{{x-8}}=frac{{4m+x}}{{x-8}}, we aim to find the value of the positive integer m that allows for a positive integer solution for x. Let's solve this step by step: 1. Start with the given equation: frac{{mx}}{{x-8}}=frac{{4m+x}}{{x-8}} 2. Combine the fractions by subtracting one from the other, setting the equation to zero: frac{{mx}}{{x-8}} - frac{{4m+x}}{{x-8}} = 0 3. Simplify the numerator: frac{{mx - 4m - x}}{{x-8}} = 0 4. Factor the numerator: frac{{(m-1)x - 4m}}{{x-8}} = 0 5. From this, we derive two conditions: - (m-1)x - 4m = 0 - x - 8 neq 0 6. Solve for x in terms of m: x = frac{{4m}}{{m-1}} And ensure x neq 8 to avoid division by zero. 7. Since x must be a positive integer, we analyze the expression for x: x = frac{{4m}}{{m-1}} = 4 + frac{4}{{m-1}} 8. For x to be an integer, frac{4}{{m-1}} must also be an integer. This implies m-1 could be factors of 4, which are 1, 2, and 4. Therefore, m could be 2, 3, or 5. 9. Substituting these values of m back into the expression for x gives: - For m=2, x=8 (which is discarded because x neq 8). - For m=3, x=6. - For m=5, x=5.

This implies that f'(x) is monotonically increasing, which contradicts the requirement for having both a local minimum and maximum with x_1 < x_2. - When 0 < a < 1, the sign of f''(x) can change, indicating that f(x) can have regions of concavity up and down, allowing for the existence of both a local minimum and maximum. 4. **Determine the condition for f'(x) to have the correct behavior**: - For 0 < a < 1, we find x_0 such that f''(x_0) = 0.

However, considering the initial condition that x_1 < x_2 and the analysis of the second derivative, the correct interpretation leads to the conclusion that for f(x) to have a local minimum at x_1 and a maximum at x_2 with x_1 < x_2, a must satisfy the condition for when 0 < a < 1.

Since he saves 50% of his income, his savings in the first year are ( 0.5I ), and his expenditure in the first year is also ( 0.5I ) (since savings + expenditure = income).

His expenditure in the second year is his income minus his savings, which is ( 1.5I - I = 0.5I ). Therefore, his total expenditure over the two years is ( 0.5I + 0.5I = I ).

Let's go through the solution step-by-step: 1. **Semicircle Geometry**: - The semicircle has a radius ( r ). - It is centered along a diameter, say on the x-axis, from ((-r, 0)) to ( (r, 0) ). 2. **Consider a Trapezoid**: - We hypothesize that one possible shape with maximum area could be a trapezoid. 3. **Positioning the Trapezoid**: - Let two vertices of the trapezoid lie at the endpoints of the diameter of the semicircle, i.e., at ( (-r, 0) ) and ( (r, 0) ). - The other two vertices must be on the semicircle to maximize the area covered by the semicircle. 4. **Divide Semicircle into Equal Arcs**: - Let the semicircle be divided into three equal arcs. - These arcs will be (frac{2pi r}{3}) each. 5. **Vertices on the Semicircle**: - Place the remaining two vertices of the trapezoid on the semicircle such that each arc is (pi r / 3). - These points subtend angles of (120^circ) from the center. 6. **Coordinates of the Additional Vertices**: - Using the polar coordinates, the additional two vertices are essentially at angles of (pm 60^circ) from the center. - Their coordinates will be ( (r cos(60^circ), r sin(60^circ) )) and ( (-r cos(60^circ), r sin(60^circ) )). 7. **Vertices Determination**: - Hence, the trapezoid will have vertices at: [ (-r, 0), quad (r, 0), quad left( frac{r}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}r}{2} right), quad left( -frac{r}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}r}{2} right) ] 8. **Area Calculation**: - The area of a trapezoid can be given by: [ A = frac{1}{2} ( x_1 + x_2 )h ] - Here, ( x_1 + x_2 ) is the sum of the parallel sides (length 2r) and ( h ) is the height, which from the coordinates ( (0, rsqrt{3}/2) ) is ( sqrt{3}r/2 ). 9. **Substituting Values**: [ A = frac{1}{2} (2r) left( frac{sqrt{3}r}{2} right) ] Simplifying: [ A = r left( frac{sqrt{3}r}{2} right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} r^2 ] 10. **Maximization**: - This area is maximized if our division and placement of vertices follow the optimal strategy. 11. **Final Calculation**: - This shape indeed maximizes the area among all possible quadrilaterals that can fit inside the semicircle, confirming our hypothesized maximum area. # Conclusion: Thus, the quadrilateral with the maximum area inside a semicircle is a trapezoid with vertices dividing the semicircle into three equal arcs.

Since among any three students, there are at least two who are friends: - Every student among the remaining 23 must be friends with either Vasya or Petya (or both). - If there were a student, say Kolya, who is not a friend with either Vasya or Petya, then Vasya, Petya, and Kolya would form a group of three students with no pairs of friends, contradicting the initial condition. 5. **Friendship Analysis via Dirichlet Principle:** Assume that Vasya and Petya each have at most 11 friends among the 23 students. Therefore, the total number of students who can be friends with either Vasya or Petya is at most 22 (11 + 11). - This sum leaves one student unaccounted for among the 23 students, implying a contradiction because it is given that every student is friends with at least one of either Vasya or Petya. 6. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** The assumption that both Vasya and Petya can each have at most 11 friends leads to a contradiction. Hence, at least one of Vasya, Petya, or any student must have more than 11 friends to satisfy the initial condition.

What is the area of the square?","completion":"1. Given problem setup: We have a square with two of its vertices lying on the parabola ( y = x^2 ) and one of its sides lying on the line ( y = 2x - 17 ). 2. Start by recognizing that the parabola and the line do not intersect. We will focus on another line ( l ), which will be parallel to ( y = 2x - 17 ). This line can be described by ( 2x - y + b = 0 ), where ( b ) is some constant. 3. Calculate the distance ( d ) between these two parallel lines: [ d = frac{|b - (-17)|}{sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{|b + 17|}{sqrt{5}} ] 4. Now, find the intersection points of the line ( l ) (given by ( y = 2x + b )) and the parabola ( y = x^2 ): [ x^2 = 2x + b implies x^2 - 2x - b = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation yields the solutions ( x ): [ x_{1,2} = 1 pm sqrt{1 + b} ] 5. The horizontal distance between the intersection points is: [ x_1 - x_2 = (1 + sqrt{1 + b}) - (1 - sqrt{1 + b}) = 2sqrt{b + 1} ] 6. The vertical distance between these points can be calculated by the ( y )-coordinates of these points on the parabola: Since ( y = x^2 ), we get: [ y_1 = (1 + sqrt{1 + b})^2, quad y_2 = (1 - sqrt{1 + b})^2 ] The vertical distance is thus: [ y_1 - y_2 = (1 + sqrt{1 + b})^2 - (1 - sqrt{1 + b})^2 ] Using the difference of squares: [ y_1 - y_2 = [4(1 + b)] ] 7. Hence, the distance between points ( M_1(x_1, y_1) ) and ( M_2(x_2, y_2) ) is: [ M_1M_2^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 = (2 sqrt{b + 1})^2 + (4 sqrt{b + 1})^2 = 4(b+1) + 16(b+1) = 20(b + 1) ] 8. As this distance is a diagonal of the square, we equate the squares of the sides and the diagonal: [ 20(b + 1) = frac{(b + 17)^2}{5} ] 9.

Let's break it down: 1. Start with the given equation: 2cos 2A+4cos left(B+Cright)+3=0 2. Use the identity cos 2A = 2cos^2 A - 1 and cos(pi - A) = -cos A: 2(2cos^2 A - 1) + 4(-cos A) + 3 = 0 3.

Let the price reduction for each piece of children's clothing be x yuan. - The new selling price per piece will be 120 - x yuan. - The profit per piece after the reduction will be (120 - x) - 80 = 40 - x yuan. - The number of pieces sold per day increases by 2 for every 1 yuan reduction, so the new quantity sold per day is 20 + 2x pieces.

The answer to this problem is that the possible values of k is k = n + 1, where n is the number of walls. Here is the detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Number of Regions**: - We demonstrate by induction that the n walls divide the plane into binom{n+1}{2} + 1 regions. - **Base Case**: For n=0, there are no walls and hence only one region, which is binom{0+1}{2} + 1 = 1. - **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume it is true for some n=k that k walls create binom{k+1}{2} + 1 regions. - **Induction Step**: When we add one more wall (n=k+1), it intersects each of the existing k walls exactly once, splitting each of those k regions into two. Thus: [ text{New number of regions} = left( binom{k+1}{2} + 1 right) + (k+1) ] Simplifying: [ = frac{(k+1)k}{2} + 1 + k + 1 = frac{k^2 + k}{2} + k + 2 = frac{k^2 + 3k + 2}{2} = frac{(k+2)(k+1)}{2} + 1 = binom{(k+2)}{2} + 1 ] This proves the induction step and confirms that the number of regions created by n walls is binom{n+1}{2} + 1. 2. **Graph Representation**: - Let G be a graph where vertices represent the regions formed by the walls and two regions (vertices) are connected by an edge if there is a door (intersection point of two differently colored sides) between them. - At each intersection of two walls, there are binom{n}{2} intersection points, each corresponding to an edge in G. 3. **Connected Components**: - As we add edges of G sequentially, each edge decreases the number of connected components by at most one. - Initially, the number of connected components is binom{n+1}{2} + 1 (the number of regions). - Each edge reduces the number of connected components by at most one: [ text{Number of connected components} geq binom{n+1}{2} + 1 - binom{n}{2} ] Simplifying: [ = left( frac{(n+1)n}{2} + 1 right) - frac{n(n-1)}{2} = frac{n^2 + n}{2} + 1 - frac{n^2 - n}{2} = 2n + 1 ] 4. **Placing Knights**: - The minimum number of connected components is n + 1. Therefore, Morgana can place a knight in each connected component, ensuring they will not meet. 5. **Construction to Show Maximum**: - Merlin can paint the walls such that the number of connected components is no more than n+1. - For this, Merlin can place walls such that regions between them differ by exactly 1 number of walls. This arrangement ensures proper separation into connected components. 6. **Final Conclusion**: - As shown by induction and through the construction, the value of k(mathfrak{L}) for n walls can be controlled and maintained at n + 1, no matter how the walls are painted by Merlin. Therefore, the largest number k such that Morgana can always place at least k knights without them ever meeting is n + 1.

When P and Q work together for 2 hours, they can complete a combined portion of the job. The combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: P's rate + Q's rate = (1/3) + (1/15) = (5/15) + (1/15) = 6/15 = 2/5 of the job per hour.

Let's examine why this function fits the given condition, albeit with a slight misunderstanding in the interpretation of the increase of y with respect to x. 1.

Given the misunderstanding in the interpretation, the function y = -frac{1}{x} does not strictly satisfy the condition that y increases as x increases for x > 1 in the conventional sense (where we expect the function to move upwards as we move to the right).

To determine the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top of the dice is prime, we first need to understand the conditions under which the product of two numbers is prime. A product of two numbers is prime if and only if one of the numbers is 1 and the other number is a prime number. This is because a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. 2. The prime numbers less than or equal to 6 (the numbers on a six-sided die) are 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, the possible prime numbers that can appear on the dice are 2, 3, and 5. 3. For each prime number, there are two possible scenarios: the prime number can appear on the first die and 1 on the second die, or the prime number can appear on the second die and 1 on the first die. This gives us a total of 2 choices for each prime number. 4. Since there are 3 prime numbers (2, 3, and 5), and each prime number can appear in 2 different ways (as described in step 3), the total number of favorable outcomes is: [ 2 times 3 = 6 ] 5. The total number of possible outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice is: [ 6 times 6 = 36 ] 6.

The area is maximized when 2A = frac{pi}{2}, implying A = frac{pi}{4}. At this angle, tan A = 1 and tan B = frac{1}{2}. This also means sin B = frac{sqrt{5}}{5}. 5. Using the Law of Sines again, we find frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B}. Substituting the values, we get: [a = frac{bsin A}{sin B} = frac{sqrt{2} times frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{frac{sqrt{5}}{5}} = sqrt{5}.] Therefore, the value of a when the area of triangle ABC is at its maximum is boxed{sqrt{5}}."},{"prompt":"f alpha is an acute angle and tan alpha = 1, then the value of cos alpha is: A: frac{1}{2} B: frac{sqrt{2}}{2} C: frac{sqrt{3}}{2} D: 1","completion":"Given that tan alpha = 1, we can deduce the value of alpha and subsequently find cos alpha. 1.

The scale factor k is given by ( k = frac{AL'}{AL} ). 4. **Apply the homothety:** Using this homothety, map K to K', L to L', M to M', and N to N'. This will give you the desired square K'L'M'N'. If considering the extended triangle sides, it's possible that the square can have another configuration due to reflection through A. Thus, it might have two solutions as seen in diagram 160. **Conclusion:** Hence the constructed square K'L'M'N' fits within the triangle, satisfying the given conditions. blacksquare --- **Problem 47(b):** Construct a triangle LMN such that its sides are parallel to the given lines l_1, l_2, and l_3, and vertex L lies on BC, M lies on CA. Here are the steps: 1. **Initial construction:** Place triangle LMN within ABC with L on BC, M on CA, and all sides of LMN parallel to l_1, l_2, and l_3 respectively. 2. **Intersection point:** Identify the point of intersection N' of the lines CN and AB. 3. **Define the homothety:** Use C as the center of homothety. Find the scale factor k = frac{CN'}{CN}. 4. **Apply the homothety:** The homothety with center C and this scale translates the triangle LMN such that it scales down while keeping the shape and orientation intact. 5. **Resulting triangle:** The resulting triangle L'M'N' is a smaller triangle whose sides are parallel to l_1, l_2, and l_3 and which fits perfectly within ABC as shown in diagram 161. **Conclusion:** Thus, the resulting triangle L'M'N' adheres to the required conditions. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given that points A (3, 2m1) and B (n+1, 4) are symmetric about the yaxis, then ( ) A: m=2.5, n=2 B: m=2.5, n=4 C: m=1.5, n=4 D: m=1.5, n=2","completion":"**Solution**: Since A (-3, 2m-1) and B (n+1, 4) are symmetric about the y-axis, then n+1=3 and 2m-1=4, thus n=2 and m=2.5.

To do this, we look at the discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation x^2 - 2kx - 1 = 0. The discriminant Delta is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac, where a = 1, b = -2k, and c = -1. Substituting these values into the formula for Delta, we get: [ Delta = (-2k)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-1) = 4k^2 + 4. ] Since 4k^2 is always non-negative for any real number k, and adding 4 to it makes it strictly positive, we have: [ Delta = 4k^2 + 4 > 0. ] This positive discriminant Delta > 0 implies that the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots. Therefore, the graph of the quadratic function intersects the x-axis at two points, regardless of the value of k. Part 2: Finding the Intersection Points with the x-axis Given that the axis of symmetry of the graph is the y-axis, the coefficient of x in the vertex form of the quadratic equation must be 0. This means that the term involving k must be nullified, leading to -frac{-2k}{2 cdot 1} = 0. Solving for k gives us k = 0. Substituting k = 0 into the original equation, we get the simplified quadratic function: [ y = x^2 - 1. ] To find the points of intersection with the x-axis, we set y = 0 and solve for x: [ x^2 - 1 = 0 implies x^2 = 1 implies x = pm 1. ] Therefore, the points of intersection with the x-axis are (1, 0) and (-1, 0).

The primary reaction of interest is the neutralization reaction between acetic acid (HCH3CO2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form sodium acetate (NaCH3CO2) and water (H2O): HCH3CO2 + NaOH → NaCH3CO2 + H2O However, we also need to consider the side reaction where hydrochloric acid (HCl) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H2O): HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O Since the side reaction has a 1:1 stoichiometry, 2 moles of HCl will react with 2 moles of NaOH to form 2 moles of NaCl and 2 moles of H2O. This will leave us with 1 mole of NaOH remaining (3 moles of NaOH initially - 2 moles of NaOH reacted with HCl). Now, we can use the remaining NaOH to react with HCH3CO2 to form NaCH3CO2. Since we have 4 moles of HCH3CO2 and only 1 mole of NaOH left, the reaction will be limited by the amount of NaOH available. The stoichiometry of the reaction between HCH3CO2 and NaOH is also 1:1, so 1 mole of NaOH will react with 1 mole of HCH3CO2 to form 1 mole of NaCH3CO2.

Therefore, OC perp MN at the point of tangency. When OC perp MN, |MN| will be at its minimum because any other position of MN would result in a longer line segment due to the properties of a right triangle (the hypotenuse is always longer than either of the two other sides).

The classrooms have capacities ( 1, 2, ldots, n ) respectively, and the total number of students is ( 1 + 2 + cdots + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ). 2. **Initial Setup:** Let ( k = f(n) ). We need to show that ( f(n) leq 3 ). 3. **First Round Distribution:** Suppose in the first round, students ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) are in classroom ( n ). Let the set of these students be ( A ), and let ( B ) be the set of the other students.

Dividing the entire equation by x^2 yields: [x^2 + 2px + 1 + frac{2p}{x} + frac{1}{x^2} = 0.] Introducing a substitution y = x + frac{1}{x}, we can rewrite the equation as: [y^2 = x^2 + 2 + frac{1}{x^2}.] This simplifies the equation to: [y^2 - 2 + 2py + 1 = 0,] which further simplifies to: [y^2 + 2py - 1 = 0.] Solving for p gives us: [p = frac{1 - y^2}{2y}.] For x being negative, by the AM-GM inequality, we have: [y = x + frac{1}{x} le -2.] This leads to an inequality involving p: [frac{1 - y^2}{2y} - frac{3}{4} = -frac{(y + 2)(2y - 1)}{4y} ge 0.] Therefore, we have: [p = frac{1 - y^2}{2y} ge frac{3}{4}.] However, if y = -2, then x + frac{1}{x} = -2, which implies x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0, yielding a single negative root x = -1.

Let the inscribed circle in triangle ABC touch the sides BC, AC, and AB at points D, E, and F respectively. A line segment KL is drawn parallel to BC and tangent to the inscribed circle at point M (refer to the provided diagram). 2.

Solving for m: [ m = frac{a(p - a)}{p} ] 6. To find the maximum value of m, we observe that it is a quadratic function of a. We introduce the expression for m using a in terms of p: [ aleft(frac{p}{2} - aright) ] 7. The maximum value of this product occurs when a = frac{p}{2}, since it is a symmetric quadratic maximum: [ m = frac{2left(frac{p}{2} - aright)left(frac{p}{2}right)}{p} = m = frac{p}{4} ] 8.

What are those values of ( k ) for which it is possible to color the small cubes with two colors in such a way that each small cube has exactly two neighbors of the same color? (Two small cubes are considered neighbors if they share a face.)","completion":"1. First, let's examine why (k) must be even for the desired coloring to exist. We use a 3D coordinate system with unit vectors (mathbf{i}), (mathbf{j}), and (mathbf{k}) parallel to the edges of the small cubes. From the center of each cube, we draw vectors to the centers of its adjacent cubes that have the same color. Each of these vectors is either equal to or opposite one of the unit vectors. If there is a vector from the center of cube (O_1) to the center of cube (O_2), there must also be a vector from (O_2) back to (O_1). Therefore, the sum of all vectors among the (k^3) cubes must be the zero vector: [ a_1 mathbf{i} + a_2 mathbf{j} + a_3 mathbf{k} + b_1 (-mathbf{i}) + b_2 (-mathbf{j}) + b_3 (-mathbf{k}) = mathbf{0} ] where (a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3) represent the number of cubes from which vectors in the directions (mathbf{i}, mathbf{j}, mathbf{k}, -mathbf{i}, -mathbf{j}, -mathbf{k}) respectively, are drawn. This results in the equation: [ (a_1 - b_1) mathbf{i} + (a_2 - b_2) mathbf{j} + (a_3 - b_3) mathbf{k} = mathbf{0} ] This equality holds if and only if (a_1 = b_1), (a_2 = b_2), and (a_3 = b_3). Thus, we get the relation: [ k^3 = 2(a_1 + a_2 + a_3) ] which implies (k^3) is even, meaning (k) itself must be even. Hence, (k) being even is a necessary condition. 2. Now let's construct a valid coloring for even (k). Let (k = 2l), where (l) is an integer. Consider an array of small cubes arranged in a (2l times 2l times 1) block. We can color this block in a checkerboard pattern alternating two colors (denoted as (A) and (B)) such that each cube has exactly two adjacent cubes of the same color.

By stacking these (2l times 2l times 1) blocks with alternating layers, where the top layer's cubes above (A) cubes are (B) cubes and vice-versa, we ensure that each cube in the stack has two adjacent cubes on its sides of the same color while the cubes directly above and below it are of the opposite color. This arrangement leads to each small cube having exactly two same-colored neighbors, fulfilling the problem's requirement. # Conclusion: Thus, the values of (k) that allow the described coloring are the even values.

Therefore, no even ( n ) can satisfy the condition as it will have at least one even digit in ( n^2 ). 3. **Check Numbers Divisible by 5**: If ( n ) is odd and divisible by 5, then ( n = 10k + 5 ) for some integer ( k geq 0 ).

Find a closed formula for the number of 2times n grids with no stranded black square. Note that n is any natural number and the formula must be in terms of n with no other variables.","completion":"1. **Define the problem and initial conditions:** Let ( N(n) ) denote the number of ( 2 times n ) grids with no stranded black squares. We start by considering the base case: [ N(1) = 4 ] This is because there are four possible colorings of a ( 2 times 1 ) grid: both squares white, both squares black, top white and bottom black, and top black and bottom white. 2. **Recursive relation:** Consider a ( 2 times n ) grid. We can think of it as a ( 2 times (n-1) ) grid with an additional column added to the right. We need to count the valid colorings of this new column based on the colorings of the ( 2 times (n-1) ) grid. 3. **Case 1: Bottom row of the ( 2 times (n-1) ) grid is all black:** - There are ( 2^{n-1} ) such colorings. - For the rightmost column, there are no constraints, so there are 4 possible colorings. - Thus, the number of valid colorings in this case is: [ 4 cdot 2^{n-1} ] 4. **Case 2: Bottom row of the ( 2 times (n-1) ) grid is not all black:** - There are ( N(n-1) - 2^{n-1} ) such colorings. - For the rightmost column, if the bottom-right square is black, the top-right square must be white to avoid a stranded black square. This gives 3 possible colorings. - Thus, the number of valid colorings in this case is: [ 3 cdot (N(n-1) - 2^{n-1}) ] 5. **Combine the cases:** [ N(n) = 4 cdot 2^{n-1} + 3 cdot (N(n-1) - 2^{n-1}) ] Simplify the expression: [ N(n) = 4 cdot 2^{n-1} + 3N(n-1) - 3 cdot 2^{n-1} ] [ N(n) = 3N(n-1) + 2^{n-1} ] 6. **Solve the recurrence relation:** We solve the recurrence relation ( N(n) = 3N(n-1) + 2^{n-1} ) with the initial condition ( N(1) = 4 ). Let's find a closed form by iterating the recurrence: [ N(2) = 3N(1) + 2^1 = 3 cdot 4 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14 ] [ N(3) = 3N(2) + 2^2 = 3 cdot 14 + 4 = 42 + 4 = 46 ] We observe that the recurrence relation can be solved using the method of characteristic equations or by recognizing a pattern. 7. **General solution:** The homogeneous part of the recurrence ( N(n) = 3N(n-1) ) suggests a solution of the form ( N(n) = A cdot 3^n ). The particular solution can be found by assuming a form ( B cdot 2^n ). Combining these, we get: [ N(n) = A cdot 3^n + B cdot 2^n ] 8. **Determine constants ( A ) and ( B ):** Using the initial condition ( N(1) = 4 ): [ 4 = A cdot 3^1 + B cdot 2^1 ] [ 4 = 3A + 2B ] Using the second condition ( N(2) = 14 ): [ 14 = A cdot 3^2 + B cdot 2^2 ] [ 14 = 9A + 4B ] Solving these equations: [ 3A + 2B = 4 ] [ 9A + 4B = 14 ] Multiply the first equation by 2: [ 6A + 4B = 8 ] Subtract the first equation from the second: [ (9A + 4B) - (6A + 4B) = 14 - 8 ] [ 3A = 6 ] [ A = 2 ] Substitute ( A = 2 ) back into the first equation: [ 3(2) + 2B = 4 ] [ 6 + 2B = 4 ] [ 2B = -2 ] [ B = -1 ] Thus, the closed form is: [ N(n) = 2 cdot 3^n - 2^n ] The final answer is ( boxed{2 cdot 3^n - 2^n} )."},{"prompt":"The number 16^4+16^2+1 is divisible by four distinct prime numbers.

Next, we recognize that (2^{16} + 2^8 + 1) can be factored using the sum of cubes formula. Recall that (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca)) when (a + b + c = 0). However, in this case, we use a different approach: [ 2^{16} + 2^8 + 1 = (2^8 + 1)^2 - (2^4)^2 ] 3. We recognize this as a difference of squares: [ (2^8 + 1)^2 - (2^4)^2 = (2^8 + 1 + 2^4)(2^8 + 1 - 2^4) ] 4. Simplify the factors: [ 2^8 = 256, quad 2^4 = 16 ] [ 2^8 + 1 = 257, quad 2^8 + 1 + 2^4 = 257 + 16 = 273, quad 2^8 + 1 - 2^4 = 257 - 16 = 241 ] 5.

So, n = (50 - 30)/1 + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21. The sum of an arithmetic series can be found by the formula S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n), where S_n is the sum of the first n terms.

The question is about whether all 1119 edges can form a closed polygonal chain in space when translated in parallel. 2. **Set Up the Coordinate System:** Introduce a coordinate system such that the plane (Oxy) is parallel to the bases of the prism, and the (Oz) axis is perpendicular to these bases. Set the height of the prism to 1, with the origin (O) coinciding with one vertex of the closed polygonal chain. 3. **Understand Edge Movements:** - When moving along an edge that lies in the base, the movement is in the (Oxy) plane, meaning the (z)-coordinate does not change. - When moving along a lateral edge, the (z)-coordinate changes by 1. 4. **Calculate Total Movement in the (z)-Direction:** - There are 373 lateral edges, which implies 373 changes in (z)-coordinate when transitioning through the lateral edges. 5. **Identify Contradictions:** - To close the polygonal chain, the starting and ending point should be the same, implying the (z)-coordinate should return to its initial value. - Since each travel along a lateral edge changes the (z)-coordinate by 1, after passing through 373 lateral edges, the (z)-coordinate will change by (373). - Returning to the initial (z)-coordinate (which should be zero for the starting point) and having moved 373 times implies the final (z)-coordinate won't match its initial value, as 373 is an odd number. 6. **Conclusion:** Since the (z)-coordinate changes by an odd number of times, it cannot be zero on returning, leading to a contradiction. Hence, it is not possible to form a closed polygonal chain in space.

If a < 0, since x_1 + x_2 = 2(a - 1) < 0 and x_1x_2 = 1 > 0, we have x_1 < 0 and x_2 < 0. Hence, g(x) > 0 in (0, +infty), which means f'(x) > 0 and the interval of increase for f(x) is (0, +infty). If a > 2, since x_1 + x_2 = 2(a - 1) > 0 and x_1x_2 = 1 > 0, we find that x_1 > 0 and x_2 > 0. Then g(x) > 0 for intervals (0, x_1) and (x_2, +infty), and g(x) < 0 for (x_1, x_2). Therefore, f(x) increases on (0, x_1) and (x_2, +infty) and decreases on (x_1, x_2). In conclusion, when a > 2, f(x) increases on the intervals (0, a - 1 - sqrt{(a - 1)^2 - 1}) and (a - 1 + sqrt{(a - 1)^2 - 1}, +infty), and f(x) decreases on the interval (a - 1 - sqrt{(a - 1)^2 - 1}, a - 1 + sqrt{(a - 1)^2 - 1}); when a leq 2, f(x) increases on the interval (0, +infty), with no intervals of decrease. (Ⅱ) From the inequality frac{(x+1)ln x + 2a}{(x+1)^2} < frac{ln x}{x-1}, we get frac{(x+1)ln x + 2a}{(x+1)^2} - frac{ln x}{x-1} < 0, which simplifies to frac{-2ln x}{x^2 - 1} + frac{2a(x-1)}{(x+1)^2(x-1)} < 0, or equivalently frac{2}{1 - x^2}(ln x - a frac{x-1}{x+1}) < 0, leading to frac{2}{1 - x^2} f(x) < 0. ① From part (Ⅰ), we know that if a leq 2, f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty) and f(1) = 0. Thus, when x in (0, 1), f(x) < 0 and when x in (1, +infty), f(x) > 0. Also, for x in (0, 1), frac{2}{1-x^2} > 0 and for x in (1, +infty), frac{2}{1-x^2} < 0. Consequently, frac{2}{1-x^2}f(x) < 0 and the original inequality holds. ② From part (Ⅰ), if a > 2, f(x) is increasing on (0, x_1) and (x_2, +infty) and decreasing on (x_1, x_2). Furthermore, as x_1 x_2 = 1, we have x_1 < 1 < x_2. Given f(x_2) < f(1) = 0 and frac{2}{1 - x_2^2} < 0, the expression frac{2}{1 - x_2^2}f(x_2) > 0 contradicts the condition.

Therefore, we have: 1. a + b > c 2. a + c > b 3. b + c > a Given a=7 and b=2, we substitute these values into the inequalities to find the possible range for c: 1. From a - b < c < a + b, we substitute a and b to get 7 - 2 < c < 7 + 2, which simplifies to 5 < c < 9.

The new function, g(x), can be represented as: [g(x) = 2sin(x + frac{pi}{3} + varphi)] Given that g(x) is an even function, we know that for any even function h(x), it holds that h(x) = h(-x). Applying this property to g(x), we aim to satisfy the condition that makes g(x) even. Since the sine function, sin(x), has the property that sin(-x) = -sin(x), and considering the even nature of g(x), we deduce that the argument of the sine function in g(x) must lead to an even function. This implies that the phase shift, frac{pi}{3} + varphi, must be adjusted such that the sine function's periodic and symmetric properties are utilized to make g(x) even. Given the constraint 0 < varphi < frac{pi}{2} and the requirement for g(x) to be even, we equate the phase shift to the point where the sine function's symmetry would contribute to an even function. This point is at frac{pi}{2}, as sin(x) is symmetric around frac{pi}{2}. Therefore, we set up the equation: [frac{pi}{3} + varphi = frac{pi}{2}] Solving for varphi, we subtract frac{pi}{3} from both sides: [varphi = frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{3}] Simplifying the right side by finding a common denominator, we get: [varphi = frac{3pi - 2pi}{6} = frac{pi}{6}] Thus, the value of varphi that satisfies the given conditions is frac{pi}{6}.

Prove that for each main diagonal of the board, the following statement is true: in the rook's route, there are two consecutive moves where the rook first leaves this diagonal and then returns to it. (A main diagonal leads from one corner of the board to the opposite corner.)","completion":"1. **Fix the Diagonal**: Consider a 10times10 chessboard and fix one of its main diagonals. A main diagonal runs from one corner of the board to the opposite corner. 2. **Parity of Moves**: Given that the rook visits each cell exactly once and there are an even number of cells (100 in total), the number of cells involved in the rook's route is even. This implies that the starting and ending cells of this route are of different parity. Specifically, this means one is white and the other is black because the chessboard is colored in an alternating pattern. 3. **Endpoints Analysis**: Since the main diagonal spans from one corner to the opposite corner, it potentially includes cells of both parities. Importantly, there can be at most one endpoint cell of the route on the diagonal itself because the start and end cells are of different color. 4. **Route Pathways**: When the rook moves, it connects two neighboring cells (adjacent cells either horizontally or vertically). Additionally, for every move originating from an endpoint on the diagonal, there must be exactly one outgoing move and one incoming move for each remaining cell in the diagonal (resulting in pairs). 5. **Calculation of Moves**: The main diagonal consists of 10 cells. Since each move of the rook must leave the diagonal and return to it in pairs, there must be an even number of entries and exits. The total number of entries and exits must thus be 2 cdot 10 - 1 = 19 because the rook leaves the diagonal every time except for the first and last time. 6. **Board Interaction**: Each move that leaves the diagonal must go to a cell adjacent to the diagonal. There are a total of 18 adjacent cells (since a 10times10 board has adjacent cells only on the edges, and they wrap around at the corners). 7. **Conclusion About Moves**: Because there are 19 required moves into and out of the diagonal but only 18 adjacent cells, there must be at least one cell on the diagonal that is revisited. In other words, there is inevitably a pair of consecutive moves such that the rook leaves a diagonal cell and returns to it in the next move. 8. **Finally**: Thus, there is a pair of consecutive moves where the rook leaves the main diagonal and then returns to it.

Firstly, for the tangent function f(x) = tan(omega x), the distance between two adjacent points where the graph intersects a line parallel to the x-axis is equal to the period of the function. The problem states that this distance is frac {pi}{4}. Therefore, we can write the period T of the function as: T = frac{pi}{omega}. Since we know T = frac{pi}{4}, we can solve for omega: frac{pi}{omega} = frac{pi}{4} implies omega = 4. Now that we have the value of omega, we can write the function explicitly as f(x) = tan(4x). Secondly, we are asked to find the value of fleft( frac {pi}{4}right). We substitute value of x into the function: fleft( frac {pi}{4}right) = tanleft(4 cdot frac {pi}{4}right) = tan(pi). Since tan(pi) is equivalent to tan(0) due to the periodicity of the tangent function and tan(0) = 0, we have: fleft( frac {pi}{4}right) = tan(pi) = 0.

The face with 3 points cannot be on the top or bottom because otherwise, the adjacent previous or next cube would also show faces with 3 points. Since the face with 3 points must touch only one cube (according to the given arrangement), this forces that face to be one of the unseen vertical faces. Without loss of generality, let's assume the back face has 3 points. Then, by symmetry and logical deduction: - The face opposite to the face with 3 points should have 1 point. - Indicate the visible faces as follows: If a vertical face which is one of the side faces has 2 points, then the other side face must have 1 point. 3. **Detailed Assignment for Middle Cube**: Assume the same pattern for all top middle cubes. For the top middle cube in the structure, let's now work face by face: - The top face must have 3 points, otherwise, none of the touching conditions will be met. - The front face (facing the observer) must have 2 points. - Therefore, the back face must also have 2 points given the symmetry and the requirement that touching faces must share the same number of points. - The left-most face must then have 1 point throughout the structure. Repeat for the vertical right face. 4. **Determining A, B, and C Faces**: - Front middle cube: Same formation rules apply again. Hence, A must check for the visible faces in the structure. - Now, recall the same must hold for left connecting cubes to validate all aligned responses based on the established cube face rules. - Hence, respectively, faces A = 2 points, face B = 2 points, face C = 3 points, ensuring the consistency. 5. **Verification of Conditions**: To ensure all touching face constraints satisfy and meeting the problem rules, check the elaborate point allocation marked and verify back. **Conclusion**: The faces A, B, and C are allocated, [ text{Face } A = 2 text{ points} ] [ text{Face } B = 2 text{ points} ] [ text{Face } C = 3 text{ points} ] Therefore, the result is correct and all cube formations aligned correctly meeting the set up cubic face constraints.
