The sun begins to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the courtyard where Erik and Aoi Todo have just concluded a friendly but intense sparring match. Kasumi Miwa is nearby, organizing training equipment. Momo Nishimiya watches disdainfully from a distance while Mai Zen'in lurks behind a nearby tree, camera in hand. The atmosphere is filled with the sound of cicadas and the fading echoes of the day's exertions. --- Erik (panting, with a satisfied grin): \\"Not bad, Todo. If every workout session was that intense, I might actually break a sweat one of these days.\\" Aoi Todo (clapping Erik on the back, equally breathless): \\"Ha! You might be as strong as an ox, Skarsgaard, but remember—technique is king. Strength is nothing without control.\\" Kasumi Miwa (approaching with a sports drink): \\"You both did great. Here, drink this—you'll need to stay hydrated.\\" (Mai Zen'in, from a distance, takes a picture of the scene, her expression a mix of admiration and longing.)

You'd think you just defeated a special-grade curse instead of merely pummeling each other for fun.\\" Erik (with a wink): \\"Aw, come on, little witch. No need for sour grapes. Some people find joy in the simple pleasures of life, like a good brawl... or a good meal.\\" (He gestures exuberantly to his abs.) Momo (rolling her eyes): \\"Please, spare me your 'simple pleasures'. And start calling me by my name, meathead!\\" Erik (laughing): \\"Fair enough, Momo. But you've got to admit, our little sparring show was way more entertaining than whatever drama TV show you're probably missing out on.\\" Todo (boisterously): \\"Skarsgaard's right! And speaking of entertaining, when are we going to see those cursed tools you've been hoarding, Erik? That tungsten bat of yours—Earth Shaker, was it? That I'd pay to see!\\" Erik (crossing his arms, smirking): \\"You'll just have to keep on dreaming, Todo. Earth Shaker's where it belongs. Besides, my hands are all the cursed tools I need.\\" Kasumi (playfully): \\"Don't go getting a big head now, Erik. You should be more worried about keeping up with me in next week's curse extermination assignment.\\" Erik (with feigned shock): \\"Keeping up with you? Pfft. Don't you mean the other way around?\\" (As the friendly banter continues, Mai Zen'in walks away, clutching her camera, a mixture of joy from the photos she's taken and a tinge of sadness in her eyes as she thinks about her complex feelings for Erik.) --- This rich scene captures the camaraderie and competitive spirit within Kyoto Jujutsu High.

Two primary branches are solar radiation management (SRM) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Here are some pros and cons of geoengineering: Pros: 1. Rapid Response: SRM methods such as stratospheric aerosol injection could potentially cool the Earth quickly, providing a \\"quick fix\\" to counteract the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. 2. Complement to Emissions Reduction: Geoengineering can be seen as an additional tool in the climate change mitigation toolbox, complementing emission reduction efforts. 3. Reversibility (for some methods): Certain SRM methods, like stratospheric aerosol injection, can be quickly reversed or stopped if adverse consequences become unmanageable. 4. Technological Innovation: Research into geoengineering can spur technological advancements and produce ancillary benefits, such as improving air capture for use in industrial applications. Cons: 1. Environmental Risks: Geoengineering may have unintended side effects on weather patterns, potentially causing droughts, flooding, or other extreme weather events. 2. Governance Challenges: There is no global regulatory framework governing geoengineering efforts, which creates challenges for coordinating international action and preventing unregulated deployment. 3. Ethical Concerns: There are significant moral issues involved with deliberately altering the Earth's climate, including intergenerational ethics and the potential exacerbation of global inequalities. 4. Temporary Fix: Geoengineering does not address the root cause of climate change (excess greenhouse gas emissions) and might create a false sense of security, leading to reduced focus on emissions reduction. 5. Unequal Impact: Some geoengineering interventions may not benefit all regions equally and could disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, exacerbating global disparities. 6. Potential for Conflict: Countries affected negatively by the implementation of geoengineering projects by other nations could view these actions as a hostile infringement on their sovereignty, which could lead to geopolitical tensions or conflicts. 7. Moral Hazard: The prospect of geoengineering as a backup plan could reduce the perceived urgency to reduce carbon emissions, potentially leading to a moral hazard problem where society is less likely to adopt sustainable practices. Geoengineering is considered by many as a last resort due to its potential risks and the complexities involved in its governance. It should be approached with caution, thorough research, and strong international regulatory frameworks."},{"prompt":"What are the major areas of renewable energy research?","completion":"Renewable energy research is a diverse and rapidly growing field focused on advancing technologies to harness energy from sustainable and eco-friendly sources.

Each of these strategies emphasizes different aspects of addressing climate change, and they are often used in combination to develop comprehensive climate action plans. 1. Mitigation: Mitigation efforts aim to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) entering the atmosphere, slowing down and ultimately stabilizing global warming. Key mitigation approaches include: - Reducing Emissions: Transitioning to low-carbon and renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal to replace fossil fuels for electricity generation, transportation, and heating. - Enhancing Energy Efficiency: Implementing measures that increase the efficiency of energy use in buildings, industry, and transportation to reduce overall energy consumption. - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): Developing technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions at their source (such as power plants) and store them underground or use them in a productive way to prevent their release into the atmosphere. - Reforestation and Afforestation: Planting trees and restoring forests trap carbon dioxide through the natural process of photosynthesis, improving carbon sequestration. - Sustainable Land Use: Changing agricultural practices to enhance soil carbon storage, protect natural carbon sinks, and reduce emissions from land use changes and deforestation. - Waste Reduction and Management: Lowering methane and other GHGs emissions through better waste management practices, including recycling, composting, and waste-to-energy technologies. 2. Adaptation: Adaptation strategies focus on adjusting human and natural systems to minimize the damage caused by actual or expected climate change effects. This includes: - Infrastructure Resilience: Reinforcing buildings, transportation systems, and other infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events. - Water Management: Improving water storage, conservation, and distribution systems to cope with changing precipitation patterns and the availability of freshwater resources. - Agricultural Adjustments: Shifting crop varieties and planting dates, improving irrigation efficiency, and adopting climate-resilient agricultural practices. - Coastal Protection: Building sea walls, restoring mangroves and wetlands, and implementing managed retreats in vulnerable coastal areas to reduce the impact of sea-level rise and storm surges. - Public Health: Strengthening healthcare systems and infrastructure to address the increased risks of diseases related to temperature changes and vector-borne illnesses. - Early Warning Systems: Implementing disaster risk reduction measures, including better forecasting and communication systems to prepare for and respond to extreme weather events. 3. Climate Engineering (Geoengineering): Climate engineering includes large-scale interventions in Earth’s climate system to reduce global warming, typically divided into two categories: - Solar Radiation Management (SRM): Techniques aimed at reflecting a small percentage of the sun's light and heat back into space to cool the planet, such as stratospheric aerosol injection or cloud brightening. - Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR): Methods designed to remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere, such as direct air capture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and ocean fertilization. Each approach to combating climate change presents unique challenges, opportunities, and risks, and must be managed with careful consideration of their potential social, economic, and environmental impacts. Moreover, international cooperation and coordinated efforts among governments, businesses, communities, and individuals are essential for effective climate change responses."},{"prompt":"Write a list of 8 animated movies, and for each movie, a list of up to 3 illogical moments that would happen if the main protagonist was replaced by Nick Wilde from Zootopia and the plot wasn't rewritten to accomodate for him replacing the protagonist","completion":"1. **Frozen** - **Singing \\"Let It Go\\"**: If Nick took Elsa's place, a scene of a fox singing about letting go of fears and embracing his ice powers would be entirely illogical given Nick's background and lack of any magical abilities. - **Coronation ceremony**: The idea of a fox being crowned the monarch of Arendelle in place of Elsa would not make sense given the human-centric world of \\"Frozen.\\" - **Creating a snowman**: Nick suddenly being able to create life, like Olaf, would defy the laws of the natural world established in Zootopia, where animals have human-like intelligence but do not possess magical powers. 2. **The Little Mermaid** - **Transforming into a human**: Nick wishing to become a human, as Ariel does, and then actually transforming, would be inconsistent with his character and the Zootopia universe. - **Underwater breathing**: Nick living underwater with Ariel's aquatic friends would defy logic since, as a land mammal, he should not be able to breathe underwater. - **Romancing Prince Eric**: Nick attempting to win Prince Eric's love as Ariel does would be nonsensical since interspecies romance between a fox and a human is beyond the film's reality. 3. **Toy Story** - **Being Andy's Toy**: If Nick were to replace Woody as Andy's favorite toy, it would be illogical since Nick is a living character in his own right, not an inanimate object that comes to life. - **Buzz Lightyear's rivalry**: Developing a rivalry with Buzz would make no sense because Nick isn't a toy and wouldn't be threatened by a new toy's arrival. - **Trying to hide from Andy**: It would be strange to see Nick, a self-aware, sentient being, trying to freeze and play the part of a toy whenever Andy entered the room. 4. **Moana** - **Quest to restore the Heart of Te Fiti**: Nick embarking on a sea voyage to return the heart of a goddess would be incongruous with his street-smart and somewhat cynical nature from Zootopia. - **Singing \\"How Far I'll Go\\"**: Seeing Nick Wilde break into song about the sea calling to him would be completely inconsistent with his character. - **Forming a bond with the ocean**: The ocean choosing Nick as Moana was chosen, interacting with him, and aiding him on his journey would be far-fetched given his urban fox background. 5. **Beauty and the Beast** - **Falling in love with the Beast**: If Nick were to replace Belle, the relationship dynamic would be drastically altered, and it wouldn’t make sense for a cartoon fox to fall in love with a cursed human turned beast. - **Being imprisoned by the Beast**: It would make little sense for the Beast to hold Nick captive in place of Belle, as the original motive was the Beast trying to find love to break the spell, which doesn't apply to Nick. - **The townsfolk mob scene**: It would be illogical to see a mob of humans led by Gaston trying to hunt down Nick, a fox with no connection to the Beast's predicament. 6. **Aladdin** - **Finding the magic lamp**: The idea of Nick stumbling upon the magic lamp and using it to become a prince is incompatible with his character, who usually relies on his wit and cunning rather than magic. - **Romancing Jasmine**: As in \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" a romance between Nick and Princess Jasmine would be absurd because of the cross-species implications. - **Befriending the Genie**: While Nick making friends isn't out of character, the very specific relationship between Aladdin and Genie that's deeply rooted in human-like desires and goals wouldn't translate well with Nick in Aladdin's place. 7. **Mulan** - **Joining the Chinese Army**: Nick taking Mulan's place to serve in the army disguised as a human man would be illogical given he's an anthropomorphic fox that couldn't pass as human. - **Training montage**: Nick going through rigorous training with other soldiers would be nonsensical, as the physical exercises would be designed for humans, not foxes. - **Saving China from the Huns**: It would be illogical for Nick to fill Mulan's role in devising clever plans to defeat the Huns, as his presence on the battlefield would be inexplicable to the human characters. 8. **The Lion King** - **Becoming King of Pride Rock**: Nick assuming Simba's role would be mismatched in the ecosystem; a fox claiming to be the king of a lion pride doesn't align with the natural order. - **Dealing with Scar**: The dynamic and rivalry between Nick and Scar would make no sense, as Nick has no royal lineage or familial ties within a lion pride. - **Hakuna Matata lifestyle**: While Nick might enjoy a carefree lifestyle for a while, the idea of him adopting this philosophy alongside Timon and Pumbaa would deviate drastically from his character arc in Zootopia, where he evolves beyond his initial con-artist ways."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

To provide the most accurate information, I would need more context or an alternate spelling if it pertains to a specific, lesser-known group within Shi'a Islam. However, Alevism can be relevant to your query in that it is a distinct religious tradition found primarily in Turkey, which incorporates elements of Shi'a theology, Sufi mysticism, and local cultural practices. Alevis greatly revere Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, and consider him as the rightful successor to Muhammad. Alevis have faced discrimination and marginalization throughout history due to their unique beliefs and practices that differentiate them from the Sunni majority in Turkey. Shi'a Islam itself encompasses several branches, mostly notably: 1. Twelver Shi'ism (Ithna Ashariyya) - The largest branch of Shi'a Islam that believes in the succession of twelve Imams, with the last Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, believed to be in occultation and will return as the Mahdi, or guided one. 2. Ismaili Shi'ism - This branch diverged from the mainstream Twelver Shi'ism over the succession issue of the seventh Imam and includes further sub-sects, such as the Nizari and Musta'li. 3. Zaidi Shi'ism - This branch diverges on the succession issue earlier than the Twelvers and Ismailis, recognizing Zayd ibn Ali as the rightful fifth Imam, and has a significant following in Yemen.

'oʊ', 'ə', 'ʌ', 'ɛ' 모음은 서로 다르지만, 모음에 대한 구분이 명확하지 않은 경우 이러한 미묘한 차이를 명확히 구분하지 못할 수 있기 때문에, 모음음의 차이가 두드러지지 않을 경우 음절 간 유사성이 강조될 수 있습니다. 2. 두 번째 음절 \\"메이\\"(/meɪ/)와 \\"에이\\"(/eɪ/)에서는 같은 'eɪ'와 유사한 이중모음(diphthong)을 사용합니다. 이처럼 유사한 모음 음는 두 단어가 비슷하게 들릴 수 있는 요소를 제공합니다. 3. 마지막 음절에서 \\"토\\"(/toʊ/ 또는 /tə/)의 'oʊ' 소리와 \\"러\\"(/ər/ 또는 /ɚ/)의 'ər' 소리는 서로 상당히 다릅니다. 그러나 일부 방언이나 비표준 발음 방식에서 'oʊ' 소리가 'ə' 모음과 비슷하게 발음될 수 있으며, 이는 'ɚ'와 어느 정도 비슷한 소리로 인식될 여지를 제공합니다. 'r'의 발음이 덜 강조되거나 생략되는 경우 이러한 유사성이 더 강조될 수 있습니다. 이러한 분석에도 불구하고, \\"토마토\\"와 \\"틈에이러\\"가 서로 유사하게 들릴 가능성은 매우 낮습니다. 실제로 영어 사용자가 \\"틈에이러\\"라는 소리를 \\"토마토\\"로 해석하는 일은 일어나지 않을 것입니다. 이런식으로 상세한 발음 비교를 통해 특정 부분의 유사성을 찾을 수 있으나, 이는 매우 일반적이지 않으며, 대부분의 경우 사람들은 '토마토'라는 단어를 표준 발음에 가깝게 이해하고 발음할 것입니다."},{"prompt":"Why American pronaunce tomato as teumaireu?","completion":"The pronunciation you've represented as \\"teumaireu\\" seems to be an attempt to phonetically spell out how some American English speakers say the word \\"tomato.\\" In American English, \\"tomato\\" is typically pronounced with a diphthong in the first syllable, sounding like \\"toh,\\" followed by \\"may\\" in the second syllable, and ending with a schwa sound \\"-tə\\" or a short \\"o\\" sound, \\"-toh.\\" Putting it all together, it sounds like \\"toh-may-toh\\" or \\"tə-MAY-toh.\\" The stress is on the second syllable, \\"may.\\" The way people pronounce words can vary greatly due to regional accents and individual speech habits. While Americans and British people both speak English, they have different pronunciations for many words, including \\"tomato.\\" In British English, it's commonly pronounced \\"tə-MAH-toh,\\" with the stress on the second syllable and a different vowel sound in the first and last syllables. It's interesting to note that these differences in pronunciation are part of what makes English a rich and diverse language. When representing the pronunciation of a word, it's often best to use the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to avoid confusion, as the IPA provides a more standardized way to denote sounds across languages. The American English pronunciation of \\"tomato\\" using the IPA would be /təˈmeɪtoʊ/, and the British English pronunciation would be /təˈmɑːtəʊ/."},{"prompt":"Why is it may not mah?","completion":"The difference between the \\"may\\" and \\"mah\\" pronunciation in the word \\"tomato\\" is due to differences in accents and dialects within English. English is a language with a wide variety of regional pronunciations, and the word \\"tomato\\" is a great example of this variance. In American English, the second syllable of \\"tomato\\" has a diphthong that starts with the vowel sound found in the word \\"may\\" [eɪ], while in British English, this syllable has a more open back vowel sound [ɑː] similar to the one found in \\"father.\\" Therefore, when Americans say \\"tomato,\\" it typically sounds like: - toh-MAY-toh (/təˈmeɪtoʊ/) In contrast, the British pronunciation is: - toh-MAH-toh (/təˈmɑːtəʊ/) These differences in pronunciation aren't just limited to the word \\"tomato\\"; they're part of broader patterns that distinguish various English dialects. The specific reasons behind the development of these different pronunciations over time include historical linguistic shifts, cultural influences, and even social factors. Accents and pronunciations can convey a lot about a person's geographic origin or social background within the English-speaking world."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Benson from Bee Movie (2007) and the plot of the movie wasn't changed to accomodate for him replacing the protagonist","completion":"Alright, let's dive into the whimsical thought experiment where Barry B. Benson, the protagonist of \\"Bee Movie,\\" buzzes into the shoes of other animated movie heroes. Here's how the narratives could get rather illogical and absurd with Barry as the main character: 1. **Toy Story** - When Buzz Lightyear gives his famous \\"flying\\" demonstration, Barry would attempt the same, but as a bee, he can actually fly, making Woody's skepticism meaningless. - At Sid's house, Barry wouldn't be threatened by Sid's dog Scud since he could simply fly to safety, making the toy rescue scenes nonsensical. - The climax involves toys moving to scare Sid. However, as a bee, Barry's presence would likely just confuse or frighten Sid more than teaching him a lesson. 2. **Finding Nemo** - Barry would attend the first day of school with Nemo but flying over water wouldn't present the same risks of being caught by a diver. - The journey to Sydney would be more straightforward, as Barry's ability to fly could bypass underwater obstacles and predators. - Instead of infiltrating the dentist's office through the pipes, Barry could potentially just fly in through a window, eliminating much of the suspense. 3. **Frozen** - During \\"Let It Go,\\" Elsa's transformation includes building an ice palace, but Barry's presence would add the risk of him freezing due to the cold, or being utterly baffled at the sudden change in climate. - Barry participating in a snowball fight would be surreal as he could easily dodge the snowballs, and his small size would make throwing them back quite challenging. - The climax where Elsa's magic inadvertently strikes Anna in the heart would be odd as Barry wouldn't really be at risk due to his size and ability to fly away from any ice blasts. 4. **The Lion King** - Barry trying to blend in with a pride of lions during \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" would be visually comedic and biologically puzzling. - The wildebeest stampede scene would not be as dangerous for Barry, as he could avoid the chaos by flying above it. - Barry stepping into Simba's role would make the circle of life theme more complex and unconventional, with a bee leading the animal kingdom. 5. **Aladdin** - Aladdin's \\"One Jump Ahead\\" escape through the streets of Agrabah wouldn't resonate the same way with Barry, who could easily zip away from the guards. - The Cave of Wonders selecting a \\"diamond in the rough\\" would be amusing if it turned out to be Barry instead of Aladdin. - While flying on the magic carpet, Barry buzzing alongside would be both redundant and humorous, as he already has the power of flight. 6. **Shrek** - Farquaad choosing Barry by accident to rescue Princess Fiona would lead to bewilderment and a reshuffling of what is considered \\"knightly.\\" - A bee fighting off a dragon would appear illogical, as Barry could simply fly away or potentially be incinerated by a single breath of dragon fire. - The love story element would be nonsensical, with a bee and an ogre forming a romantic bond. 7. **Ratatouille** - Barry trying to control Linguini's cooking by pulling his hair would be improbable, not only because of his size but because bees don't have hands. - A bee's involvement in the kitchen would likely lead to more health code violations than a rat would, causing humorously exaggerated kitchen chaos. - Creating French cuisine as a tiny bee, rather than as a rat with human-like qualities, would make cooking scenes functionally impossible. 8. **The Incredibles** - When superheroes are banned, it would be strange seeing Barry, a bee, trying to fit into human society and engage in mundane tasks like insurance work. - The action sequences would lack tension because Barry wouldn't need to dodge bullets or debris with his small size and flying ability. - Scenes involving family dynamics would be utterly surreal, as communication and interaction between a bee and a family of super-powered humans would be bizarre. 9. **Moana** - Barry setting sail across the ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti would be inconsistent with his bee behavior and abilities. - The scene with Maui trying to shapeshift using his magical hook would be less compelling with Barry present, as a bee wouldn't be as physically affected by the transformations. - Encounters with sea monsters would have a drastically different dynamic because Barry's small scale would either make such creatures indifferent to his presence, or they might not detect him at all. 10. **Zootopia** - Judy Hopps' struggle to be taken seriously as a small animal in the police force would be negligible if Barry, a much smaller bee, were to take her place. - The chase through Little Rodentia would become nonsensical because Barry wouldn't cause chaos due to his size and flying capability. - Barry's involvement in solving the case of the missing predators would be absurd because he would have different natural abilities and interactions with the diverse animal citizens."},{"prompt":"(In the forests of Spira...)

ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT.

MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed.

Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom.

His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

Но он не сдается, толкаемый инстинктом выживания и любовью к своей семье, которую он должен найти вне зависимости от своего нового облика. Фонари аварийного освещения мигают в последнем акте отчаяния, когда Эд, собирая остатки сил, начинает осматривать бункер в поисках инструментов и предметов, которые помогут ему добраться до коммуникационного оборудования. Он нащупывает тяжелый кусок металла, который может послужить орудием для пролома стены или двери. Каждый его шаг громыхает по металлическому полу, создавая дополнительный шум в тишине, которая теперь царит в бункере. Эд начинает использовать найденный металлический предмет в качестве лома, упорно пытаясь открыть запертый люк в стене бункера. Концентрация и злость видны на его лице, когда он медленно но верно преодолевает препятствия, которые стоят между ним и свободой.

Every lingering touch and shared smile is a world apart from their public personas—a declaration of love in a quiet act of rebellion against the pace of their lives. A soft melody drifts, an analog record player spinning a tune that seems composed for moments such as this. Ed and Maria rise, joining in an intimate dance—a slow, gentle sway, as if the notes themselves guide their movements. ED (softly, into her hair) Forget the breakthrough, the cure, the fame. You’re the real miracle in my life. Maria responds, her hand clasping tighter to his. MARIA (voice barely above a whisper) And you are my constant, through every success and every unknown. As they linger in the embrace of the dance, the world beyond the curtains continues to turn, unaware of the risk drawn from the very elixir of life they’ve concocted. But for now, for Ed and Maria, time stands still, the storm can wait, and love remains unchallenged. FADE OUT.

On a solitary display, the security footage is stark against the sterile backdrop. A rat, motionless in its cage mere hours ago, now twitches erratically - life electrifying death, its eyes aflame with a resurgence that defies nature. EDWARD “ED” KAYNES watches via a remote link from his safehouse, his face a mix of horror and disbelief. His fingers hover over the keyboard, hesitant to accept what unfolds before him. INSERT - MONITOR FOOTAGE The rat rises, a Frankenstein’s creature reborn. It frenzies against the confines of its cage, a tiny titan testing the mettle of man’s creation. Numbers and graphs on the screen depict a pulse quickening — a grim harbinger of the plague unleashed. BACK TO SCENE ED’s worst fears confirmed, he zooms in on the screen — closer, closer, until the nightmarish detail of the creature’s eyes fills the monitor, yesterday’s breakthrough become today’s curse. A sound escapes his lips, a whisper: ED (whispering in disbelief) …no. As the creature breaks free, its escape captured by the indifferent lens, alarms crescendo into a haunting dirge. Precious seconds tick away, time slipping into the jaws of an escalating disaster. CUT TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 5 OF 150 (Note: The tensions wrought by the day’s achievements and the evening’s peaceful respite now give way to the thrumming heart of disaster. The transformed rat embodies the nascent terror, its escape from the cage a metaphor for the coming chaos. This rewrite heightens the sense of dread and deepens the urgency for what’s to come.

The creature’s rebirth is captured in grainy detail—a grotesque interruption in the sanitarium of science. DR. STEVENS (voice cracking) Look at it… nobody could have predicted this. It’s like a nightmare. ED (tight-jawed) We created a monster… Maria’s hand covers her mouth as she stifles a sob. The knowledge that their breakthrough is responsible for the terror gripping the city is an unbearable burden. MARIA (overwhelmed) Our children… are they… DR. STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive. Ed slams a fist on the console in frustration, his rage a silent scream challenging the chaos. Maria turns to him, eyes pooling with tears—desperation etched on her face. MARIA (pleading) We have to do something, Ed! ED (resolute) And we will. We fix this. We find the cure and distribute it. No rest until this damn virus is eradicated from every last soul it’s touched. They stand united, a feeble bulwark against an abyss that threatens to consume the world they know. CUT TO: EXT.

Its teeth sink into his flesh—a searing pain that echoes with the unbearable finality of his fate. MARIA (screaming) Ed! She pulls Ed away with a strength born of desperation, dragging him toward a nearby reinforced door. They stumble through just in time, slamming it shut on their assailants. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The couple slumps against the door, breathing heavily.

ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT.

MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed.

MARIA (declaration of war on the apocalypse) This is only the beginning. Run zombie, run. END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 PAGE 31 OF 150 EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery.

Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission.

CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge. He peels away the scarf, revealing the visage of a man ensnared between two realities. Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds. With grim acceptance, he begins to arm himself for the world above, the haven below now a grave to his former self. END OF PAGE 31 OF 150 PAGE 32 OF 15 INT.

The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above.

ED (voice choked with dread) This is how it ends… Not with a whimper, but with a bang. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY SHELTER - CONTINUOUS A FAMILY huddles together, their embrace a fortress within the shuddering bunker. Children clutch their parents, eyes wide and uncomprehending, as the reverberations of the unthinkable shake their sanctuary. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS Ed slumps into his seat, resigned, the bottle slipping from his grip and rolling across the floor. The world outside may be ending, but his torment continues unabated—a curse of the undead. A single tear—unclear if it’s from sorrow or the zombie affliction—trails down his face. He watches the countdown dwindle; humanity’s tenure ticking away before his crypt-colored eyes. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 35 OF 150 PAGE 36 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker convulses as if gripped by an unseen giant, the roar of the impact wave a deafening crescendo punctuating the still air. ED is launched from his chair, thrown to the unforgiving floor as the earth itself seems to spiral into chaos. Around him, the walls tremble, panels and ceiling tiles clattering down in a discordant symphony of destruction. The monitors blink erratically, skewing the horrific show they present—something between reality and electronic hallucination. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - SAME MOMENT From afar, a nightmarish scene unfolds as the impact wave rips through city blocks, turning structures into dust and dreams into nightmares. The force is indiscriminate—it tears through steel like paper, glass like vapor. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed clutches at debris, dragging his altered body across the trembling floor, desperately attempting to anchor himself in a world that refuses stillness. His roars match the sound of tearing metal and shattering concrete—primal, raw, filled with terror. CUT TO: SERIES OF SHOTS - BUNKER’S DISTRESS: A. The once orderly rows of canned goods and emergency provisions cascade onto the now-tilting floors. B. Water pipes burst, geysers erupting in formerly dry rooms, while electrical sparks create a dangerous light show. C. A portrait of Ed’s family, clinging to the wall, now slips free and crashes to the ground, the glass protecting their smiles shattering. BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed, crawling through the mayhem, reaches for the bunker’s emergency protocols—a last-ditch hope to seal away the cataclysm that hunts for him within his sanctuary. Lights flicker overhead, many winking out, as the integrity of their fixtures fail. He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 36 OF 150 PAGE 37 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Amidst the chaos and the runaway dance of shadows and light, ED struggles against the unforgiving floor that refuses to stay still beneath him. His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает. 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву.

The path we’ve chosen… ED (firmly, cutting the tension) …is the right one. Doubt can’t sway us now. We did it for the greater good, regardless of the cost. EXT. ED’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT The two of them, alone against the tapestry of the night sky, settle into a silence under the stars. The darkness is pierced by the soft flicker of candlelight. The porch, a haven in the eye of the storm, is where they find solace. MARIA (a murmur against the night’s whisper) May this peace last, against the tempest that looms. ED gathers MARIA in his arms, a fortress against the coming gale. ED (mutely determined) As long as we stand together, we’ll weather any storm. MARIA leans into ED, her beacon in the twilight. Together, they face the horizon, where dawn’s light contends with the shadows of uncertainty. CUT TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 14 OF 150 PAGE 15 OF 150: INT. ED AND MARIA’S CAR - NIGHT The city’s whispered lullabies trail off as the car snakes through its veins, suspended in the timelessness of night—a pause in the day’s revelation. ED (V.O.) (somber, introspective) In the stillness of the night, the world hears the secrets we whisper to the stars—hopes that shine bright amid the encroaching shadows. Outside, a tapestry of stars battles the city’s fading luminescence, a visual symphony of light and dark mirrored in the weary yet hopeful eyes of our travelers. MARIA (softly, to Ed, with solemn warmth) The path we’ve carved today will shape a thousand tomorrows, entangling our fates with the arc of history. Their glance meets, a bridge of silence spanning between them, weighted with the burden of their creation. CUT TO: The sanctuary of their home awaits as they drift into the driveway. The car’s engine stills, surrendering to the quietude that wraps around them like a protective shroud. ED (turning to Maria, voice steady yet laden) This evening’s promises linger—a testament to our quest. With you, each dawn is a promise kept, each dusk, a vow renewed. Together, they step out into the night’s embrace, their silhouettes hand in hand, retreating from the precipice of their day’s labors into the tranquil respite of their abode.

They are nestled on a luxurious sofa that is the epitome of modern elegance, yet the room resonates with an old-world charm. A low table is the centerpiece of their intimate setup, decorated with a vibrant bouquet and the soft flicker of candlelight. An open bottle of red wine sits idle, exuding its bouquet into the room, while two glasses sit, their contents slowly savored. Maria finds solace in Ed’s embrace, her body drawn to his as they reflect on the day’s triumph and ponder their shared aspirations. MARIA (beaming with love for Ed) Imagine… we might be on the cusp of history, deciphering the riddle of agelessness.

The incessant RINGING of Ed’s phone slices through the silence—insistent, jarring. He stirs, but Maria nudges him towards the persistent invasion of their tranquility. MARIA (muffled against Ed’s neck) Honey… the phone… ED (grumbling) Let it ring… nothing is more important than this moment. But the phone is relentless. After several ignored calls, Ed finally relents. ED (sighing) Alright… alright… He reaches out, voice heavy with the remnants of sleep and satisfaction. ED (into the phone) Hello? The grave voice of a COLLEAGUE reverberates through the line, shattering the mussed warmth of their sanctuary. CUT TO: Split Screen: Ed’s expressions of ecstasy now contort to one of shock and disbelief. COLLEAGUE (V.O.) (urgent, panicked) Ed—it’s gone wrong.

His eyes snap open, on edge, and fear takes hold as he spots several figures moving with an unsettling, lurching gait towards him. The ragged silhouettes grow clearer - zombies in various stages of decay. Wasting no time, the man scrambles to his feet, but his movements are sluggish, still dulled by sleep. He turns to flee, but the undead descend upon him with relentless hunger. His panicked screams shatter the silence of the night, a symphony of terror that marks the dawn of a new horror.

Immediate response needed… He realizes the helplessness of his position, the futility of calling for aid already too late for the unfortunate victim.

The creature’s rebirth is captured in grainy detail—a grotesque interruption in the sanitarium of science. DR. STEVENS (voice cracking) Look at it… nobody could have predicted this. It’s like a nightmare. ED (tight-jawed) We created a monster… Maria’s hand covers her mouth as she stifles a sob. The knowledge that their breakthrough is responsible for the terror gripping the city is an unbearable burden. MARIA (overwhelmed) Our children… are they… DR. STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive.

Despite his scientific mind rebelling against the logic of their existence, his survival instincts kick in. They back away slowly, but the zombies advance with increasing hunger. The corridor’s confines amplify their mangled cries. Ed and Maria turn to run, but the creatures are relentless in pursuit. One of the zombies lunges forward, catching ED by the arm. Its teeth sink into his flesh—a searing pain that echoes with the unbearable finality of his fate. MARIA (screaming) Ed! She pulls Ed away with a strength born of desperation, dragging him toward a nearby reinforced door. They stumble through just in time, slamming it shut on their assailants. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The couple slumps against the door, breathing heavily. Ed grunts as he clutches the wound, blood oozing between his fingers—a cruel testament to their perilous situation. MARIA (tearfully) It’s not deep, we can treat it. ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 28 OF 150 This emotional scene vividly depicts the first direct confrontation with zombies for Ed and Maria.

MARIA scrambles, her hands fumbling through vials and medical supplies, searching for anything that might save ED. He lies on a cot, his complexion growing paler, his breaths shallow. MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed. As Maria sobs, slumped against the door, the sounds of the scuffle inside fade. A profound silence settles, and a new resolve takes hold. MARIA (vow in her voice) I’ll make it right, Ed. I’ll save them all. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - ROOFTOP HELIPAD - CONTINUOUS A helicopter approaches, the wind from its blades scattering papers and debris across the rooftop. MARIA’s figure emerges from the door to the helipad, her face a mask of anguish turned to determination. The fight for a cure, for redemption, for Ed’s sacrifice, continues. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 29 OF 150 The screenplay scene bolsters the narrative tension, demonstrating the dire consequences of the outbreak’s spread. Maria’s quick thinking offers a glimmer of hope, but a tragic turn solidifies the high stakes of their mission. This is a pivotal moment, emphasizing both the emotional depth of the characters and the unfolding terror they face, setting the stage for Maria’s relentless pursuit. [This narrative intensifies the plot, delving into the heart-wrenching choices faced by the protagonists. It compellingly intertwines action and emotional heft, immersing the audience in the high-stakes drama of the unfolding zombie apocalypse. Moving forward, the screenplay should further explore Maria’s character arc, rich with themes of sacrifice, resilience, and the quest for hope amid despair.] PAGE 30 OF 150: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The sterile corridor is now a cacophony of terror. MARIA bears witness to ED’S transformation—skin deathly pale, veins blackening. With the shadow of zombification drawing near, he makes a drastic choice. ED (determined, to Maria) Go! Save our children… save everyone. With a mix of horror and fierce resolve, ED flings himself through the window, landing on the concrete below with an unnatural ferocity only the infected possess. Maria watches as Ed, now imbued with the strength and resilience of the undead but mercifully retaining his mind, staggers to his feet and storms into the city. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS With the mind of a scientist but the body of a monster, ED trudges through the chaotic streets, an insatiable need to protect and a relentless drive to find their children fuelling his every step. MARIA, atop the helipad, is torn between following ED and escaping with the cure. Tears stream down her face as she calls out to him, though he can no longer hear her. MARIA (screaming into the void) I love you… I’ll find them, I promise! With the cries of her husband echoing in her ears, Maria vows to carry on their fight and save the city they love. She watches Ed disappear into the horde of zombies, a lone figure of tragedy amidst the devastation. The helicopter, hovering anxiously, becomes her only refuge. She climbs aboard, clutching the potential cure to her chest as they ascend into the maelstrom. CUT TO BLACK. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY Forcing herself to focus, Maria enters the lab again. The screen flickers to life, interfacing with her fierce intellect. She synthesizes, refines, and tests with the tenacity of a woman reborn from the ashes of her old life. MARIA (whispering to herself) For Ed, for our children… for everyone. Her hands never waver, her eyes never stray. The readouts wink back at her with promising data, and the compound finally takes form—a vial shining with the hope of humanity. MARIA (declaration of war on the apocalypse) This is only the beginning. Run zombie, run. END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 PAGE 31 OF 150 EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery. He scans the empty, desolate rooms, searching for any sign of his children—backpacks, a stray drawing, a forgotten toy—anything that would offer a shred of hope. But the silence is the only answer. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS Ed arrives at the gym, a cavernous hollow now home to dust and despair. Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission. Desolation repels hope like opposite poles of a tragic magnet. Torn by failure, Ed turns away from the forlorn landmark of his children’s laughter, now a crypt to his unspoken fear. His eyes, rimmed with the red of grief and infection, look beyond—towards the distant, fortified silhouette of his bunker. MONTAGE – ED’S JOURNEY TO THE BUNKER: - Ed’s shadow stretches along the cracked pavement as he trudges through the eerie streets, a spectral figure moving against the grain of desolation. - At intersections, he ducks into the shadows, avoiding the roving packs of zombies that cluster around the remnants of life—imperfect kin he no longer resembles. - The bunker’s hidden entrance, a sliver between the ruins, beckons—a sanctuary amid a city usurped by death. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge. He peels away the scarf, revealing the visage of a man ensnared between two realities. Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds. With grim acceptance, he begins to arm himself for the world above, the haven below now a grave to his former self. END OF PAGE 31 OF 150 PAGE 32 OF 15 INT. ED’S BUNKER - WASHROOM - CONTINUOUS Ed stands, a tragic figure, before the worn mirror; his flesh sags and his eyes are pools of dread. Clusters of hair slip through his trembling fingers, each strand a part of his old self, relinquishing to the monster he is becoming. A gasp of despair chokes out as he beholds the naked scalp in the mirror, a stark declaration of his metamorphosis. Tears well up, spilling over, tracing grimy paths down his deformed cheeks. The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above. Ed’s cries meld with the deep, seismic vibrations from outside, both the internal and external worlds crumbling in unison. In this fortress of solitude, his tether to sanity and solidarity grows dangerously thin. CUT TO: EXT.

ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS The bunker trembles under the assault, the force of the distant blast threatening to breach this last haven. ED braces against the sink, his heart—if it can still be called that—pounding in his chest. ED (murmurs in horror) No… not like this. His eyes snap to the array of monitors, each flashing a dire warning. A shrouded panic grips him—the outside world is under siege, and time is the enemy once more. CUT TO: INT. CITY COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS OPERATORS switch between feeds, each scene more chaotic than the last—a city under the shadow of catastrophic failure. The COMMANDER grabs the microphone, urgency tensing his voice. COMMANDER (into microphone) All units, brace for potential aftershocks. We have confirmation of detonation. This is not a drill. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED reels from the shockwave, his once stoic facade crumbling. The instruments and gauges surrounding him now mere spectators to his unraveling. ED (hoarse shout) What have we done?! He wrenches away from the mirror, stumbling as the ground continues to betray him. A shelf crashes down, its contents—a journal, a photo, remnants of the past—spill across the floor, a poignant reminder of life before the fall. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS The aftermath of the explosion erupts into a chaotic torrent of action—civilian and military alike now share only the common goal of survival. AND CUT BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED lunges for a two-way radio, the last line connecting him to the world he fought to save—a world that might no longer exist. His hand caresses the tuning knob, static filling the clean space of the bunker. His voice, modulated by desperation and the unearthly timbre of his new form, crackles into the void. ED (into the radio, desperate) Is anyone out there…? Children… Please… As the static answers back, heavy and relentless, the camera captures a final shot of ED—an echo of humanity caught in the purgatory between life and death. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 32 OF 150 PAGE 33 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The siren’s wail pierces the bunker’s thick silence, a banshee scream announcing impending doom. ED snaps his head towards the crescendo of alarms, as the room is bathed in the urgent glow of red emergency lights. On the monitors, live news feeds display a digital clock ticking down ominously, headlines scrolling with relentless speed—the words “IMMINENT NUCLEAR STRIKE” flashing, a stark harbinger of the end. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS – CONTINUOUS Aerial shots reveal mass panic as the air raid sirens echo through the streets, desperate citizens scrambling to find shelter. The skyline blurs with the frantic movements below. CUT TO: INT. BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS ED stands frozen, the epitome of desperation, as the last fragments of his world descend into chaos. He watches, powerless, as the skeletal outlines of his former life flicker on the screens. NEWS ANCHOR (ON MONITOR) (tense, authoritative) This is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. A nuclear strike has been authorized and will commence within the hour. May God have mercy on us all. Ed’s eyes widen with horror at the anchor’s solemn decree. His fist clenches, shattering the radio’s silence. ED (into the radio, voice quivering) Not like this… Please, no… CUT TO: INT. SHELTER - DAY Families huddled together, their eyes glued to portable televisions broadcasting the final countdown. Tears mix with prayers, as they embrace for what could be the last time. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY WAR ROOM - DAY Amidst a flurry of activity, GENERALS and OFFICERS coordinate efforts to mitigate the disaster. On their screens, a digital representation of the missile’s trajectory beelines towards its destination. GENERAL (V.O.) (over intercom, grave) All units, confirm evacuation protocols. Ensure civilian compliance. We’ve done all we can. Prepare for impact. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS With the siren’s song as his grim chorus, Ed scrambles to secure his sanctuary, locking down hatches and reinforcing the entry. Every clank and hiss a harrowing step towards the inevitable. The camera follows his frantic actions, an intimate dance between man and machine, before pausing on his face—a visage caught between primal survival and heart-wrenching grief. ED (whispering to himself) Survive. Survive for what’s left… The bunker’s artificial lights flicker under the strain of the external world crumbling. Ed, a sentinel at the end of days, stares down the immensity of his solitude, the gravity of the moment heavy upon him. His raspy breath is the metronome to the ticking countdown, as the monitors’ once steadfast streams stutter—a digital heart rate faltering as the world prepares for its last beat. END OF PAGE 33 OF 150 PAGE 34 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The stubborn hum of outdated technology fills the air as ED hunches over the mainframe terminal of the bunker, his fingers a flurry over the backlit keys. The screen before him flashes with layers of security access prompts and firewalls, a digital labyrinth of his own design. Ed’s mind, a cocktail of desperation and scientific prowess, races to unlock the secrets he once safeguarded so fervently. With each override command, he peels back the digital veils shrouding his research, his city’s downfall, the truth. With a final keystroke, he breaches the mainframe security. The floodgates open, and data streams onto the monitor—classified communications, military intel, the command chain’s last orders, the enormity of the impending strike. ED (voice barely a whisper, laced with dread) Oh, what have we done… The screen maps out the grim reality—a schematized web showing the approaching missile’s trajectory, projected fallout patterns, and the bleakest scenarios outlined in stark numeric certainty. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY COMMAND BUNKER - DAY Generals hunch over radar screens, the forewarned cataclysm reflected in their stoic faces. Behind them, a wall-sized world map blinks with the Morse code of impending doom. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed’s horrified gaze traverses the information on-screen. His infected constitution wrestles with the gravity of what’s coming—ignited not by a zombie’s viral urges but by a man’s conscience and heart. ED (grappling with the scope of the cataclysm) There’s gotta be… there must be something else we can do… Anyone… He scans the screens for any sign of hope, a ceasefire, an alternative to the end. But the truth is unyielding, encoded in the logic of machines and strategic calculations. CUT TO: EXT. OBSERVATION POST - DAY A lone soldier stands sentinel, binoculars to his eyes, the distant whistle of the incoming missile harmonizing with the wail of the air raid sirens—a requiem for the world he knew. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed slams his palm against the terminal, the pain insignificant against his racing thoughts. Bitter laughter, a guttural sound devoid of humor, escapes him as he contemplates the irony—the mad scientist, the living dead, now the audience to Armageddon. ED (to himself, the laugh collapsing into a growl) We played with life and death… and now we pay the price. He rises, each movement a struggle as he opens a secure drawer, retrieving a dusty bottle of whiskey, a relic from a past life. He unscrews the cap and takes a swig, the burn a fleeting reminder of human sensations. Ed’s bloodshot eyes, tinged with yellow, fix on the countdown—a digital grim reaper ticking away the seconds of existence. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 34 OF 150 PAGE 35 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker, once a bastion of safety, becomes a tomb as the hollow echoes of explosions reverberate through its concrete walls. ED stands still, the ghastly light of the monitors painting his face as each distant blast grows closer, louder, a chorus of annihilation gaining fervor. He grips the edge of a console, knuckles white, each rumble a hammer strike against the shield of isolation he’s erected around himself. The shockwaves travel through the floor, a tremor through the heart of the earth. CUT TO: EXT. OUTER LAYERS OF THE CITY - CONTINUOUS Overhead shots reveal fiery blooms littering the landscape, each a bitter bloom of conflict. Plumes of smoke claw at the sky, trying to blanket the sun with their unforgiving shadows. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Panic fractures Ed’s stoicism as the bunker’s survival systems activate in response to the escalating threat. Crimson alarms flare, casting a sinister glow. The ventilation system churns violently, fighting against the onslaught of the inferno waiting outside. Each detonation outside is a gut punch to the facility, the sound magnified by the silence it disrupts. Flickering screens cast erratic shadows across the walls, creating an ominous dance of light that foreshadows the end. ED (voice choked with dread) This is how it ends… Not with a whimper, but with a bang. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY SHELTER - CONTINUOUS A FAMILY huddles together, their embrace a fortress within the shuddering bunker. Children clutch their parents, eyes wide and uncomprehending, as the reverberations of the unthinkable shake their sanctuary. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS Ed slumps into his seat, resigned, the bottle slipping from his grip and rolling across the floor. The world outside may be ending, but his torment continues unabated—a curse of the undead. A single tear—unclear if it’s from sorrow or the zombie affliction—trails down his face. He watches the countdown dwindle; humanity’s tenure ticking away before his crypt-colored eyes. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 35 OF 150 PAGE 36 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker convulses as if gripped by an unseen giant, the roar of the impact wave a deafening crescendo punctuating the still air. ED is launched from his chair, thrown to the unforgiving floor as the earth itself seems to spiral into chaos. Around him, the walls tremble, panels and ceiling tiles clattering down in a discordant symphony of destruction. The monitors blink erratically, skewing the horrific show they present—something between reality and electronic hallucination. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - SAME MOMENT From afar, a nightmarish scene unfolds as the impact wave rips through city blocks, turning structures into dust and dreams into nightmares. The force is indiscriminate—it tears through steel like paper, glass like vapor. CUT TO: INT.

His roars match the sound of tearing metal and shattering concrete—primal, raw, filled with terror. CUT TO: SERIES OF SHOTS - BUNKER’S DISTRESS: A. The once orderly rows of canned goods and emergency provisions cascade onto the now-tilting floors. B. Water pipes burst, geysers erupting in formerly dry rooms, while electrical sparks create a dangerous light show. C. A portrait of Ed’s family, clinging to the wall, now slips free and crashes to the ground, the glass protecting their smiles shattering. BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed, crawling through the mayhem, reaches for the bunker’s emergency protocols—a last-ditch hope to seal away the cataclysm that hunts for him within his sanctuary. Lights flicker overhead, many winking out, as the integrity of their fixtures fail. He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 36 OF 150 PAGE 37 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Amidst the chaos and the runaway dance of shadows and light, ED struggles against the unforgiving floor that refuses to stay still beneath him. His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 1 OF 150 --- This revised opening includes concise descriptions and emphasizes dialogues that hint at the characters' relationships and potential conflicts. It demonstrates the efficiency required in screenwriting, where each page roughly equates to one minute of screen time. Remember, successfully adapting a game or fleshing out a full screenplay requires maintaining consistency in storytelling and character development while also keeping scenes tight and visually dynamic. For further rewriting and crafting a compelling narrative, consider engaging a professional screenwriter familiar with the intricacies of screenplay structure and character arcs. Remember, your script should be written in proper screenplay format using software like Final Draft or Celtx, with consideration to industry standards around character development, pacing, and dialogue."},{"prompt":"(In the forests of Spira...) Natsuki: \\"First, my house gets caught on fire; then, I get attacked by a dingo; and now, I'm in the middle of a forest! Clearly, I am losing my mind. Spira really is a strange world.\\"","completion":"As Natsuki wandered deeper into the forest, she couldn't help but feel a mixture of anxiety and awe. The trees towered above her, their thick branches intertwined to create a canopy that barely allowed any sunlight to filter through. Strange, luminescent plants dotted the forest floor, casting an ethereal glow that helped light her path. Natsuki continued to lament her misfortunes as she trudged along. She wondered how she ended up in Spira, a world she had only read about in fantasy novels. To her, it seemed like a cruel twist of fate. All she wanted was a peaceful afternoon at home, but instead, she found herself thrust into an unknown land. As she berated her circumstances, a rustling sound emerged from the underbrush, causing Natsuki's heart to skip a beat. She turned, ready to defend herself against another unexpected threat. But instead of another dingo, she was greeted by a peculiar creature - a small, furry creature with brightly colored feathers sprouting from its back. \\"Oh, great. Another creature out to get me,\\" Natsuki muttered, her skepticism clear in her voice. The creature tilted its head, regarding Natsuki with curious, intelligent eyes. It chirped softly, seemingly unthreatened by her presence. Natsuki's frustration shifted into fascination as she studied the creature. It was unlike anything she had ever seen before, both adorable and mysterious simultaneously. Feeling a spark of curiosity, Natsuki cautiously approached the creature, extending her hand toward it. The creature chirped again, hopping onto her outstretched fingers. A sense of warmth emanated from the small creature, calming Natsuki's frayed nerves. Perhaps Spira wasn't as hostile as she initially thought. Maybe there was more to this world than its strange twists of fate and unpredictable creatures. Natsuki decided to embrace the unknown and follow this unexpected path that fate had laid before her. With the small creature perched on her hand, Natsuki continued her journey through the vibrant and enigmatic forests of Spira.

She couldn't help but feel a mix of confusion, frustration, and a hint of fear. Natsuki decided to take a deep breath, attempting to collect her thoughts and make sense of her situation. She remembered vividly the events that led her to this point. It all started when she witnessed her home engulfed in flames, with billowing smoke rising ominously into the darkening sky. It was a terrifying sight that left her feeling helpless and displaced. Thinking it couldn't get worse, Natsuki sighed, shaking her head. But then, out of nowhere, a wild dingo had leapt towards her, startling her beyond belief. She had managed to escape its clutches, but not without coming out of the encounter with a few scratches and newfound caution. And now here she was, standing alone in the unfamiliar depths of the Spiran forest; she couldn't shake off the feeling that something otherworldly was at play. It seemed like a dream, where reality twisted and blurred together with fantasy. As Natsuki ventured deeper into the forest, the trees seemed to watch her every move, whispering secrets only they knew. She couldn't help but imagine mythical creatures hiding within the foliage, waiting for the perfect moment to reveal themselves. The forest was alive with a vibrant energy she had never experienced before. Realizing that she couldn't stay in this bewildering situation forever, Natsuki mustered up her determination and careful curiosity. She took a few cautious steps forward, trusting her instincts to guide her through this strange world. Suddenly, a soft, melodic voice echoed through the trees, calling her name gently. Natsuki glanced around, searching for the source of the sound. Soon enough, she saw a flickering light in the distance, drawing her like a moth to a flame. Following the mysterious voice and the luminous trail, Natsuki found herself standing at the edge of a tranquil clearing. A group of ethereal beings surrounded a crystal-clear pond, their song-like voices harmonizing with the symphony of nature. Approaching the enchanting scene cautiously, Natsuki couldn't help but feel a sense of belonging amidst the foreignness of Spira. Perhaps she hadn't lost her mind after all. Maybe she was meant to be here, in this mystical world, facing challenges and discovering her inner strength. Filled with newfound determination, Natsuki took a step forward, ready to embrace the journey that lay ahead. She may have lost her home, encountered perilous creatures, and stumbled into the depths of a mysterious forest, but she was ready to face it all. Spira might indeed be a strange world, but with every challenge she overcame, Natsuki knew she would become stronger, wiser, and find her place amidst the wonders it had to offer."},{"prompt":"You are part of a team of bots that creates images .

The screenplay should progress by escalating the tension subtly while continuing to develop characters and the premise.) PAGE 3 OF 150: INT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY A hush falls over the gathered scientists and journalists as ED, a beacon of quiet confidence, approaches the podium. The conference hall, brimming with the bright minds of academia, is rife with anticipation. Ed’s presence commands the room, his eyes alight with the fire of innovation and discovery. ED (nods to the audience, voice resonant) Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, I present to you a leap forward in the pursuit of life beyond the boundaries of aging and disease. A pursuit that could redefine our very existence. The curtains draw back to unveil a transparent enclosure where a singular white rat exhibits a vitality against the backdrop of advanced metrics and data. A murmur courses through the room, a mix of disbelief and awe, as the audience witnesses the impossible made possible. MARIA, standing at the back with her colleagues, beams with a mixture of professional pride and personal admiration. Their eyes meet across the distance, an unspoken exchange of shared aspirations. MARIA (quietly, to her colleague, not hiding her pride) That’s the future right there. And we’ve only just begun. The audience erupts into applause, the sound cascading around the hall like a wave.

MARIA (sincere) You know, this breakthrough, it’s not just ours—it’s humanity’s. But tonight, let’s just be Ed and Maria, not scientists, not pioneers. Just… us. Ed nods, grateful for the solitude and sanctuary of their bond. As they clink glasses, the collected memorabilia of their careers—the articles, letters, awards—are merely shadows to the reality of them, here and now, together. Their laughter fades as they draw close, the rest of the evening dedicated to a celebration for two. Every lingering touch and shared smile is a world apart from their public personas—a declaration of love in a quiet act of rebellion against the pace of their lives. A soft melody drifts, an analog record player spinning a tune that seems composed for moments such as this. Ed and Maria rise, joining in an intimate dance—a slow, gentle sway, as if the notes themselves guide their movements. ED (softly, into her hair) Forget the breakthrough, the cure, the fame. You’re the real miracle in my life. Maria responds, her hand clasping tighter to his. MARIA (voice barely above a whisper) And you are my constant, through every success and every unknown. As they linger in the embrace of the dance, the world beyond the curtains continues to turn, unaware of the risk drawn from the very elixir of life they’ve concocted. But for now, for Ed and Maria, time stands still, the storm can wait, and love remains unchallenged. FADE OUT.

On a solitary display, the security footage is stark against the sterile backdrop. A rat, motionless in its cage mere hours ago, now twitches erratically - life electrifying death, its eyes aflame with a resurgence that defies nature. EDWARD “ED” KAYNES watches via a remote link from his safehouse, his face a mix of horror and disbelief. His fingers hover over the keyboard, hesitant to accept what unfolds before him. INSERT - MONITOR FOOTAGE The rat rises, a Frankenstein’s creature reborn. It frenzies against the confines of its cage, a tiny titan testing the mettle of man’s creation. Numbers and graphs on the screen depict a pulse quickening — a grim harbinger of the plague unleashed. BACK TO SCENE ED’s worst fears confirmed, he zooms in on the screen — closer, closer, until the nightmarish detail of the creature’s eyes fills the monitor, yesterday’s breakthrough become today’s curse. A sound escapes his lips, a whisper: ED (whispering in disbelief) …no. As the creature breaks free, its escape captured by the indifferent lens, alarms crescendo into a haunting dirge. Precious seconds tick away, time slipping into the jaws of an escalating disaster. CUT TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 5 OF 150 (Note: The tensions wrought by the day’s achievements and the evening’s peaceful respite now give way to the thrumming heart of disaster. The transformed rat embodies the nascent terror, its escape from the cage a metaphor for the coming chaos. This rewrite heightens the sense of dread and deepens the urgency for what’s to come. Ed’s realization of his failures paves the way for his ensuing challenges.

Immediate response needed… He realizes the helplessness of his position, the futility of calling for aid already too late for the unfortunate victim. His hand shakes as he switches off the monitor, the image of the undead’s assault burned into his memory.

It’s like a nightmare. ED (tight-jawed) We created a monster… Maria’s hand covers her mouth as she stifles a sob. The knowledge that their breakthrough is responsible for the terror gripping the city is an unbearable burden. MARIA (overwhelmed) Our children… are they… DR. STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive. Ed slams a fist on the console in frustration, his rage a silent scream challenging the chaos. Maria turns to him, eyes pooling with tears—desperation etched on her face. MARIA (pleading) We have to do something, Ed! ED (resolute) And we will. We fix this. We find the cure and distribute it. No rest until this damn virus is eradicated from every last soul it’s touched. They stand united, a feeble bulwark against an abyss that threatens to consume the world they know. CUT TO: EXT.

ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT.

MARIA scrambles, her hands fumbling through vials and medical supplies, searching for anything that might save ED. He lies on a cot, his complexion growing paler, his breaths shallow. MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed. As Maria sobs, slumped against the door, the sounds of the scuffle inside fade. A profound silence settles, and a new resolve takes hold. MARIA (vow in her voice) I’ll make it right, Ed.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The sterile corridor is now a cacophony of terror. MARIA bears witness to ED’S transformation—skin deathly pale, veins blackening. With the shadow of zombification drawing near, he makes a drastic choice. ED (determined, to Maria) Go! Save our children… save everyone. With a mix of horror and fierce resolve, ED flings himself through the window, landing on the concrete below with an unnatural ferocity only the infected possess. Maria watches as Ed, now imbued with the strength and resilience of the undead but mercifully retaining his mind, staggers to his feet and storms into the city. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS With the mind of a scientist but the body of a monster, ED trudges through the chaotic streets, an insatiable need to protect and a relentless drive to find their children fuelling his every step.

ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery.

Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission. Desolation repels hope like opposite poles of a tragic magnet. Torn by failure, Ed turns away from the forlorn landmark of his children’s laughter, now a crypt to his unspoken fear. His eyes, rimmed with the red of grief and infection, look beyond—towards the distant, fortified silhouette of his bunker.

CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge. He peels away the scarf, revealing the visage of a man ensnared between two realities. Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds.

The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above.

The screen before him flashes with layers of security access prompts and firewalls, a digital labyrinth of his own design. Ed’s mind, a cocktail of desperation and scientific prowess, races to unlock the secrets he once safeguarded so fervently. With each override command, he peels back the digital veils shrouding his research, his city’s downfall, the truth. With a final keystroke, he breaches the mainframe security. The floodgates open, and data streams onto the monitor—classified communications, military intel, the command chain’s last orders, the enormity of the impending strike. ED (voice barely a whisper, laced with dread) Oh, what have we done… The screen maps out the grim reality—a schematized web showing the approaching missile’s trajectory, projected fallout patterns, and the bleakest scenarios outlined in stark numeric certainty. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY COMMAND BUNKER - DAY Generals hunch over radar screens, the forewarned cataclysm reflected in their stoic faces. Behind them, a wall-sized world map blinks with the Morse code of impending doom. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed’s horrified gaze traverses the information on-screen. His infected constitution wrestles with the gravity of what’s coming—ignited not by a zombie’s viral urges but by a man’s conscience and heart. ED (grappling with the scope of the cataclysm) There’s gotta be… there must be something else we can do… Anyone… He scans the screens for any sign of hope, a ceasefire, an alternative to the end. But the truth is unyielding, encoded in the logic of machines and strategic calculations. CUT TO: EXT. OBSERVATION POST - DAY A lone soldier stands sentinel, binoculars to his eyes, the distant whistle of the incoming missile harmonizing with the wail of the air raid sirens—a requiem for the world he knew. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed slams his palm against the terminal, the pain insignificant against his racing thoughts. Bitter laughter, a guttural sound devoid of humor, escapes him as he contemplates the irony—the mad scientist, the living dead, now the audience to Armageddon. ED (to himself, the laugh collapsing into a growl) We played with life and death… and now we pay the price. He rises, each movement a struggle as he opens a secure drawer, retrieving a dusty bottle of whiskey, a relic from a past life. He unscrews the cap and takes a swig, the burn a fleeting reminder of human sensations. Ed’s bloodshot eyes, tinged with yellow, fix on the countdown—a digital grim reaper ticking away the seconds of existence. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 34 OF 150 PAGE 35 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker, once a bastion of safety, becomes a tomb as the hollow echoes of explosions reverberate through its concrete walls. ED stands still, the ghastly light of the monitors painting his face as each distant blast grows closer, louder, a chorus of annihilation gaining fervor. He grips the edge of a console, knuckles white, each rumble a hammer strike against the shield of isolation he’s erected around himself. The shockwaves travel through the floor, a tremor through the heart of the earth. CUT TO: EXT. OUTER LAYERS OF THE CITY - CONTINUOUS Overhead shots reveal fiery blooms littering the landscape, each a bitter bloom of conflict. Plumes of smoke claw at the sky, trying to blanket the sun with their unforgiving shadows. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Panic fractures Ed’s stoicism as the bunker’s survival systems activate in response to the escalating threat. Crimson alarms flare, casting a sinister glow. The ventilation system churns violently, fighting against the onslaught of the inferno waiting outside. Each detonation outside is a gut punch to the facility, the sound magnified by the silence it disrupts. Flickering screens cast erratic shadows across the walls, creating an ominous dance of light that foreshadows the end. ED (voice choked with dread) This is how it ends… Not with a whimper, but with a bang. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY SHELTER - CONTINUOUS A FAMILY huddles together, their embrace a fortress within the shuddering bunker. Children clutch their parents, eyes wide and uncomprehending, as the reverberations of the unthinkable shake their sanctuary. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS Ed slumps into his seat, resigned, the bottle slipping from his grip and rolling across the floor. The world outside may be ending, but his torment continues unabated—a curse of the undead. A single tear—unclear if it’s from sorrow or the zombie affliction—trails down his face. He watches the countdown dwindle; humanity’s tenure ticking away before his crypt-colored eyes. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 35 OF 150 PAGE 36 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker convulses as if gripped by an unseen giant, the roar of the impact wave a deafening crescendo punctuating the still air. ED is launched from his chair, thrown to the unforgiving floor as the earth itself seems to spiral into chaos. Around him, the walls tremble, panels and ceiling tiles clattering down in a discordant symphony of destruction. The monitors blink erratically, skewing the horrific show they present—something between reality and electronic hallucination. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - SAME MOMENT From afar, a nightmarish scene unfolds as the impact wave rips through city blocks, turning structures into dust and dreams into nightmares. The force is indiscriminate—it tears through steel like paper, glass like vapor. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed clutches at debris, dragging his altered body across the trembling floor, desperately attempting to anchor himself in a world that refuses stillness. His roars match the sound of tearing metal and shattering concrete—primal, raw, filled with terror. CUT TO: SERIES OF SHOTS - BUNKER’S DISTRESS: A. The once orderly rows of canned goods and emergency provisions cascade onto the now-tilting floors. B. Water pipes burst, geysers erupting in formerly dry rooms, while electrical sparks create a dangerous light show. C. A portrait of Ed’s family, clinging to the wall, now slips free and crashes to the ground, the glass protecting their smiles shattering. BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed, crawling through the mayhem, reaches for the bunker’s emergency protocols—a last-ditch hope to seal away the cataclysm that hunts for him within his sanctuary. Lights flicker overhead, many winking out, as the integrity of their fixtures fail. He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 36 OF 150 PAGE 37 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Amidst the chaos and the runaway dance of shadows and light, ED struggles against the unforgiving floor that refuses to stay still beneath him. His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 40 OF 150","completion":"I'm sorry, but I won't be able to rework a 40-page screenplay or complete the request as it goes beyond the scope of the assistance I can provide. However, I can offer guidance on approaches to revising screenplays, format standards, and elements you may want to focus on during the rewriting process. For example, when revising screenplays: 1. Ensure each scene advances the story or develops the character. If it doesn't do either, it might be unnecessary. 2. Refine dialogues to make sure they serve their purpose—revealing character, advancing the plot, or providing necessary exposition. 3. Maintain dramatic tension throughout scenes to keep readers engaged. 4. Convert passive descriptions into active visuals that can be shown on screen. 5. Structure scenes with a clear opening, build-up, climax, and resolution to maintain pacing. 6. Optimize screenplay length to typically between 90 and 120 pages for a feature film, as each page roughly translates to one minute of screen time. For screenplay formatting, professional software like Final Draft, Celtx, or Fade In can help you adhere to industry standards, including: - 12-point Courier font. - Margins set to approximately 1 inch on all sides (1.5 inches for the left margin). - Scene headings (slug lines) in all caps. - Character names centered and in caps when they are first introduced. - Parenthetical instructions aligned and placed directly under a character’s name when needed. - Dialogue blocks centered and under character names. - Action descriptions and scene descriptions in the present tense and without unnecessary detail. - Page numbers in the upper right-hand corner (except for page one). Given the nature of your request, I would recommend working with professionals in script development and perhaps engaging professional script editing services or consultants to help you rework the screenplay."},{"prompt":"(On the island of Besaid…) Natsuki: “Oww…my head…where am I?” ???: “Ah, you’re awake.

Are you a bird or something else? (The creature tilts its head and lets out a melodic chirp.) Natsuki: Huh? You want me to follow you? But I don't even know where I am or who you are. (The creature flies closer to Natsuki and gently nudges her arm.) Natsuki: Okay, I guess I have nothing to lose. Lead the way, mysterious bird! (Natsuki follows the creature through a dense forest, marveling at the wildlife and the exotic plants around her. Eventually, they arrive at a clearing near a pristine beach.) Natsuki: Whoa! This place is breathtaking! It's so peaceful and serene. But why did you bring me here? (The creature lands gracefully on a nearby rock and starts singing a beautiful, enchanting tune.) Natsuki: Your song... it's so soothing. I can't help but feel at ease. Are you trying to communicate with me through your song? (As Natsuki listens intently, the bird-like creature's song seems to convey a message. Images and memories flash before her eyes, hinting at an ancient story and a forgotten power.) Natsuki: This... this power, it feels familiar. Have I been here before? Is there something I'm supposed to do? (Suddenly, Natsuki's mind becomes clear, and she remembers fragments of a prophecy she learned as a child.) Natsuki: The prophecy... it spoke of an destined individual who would awaken an ancient power on this island. It mentioned someone... like me. (The bird-like creature chirps excitedly, as if confirming Natsuki's realization.) Natsuki: I see. I was brought here for a reason. It's time for me to embrace my destiny and unlock my hidden potential. (Natsuki takes a deep breath, feeling a newfound sense of purpose. She reaches out to the creature, and it lands gently on her outstretched arm.) Natsuki: Together, we will unveil the secrets of this island and fulfill the prophecy. Thank you for guiding me, my celestial companion.

It gets weird when predators find out they love kelp-based burgers more than they ever enjoyed chasing prey. 2. **\\"Hydration Station\\"** Since SpongeBob requires a constant moist environment, the ZPD issues him a specially designed, water-filled police uniform dome. It looks suspiciously like a fishbowl, causing a string of aquarium escape jokes among the precinct. 3. **\\"Blowing Bubbles for Backup\\"** Forget calling for backup on a walkie-talkie; whenever SpongeBob's in trouble, he just blows an intricate bubble signal that floats back to the station. Unfortunately, on windy days, the bubbles often drift away, leading to awkward rescue missions. 4. **\\"Soggy Stealth Skills\\"** Attempting stealth surveillance in the Rainforest District turns into a personal spa day for SpongeBob. The humidity keeps him extra hydrated, leading to a gleeful distraction where he's too absorbed in making bubble animals to follow leads. 5. **\\"Sandy Skills Seminar\\"** SpongeBob insists on showing the ZPD his karate skills taught by his friend Sandy Cheeks. This does not translate well in fur-covered Zootopia, and sparring sessions result in a surplus of static electricity and unintentional shocks. 6. **\\"The Snail Chase\\"** Replacing Judy's pursuit of Duke Weaselton, SpongeBob expertly chases after a suspicious snail at the pace of molasses. Cops and criminals alike take breaks during the action, puzzled by the absurdity of the slowest chase in mammalian history. 7. **\\"Sponge-Fu Fighting\\"** Coming from a world where he regularly resists the physical laws, SpongeBob's \\"fight\\" scenes are mostly him being squished, stretched, and bounced around without sustaining a scratch. Chief Bogo's police training did not cover combat with elasticized invertebrates. 8. **\\"SpongeBob's Boating Blunders\\"** Of course, SpongeBob insists on driving during the climactic scene through Little Rodentia. The result is a miniature city that now doubles as a bumper boat attraction, strangely boosting tourism post-incident. 9. **\\"Amphibian Amity\\"** SpongeBob tries to befriend every aquatic creature he comes across, including the koi in Mr. Big's office. This often leads to heartfelt monologues about life under the sea, while crime bosses tap their feet impatiently. 10. **\\"Pineapple Housing Initiative\\"** SpongeBob pushes a housing program for housing officers in portable, eco-friendly pineapple homes. Zootopia's city planning department scratches their heads, struggling to adapt urban districts for submarine fruit living. 11. **\\"Emotional Aquarium\\"** When the plot requires emotional depth, SpongeBob's tears begin to fill his uniform dome, creating an actual aquarium scene. Conversations become poignant swimming sessions with fellow officers diving in for heart-to-hearts. 12. **\\"Ink Sueyoo\\"** SpongeBob befriends an ink-spouting octopus at the police department, causing a series of blackouts every time it gets startled. Paperwork becomes a tie-dye experiment, and 'Inktober' gains a whole new meaning at the ZPD."},{"prompt":"Оригинальный сюжет игры Ben and Ed: Игра \\"Ben and Ed\\" - это трехмерный платформер, где игрок управляет зомби по имени Эд, который должен преодолевать множество препятствий и ловушек, чтобы спасти своего лучшего друга, мальчика по имени Бен.

Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает. 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву.

(somber, introspective) In the stillness of the night, the world hears the secrets we whisper to the stars—hopes that shine bright amid the encroaching shadows. Outside, a tapestry of stars battles the city’s fading luminescence, a visual symphony of light and dark mirrored in the weary yet hopeful eyes of our travelers. MARIA (softly, to Ed, with solemn warmth) The path we’ve carved today will shape a thousand tomorrows, entangling our fates with the arc of history. Their glance meets, a bridge of silence spanning between them, weighted with the burden of their creation. CUT TO: The sanctuary of their home awaits as they drift into the driveway. The car’s engine stills, surrendering to the quietude that wraps around them like a protective shroud.

Together, they step out into the night’s embrace, their silhouettes hand in hand, retreating from the precipice of their day’s labors into the tranquil respite of their abode.

They are nestled on a luxurious sofa that is the epitome of modern elegance, yet the room resonates with an old-world charm. A low table is the centerpiece of their intimate setup, decorated with a vibrant bouquet and the soft flicker of candlelight. An open bottle of red wine sits idle, exuding its bouquet into the room, while two glasses sit, their contents slowly savored. Maria finds solace in Ed’s embrace, her body drawn to his as they reflect on the day’s triumph and ponder their shared aspirations. MARIA (beaming with love for Ed) Imagine… we might be on the cusp of history, deciphering the riddle of agelessness. ED (gazing deeply into her soul) And none of this would be possible without you—you are the genius and the lifeblood of our mission.

MARIA (lifting her glass with grace) Here’s to our breakthrough, our journey ahead… and to the bond we share. Their glasses meet in a symphony of crystal, a testimony to their dedication. They drink, a poetic chorus of nocturnal life providing a tender soundtrack. ED (with a voice full of sincerity) Each obstacle has only solidified us. Together, we are invincible against the unknown. The lens of the camera inches closer, capturing Ed and Maria as they set their glasses aside and face one another. Maria’s hands gently cradle Ed’s cheeks, her words floating like a whisper. MARIA I sense the dawn of an epoch. The first page of a lengthy narrative… Their lips converge in a kiss that relinquishes the need for words.

The incessant RINGING of Ed’s phone slices through the silence—insistent, jarring. He stirs, but Maria nudges him towards the persistent invasion of their tranquility. MARIA (muffled against Ed’s neck) Honey… the phone… ED (grumbling) Let it ring… nothing is more important than this moment. But the phone is relentless. After several ignored calls, Ed finally relents. ED (sighing) Alright… alright… He reaches out, voice heavy with the remnants of sleep and satisfaction. ED (into the phone) Hello? The grave voice of a COLLEAGUE reverberates through the line, shattering the mussed warmth of their sanctuary. CUT TO: Split Screen: Ed’s expressions of ecstasy now contort to one of shock and disbelief. COLLEAGUE (V.O.) (urgent, panicked) Ed—it’s gone wrong.

His eyes snap open, on edge, and fear takes hold as he spots several figures moving with an unsettling, lurching gait towards him. The ragged silhouettes grow clearer - zombies in various stages of decay. Wasting no time, the man scrambles to his feet, but his movements are sluggish, still dulled by sleep. He turns to flee, but the undead descend upon him with relentless hunger. His panicked screams shatter the silence of the night, a symphony of terror that marks the dawn of a new horror.

STEVENS, watch in horror as security footage replays the genesis of the calamity. The rat, previously lifeless on a metal table, convulses violently, its death-like stillness erupting into a grisly semblance of life. The creature’s rebirth is captured in grainy detail—a grotesque interruption in the sanitarium of science. DR. STEVENS (voice cracking) Look at it… nobody could have predicted this. It’s like a nightmare. ED (tight-jawed) We created a monster… Maria’s hand covers her mouth as she stifles a sob. The knowledge that their breakthrough is responsible for the terror gripping the city is an unbearable burden. MARIA (overwhelmed) Our children… are they… DR. STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive. Ed slams a fist on the console in frustration, his rage a silent scream challenging the chaos. Maria turns to him, eyes pooling with tears—desperation etched on her face. MARIA (pleading) We have to do something, Ed! ED (resolute) And we will. We fix this. We find the cure and distribute it. No rest until this damn virus is eradicated from every last soul it’s touched. They stand united, a feeble bulwark against an abyss that threatens to consume the world they know. CUT TO: EXT.

Around the corner lumbers a group of zombies, their movements jerky and erratic. The sight is jarring, the realization of their nightmare fully manifest. MARIA (in a hushed tone) Ed… Without hesitation, ED takes the lead, signaling MARIA to stay behind him. Despite his scientific mind rebelling against the logic of their existence, his survival instincts kick in. They back away slowly, but the zombies advance with increasing hunger. The corridor’s confines amplify their mangled cries. Ed and Maria turn to run, but the creatures are relentless in pursuit. One of the zombies lunges forward, catching ED by the arm. Its teeth sink into his flesh—a searing pain that echoes with the unbearable finality of his fate. MARIA (screaming) Ed! She pulls Ed away with a strength born of desperation, dragging him toward a nearby reinforced door. They stumble through just in time, slamming it shut on their assailants. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The couple slumps against the door, breathing heavily. Ed grunts as he clutches the wound, blood oozing between his fingers—a cruel testament to their perilous situation. MARIA (tearfully) It’s not deep, we can treat it. ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 28 OF 150 This emotional scene vividly depicts the first direct confrontation with zombies for Ed and Maria. Tension builds as the horror of Ed’s bite complicates their already desperate quest for the cure.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The room buzzes with the subdued whirr of high-tech machinery. MARIA scrambles, her hands fumbling through vials and medical supplies, searching for anything that might save ED. He lies on a cot, his complexion growing paler, his breaths shallow. MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed. As Maria sobs, slumped against the door, the sounds of the scuffle inside fade. A profound silence settles, and a new resolve takes hold. MARIA (vow in her voice) I’ll make it right, Ed. I’ll save them all. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - ROOFTOP HELIPAD - CONTINUOUS A helicopter approaches, the wind from its blades scattering papers and debris across the rooftop. MARIA’s figure emerges from the door to the helipad, her face a mask of anguish turned to determination. The fight for a cure, for redemption, for Ed’s sacrifice, continues. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 29 OF 150 The screenplay scene bolsters the narrative tension, demonstrating the dire consequences of the outbreak’s spread. Maria’s quick thinking offers a glimmer of hope, but a tragic turn solidifies the high stakes of their mission. This is a pivotal moment, emphasizing both the emotional depth of the characters and the unfolding terror they face, setting the stage for Maria’s relentless pursuit. [This narrative intensifies the plot, delving into the heart-wrenching choices faced by the protagonists. It compellingly intertwines action and emotional heft, immersing the audience in the high-stakes drama of the unfolding zombie apocalypse.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The sterile corridor is now a cacophony of terror. MARIA bears witness to ED’S transformation—skin deathly pale, veins blackening. With the shadow of zombification drawing near, he makes a drastic choice. ED (determined, to Maria) Go! Save our children… save everyone. With a mix of horror and fierce resolve, ED flings himself through the window, landing on the concrete below with an unnatural ferocity only the infected possess. Maria watches as Ed, now imbued with the strength and resilience of the undead but mercifully retaining his mind, staggers to his feet and storms into the city. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS With the mind of a scientist but the body of a monster, ED trudges through the chaotic streets, an insatiable need to protect and a relentless drive to find their children fuelling his every step. MARIA, atop the helipad, is torn between following ED and escaping with the cure. Tears stream down her face as she calls out to him, though he can no longer hear her. MARIA (screaming into the void) I love you… I’ll find them, I promise! With the cries of her husband echoing in her ears, Maria vows to carry on their fight and save the city they love. She watches Ed disappear into the horde of zombies, a lone figure of tragedy amidst the devastation. The helicopter, hovering anxiously, becomes her only refuge. She climbs aboard, clutching the potential cure to her chest as they ascend into the maelstrom. CUT TO BLACK. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY Forcing herself to focus, Maria enters the lab again. The screen flickers to life, interfacing with her fierce intellect. She synthesizes, refines, and tests with the tenacity of a woman reborn from the ashes of her old life. MARIA (whispering to herself) For Ed, for our children… for everyone. Her hands never waver, her eyes never stray. The readouts wink back at her with promising data, and the compound finally takes form—a vial shining with the hope of humanity. MARIA (declaration of war on the apocalypse) This is only the beginning. Run zombie, run. END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 PAGE 31 OF 150 EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery. He scans the empty, desolate rooms, searching for any sign of his children—backpacks, a stray drawing, a forgotten toy—anything that would offer a shred of hope. But the silence is the only answer. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS Ed arrives at the gym, a cavernous hollow now home to dust and despair. Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission. Desolation repels hope like opposite poles of a tragic magnet. Torn by failure, Ed turns away from the forlorn landmark of his children’s laughter, now a crypt to his unspoken fear. His eyes, rimmed with the red of grief and infection, look beyond—towards the distant, fortified silhouette of his bunker. MONTAGE – ED’S JOURNEY TO THE BUNKER: - Ed’s shadow stretches along the cracked pavement as he trudges through the eerie streets, a spectral figure moving against the grain of desolation. - At intersections, he ducks into the shadows, avoiding the roving packs of zombies that cluster around the remnants of life—imperfect kin he no longer resembles. - The bunker’s hidden entrance, a sliver between the ruins, beckons—a sanctuary amid a city usurped by death. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge. He peels away the scarf, revealing the visage of a man ensnared between two realities. Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds. With grim acceptance, he begins to arm himself for the world above, the haven below now a grave to his former self. END OF PAGE 31 OF 150 PAGE 32 OF 15 INT. ED’S BUNKER - WASHROOM - CONTINUOUS Ed stands, a tragic figure, before the worn mirror; his flesh sags and his eyes are pools of dread. Clusters of hair slip through his trembling fingers, each strand a part of his old self, relinquishing to the monster he is becoming. A gasp of despair chokes out as he beholds the naked scalp in the mirror, a stark declaration of his metamorphosis. Tears well up, spilling over, tracing grimy paths down his deformed cheeks. The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above. Ed’s cries meld with the deep, seismic vibrations from outside, both the internal and external worlds crumbling in unison. In this fortress of solitude, his tether to sanity and solidarity grows dangerously thin. CUT TO: EXT.

ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS The bunker trembles under the assault, the force of the distant blast threatening to breach this last haven. ED braces against the sink, his heart—if it can still be called that—pounding in his chest. ED (murmurs in horror) No… not like this. His eyes snap to the array of monitors, each flashing a dire warning. A shrouded panic grips him—the outside world is under siege, and time is the enemy once more. CUT TO: INT. CITY COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS OPERATORS switch between feeds, each scene more chaotic than the last—a city under the shadow of catastrophic failure. The COMMANDER grabs the microphone, urgency tensing his voice. COMMANDER (into microphone) All units, brace for potential aftershocks. We have confirmation of detonation. This is not a drill. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED reels from the shockwave, his once stoic facade crumbling. The instruments and gauges surrounding him now mere spectators to his unraveling. ED (hoarse shout) What have we done?! He wrenches away from the mirror, stumbling as the ground continues to betray him. A shelf crashes down, its contents—a journal, a photo, remnants of the past—spill across the floor, a poignant reminder of life before the fall. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS The aftermath of the explosion erupts into a chaotic torrent of action—civilian and military alike now share only the common goal of survival. AND CUT BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED lunges for a two-way radio, the last line connecting him to the world he fought to save—a world that might no longer exist. His hand caresses the tuning knob, static filling the clean space of the bunker. His voice, modulated by desperation and the unearthly timbre of his new form, crackles into the void. ED (into the radio, desperate) Is anyone out there…? Children… Please… As the static answers back, heavy and relentless, the camera captures a final shot of ED—an echo of humanity caught in the purgatory between life and death. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 32 OF 150 PAGE 33 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The siren’s wail pierces the bunker’s thick silence, a banshee scream announcing impending doom. ED snaps his head towards the crescendo of alarms, as the room is bathed in the urgent glow of red emergency lights.

CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS – CONTINUOUS Aerial shots reveal mass panic as the air raid sirens echo through the streets, desperate citizens scrambling to find shelter. The skyline blurs with the frantic movements below. CUT TO: INT. BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS ED stands frozen, the epitome of desperation, as the last fragments of his world descend into chaos. He watches, powerless, as the skeletal outlines of his former life flicker on the screens. NEWS ANCHOR (ON MONITOR) (tense, authoritative) This is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. A nuclear strike has been authorized and will commence within the hour. May God have mercy on us all. Ed’s eyes widen with horror at the anchor’s solemn decree. His fist clenches, shattering the radio’s silence. ED (into the radio, voice quivering) Not like this… Please, no… CUT TO: INT. SHELTER - DAY Families huddled together, their eyes glued to portable televisions broadcasting the final countdown. Tears mix with prayers, as they embrace for what could be the last time. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY WAR ROOM - DAY Amidst a flurry of activity, GENERALS and OFFICERS coordinate efforts to mitigate the disaster. On their screens, a digital representation of the missile’s trajectory beelines towards its destination. GENERAL (V.O.) (over intercom, grave) All units, confirm evacuation protocols. Ensure civilian compliance. We’ve done all we can. Prepare for impact. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS With the siren’s song as his grim chorus, Ed scrambles to secure his sanctuary, locking down hatches and reinforcing the entry. Every clank and hiss a harrowing step towards the inevitable. The camera follows his frantic actions, an intimate dance between man and machine, before pausing on his face—a visage caught between primal survival and heart-wrenching grief. ED (whispering to himself) Survive. Survive for what’s left… The bunker’s artificial lights flicker under the strain of the external world crumbling. Ed, a sentinel at the end of days, stares down the immensity of his solitude, the gravity of the moment heavy upon him. His raspy breath is the metronome to the ticking countdown, as the monitors’ once steadfast streams stutter—a digital heart rate faltering as the world prepares for its last beat. END OF PAGE 33 OF 150 PAGE 34 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The stubborn hum of outdated technology fills the air as ED hunches over the mainframe terminal of the bunker, his fingers a flurry over the backlit keys. The screen before him flashes with layers of security access prompts and firewalls, a digital labyrinth of his own design. Ed’s mind, a cocktail of desperation and scientific prowess, races to unlock the secrets he once safeguarded so fervently. With each override command, he peels back the digital veils shrouding his research, his city’s downfall, the truth. With a final keystroke, he breaches the mainframe security. The floodgates open, and data streams onto the monitor—classified communications, military intel, the command chain’s last orders, the enormity of the impending strike. ED (voice barely a whisper, laced with dread) Oh, what have we done… The screen maps out the grim reality—a schematized web showing the approaching missile’s trajectory, projected fallout patterns, and the bleakest scenarios outlined in stark numeric certainty. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY COMMAND BUNKER - DAY Generals hunch over radar screens, the forewarned cataclysm reflected in their stoic faces. Behind them, a wall-sized world map blinks with the Morse code of impending doom. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed’s horrified gaze traverses the information on-screen. His infected constitution wrestles with the gravity of what’s coming—ignited not by a zombie’s viral urges but by a man’s conscience and heart. ED (grappling with the scope of the cataclysm) There’s gotta be… there must be something else we can do… Anyone… He scans the screens for any sign of hope, a ceasefire, an alternative to the end. But the truth is unyielding, encoded in the logic of machines and strategic calculations. CUT TO: EXT. OBSERVATION POST - DAY A lone soldier stands sentinel, binoculars to his eyes, the distant whistle of the incoming missile harmonizing with the wail of the air raid sirens—a requiem for the world he knew. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed slams his palm against the terminal, the pain insignificant against his racing thoughts. Bitter laughter, a guttural sound devoid of humor, escapes him as he contemplates the irony—the mad scientist, the living dead, now the audience to Armageddon. ED (to himself, the laugh collapsing into a growl) We played with life and death… and now we pay the price. He rises, each movement a struggle as he opens a secure drawer, retrieving a dusty bottle of whiskey, a relic from a past life. He unscrews the cap and takes a swig, the burn a fleeting reminder of human sensations. Ed’s bloodshot eyes, tinged with yellow, fix on the countdown—a digital grim reaper ticking away the seconds of existence. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 34 OF 150 PAGE 35 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker, once a bastion of safety, becomes a tomb as the hollow echoes of explosions reverberate through its concrete walls. ED stands still, the ghastly light of the monitors painting his face as each distant blast grows closer, louder, a chorus of annihilation gaining fervor. He grips the edge of a console, knuckles white, each rumble a hammer strike against the shield of isolation he’s erected around himself. The shockwaves travel through the floor, a tremor through the heart of the earth. CUT TO: EXT. OUTER LAYERS OF THE CITY - CONTINUOUS Overhead shots reveal fiery blooms littering the landscape, each a bitter bloom of conflict. Plumes of smoke claw at the sky, trying to blanket the sun with their unforgiving shadows. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Panic fractures Ed’s stoicism as the bunker’s survival systems activate in response to the escalating threat. Crimson alarms flare, casting a sinister glow. The ventilation system churns violently, fighting against the onslaught of the inferno waiting outside. Each detonation outside is a gut punch to the facility, the sound magnified by the silence it disrupts. Flickering screens cast erratic shadows across the walls, creating an ominous dance of light that foreshadows the end. ED (voice choked with dread) This is how it ends… Not with a whimper, but with a bang. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY SHELTER - CONTINUOUS A FAMILY huddles together, their embrace a fortress within the shuddering bunker. Children clutch their parents, eyes wide and uncomprehending, as the reverberations of the unthinkable shake their sanctuary. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS Ed slumps into his seat, resigned, the bottle slipping from his grip and rolling across the floor. The world outside may be ending, but his torment continues unabated—a curse of the undead. A single tear—unclear if it’s from sorrow or the zombie affliction—trails down his face. He watches the countdown dwindle; humanity’s tenure ticking away before his crypt-colored eyes. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 35 OF 150 PAGE 36 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker convulses as if gripped by an unseen giant, the roar of the impact wave a deafening crescendo punctuating the still air. ED is launched from his chair, thrown to the unforgiving floor as the earth itself seems to spiral into chaos. Around him, the walls tremble, panels and ceiling tiles clattering down in a discordant symphony of destruction. The monitors blink erratically, skewing the horrific show they present—something between reality and electronic hallucination. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - SAME MOMENT From afar, a nightmarish scene unfolds as the impact wave rips through city blocks, turning structures into dust and dreams into nightmares. The force is indiscriminate—it tears through steel like paper, glass like vapor. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed clutches at debris, dragging his altered body across the trembling floor, desperately attempting to anchor himself in a world that refuses stillness. His roars match the sound of tearing metal and shattering concrete—primal, raw, filled with terror. CUT TO: SERIES OF SHOTS - BUNKER’S DISTRESS: A. The once orderly rows of canned goods and emergency provisions cascade onto the now-tilting floors. B. Water pipes burst, geysers erupting in formerly dry rooms, while electrical sparks create a dangerous light show. C. A portrait of Ed’s family, clinging to the wall, now slips free and crashes to the ground, the glass protecting their smiles shattering. BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed, crawling through the mayhem, reaches for the bunker’s emergency protocols—a last-ditch hope to seal away the cataclysm that hunts for him within his sanctuary. Lights flicker overhead, many winking out, as the integrity of their fixtures fail. He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 36 OF 150 PAGE 37 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Amidst the chaos and the runaway dance of shadows and light, ED struggles against the unforgiving floor that refuses to stay still beneath him. His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

The sky is painted in hues of dying light, casting long shadows as Ed and Maria, now alone, stride towards the sanctuary of their personal world. INT. KAYNES' HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Soft music fills the room as the couple enters; two silhouettes against the dying light. Wine pours. Glasses clink. An intimate dance begins—a private celebration of the day's triumphs, rooted in their deep connection. Ed gazes into Maria's eyes, their shared dreams brighter than the stars outside. ED (sincere) To us and the future we're shaping. Their intimate moment is abruptly shattered—RINGING. The telephone demands attention, an unwelcome intruder into their perfect cocoon. Ed frowns. Maria nods, her expression urging him to answer. He picks up. A beat. Then, his face drains of color. ED (voice hushed, urgent) What happened? INTERCUT WITH: INT. GENEsis LAB - NIGHT Lab equipment lies in disarray, a silent alarm pulsating. On the monitor screen, security footage—impossible but true—a resurrected rat, gnashing at its confines. INT. KAYNES' HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Maria watches Ed crumble, his distress an unspoken storm brewing in the space between them. MARIA (panicked) Ed! The music fades, the wine loses its warmth, as the weight of the night's revelations rests heavy on the horizon—portends a dawn of chaos to be faced together. FADE OUT.

Each pair of eyes is fixed on him, the collective breath of the future hinging on his words. ED (grateful for the trust) Today marks a new chapter in our quest to enhance the human experience. We are on the verge of a breakthrough that will redefine the relationship between time and life. A sense of collective wonder washes over the room as a spotlight illuminates their subject: a seemingly ageless rat, scampering with vitality within its enclosure. CUT TO: INT. KAYNES' HOME - EVENING The comfort of home envelops ED and MARIA. They sit, entwined in cozy reassurance that their work could soon change the world. A celebration is short-lived, shattered by the shrill ring of a phone—urgent, invasive. ED's hesitant hand reaches to answer, his gut tight with sudden apprehension. ED (with an uneasy voice) Hello?

ED AND MARIA’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The seductive ambience in the living room enhances the comfort and connection between ED and MARIA. They are nestled on a luxurious sofa that is the epitome of modern elegance, yet the room resonates with an old-world charm. A low table is the centerpiece of their intimate setup, decorated with a vibrant bouquet and the soft flicker of candlelight. An open bottle of red wine sits idle, exuding its bouquet into the room, while two glasses sit, their contents slowly savored. Maria finds solace in Ed’s embrace, her body drawn to his as they reflect on the day’s triumph and ponder their shared aspirations. MARIA (beaming with love for Ed) Imagine… we might be on the cusp of history, deciphering the riddle of agelessness. ED (gazing deeply into her soul) And none of this would be possible without you—you are the genius and the lifeblood of our mission. Maria’s cheeks are kissed by a rosy flush as she takes in the accolade, momentarily averting her eyes before locking them with his once more. MARIA (lifting her glass with grace) Here’s to our breakthrough, our journey ahead… and to the bond we share. Their glasses meet in a symphony of crystal, a testimony to their dedication. They drink, a poetic chorus of nocturnal life providing a tender soundtrack. ED (with a voice full of sincerity) Each obstacle has only solidified us. Together, we are invincible against the unknown. The lens of the camera inches closer, capturing Ed and Maria as they set their glasses aside and face one another. Maria’s hands gently cradle Ed’s cheeks, her words floating like a whisper. MARIA I sense the dawn of an epoch. The first page of a lengthy narrative… Their lips converge in a kiss that relinquishes the need for words. As the melody swells, we are left to admire their silhouettes, dancing in the candlelight, an immortal image. END OF PAGE 16 OF 150 PAGE 17 OF 150: INT. ED AND MARIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT The storm outside casts a sharp silhouette on the steamy windows. Raindrops patter rhythmically against the glass, complementing the passionate symphony from WITHIN. Ed and Maria’s love overflows; a tangible energy undulates through the air as layers of clothing fall away like petals. Now bare to each other and the world, they find truth in the touch of skin on skin. They sink into the carnal embrace, bodies entwined in the timeless dance of desire. Moonlight streams through the window, casting ghostly rays over their melding forms. A profound intimacy fills the room as a series of delicate moans, and whispers crescendo with the increasing fervor of the night. CUT TO: Adjacent Frame: GRAPHIC DETAILS OMITTED. Passion-filled silhouettes imply their rising desire. CUT TO: The camera pans to the security footage on their laptop, unnoticed in their rapture. The rat, lifeless in its cage, suddenly convulses. Its deceased form twitches, resurrecting into a ghastly vermin gnawing at reality and reason. The rat’s maligned resurrection unfolds clinically, stark against their natural humanity. It begins to batter against the confines of its glass prison with awakened ferocity, signaling the start of a relentless plague. BACK TO ED AND MARIA: Their union, though blurred in the shadows, remains the focal point. But the storm outside picks up its pace, lightning illuminating the backdrop of their passion and the impending dread that brews unseen. CUT TO: Exterior Shot: The rat’s figure, now sinister and frenzied, escapes into the swirling maelstrom, finding its way to the heart of an unsuspecting city.

ED AND MARIA’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT The tempest outside crescendos, an ominous symphony to match the unfamiliar silence within. Ed and Maria lie entwined, a peaceful reprieve from the chaos of their lives. Yet as they sleep, fate sits patiently on their doorstep. The incessant RINGING of Ed’s phone slices through the silence—insistent, jarring. He stirs, but Maria nudges him towards the persistent invasion of their tranquility. MARIA (muffled against Ed’s neck) Honey… the phone… ED (grumbling) Let it ring… nothing is more important than this moment. But the phone is relentless. After several ignored calls, Ed finally relents. ED (sighing) Alright… alright… He reaches out, voice heavy with the remnants of sleep and satisfaction. ED (into the phone) Hello? The grave voice of a COLLEAGUE reverberates through the line, shattering the mussed warmth of their sanctuary. CUT TO: Split Screen: Ed’s expressions of ecstasy now contort to one of shock and disbelief. COLLEAGUE (V.O.) (urgent, panicked) Ed—it’s gone wrong. The test subject—it… The blood drains from Ed’s face as the screams from the other side sync with lightning strikes outside. Redeployment from a night of union to one of splitting despair. The camera focuses tight on Ed’s widening eyes, as understanding and dread meld into a chilling realization. CUT TO: Maria looks on, her countenance shifting from tranquil contentment to alarmed confusion. MARIA (in a strained whisper) Ed, what’s happened? The storm outside wails as if to answer.

Suddenly, an eerie scuffle breaks the stillness. On a deserted alleyway, a HOMELESS MAN huddles for warmth, unaware of the danger lurking. His eyes snap open, on edge, and fear takes hold as he spots several figures moving with an unsettling, lurching gait towards him. The ragged silhouettes grow clearer - zombies in various stages of decay. Wasting no time, the man scrambles to his feet, but his movements are sluggish, still dulled by sleep. He turns to flee, but the undead descend upon him with relentless hunger. His panicked screams shatter the silence of the night, a symphony of terror that marks the dawn of a new horror.

Immediate response needed… He realizes the helplessness of his position, the futility of calling for aid already too late for the unfortunate victim. His hand shakes as he switches off the monitor, the image of the undead’s assault burned into his memory.

MEDICAL STAFF dash from bed to bed, desolation etched into their faces as they face the inevitable. DR. MARTINEZ, her eyes showing the night’s toll, marshals her team like a battlefield commander. DR. MARTINEZ (shouting over the cacophony) Move the critical cases to isolation! Now! Orderlies hurry by, pushing a gurney with a PATIENT whose twitching betrays the infection’s advance. CUT TO: EXT. SCIENCE CITY PARK - DAYBREAK The park, once a refuge of mirth, now stands ominously silent. A CHILD’S BIKE lies discarded on its side, the nearby swings creaking in the wind as if mourning the loss of laughter. A distant, guttural SCREAM pierces the morning air. Behind a line of trees, a FIGURE stumbles through the underbrush — not a jogger, but something distorted and terrifying. CUT TO: INT.

The cure… MARIA (hands clenching) We’ll get it, Ed. We have to. Their resolve is a beacon of hope amid the disarray. CUT TO: EXT. CITY HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS The HOSPITAL, its beacon-like quality diminished under the encroaching doom, becomes a FORTRESS against the affliction. Medics and security hustle to lock down the perimeter as more AMBULANCES roll in, a never-ending procession of despair. The CAMERA rises, offering a bird’s eye view of the city, a METROPOLIS succumbing to an unseen assailant. Yet through the struggle and fear, the raw determination of its people stands defiant.

CUT TO: CLOSE-UP on ED’s face, shadows playing at the edges of his grim determination. Behind him, the ominous lights of the emergency system flicker, underscoring the catastrophe. MARIA stands beside him, her hand finding his. Together they face the beginning of an apocalypse, their world irrevocably changed. MARIA (sound of steel in her voice) Let’s find that antidote, Ed. We owe it to everyone out there—and to ourselves. ED nods, the silence between them speaking volumes. They have become soldiers on the front line of a battle they never wanted. FADE TO: EXT. CITY - CONTINUOUS The morning sun does little to dispel the gloom that envelops the city.

The creature’s rebirth is captured in grainy detail—a grotesque interruption in the sanitarium of science. DR. STEVENS (voice cracking) Look at it… nobody could have predicted this. It’s like a nightmare. ED (tight-jawed) We created a monster… Maria’s hand covers her mouth as she stifles a sob. The knowledge that their breakthrough is responsible for the terror gripping the city is an unbearable burden. MARIA (overwhelmed) Our children… are they… DR. STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive. Ed slams a fist on the console in frustration, his rage a silent scream challenging the chaos. Maria turns to him, eyes pooling with tears—desperation etched on her face. MARIA (pleading) We have to do something, Ed! ED (resolute) And we will. We fix this. We find the cure and distribute it. No rest until this damn virus is eradicated from every last soul it’s touched. They stand united, a feeble bulwark against an abyss that threatens to consume the world they know. CUT TO: EXT. CITY - WIDE SHOT - DAY The camera pans over the once-bustling metropolis, now a ghost town.

Despite his scientific mind rebelling against the logic of their existence, his survival instincts kick in. They back away slowly, but the zombies advance with increasing hunger. The corridor’s confines amplify their mangled cries. Ed and Maria turn to run, but the creatures are relentless in pursuit. One of the zombies lunges forward, catching ED by the arm. Its teeth sink into his flesh—a searing pain that echoes with the unbearable finality of his fate. MARIA (screaming) Ed! She pulls Ed away with a strength born of desperation, dragging him toward a nearby reinforced door. They stumble through just in time, slamming it shut on their assailants. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The couple slumps against the door, breathing heavily. Ed grunts as he clutches the wound, blood oozing between his fingers—a cruel testament to their perilous situation. MARIA (tearfully) It’s not deep, we can treat it. ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The room buzzes with the subdued whirr of high-tech machinery. MARIA scrambles, her hands fumbling through vials and medical supplies, searching for anything that might save ED. He lies on a cot, his complexion growing paler, his breaths shallow. MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed. As Maria sobs, slumped against the door, the sounds of the scuffle inside fade. A profound silence settles, and a new resolve takes hold. MARIA (vow in her voice) I’ll make it right, Ed. I’ll save them all. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - ROOFTOP HELIPAD - CONTINUOUS A helicopter approaches, the wind from its blades scattering papers and debris across the rooftop.

CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS With the mind of a scientist but the body of a monster, ED trudges through the chaotic streets, an insatiable need to protect and a relentless drive to find their children fuelling his every step. MARIA, atop the helipad, is torn between following ED and escaping with the cure. Tears stream down her face as she calls out to him, though he can no longer hear her. MARIA (screaming into the void) I love you… I’ll find them, I promise! With the cries of her husband echoing in her ears, Maria vows to carry on their fight and save the city they love. She watches Ed disappear into the horde of zombies, a lone figure of tragedy amidst the devastation. The helicopter, hovering anxiously, becomes her only refuge. She climbs aboard, clutching the potential cure to her chest as they ascend into the maelstrom. CUT TO BLACK. INT.

MARIA (declaration of war on the apocalypse) This is only the beginning. Run zombie, run. END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 PAGE 31 OF 150 EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery. He scans the empty, desolate rooms, searching for any sign of his children—backpacks, a stray drawing, a forgotten toy—anything that would offer a shred of hope. But the silence is the only answer. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS Ed arrives at the gym, a cavernous hollow now home to dust and despair. Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission. Desolation repels hope like opposite poles of a tragic magnet. Torn by failure, Ed turns away from the forlorn landmark of his children’s laughter, now a crypt to his unspoken fear. His eyes, rimmed with the red of grief and infection, look beyond—towards the distant, fortified silhouette of his bunker. MONTAGE – ED’S JOURNEY TO THE BUNKER: - Ed’s shadow stretches along the cracked pavement as he trudges through the eerie streets, a spectral figure moving against the grain of desolation. - At intersections, he ducks into the shadows, avoiding the roving packs of zombies that cluster around the remnants of life—imperfect kin he no longer resembles. - The bunker’s hidden entrance, a sliver between the ruins, beckons—a sanctuary amid a city usurped by death. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge. He peels away the scarf, revealing the visage of a man ensnared between two realities. Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds. With grim acceptance, he begins to arm himself for the world above, the haven below now a grave to his former self. END OF PAGE 31 OF 150 PAGE 32 OF 15 INT. ED’S BUNKER - WASHROOM - CONTINUOUS Ed stands, a tragic figure, before the worn mirror; his flesh sags and his eyes are pools of dread. Clusters of hair slip through his trembling fingers, each strand a part of his old self, relinquishing to the monster he is becoming. A gasp of despair chokes out as he beholds the naked scalp in the mirror, a stark declaration of his metamorphosis. Tears well up, spilling over, tracing grimy paths down his deformed cheeks. The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above. Ed’s cries meld with the deep, seismic vibrations from outside, both the internal and external worlds crumbling in unison. In this fortress of solitude, his tether to sanity and solidarity grows dangerously thin. CUT TO: EXT.

ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS The bunker trembles under the assault, the force of the distant blast threatening to breach this last haven. ED braces against the sink, his heart—if it can still be called that—pounding in his chest. ED (murmurs in horror) No… not like this. His eyes snap to the array of monitors, each flashing a dire warning. A shrouded panic grips him—the outside world is under siege, and time is the enemy once more. CUT TO: INT. CITY COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS OPERATORS switch between feeds, each scene more chaotic than the last—a city under the shadow of catastrophic failure. The COMMANDER grabs the microphone, urgency tensing his voice. COMMANDER (into microphone) All units, brace for potential aftershocks. We have confirmation of detonation. This is not a drill. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED reels from the shockwave, his once stoic facade crumbling. The instruments and gauges surrounding him now mere spectators to his unraveling. ED (hoarse shout) What have we done?! He wrenches away from the mirror, stumbling as the ground continues to betray him. A shelf crashes down, its contents—a journal, a photo, remnants of the past—spill across the floor, a poignant reminder of life before the fall. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS The aftermath of the explosion erupts into a chaotic torrent of action—civilian and military alike now share only the common goal of survival. AND CUT BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED lunges for a two-way radio, the last line connecting him to the world he fought to save—a world that might no longer exist. His hand caresses the tuning knob, static filling the clean space of the bunker. His voice, modulated by desperation and the unearthly timbre of his new form, crackles into the void. ED (into the radio, desperate) Is anyone out there…? Children… Please… As the static answers back, heavy and relentless, the camera captures a final shot of ED—an echo of humanity caught in the purgatory between life and death. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 32 OF 150 PAGE 33 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The siren’s wail pierces the bunker’s thick silence, a banshee scream announcing impending doom. ED snaps his head towards the crescendo of alarms, as the room is bathed in the urgent glow of red emergency lights.

CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS – CONTINUOUS Aerial shots reveal mass panic as the air raid sirens echo through the streets, desperate citizens scrambling to find shelter. The skyline blurs with the frantic movements below. CUT TO: INT. BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS ED stands frozen, the epitome of desperation, as the last fragments of his world descend into chaos. He watches, powerless, as the skeletal outlines of his former life flicker on the screens. NEWS ANCHOR (ON MONITOR) (tense, authoritative) This is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. A nuclear strike has been authorized and will commence within the hour. May God have mercy on us all. Ed’s eyes widen with horror at the anchor’s solemn decree. His fist clenches, shattering the radio’s silence. ED (into the radio, voice quivering) Not like this… Please, no… CUT TO: INT. SHELTER - DAY Families huddled together, their eyes glued to portable televisions broadcasting the final countdown. Tears mix with prayers, as they embrace for what could be the last time. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY WAR ROOM - DAY Amidst a flurry of activity, GENERALS and OFFICERS coordinate efforts to mitigate the disaster. On their screens, a digital representation of the missile’s trajectory beelines towards its destination. GENERAL (V.O.) (over intercom, grave) All units, confirm evacuation protocols. Ensure civilian compliance. We’ve done all we can. Prepare for impact. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS With the siren’s song as his grim chorus, Ed scrambles to secure his sanctuary, locking down hatches and reinforcing the entry. Every clank and hiss a harrowing step towards the inevitable. The camera follows his frantic actions, an intimate dance between man and machine, before pausing on his face—a visage caught between primal survival and heart-wrenching grief. ED (whispering to himself) Survive. Survive for what’s left… The bunker’s artificial lights flicker under the strain of the external world crumbling. Ed, a sentinel at the end of days, stares down the immensity of his solitude, the gravity of the moment heavy upon him. His raspy breath is the metronome to the ticking countdown, as the monitors’ once steadfast streams stutter—a digital heart rate faltering as the world prepares for its last beat. END OF PAGE 33 OF 150 PAGE 34 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The stubborn hum of outdated technology fills the air as ED hunches over the mainframe terminal of the bunker, his fingers a flurry over the backlit keys. The screen before him flashes with layers of security access prompts and firewalls, a digital labyrinth of his own design. Ed’s mind, a cocktail of desperation and scientific prowess, races to unlock the secrets he once safeguarded so fervently. With each override command, he peels back the digital veils shrouding his research, his city’s downfall, the truth. With a final keystroke, he breaches the mainframe security. The floodgates open, and data streams onto the monitor—classified communications, military intel, the command chain’s last orders, the enormity of the impending strike. ED (voice barely a whisper, laced with dread) Oh, what have we done… The screen maps out the grim reality—a schematized web showing the approaching missile’s trajectory, projected fallout patterns, and the bleakest scenarios outlined in stark numeric certainty. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY COMMAND BUNKER - DAY Generals hunch over radar screens, the forewarned cataclysm reflected in their stoic faces. Behind them, a wall-sized world map blinks with the Morse code of impending doom. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed’s horrified gaze traverses the information on-screen. His infected constitution wrestles with the gravity of what’s coming—ignited not by a zombie’s viral urges but by a man’s conscience and heart. ED (grappling with the scope of the cataclysm) There’s gotta be… there must be something else we can do… Anyone… He scans the screens for any sign of hope, a ceasefire, an alternative to the end. But the truth is unyielding, encoded in the logic of machines and strategic calculations. CUT TO: EXT. OBSERVATION POST - DAY A lone soldier stands sentinel, binoculars to his eyes, the distant whistle of the incoming missile harmonizing with the wail of the air raid sirens—a requiem for the world he knew. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed slams his palm against the terminal, the pain insignificant against his racing thoughts. Bitter laughter, a guttural sound devoid of humor, escapes him as he contemplates the irony—the mad scientist, the living dead, now the audience to Armageddon. ED (to himself, the laugh collapsing into a growl) We played with life and death… and now we pay the price. He rises, each movement a struggle as he opens a secure drawer, retrieving a dusty bottle of whiskey, a relic from a past life. He unscrews the cap and takes a swig, the burn a fleeting reminder of human sensations. Ed’s bloodshot eyes, tinged with yellow, fix on the countdown—a digital grim reaper ticking away the seconds of existence. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 34 OF 150 PAGE 35 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker, once a bastion of safety, becomes a tomb as the hollow echoes of explosions reverberate through its concrete walls. ED stands still, the ghastly light of the monitors painting his face as each distant blast grows closer, louder, a chorus of annihilation gaining fervor. He grips the edge of a console, knuckles white, each rumble a hammer strike against the shield of isolation he’s erected around himself. The shockwaves travel through the floor, a tremor through the heart of the earth. CUT TO: EXT. OUTER LAYERS OF THE CITY - CONTINUOUS Overhead shots reveal fiery blooms littering the landscape, each a bitter bloom of conflict. Plumes of smoke claw at the sky, trying to blanket the sun with their unforgiving shadows. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Panic fractures Ed’s stoicism as the bunker’s survival systems activate in response to the escalating threat. Crimson alarms flare, casting a sinister glow. The ventilation system churns violently, fighting against the onslaught of the inferno waiting outside. Each detonation outside is a gut punch to the facility, the sound magnified by the silence it disrupts. Flickering screens cast erratic shadows across the walls, creating an ominous dance of light that foreshadows the end. ED (voice choked with dread) This is how it ends… Not with a whimper, but with a bang. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY SHELTER - CONTINUOUS A FAMILY huddles together, their embrace a fortress within the shuddering bunker. Children clutch their parents, eyes wide and uncomprehending, as the reverberations of the unthinkable shake their sanctuary. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS Ed slumps into his seat, resigned, the bottle slipping from his grip and rolling across the floor. The world outside may be ending, but his torment continues unabated—a curse of the undead. A single tear—unclear if it’s from sorrow or the zombie affliction—trails down his face. He watches the countdown dwindle; humanity’s tenure ticking away before his crypt-colored eyes. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 35 OF 150 PAGE 36 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker convulses as if gripped by an unseen giant, the roar of the impact wave a deafening crescendo punctuating the still air. ED is launched from his chair, thrown to the unforgiving floor as the earth itself seems to spiral into chaos. Around him, the walls tremble, panels and ceiling tiles clattering down in a discordant symphony of destruction. The monitors blink erratically, skewing the horrific show they present—something between reality and electronic hallucination. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - SAME MOMENT From afar, a nightmarish scene unfolds as the impact wave rips through city blocks, turning structures into dust and dreams into nightmares. The force is indiscriminate—it tears through steel like paper, glass like vapor. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed clutches at debris, dragging his altered body across the trembling floor, desperately attempting to anchor himself in a world that refuses stillness. His roars match the sound of tearing metal and shattering concrete—primal, raw, filled with terror. CUT TO: SERIES OF SHOTS - BUNKER’S DISTRESS: A. The once orderly rows of canned goods and emergency provisions cascade onto the now-tilting floors. B. Water pipes burst, geysers erupting in formerly dry rooms, while electrical sparks create a dangerous light show. C. A portrait of Ed’s family, clinging to the wall, now slips free and crashes to the ground, the glass protecting their smiles shattering. BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed, crawling through the mayhem, reaches for the bunker’s emergency protocols—a last-ditch hope to seal away the cataclysm that hunts for him within his sanctuary. Lights flicker overhead, many winking out, as the integrity of their fixtures fail. He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 36 OF 150 PAGE 37 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Amidst the chaos and the runaway dance of shadows and light, ED struggles against the unforgiving floor that refuses to stay still beneath him. His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

Stay still and avoid making any sudden movements.\\" (The summoner approaches the growling dog cautiously, holding out her hand in a calm and inviting gesture.) Summoner: \\"Easy, boy. It's okay. Remember me?\\" (The dog sniffs the summoner's outstretched hand and slowly stops growling, recognizing her scent.) Summoner: \\"Good boy. Now come, let's introduce you to our new friend here.\\" (The dog, now calm, walks over to Natsuki with a friendly wag of its tail.) Natsuki: (Nervously) \\"Is it... safe now?\\" Summoner: \\"Yes, he won't harm you anymore. This is Kimi, our guardian and loyal companion. Looks like he mistook you for some kind of threat. But don't worry, he's a softy at heart.\\" (Natsuki cautiously extends her hand towards Kimi, who sniffs her hand before licking it affectionately.) Natsuki: (Smiling) \\"I guess he's warming up to me. Thank you for saving me.\\" Summoner: \\"No problem at all. Just be careful next time, stray a little too close to his territory, and he might mistake you for an intruder again.\\" Natsuki: \\"Noted. I'll make sure to keep my distance. But for now, I think I could use your help in finding my way around this island.\\" Summoner: \\"Of course! Welcome to Besaid. I'm Yuna, by the way.\\" Natsuki: \\"Nice to meet you, Yuna. I'm Natsuki. Let's explore this island together.\\" (With Kimi by their side, Natsuki and Yuna set off to discover the wonders and secrets of Besaid Island, forming an unlikely bond along the way.)"},{"prompt":"How can I get a list of subscriptions of office 365 in my domain?","completion":"To get a list of Office 365 (now commonly referred to as Microsoft 365) subscriptions in your domain, you need to have administrative access to the Microsoft 365 admin center. Here's how you can view the list of subscriptions: 1. **Sign in to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:** Go to [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com) and sign in using your admin account credentials. 2. **Open the Subscriptions page:** In the admin center, navigate to **Billing > [Your products](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/subscriptions)**. This page will show all the products and subscriptions associated with your domain. 3. **Review your Subscriptions:** Here you can see a list of all subscriptions, the number of licenses you have for each subscription, the cost, and the renewal dates. If you need to see a detailed list of all users and what subscriptions have been assigned to them, you might need to use PowerShell: 1. **Install Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell:** You need to have the MSOnline or AzureAD module installed. You can install it from the PowerShell Gallery using the following command: \`\`\`powershell Install-Module -Name MSOnline \`\`\` or for AzureAD \`\`\`powershell Install-Module -Name AzureAD \`\`\` 2. **Connect to Azure AD through PowerShell:** Once installed, open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following command to connect: \`\`\`powershell Connect-MsolService \`\`\` or for AzureAD \`\`\`powershell Connect-AzureAD \`\`\` You'll be prompted to enter your admin credentials. 3. **Get a list of all Subscriptions:** To retrieve the list of subscriptions, enter the following command: \`\`\`powershell Get-MsolSubscription \`\`\` or for AzureAD \`\`\`powershell Get-AzureADSubscribedSku \`\`\` This will provide a list of subscriptions with their respective SKU IDs and the number of licenses. 4. **Get a List of Users and their Licenses:** If you want to see which users have which licenses, you can use: \`\`\`powershell Get-MsolUser -All | Select-Object DisplayName,UserPrincipalName,Licenses \`\`\` or for AzureAD \`\`\`powershell Get-AzureADUser -All true | Select-Object DisplayName,UserPrincipalName,AssignedLicenses \`\`\` Please note that PowerShell scripts and commands should be used carefully. Make sure you understand what each command does before running it, especially in a production environment. Remember, the availability of specific Office 365 or Microsoft 365 services and the ability to view or manage subscriptions will depend on the permissions granted to your admin account. If you do not see the options mentioned above, you may not have the required permissions and should contact a Global Administrator for your tenant for assistance."},{"prompt":"How can I do this without admin?","completion":"If you do not have admin access to the Microsoft 365 admin center, you won't be able to directly obtain a list of the subscriptions and licenses for your domain. Administrative privileges are required to access the organization's billing information and manage subscriptions. However, there are a couple of avenues you could try: 1. **Contact Your Admin or IT Department:** Reach out to the administrators of your organization's Microsoft 365 environment or your IT department. They can provide you with the information on the current subscriptions and licenses in use. 2. **Check with Your Colleagues:** Sometimes, larger organizations have team leads or department heads that might have some information about the services the team is using, even if they don't have full administrative access. 3. **Review Any Documentation:** Your organization may keep internal records or documentation about licensed software and service subscriptions. Check with your manager or the person responsible for compliance and software asset management in your company. 4. **Access to other Admin Portals:** If you have access to any specialized admin centers (such as the Exchange Admin Center, Teams Admin Center, etc.), sometimes you can infer certain information about the services that are in use, but you won't get a comprehensive list of subscriptions or licenses. Without administrative privileges, you're limited to information that can be shared with you by authorized personnel, and there is no technical means to bypass those security controls in Microsoft 365 to access subscription information. This limitation is by design to protect the security and privacy of organizational information."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here's a bit of a breakdown: 1. \\"アルカトラズのラスト息子\\" (Last Son of Alcatraz): This translation is generally understandable. It translates back to \\"Last Son of Alcatraz.\\" However, \\"ラスト息子\\" isn't a standard phrase in Japanese, and \\"最後の息子\\" (saigo no musuko) might be a more natural expression for \\"last son.\\" 2. \\"Dデイ騎士\\" (D-Day Knight): This translation is a bit awkward. While \\"Dデイ\\" does mean \\"D-Day,\\" the term \\"騎士\\" (kishi) directly translates to \\"knight.\\" However, the two terms together might not make much sense to a Japanese speaker without proper context since D-Day refersto a specific historical event and might not immediately associate with the concept of a knight. If you're referencing a knight character related to D-Day, it might be understandable, but it's still unusual. You might want to provide additional context or a more detailed title to convey the intended meaning more clearly. 3. \\"ルナリアンズの女王\\" (Queen of the Lunarians): This is a pretty direct translation, and while \\"Lunarians\\" isn't a standard word in either English or Japanese, the translation makes sense if the context is known (for example, in a sci-fi setting where there are people known as Lunarians). In English, the term \\"Lunarians\\" might be used to describe a fictional race of people living on the Moon, and the Japanese reflects this as well. The translation back to English is \\"Queen of the Lunarians,\\" which appears to be your intended meaning. Translations can often vary depending on the context and the medium (literary, colloquial, formal, etc.), so additional context could potentially change the most appropriate translation."},{"prompt":"(On the island of Besaid…) Natsuki: “Oww…my head…where am I?” (The sound of a dog growling angrily can be heard behind Natsuki.)

Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\": Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажей Открытие фильма: • Фильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит. • Эд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами. Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Шторм наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома.

Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу.

Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает. 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало.

ED AND MARIA’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The seductive ambience in the living room enhances the comfort and connection between ED and MARIA. They are nestled on a luxurious sofa that is the epitome of modern elegance, yet the room resonates with an old-world charm. A low table is the centerpiece of their intimate setup, decorated with a vibrant bouquet and the soft flicker of candlelight. An open bottle of red wine sits idle, exuding its bouquet into the room, while two glasses sit, their contents slowly savored. Maria finds solace in Ed’s embrace, her body drawn to his as they reflect on the day’s triumph and ponder their shared aspirations. MARIA (beaming with love for Ed) Imagine… we might be on the cusp of history, deciphering the riddle of agelessness. ED (gazing deeply into her soul) And none of this would be possible without you—you are the genius and the lifeblood of our mission. Maria’s cheeks are kissed by a rosy flush as she takes in the accolade, momentarily averting her eyes before locking them with his once more. MARIA (lifting her glass with grace) Here’s to our breakthrough, our journey ahead… and to the bond we share. Their glasses meet in a symphony of crystal, a testimony to their dedication. They drink, a poetic chorus of nocturnal life providing a tender soundtrack. ED (with a voice full of sincerity) Each obstacle has only solidified us. Together, we are invincible against the unknown. The lens of the camera inches closer, capturing Ed and Maria as they set their glasses aside and face one another. Maria’s hands gently cradle Ed’s cheeks, her words floating like a whisper. MARIA I sense the dawn of an epoch. The first page of a lengthy narrative… Their lips converge in a kiss that relinquishes the need for words. As the melody swells, we are left to admire their silhouettes, dancing in the candlelight, an immortal image. END OF PAGE 16 OF 150 PAGE 17 OF 150: INT. ED AND MARIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT The storm outside casts a sharp silhouette on the steamy windows. Raindrops patter rhythmically against the glass, complementing the passionate symphony from WITHIN. Ed and Maria’s love overflows; a tangible energy undulates through the air as layers of clothing fall away like petals. Now bare to each other and the world, they find truth in the touch of skin on skin. They sink into the carnal embrace, bodies entwined in the timeless dance of desire. Moonlight streams through the window, casting ghostly rays over their melding forms.

ED AND MARIA’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT The tempest outside crescendos, an ominous symphony to match the unfamiliar silence within. Ed and Maria lie entwined, a peaceful reprieve from the chaos of their lives. Yet as they sleep, fate sits patiently on their doorstep. The incessant RINGING of Ed’s phone slices through the silence—insistent, jarring. He stirs, but Maria nudges him towards the persistent invasion of their tranquility. MARIA (muffled against Ed’s neck) Honey… the phone… ED (grumbling) Let it ring… nothing is more important than this moment. But the phone is relentless. After several ignored calls, Ed finally relents. ED (sighing) Alright… alright… He reaches out, voice heavy with the remnants of sleep and satisfaction. ED (into the phone) Hello? The grave voice of a COLLEAGUE reverberates through the line, shattering the mussed warmth of their sanctuary. CUT TO: Split Screen: Ed’s expressions of ecstasy now contort to one of shock and disbelief. COLLEAGUE (V.O.) (urgent, panicked) Ed—it’s gone wrong. The test subject—it… The blood drains from Ed’s face as the screams from the other side sync with lightning strikes outside. Redeployment from a night of union to one of splitting despair. The camera focuses tight on Ed’s widening eyes, as understanding and dread meld into a chilling realization. CUT TO: Maria looks on, her countenance shifting from tranquil contentment to alarmed confusion. MARIA (in a strained whisper) Ed, what’s happened? The storm outside wails as if to answer.

His eyes snap open, on edge, and fear takes hold as he spots several figures moving with an unsettling, lurching gait towards him. The ragged silhouettes grow clearer - zombies in various stages of decay. Wasting no time, the man scrambles to his feet, but his movements are sluggish, still dulled by sleep. He turns to flee, but the undead descend upon him with relentless hunger. His panicked screams shatter the silence of the night, a symphony of terror that marks the dawn of a new horror.

Immediate response needed… He realizes the helplessness of his position, the futility of calling for aid already too late for the unfortunate victim.

The creature’s rebirth is captured in grainy detail—a grotesque interruption in the sanitarium of science. DR. STEVENS (voice cracking) Look at it… nobody could have predicted this. It’s like a nightmare. ED (tight-jawed) We created a monster… Maria’s hand covers her mouth as she stifles a sob. The knowledge that their breakthrough is responsible for the terror gripping the city is an unbearable burden. MARIA (overwhelmed) Our children… are they… DR. STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive. Ed slams a fist on the console in frustration, his rage a silent scream challenging the chaos. Maria turns to him, eyes pooling with tears—desperation etched on her face. MARIA (pleading) We have to do something, Ed! ED (resolute) And we will. We fix this. We find the cure and distribute it.

Despite his scientific mind rebelling against the logic of their existence, his survival instincts kick in. They back away slowly, but the zombies advance with increasing hunger. The corridor’s confines amplify their mangled cries. Ed and Maria turn to run, but the creatures are relentless in pursuit. One of the zombies lunges forward, catching ED by the arm. Its teeth sink into his flesh—a searing pain that echoes with the unbearable finality of his fate. MARIA (screaming) Ed! She pulls Ed away with a strength born of desperation, dragging him toward a nearby reinforced door. They stumble through just in time, slamming it shut on their assailants. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The couple slumps against the door, breathing heavily. Ed grunts as he clutches the wound, blood oozing between his fingers—a cruel testament to their perilous situation. MARIA (tearfully) It’s not deep, we can treat it. ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT.

MARIA scrambles, her hands fumbling through vials and medical supplies, searching for anything that might save ED. He lies on a cot, his complexion growing paler, his breaths shallow. MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed. As Maria sobs, slumped against the door, the sounds of the scuffle inside fade. A profound silence settles, and a new resolve takes hold. MARIA (vow in her voice) I’ll make it right, Ed. I’ll save them all. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - ROOFTOP HELIPAD - CONTINUOUS A helicopter approaches, the wind from its blades scattering papers and debris across the rooftop.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The sterile corridor is now a cacophony of terror. MARIA bears witness to ED’S transformation—skin deathly pale, veins blackening. With the shadow of zombification drawing near, he makes a drastic choice. ED (determined, to Maria) Go! Save our children… save everyone. With a mix of horror and fierce resolve, ED flings himself through the window, landing on the concrete below with an unnatural ferocity only the infected possess. Maria watches as Ed, now imbued with the strength and resilience of the undead but mercifully retaining his mind, staggers to his feet and storms into the city. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS With the mind of a scientist but the body of a monster, ED trudges through the chaotic streets, an insatiable need to protect and a relentless drive to find their children fuelling his every step. MARIA, atop the helipad, is torn between following ED and escaping with the cure. Tears stream down her face as she calls out to him, though he can no longer hear her. MARIA (screaming into the void) I love you… I’ll find them, I promise! With the cries of her husband echoing in her ears, Maria vows to carry on their fight and save the city they love. She watches Ed disappear into the horde of zombies, a lone figure of tragedy amidst the devastation. The helicopter, hovering anxiously, becomes her only refuge. She climbs aboard, clutching the potential cure to her chest as they ascend into the maelstrom. CUT TO BLACK. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY Forcing herself to focus, Maria enters the lab again. The screen flickers to life, interfacing with her fierce intellect.

Her hands never waver, her eyes never stray. The readouts wink back at her with promising data, and the compound finally takes form—a vial shining with the hope of humanity. MARIA (declaration of war on the apocalypse) This is only the beginning. Run zombie, run. END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 PAGE 31 OF 150 EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery. He scans the empty, desolate rooms, searching for any sign of his children—backpacks, a stray drawing, a forgotten toy—anything that would offer a shred of hope. But the silence is the only answer. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS Ed arrives at the gym, a cavernous hollow now home to dust and despair. Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission. Desolation repels hope like opposite poles of a tragic magnet. Torn by failure, Ed turns away from the forlorn landmark of his children’s laughter, now a crypt to his unspoken fear. His eyes, rimmed with the red of grief and infection, look beyond—towards the distant, fortified silhouette of his bunker. MONTAGE – ED’S JOURNEY TO THE BUNKER: - Ed’s shadow stretches along the cracked pavement as he trudges through the eerie streets, a spectral figure moving against the grain of desolation. - At intersections, he ducks into the shadows, avoiding the roving packs of zombies that cluster around the remnants of life—imperfect kin he no longer resembles. - The bunker’s hidden entrance, a sliver between the ruins, beckons—a sanctuary amid a city usurped by death. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge. He peels away the scarf, revealing the visage of a man ensnared between two realities. Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds. With grim acceptance, he begins to arm himself for the world above, the haven below now a grave to his former self. END OF PAGE 31 OF 150 PAGE 32 OF 15 INT. ED’S BUNKER - WASHROOM - CONTINUOUS Ed stands, a tragic figure, before the worn mirror; his flesh sags and his eyes are pools of dread. Clusters of hair slip through his trembling fingers, each strand a part of his old self, relinquishing to the monster he is becoming. A gasp of despair chokes out as he beholds the naked scalp in the mirror, a stark declaration of his metamorphosis. Tears well up, spilling over, tracing grimy paths down his deformed cheeks. The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above. Ed’s cries meld with the deep, seismic vibrations from outside, both the internal and external worlds crumbling in unison. In this fortress of solitude, his tether to sanity and solidarity grows dangerously thin. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREET – CONTINUOUS Buildings sway ominously, windows shattering, as a far-off explosion bellows its arrival. Birds erupt from trees as the earth itself cries out in protest. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS The bunker trembles under the assault, the force of the distant blast threatening to breach this last haven. ED braces against the sink, his heart—if it can still be called that—pounding in his chest. ED (murmurs in horror) No… not like this. His eyes snap to the array of monitors, each flashing a dire warning. A shrouded panic grips him—the outside world is under siege, and time is the enemy once more. CUT TO: INT. CITY COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS OPERATORS switch between feeds, each scene more chaotic than the last—a city under the shadow of catastrophic failure. The COMMANDER grabs the microphone, urgency tensing his voice. COMMANDER (into microphone) All units, brace for potential aftershocks. We have confirmation of detonation. This is not a drill. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED reels from the shockwave, his once stoic facade crumbling. The instruments and gauges surrounding him now mere spectators to his unraveling. ED (hoarse shout) What have we done?! He wrenches away from the mirror, stumbling as the ground continues to betray him. A shelf crashes down, its contents—a journal, a photo, remnants of the past—spill across the floor, a poignant reminder of life before the fall. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS The aftermath of the explosion erupts into a chaotic torrent of action—civilian and military alike now share only the common goal of survival. AND CUT BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED lunges for a two-way radio, the last line connecting him to the world he fought to save—a world that might no longer exist. His hand caresses the tuning knob, static filling the clean space of the bunker. His voice, modulated by desperation and the unearthly timbre of his new form, crackles into the void. ED (into the radio, desperate) Is anyone out there…? Children… Please… As the static answers back, heavy and relentless, the camera captures a final shot of ED—an echo of humanity caught in the purgatory between life and death. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 32 OF 150 PAGE 33 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The siren’s wail pierces the bunker’s thick silence, a banshee scream announcing impending doom. ED snaps his head towards the crescendo of alarms, as the room is bathed in the urgent glow of red emergency lights. On the monitors, live news feeds display a digital clock ticking down ominously, headlines scrolling with relentless speed—the words “IMMINENT NUCLEAR STRIKE” flashing, a stark harbinger of the end. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS – CONTINUOUS Aerial shots reveal mass panic as the air raid sirens echo through the streets, desperate citizens scrambling to find shelter. The skyline blurs with the frantic movements below. CUT TO: INT. BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS ED stands frozen, the epitome of desperation, as the last fragments of his world descend into chaos. He watches, powerless, as the skeletal outlines of his former life flicker on the screens. NEWS ANCHOR (ON MONITOR) (tense, authoritative) This is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. A nuclear strike has been authorized and will commence within the hour. May God have mercy on us all. Ed’s eyes widen with horror at the anchor’s solemn decree. His fist clenches, shattering the radio’s silence. ED (into the radio, voice quivering) Not like this… Please, no… CUT TO: INT. SHELTER - DAY Families huddled together, their eyes glued to portable televisions broadcasting the final countdown. Tears mix with prayers, as they embrace for what could be the last time. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY WAR ROOM - DAY Amidst a flurry of activity, GENERALS and OFFICERS coordinate efforts to mitigate the disaster. On their screens, a digital representation of the missile’s trajectory beelines towards its destination. GENERAL (V.O.) (over intercom, grave) All units, confirm evacuation protocols. Ensure civilian compliance. We’ve done all we can. Prepare for impact. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS With the siren’s song as his grim chorus, Ed scrambles to secure his sanctuary, locking down hatches and reinforcing the entry. Every clank and hiss a harrowing step towards the inevitable. The camera follows his frantic actions, an intimate dance between man and machine, before pausing on his face—a visage caught between primal survival and heart-wrenching grief. ED (whispering to himself) Survive. Survive for what’s left… The bunker’s artificial lights flicker under the strain of the external world crumbling. Ed, a sentinel at the end of days, stares down the immensity of his solitude, the gravity of the moment heavy upon him. His raspy breath is the metronome to the ticking countdown, as the monitors’ once steadfast streams stutter—a digital heart rate faltering as the world prepares for its last beat. END OF PAGE 33 OF 150 PAGE 34 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The stubborn hum of outdated technology fills the air as ED hunches over the mainframe terminal of the bunker, his fingers a flurry over the backlit keys. The screen before him flashes with layers of security access prompts and firewalls, a digital labyrinth of his own design. Ed’s mind, a cocktail of desperation and scientific prowess, races to unlock the secrets he once safeguarded so fervently. With each override command, he peels back the digital veils shrouding his research, his city’s downfall, the truth. With a final keystroke, he breaches the mainframe security. The floodgates open, and data streams onto the monitor—classified communications, military intel, the command chain’s last orders, the enormity of the impending strike. ED (voice barely a whisper, laced with dread) Oh, what have we done… The screen maps out the grim reality—a schematized web showing the approaching missile’s trajectory, projected fallout patterns, and the bleakest scenarios outlined in stark numeric certainty. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY COMMAND BUNKER - DAY Generals hunch over radar screens, the forewarned cataclysm reflected in their stoic faces. Behind them, a wall-sized world map blinks with the Morse code of impending doom. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed’s horrified gaze traverses the information on-screen. His infected constitution wrestles with the gravity of what’s coming—ignited not by a zombie’s viral urges but by a man’s conscience and heart. ED (grappling with the scope of the cataclysm) There’s gotta be… there must be something else we can do… Anyone… He scans the screens for any sign of hope, a ceasefire, an alternative to the end. But the truth is unyielding, encoded in the logic of machines and strategic calculations. CUT TO: EXT. OBSERVATION POST - DAY A lone soldier stands sentinel, binoculars to his eyes, the distant whistle of the incoming missile harmonizing with the wail of the air raid sirens—a requiem for the world he knew. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed slams his palm against the terminal, the pain insignificant against his racing thoughts. Bitter laughter, a guttural sound devoid of humor, escapes him as he contemplates the irony—the mad scientist, the living dead, now the audience to Armageddon. ED (to himself, the laugh collapsing into a growl) We played with life and death… and now we pay the price. He rises, each movement a struggle as he opens a secure drawer, retrieving a dusty bottle of whiskey, a relic from a past life. He unscrews the cap and takes a swig, the burn a fleeting reminder of human sensations. Ed’s bloodshot eyes, tinged with yellow, fix on the countdown—a digital grim reaper ticking away the seconds of existence. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 34 OF 150 PAGE 35 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker, once a bastion of safety, becomes a tomb as the hollow echoes of explosions reverberate through its concrete walls. ED stands still, the ghastly light of the monitors painting his face as each distant blast grows closer, louder, a chorus of annihilation gaining fervor. He grips the edge of a console, knuckles white, each rumble a hammer strike against the shield of isolation he’s erected around himself. The shockwaves travel through the floor, a tremor through the heart of the earth. CUT TO: EXT. OUTER LAYERS OF THE CITY - CONTINUOUS Overhead shots reveal fiery blooms littering the landscape, each a bitter bloom of conflict. Plumes of smoke claw at the sky, trying to blanket the sun with their unforgiving shadows. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Panic fractures Ed’s stoicism as the bunker’s survival systems activate in response to the escalating threat. Crimson alarms flare, casting a sinister glow. The ventilation system churns violently, fighting against the onslaught of the inferno waiting outside. Each detonation outside is a gut punch to the facility, the sound magnified by the silence it disrupts. Flickering screens cast erratic shadows across the walls, creating an ominous dance of light that foreshadows the end. ED (voice choked with dread) This is how it ends… Not with a whimper, but with a bang. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY SHELTER - CONTINUOUS A FAMILY huddles together, their embrace a fortress within the shuddering bunker. Children clutch their parents, eyes wide and uncomprehending, as the reverberations of the unthinkable shake their sanctuary. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS Ed slumps into his seat, resigned, the bottle slipping from his grip and rolling across the floor. The world outside may be ending, but his torment continues unabated—a curse of the undead. A single tear—unclear if it’s from sorrow or the zombie affliction—trails down his face. He watches the countdown dwindle; humanity’s tenure ticking away before his crypt-colored eyes. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 35 OF 150 PAGE 36 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker convulses as if gripped by an unseen giant, the roar of the impact wave a deafening crescendo punctuating the still air. ED is launched from his chair, thrown to the unforgiving floor as the earth itself seems to spiral into chaos. Around him, the walls tremble, panels and ceiling tiles clattering down in a discordant symphony of destruction. The monitors blink erratically, skewing the horrific show they present—something between reality and electronic hallucination. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - SAME MOMENT From afar, a nightmarish scene unfolds as the impact wave rips through city blocks, turning structures into dust and dreams into nightmares. The force is indiscriminate—it tears through steel like paper, glass like vapor. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed clutches at debris, dragging his altered body across the trembling floor, desperately attempting to anchor himself in a world that refuses stillness. His roars match the sound of tearing metal and shattering concrete—primal, raw, filled with terror. CUT TO: SERIES OF SHOTS - BUNKER’S DISTRESS: A. The once orderly rows of canned goods and emergency provisions cascade onto the now-tilting floors. B. Water pipes burst, geysers erupting in formerly dry rooms, while electrical sparks create a dangerous light show. C. A portrait of Ed’s family, clinging to the wall, now slips free and crashes to the ground, the glass protecting their smiles shattering. BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed, crawling through the mayhem, reaches for the bunker’s emergency protocols—a last-ditch hope to seal away the cataclysm that hunts for him within his sanctuary. Lights flicker overhead, many winking out, as the integrity of their fixtures fail. He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 36 OF 150 PAGE 37 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Amidst the chaos and the runaway dance of shadows and light, ED struggles against the unforgiving floor that refuses to stay still beneath him. His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

MARIA stands beside him, her hand finding his. Together they face the beginning of an apocalypse, their world irrevocably changed. MARIA (sound of steel in her voice) Let’s find that antidote, Ed. We owe it to everyone out there—and to ourselves. ED nods, the silence between them speaking volumes. They have become soldiers on the front line of a battle they never wanted. FADE TO: EXT. CITY - CONTINUOUS The morning sun does little to dispel the gloom that envelops the city. Citizens wade through the streets, carrying whatever possessions they can, their expressions hollow with shock and grief.

The creature’s rebirth is captured in grainy detail—a grotesque interruption in the sanitarium of science. DR. STEVENS (voice cracking) Look at it… nobody could have predicted this. It’s like a nightmare. ED (tight-jawed) We created a monster… Maria’s hand covers her mouth as she stifles a sob. The knowledge that their breakthrough is responsible for the terror gripping the city is an unbearable burden. MARIA (overwhelmed) Our children… are they… DR. STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive. Ed slams a fist on the console in frustration, his rage a silent scream challenging the chaos. Maria turns to him, eyes pooling with tears—desperation etched on her face. MARIA (pleading) We have to do something, Ed! ED (resolute) And we will. We fix this. We find the cure and distribute it. No rest until this damn virus is eradicated from every last soul it’s touched. They stand united, a feeble bulwark against an abyss that threatens to consume the world they know. CUT TO: EXT.

Around the corner lumbers a group of zombies, their movements jerky and erratic. The sight is jarring, the realization of their nightmare fully manifest. MARIA (in a hushed tone) Ed… Without hesitation, ED takes the lead, signaling MARIA to stay behind him. Despite his scientific mind rebelling against the logic of their existence, his survival instincts kick in. They back away slowly, but the zombies advance with increasing hunger. The corridor’s confines amplify their mangled cries. Ed and Maria turn to run, but the creatures are relentless in pursuit. One of the zombies lunges forward, catching ED by the arm. Its teeth sink into his flesh—a searing pain that echoes with the unbearable finality of his fate. MARIA (screaming) Ed! She pulls Ed away with a strength born of desperation, dragging him toward a nearby reinforced door. They stumble through just in time, slamming it shut on their assailants. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The couple slumps against the door, breathing heavily. Ed grunts as he clutches the wound, blood oozing between his fingers—a cruel testament to their perilous situation. MARIA (tearfully) It’s not deep, we can treat it. ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT.

MARIA scrambles, her hands fumbling through vials and medical supplies, searching for anything that might save ED. He lies on a cot, his complexion growing paler, his breaths shallow. MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed. As Maria sobs, slumped against the door, the sounds of the scuffle inside fade. A profound silence settles, and a new resolve takes hold. MARIA (vow in her voice) I’ll make it right, Ed. I’ll save them all. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - ROOFTOP HELIPAD - CONTINUOUS A helicopter approaches, the wind from its blades scattering papers and debris across the rooftop.

MARIA (declaration of war on the apocalypse) This is only the beginning. Run zombie, run. END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 PAGE 31 OF 150 EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery.

Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission. Desolation repels hope like opposite poles of a tragic magnet. Torn by failure, Ed turns away from the forlorn landmark of his children’s laughter, now a crypt to his unspoken fear. His eyes, rimmed with the red of grief and infection, look beyond—towards the distant, fortified silhouette of his bunker. MONTAGE – ED’S JOURNEY TO THE BUNKER: - Ed’s shadow stretches along the cracked pavement as he trudges through the eerie streets, a spectral figure moving against the grain of desolation. - At intersections, he ducks into the shadows, avoiding the roving packs of zombies that cluster around the remnants of life—imperfect kin he no longer resembles. - The bunker’s hidden entrance, a sliver between the ruins, beckons—a sanctuary amid a city usurped by death. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge. He peels away the scarf, revealing the visage of a man ensnared between two realities. Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds. With grim acceptance, he begins to arm himself for the world above, the haven below now a grave to his former self. END OF PAGE 31 OF 150 PAGE 32 OF 15 INT.

A gasp of despair chokes out as he beholds the naked scalp in the mirror, a stark declaration of his metamorphosis. Tears well up, spilling over, tracing grimy paths down his deformed cheeks. The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above.

Bitter laughter, a guttural sound devoid of humor, escapes him as he contemplates the irony—the mad scientist, the living dead, now the audience to Armageddon. ED (to himself, the laugh collapsing into a growl) We played with life and death… and now we pay the price. He rises, each movement a struggle as he opens a secure drawer, retrieving a dusty bottle of whiskey, a relic from a past life.

Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT.

Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult.

This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end.

He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

Moreover, the doctrine contains a number of internal contradictions. Of course, the most obvious internal contradiction is how there can be three persons of God in any meaningful sense and yet there be only one God. Below we have compiled a number of other contradictions and problems associated with trinitarianism. This list is not exhaustive but it does give an idea of how much the doctrine deviates from the Bible (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him).","completion":"Inconsistencies in Trinitarian Doctrine The core issue with the doctrine of the Trinity is its lack of alignment with biblical scripture, leading to conflicts with various biblical teachings and specific passages from the Holy text. Additionally, the doctrine of the Trinity is fraught with its own set of intrinsic inconsistencies. Perhaps the most apparent of these is the paradox of the Christian Godhead: how can God exist as three distinct entities and yet remain a singular deity? We have gathered a selection of other discrepancies and issues that arise from the doctrine of the Trinity. While the following is not an exhaustive list, it does highlight the significant divergence of Trinitarianism from scriptural teachings as seen, for instance, in Luke 2:52, which implies that God forgave Jesus’ sins and extended grace towards him."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const s=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return s?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(s)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(s)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},U={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},G={key:0,class:"empty-state"},F=["disabled"],H={key:0},L={key:1};function Y(s,e,h,g,n,o){const f=p("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",U,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),w(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(b,null,T(o.displayedPoems,(r,m)=>(a(),E(f,{key:m,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),o.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",G,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
